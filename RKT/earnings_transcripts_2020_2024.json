At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, John Shallcross. Thank you. Please go ahead.\nJohn Shallcross: Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us for Rocket Companies earnings call covering the fourth quarter and full-year of 2020. We\u2019re excited to share these strong results with you, but before I turn things over to Jay Farner, I will read our disclaimers. Today's call is to provide you with information regarding our fourth quarter and full-year 2020 performance in addition to our financial outlook. This conference call includes forward-looking statement. For more information about factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to the earnings release that we issued today, as well as risks described in filings with the SEC, particularly in the section of these documents titled Risk Factors. Our commentary today will also include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP metrics for our reported results can also be found in our earnings release issued today, as well as in our filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll turn things over to Jay Farner to get us started. Jay?\nJay Farner: Good afternoon and welcome to the fourth quarter earnings call for Rocket Companies. Before we discuss another incredible quarter, I\u2019d like to thank our 24,000 team members, many of whom are listening now. The excellent results that we are about to discuss and the innovations that drove them are a testament to your focus and dedication in what was an incredibly difficult year for the world. Your contributions to our clients and communities were a shining example of how successful our, for more than profit mindset can truly be. On today\u2019s call, I\u2019ll be speaking to a very important topic here at Rocket Companies, our platform. The platform continues to be the key to our long-term success in the verticals where we operate, as well as the record results that we've achieved in 2020. Over the next few minutes, you'll see how the technology that we've built and refined over decades will continue to drive success not only in the products that you're familiar with today, but also in product extensions and entirely new verticals in the future. If you were to ask us what our most important product is, we'd say it's the platform itself. In walking through our results, I'll provide updates on each of the key pillars of the Rocket platform, our technology, the strength of our brand, the Rocket Cloud Force, which I'll discuss later, and our data science foundation. I'll finish today's remarks by talking about how our platform allows us to continue to grow and become more efficient in our existing lines of business, while also launching and rapidly scaling new businesses. Our mission over the last several decades has been to take the most complicated and stressful transactions in life and simplify them with technology. Whether those transactions are mortgage, real estate, auto sales, or any number of new initiatives we're currently incubating, we provide a simple digital process, exceptional client experience, and certainty. This mission began in 1998 when our Founder and Chairman, Dan Gilbert, wrote an email committing all of the company's resources to moving online. His vision was simple, but decades ahead of its time. Most of the internet companies of that era focused on problems like search, advertising, or basic e-commerce. Dan saw things differently. He spotted the potential to take the most complex transaction in a consumer\u2019s life, the buying and financing of a new home and leverage technology to make it accessible online to consumers across the country. For more than two decades, we've been quietly building our technology platform right here in Detroit. To transform the way our clients experience life's most important events, we've continued to strengthen our digital products and infrastructure in 2020, deploying nearly 4,500 product features throughout the year, and delivering improvements to our platform every 28 minutes on average. Supporting our platform is our strong national brand that consumers and partners know and trust. As we grow, we continue to invest and find new ways to extend our reach and expand our marketing channels we leverage, allowing us to connect with more and more clients. I'm pretty sure the majority of you were among the nearly 100 million fans who watched the Super Bowl a couple weeks ago. In that game, we ran two 60 second advertisements highlighting that certain is better when it comes to buying a home. We aired one commercial highlighting Rocket Mortgage, and our technology that helps bring certainty to the home buying process, something that is needed now more than ever in today's red hot real estate market. The second demonstrated the significant role mortgage brokers play in American home ownership. As you know, brokers are important partners as we continue to extend the reach of our platform. This massive exposure, the first ever national advertisement showcasing brokers during a Super Bowl allows them to align with the power of the Rocket brand to create differentiation in their local markets. Our ads were ranked numbers one and two on USA Today's ad meter, which I am certain is the most prestigious consumer ranking of top Super Bowl Ads. This means not only were our ads loved by millions of consumers, but also received tremendous lift and visibility through social media, news articles, and TV networks playing our ads for free. All told, our Super Bowl activation resulted in more than 3.3 billion consumer impressions. When you look at the areas where we continue to excel and set the standard, you see both a company and a brand that some of the most well respected organizations in the world want to associate with. We've talked about our relationship with American Express, with State Farm, Intuit, Charles Schwab, and others in the past. On our last call, I also hinted that we would soon be announcing a new partnership. Today, I am happy to share that Morgan Stanley and E*Trade have entered into a new agreement with Rocket Mortgage where our company will originate, close, and service conforming mortgages for their clients. This arrangement allows Morgan Stanley to continue focusing on its jumbo lending, while allowing Rocket Mortgage to provide conforming loan options to the firm's millions of clients. We are very excited about this opportunity, which will kick off this year. Another pillar of our business model is the incredible Rocket Cloud Force, now consisting of more than 6,600 U.S. based professionals, trained to advise our clients on complex transactions. The COVID pandemic truly proved that the power of our Rocket Cloud Force can be harnessed anywhere, as our team member\u2019s work from home in locations across the country. The versatility and skill of this team allows us to continue exploring new verticals and services. Our ability to build, train, and license large scale sales teams provides us a significant competitive mode. Today's consumer expects simple, powerful digital experiences backed by support and consultation from trusted advisors. The Rocket Cloud Force\u2019s ability to seamlessly integrate into the online experience with timely, accurate, and actionable information is a game changer. In-markets where the legacy experience can be confusing and discouraging like buying or selling a home, searching for a car or considering a personal loan, our digital solutions and trusted advisors provide confidence and certainty. Along with our powerful Rocket Cloud Force, our company also continues to rapidly grow its use of ethical artificial intelligence and machine learning to streamline the business. This acceleration is made possible thanks to our vast data lake, which includes proprietary first party data on more than 58 million consumers and extends to 220 million consumers in total or 85% of the adults in the United States. We have the benefit of millions of clients working with us each year to buy a car, get a personal loan, buy a home, or refinance a mortgage. And we've been able to leverage this information to build sophisticated models to ensure our brand is in front of our clients and top of mind when they're ready to transact. In fact, since the beginning of 2019, data science has driven more than $75 billion in application value. The importance of data cannot be overstated. It is this information that allows us to quickly innovate, anticipate the market, and in some cases develop new companies altogether. These real time insights are a significant market advantage and consistently guide us to the right decisions with incredible efficiency. Together these pillars of our business, our scalable platform, our national brand, our Rocket Cloud Force, and our strategic use of data combine to create a technology powerhouse that continues to accelerate at scale. Consider this; it took our company 25 years to close our first 1 million loans. In 2020 alone, we have helped more than 1.1 million clients with their mortgage, automotive, real estate, or personal loan needs, innovation and execution paired with a highly trained Rocket Cloud Force creates a flywheel that continues to rapidly accelerate. I'm even more excited about where we're going in the future. Just three years ago, we launched Rocket Auto with the belief that we could leverage our platform and Rocket Cloud Force to help simplify the process of purchasing a car. Everyone knows buying a car is complicated, and intimidating. It's an experience that few consumers look forward to, but we've been able to make it approachable and enjoyable. Starting from zero in 2017, we've organically scaled Rocket Auto to more than $750 million of gross merchandise value in 2020. Now that we've validated the model, we will continue to invest in accelerating the growth in 2021 and beyond. Our partner network is another increasingly important growth driver for Rocket Companies. We continue to evolve and diversify from our original direct-to-consumer business model. Partner volume made up 38% of our closed loan volume in 2020, up from 23%, just two years ago. We view this evolution similar to Amazon's past decision to open up its marketplace to third party sellers.  Like Amazon, we've built a proprietary platform and have the capacity to process millions of transactions a year. The Partner Network brings growth and diversification to our business. Supporting these efforts, in late January, we announced that we launched a directory of nearly every broker in the country on RocketMortgage.com. We then promoted that directory with the Super Bowl ad that I mentioned earlier. The impact has been tremendous. In less than a month, since launching, we've had tens of thousands of consumers visit the directory and click through to contact a broker. All of these elements together have created an incredibly profitable company that has shown an ability to grow, strengthen, and scale in any market environment. The fourth quarter of 2020 was no exception. All of our businesses performed above expectations, leading to a full-year adjusted revenue of $16.9 billion, and adjusted EBITDA of $11.1 billion. As a result of our exceptional financial performance, Rocket Companies has generated substantial capital and today we're excited to announce that we are sharing our success with our shareholders. As Julie will soon explain, our board has authorized a special dividend of $1.11 per share for holders of our stock as of March 9 to be paid on March 23. We're also accelerating our long-term approach of launching and scaling new businesses from the ground up. I'm pleased to announce the creation of Rocket Labs. Rocket Labs mission is to incubate new businesses within Rocket Companies that leverage our platform and provide our clients with services that complement our existing core products. Our approach is to empower small, independent teams to work on big ideas and concepts, which will form the core of our future products. We're excited about Rocket Labs and the possibilities that represents. Before I turn things over to Julie to share our financial results, I'm going to take a moment to give her a proper introduction. Julie and I have worked together inside this company for 17 years. During that time, she's led the finance and accounting teams and done a tremendous job managing all aspects of our liquidity. It's Julie's foresight that has helped us continue to grow in all market cycles. Not only that, but there's nobody who knows the financial side of this industry better. We're all lucky to be working alongside her. With that introduction, Julie, take it away.\nJulie Booth: Thanks, Jay and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to again report strong financial results for Rocket Companies. For the full-year 2020, Rocket Companies generated $16.9 billion of adjusted revenue and $11.1 billion of adjusted EBITDA as we wrapped up a record setting year. In discussing today's results, I'll walk through some of the key advantages of Rocket Companies business model. In particular, I'll highlight the power of our platform to unlock scale, drive efficiency, and serve as a launch pad for new businesses focused on simplifying complicated transactions. I will also provide some insights on our capital allocation priorities. Our 2020 results demonstrate true growth at scale. For the full-year 2020, we generated $320 billion of closed loan volume, representing an increase of 121% year-over-year. Our success in 2020 was broad based with consistent increases across both our direct-to-consumer and Partner Network channels. Our growth was also balanced between new and existing client relationships. 2020 was also a year of robust growth across Rocket Companies with particular strength at Amrock, our title company with revenues increasing 124% to $1.3 billion during the year. Rocket Auto, our automotive retail marketplace also generated robust results orchestrating more than $750 million in gross merchandise value of automotive e-commerce transactions. This equates to just over 32,000 auto units in 2020, up more than 60% as compared to 2019. We finished 2020 on a particularly strong note, with fourth quarter rate lock volume of $96 billion and closed loan volume of $107 billion, both significantly exceeding the high-end of our expectations. Multiple drivers contributed to the outperformance in Q4. In particular, we are seeing a consumer that is increasingly comfortable completing large complex transactions online. Continuing the trend we've seen throughout 2020, our automated self-serve digital experience was our fastest growing channel in Q4. We also saw strengthen Q4 from our branded partnerships and mortgage broker partners after launching the Rocket Pro TPO brands to the broker community and releasing multiple enhancements to our TPO software portal during the fourth quarter. Rocket Homes also finished the year on a strong note as they assisted clients with nearly $1.6 billion of real estate transactions during the fourth quarter alone. While current industry estimates on market size vary widely, it is clear that rocket gained meaningful market share in 2020. Our full-year closed volume growth of 121% substantially exceeded any estimate of the overall industry's growth from third party sources, which estimate 67% growth on average. Our platform business model is the key to enabling our growth at scale that is truly unmatched. To put this in perspective, Rocket Mortgage\u2019s incremental closed volume of $175 billion in 2020 was more than double the growth of any other market participant. In fact, our incremental gain in 2020 alone was nearly large enough to eclipse the entire all-in closed loan volume of the nation's second largest originator last year. Growing at this pace in a complex category, like home loans, requires a platform with broad reach, scalable infrastructure, and centralized software driven operations. The Rocket Platform is built to perform and grow in the largest, most complex markets. Our infrastructure also leads to a highly efficient economic model with substantial operating leverage. Our 2020 results demonstrate Rocket\u2019s ability to drive increased scale from a single platform with limited incremental cost. For the full-year 2020, Rocket\u2019s adjusted revenue increased by $11 billion year-over-year. We drove this revenue growth, while only adding $2 billion of expenses during the year or $3 billion of annualized operating expenses based on our fourth quarter. To demonstrate the efficiency of the business model, Rocket\u2019s transactions per production team member in 2020 were roughly triple the industry average. While our low cost platform model is driving record profitability, we're continuing our long-term strategy to reinvest in the business. Key targets for investment include our brand, product development, and initiatives to drive growth in the purchase market. We continue to invest in talent growth, particularly in technical roles. As an example, our data science team now includes over 300 professionals. We're seeing high performers choose to join Rocket across multiple teams, including the ongoing expansion of our technology and product strategy teams. Our brand is another key investment priority, including our recent Super Bowl ads, which generated significant brand recognition and drove record traffic to our online and mobile properties. Among our key product development priorities is Rocket Logic, the next generation of our core workflow management platform. The new platform guides users through the next best action, resulting in faster, more accurate workflows. We are very impressed with our initial pilot, where we are seeing 20% improvement in turn times within the pilot group. What's even more exciting is that Rocket Logic can be applied to enhance processes beyond mortgage origination. We expect Rocket Logic and our many automation initiatives to drive continued efficiency in the business model. The core of our economic flywheel is that we are constantly leveraging our profitability advantages to reinvest in the business, further strengthening our competitive position. Another key advantage of the Rocket Companies platform is our ability to test, launch, and rapidly scale new business models. This entrepreneurial approach can be seen in our scaled mortgage operations. In two years, our partner network has grown from less than $20 billion in close loan volume to $120 billion on an annual basis. We see similar opportunity within our early stage rapidly expanding businesses, such as Rocket Auto, Rocket Loans, and Rocket Homes. To that end, and as Jay announced a few minutes ago, the launch of Rocket Labs will further accelerate our focus on expanding the business in ways that leverage our platform and serve our client base. We believe our clients will be greatly served over time with these additional business lines. Turning to our first quarter outlook, we expect close loan volume of $98 billion to $103 billion, compared to $51.7 billion in the first quarter of 2020, net rate lock volume of $88 billion to $95 billion, up from $56 billion in the first quarter of 2020, and gain on sale margins of 3.6% to 3.9%, compared to 3.25% in the first quarter of 2020. We're excited about the continued strength and momentum of the Rocket Platform. We ended 2020 with an extremely strong balance sheet, including $2 billion of cash and $7.7 billion of total liquidity. Total liquidity includes cash on hand, undrawn lines of credit, undrawn MSR lines, and corporate cash used to sell fund loan originations, which could be transferred to funding facilities at our option. As we communicated at the time of our IPO last summer, our capital allocation priorities always start with properly capitalizing and reinvesting in the business. As I discussed earlier, we are actively deploying capital with investments in our platform, our brand, and our talent. We also want to deploy through add-on acquisitions that would be additive to our economic flywheel and bring value to our client base. Our next priority is to return capital to shareholders through dividends, opportunistic use of share buybacks, or a combination of the two. Given our record level of profitability in 2020, the board approved a special dividend of $1.11 per Class A Common Share funded by an equity distribution of $2.2 billion. Our substantial cash generation provides us significant optionality to drive long-term value for our shareholders. Additionally, we remain authorized to repurchase up to $1 billion of Rocket Companies common stock. With that, we are ready to turn it back to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Great, thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question here comes from the line of Timothy Chiodo from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nTimothy Chiodo: Great. Thank you so much for the question \u2013 for taking the question. So, you touched on it, I think very nicely during the prepared remarks around some of the other businesses, they may be sometimes get a little bit less attention, given they're a smaller percentage of revenue today, but represent a bigger opportunity, longer-term. I wanted to first touch on the auto business briefly, both in terms of the direct and some of the indirect benefits to the overall platform. And then if you don't mind a brief follow up on Rocket Homes.\nJay Farner: Thanks, Tim. Jay Farner here Absolutely. When we think about Dan Gilbert's vision for the company, over 20 years ago, I think I referenced the email that Dan had sent out about our ability to transform these major life events that people have leveraging the internet. Well, here we are 20 years later. And we're talking about mortgage, we're talking about real estate, we're talking about auto sales. As you know, that's over a $5.5 trillion market that we're playing in. And these investments that I discussed in the prepared remarks around our technology platform, the brand that we have built, the Rocket Cloud Force that allows us to step-in and take action at the right moment with consumers. And then this massive data lake that allows us to market to consumers. Well, now we're leveraging that across multiple channels, this platform that you're asking about. So, one thing I'll draw your attention to. We did 750 million in gross merchandise value at Rocket Auto in 2020. We're looking to see that double as we go into 2021. So that's really kind of our direct impact, but you also asked about the indirect. If you think about the importance here with the retention rate that's, I think nearly 90% industry tops then these points for us to help our clients with other transactions and have a car delivered directly to their doorstep that keeps our engagement strong. And so the next time they need to purchase or refinance or roll in debt, or have a life event, we're right there, and they think about us as more than a mortgage lender. On our real estate side, even with COVID and some of the delays that we saw in the spring time with home buying, we did $6 billion in transaction value from Rocket Homes. We invested heavily in our MLS platform, and launched that new technology here in January. We're rapidly adding states. I think we'll be up to 45 states by the end of March. And so that gives us great reach into the client base out there that's thinking about buying a home. And now we're interacting with them at the top of the funnel, and we can bring them through for mortgage title. And if you're not ready to buy a home right now, well, that's okay, maybe a [indiscernible] is the right thing for them. So, you're starting to see the power of this platform that we're building.\nTimothy Chiodo: All right, that's excellent. Thank you so much. You sort of touched on it there with the follow-up on homes, but maybe you can just dig into a little bit in terms of the listings, the quality of the listings, what might be unique about them, the extent of your coverage in terms of the MLS listings, any data points around that that could give us a better sense of just how broad that platform has become?\nJay Farner: Yeah. I think not only how broad it can be, but it moves us up to the top of the funnel as we see our clients starting to think about or purchase a home. The other important component, though, is, is that we've got more than just MLS. ForSaleByOwner.com, which allows us to help clients who aren't ready to transact with the real estate agent, we've got a realtor network. So those who are ready, we can refer off to the best agents in the country. And of course, then we can supply with our full blown approvals to ensure that anybody that's interacting with our real estate agents, is an active buyer. And as you know, in a real estate market, that's red hot, with such low inventory, the need for that client to walk through the door with a Rocket Mortgage, full approval is absolutely critical. So, it's really tying all of those threads together that gives our clients the best shot at getting the house from start to finish and all along the way we\u2019re able to collect data to determine someone\u2019s interest and make sure that we\u2019re putting our Rocket Cloud Force in the right point at the right time to help that client through the process.\nTimothy Chiodo: Excellent. Thank you so much for taking both of those.\nJay Farner: Of course.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nJames Faucette: Thank you very much. Jay. Julie, wondering if you can help shed some light on what we should expect in terms of new applications and growing \u2013 continuing to grow the business, particularly in the rising rate environment. You guys obviously have the benefit of a long history through lots of different interest rates cycle. So, how are you anticipating that borrowers and homebuyers will react to kind of the current move? And where should we be particularly sensitive to where rates could go, is kind of my first question?\nJay Farner: Well, as we've been on this journey for 35 years as a company, 25 years for me here and Julie 17, Bob 24, you know, rates will that tick up and rates will tick down. Our real focus is making sure we're providing an experience that draws clients and consumers into our funnel, and allows us to grow market share in particular, when things get a bit more challenging, and others tend to step away from investments in marketing and technology and other things.  We're seeing strong consumer demand, especially in the housing market, and it's a strongest that it's been here in the last decade, and current rates are still incredibly low. So that means it's very affordable to buy a home. And there are still millions of Americans out there that can save well over $100 a month on their monthly payment by refinancing their home. There are also many Americans out there that are looking to invest in their home, home improvements and those sorts of things. So, like I said, we're seeing strong consumer demand. I know Julie's given the guidance for the next quarter, which is kind of where we're willing to go at this point in time. I'll draw your attention to the fact that overall, we were able to grow volume twice as fast as the industry in 2020. And so when we think about our opportunity to invest in marketing, invest in technology, and continue to grow market share in 2021 we feel very strong about that. And we think that that investment won't \u2013 it will not only grow our market for mortgage and real estate, but it will start feeding these other businesses like I talked about auto for example on our platform.\nJames Faucette: That's really useful. And Julie, you didn't give very specific guidance for first quarter. So, appreciate that. How should we think about, particularly the evolution of gain on sale through the course of the year, at least directionally, and any color you can give us to help us think about like what the current environment is for selling of loans and how you're anticipating that roughly to evolve over the year?\nJulie Booth: Yeah, sure. First I\u2019ll say, we're still in a very strong demand environment with the Fed buying 95% or so of all conforming mortgage production today, the demand environment is very strong. One thing to remember about us as well as the market leader, we also benefit from the scale of our business when we execute into the secondary market. So, we have advantages because of that. So, we've seen gain on sale margins of 4.52% in Q3 of this year and then we saw continued strength as we came into Q4 coming in at 4.41%. And then, you know, as we look ahead into Q1, our expectations, as I said, for gain on sale margins are between 3.6% and 3.9%. And this is up from 3.25%, in Q1 of last year. So, margins are still well ahead of where they were a year ago. And then I\u2019ll also point at same time, we're still seeing strong close loan volume. Our close loan volume in Q4 of [$170 billion] and then looking ahead into Q1 between 98 billion and 103 billion, with those numbers, that would be the second biggest quarter in our company's history. So, to put this in perspective, just a little bit more than midpoint for our guidance is roughly 95% higher than our Q1 volumes. So, you know, the flexibility of our platform that we've talked about allows us to really run our business for long-term growth and for profitability in any environment and we're really feeling good about the momentum that we're seeing.\nJames Faucette: That's great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question here comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nRyan Nash: Hi, good evening, everyone.\nJay Farner: Good evening.\nRyan Nash: Maybe just talk about the mechanics of the special dividend? How is the 2.2 billion split? How is it funded across the different classes? I think you mentioned by an equity distribution, so I just wanted to clarify. And second, you know, last quarter, you know, with, you know, with the, you know, large profitability you did a billion dollar buyback, this quarter it\u2019s a 2.2 billion special and I appreciate Julie outlining, you know, the capital priorities, but maybe can you just help us understand, you know how your framework came to the conclusion, one quarter buyback another quarter special dividend and how we should think about, you know, use of capital in a time where you're experiencing, you know, really record profits? Thanks.\nJulie Booth: Yeah. Sure. I'll start with the dividend and mechanics, and then maybe I'll let Jay comment on your other questions. So, the way to think about the dividends is that the $2.2 billion is being distributed to all shareholders based on their economic interest. So, our public Class A shareholders have roughly a 6% economic interest, and then RHI has a 94% economic interest. So, they are each receiving a dividend in proportion to that economic interest.\nJay Farner: All right and then maybe going into the capital allocation, just to be clear, the board approved up to a billion dollar share repurchase, we have not repurchased shares up to this point in time. In looking at, and Julie walked through the waterfall nicely, I'll recap it again, we always first are focused on maintaining a very strong balance sheet, which we have today.  Second, is just investing in our business, like we've been doing now for 35 years, whether it's the brand activity, you saw the Super Bowl spots, the technology platforms here, that we have been rolling out, strengthening, adding features to. Rocket Labs, which I talked about, which is an important investment for us to make sure we're incubating all of these ideas that we can grow and then add to the platform. And we're very active and looking for acquisitions that would allow us to grow. After going through that waterfall, we determined at this moment in time, the best use of those funds was to issue a dividend. And we'll follow that process moving forward here, as we've got a great track record of being profitable and throwing off a lot of cash, what's the best use in the long-term for our shareholders. And so that's the process we use. That's a process we'll continue to use. And we'll be opportunistic. If we feel like the share prices is at a place where the right thing to do is buy back those shares. We'll do that as well.\nRyan Nash: Got it. And maybe I can ask a follow up to an earlier question. Jay, can you maybe just talk about some of the competitive dynamics you're seeing given, you know, the changing rate backdrop, and I was hoping you can maybe talk about it in the context of the direct-to-consumer and the partner segments. I think, you know, there was a competitor in the partner segment talking about exiting parts of the market. So, I was hoping you can maybe talk about how that's evolving. And if we do continue to see, you know, rates going up, like where do you inevitably see margins getting to over time? Thanks.\nJay Farner: Well, I'll start with the partner segment. I know we made an announcement today that Morgan Stanley and E*Trade will be joining the platform. They'll be joining Charles Schwab, State Farm, Intuit, [indiscernible] TurboTax, Realtor.com. So, you know, as the market becomes more challenging and others experience headwind, typically what we find is that, you know, large partners like this will look for the steady driving force in the market and that\u2019s us. And so that usually bodes well for our opportunity to grow market share and grow partnerships. When it comes to our third party or what we call TPO space, it\u2019s the same situation. Brokers out there who are in a more challenging market are going to look for somebody who will deliver the technology, a brand that they can lean into. And that's why we did the Super Bowl spot to give them that Rocket Brand that they could leverage to grow their business. And so, usually as we see these interest rates tick up a bit, what we're going to see is an opportunity for us to lean in to spend more money, and now to talk about the retail or direct-to-consumer space, same situation here. There are so many marketing opportunities out there for us. And as others tend to step away or back away from the space this is where we can lean in, we can grab market share. And not only are we thinking about the profitability that we achieve on the first transaction. We're thinking about the lifetime value of that client, and we're now thinking about the lifetime value not only over mortgage, but real estate, auto, and these additional businesses that we'll be adding. So, I guess you can tell we're pretty excited about it and don't see interest rates going up or down really having an impact on our business one way or the other.\nRyan Nash: Got it. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Your next question here comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nMihir Bhatia: Hi. This is Mihir on for Jason. Actually wanted to ask just a little bit, maybe just following up a little bit on that. You know, as we think about rates increasing, maybe you can talk about what is the right level of profitability longer-term for the market business and just for how you're thinking about, you know you have pretty optimistic, if you will market share aspirations over the long-term? So how are you thinking about taking advantage of that opportunity as rates rise and as balancing that market share gains with those margin? Thank you.\nJay Farner: Well, maybe I'll let Bob speak a moment about the margin because we've got a pretty long track record of protecting that over time, and then I can dive a little bit into the things that we'll do to continue to grow market share.\nBob Walters: Yeah, Jay, I think it's a good question. It's important one. In a lot of ways, when interest rates have risen in the past those have been and we've made some [indiscernible] powerful share gains. We have a lot of advantages that our competitors don't have and as Jay and Julie touched on, because of the brand, because of our brand, there's only one National Mortgage brand, it really allows for the consistency of those margins. So, not only are we able to protect those, but also gain share in these sorts of environments. There's a lot of different areas that we are gaining those shares. We have multiple channels, a lot of our competitors don't have those multiple. We talked about the Pro channel, and we \u2013 certainly the direct-to-consumer channel. And there's also a pretty persistent market of less interest rate sensitive products whether it be mortgage insurance, whether it be equity extraction, so cash out, you know that homes have risen in an incredible amount. The amount of equity in the market is really substantial. That is something that really will drive the market in the years to come. And then there's also a very, very robust purchase market and that we're very active in. So, you know, you asked for that ideal, that ideal channel, or ideal, it's really \u2013 it is these sorts of markets that we have grown in the past and taken advantage of a lot of the attributes that we have that are competitive.\nJay Farner: Yeah, maybe I'll jump in here. If you think about our operational efficiencies, and how much of every dollar we earn in revenue drops to the bottom line, and the scale that we have in our platform, and you can see the guidance that Julie provided in Q1. We've obviously seen market shifting and changing the last few months and our guidance is based on that. We have this very unique advantage to make the investment in marketing. And that can be marketing to drive more purchase leads to our 6,600 Cloud Force individuals that can be marketing with our partners like Realtor.com to drive purchase leads that can be marketing inside of E*Trade clients or Schwab clients. And so, as Bob touched on, those operational efficiencies give us the opportunity to increase our investment and grow that market share. And we're fortunate that so many different places to go spend those dollars. That's what you will see us do. And that's the plan that we will execute on to continue to grow through 2021.\nMihir Bhatia: Understood. And then just really quickly, Jay, you mentioned earlier, as you're thinking about capital, the priorities, you know the flowchart, if you will, on a waterfall of capital allocation, you mentioned acquisitions, and I was curious, what you thinking over there is like mortgage, non-mortgage both? Just if, you know, to the extent it is, just what do you think in terms of opportunities right now in that? Thank you.\nJay Farner: Yeah, I'll give some many themes that we're looking at. I want to be cautious about going too far down the funnel there. But we're thinking about the tech stack that exists in auto. One of the key differentiators for us on the Rocket Auto piece is connecting the highly fragmented buyers across America with the highly fragmented distributors across America. And so there's a unique tech stack opportunity there that could accelerate our growth. We look at other add-ons that could bring efficiency or accelerate growth in mortgage out of mortgage. We look at other tech add-ons that could allow our Rocket Homes platform to grow efficiently. So, you'll find us exploring things that we can add-on to our platform that will accelerate your organic growth that we're already seeing.\nMihir Bhatia: Thanks guys.\nOperator: Your next question here comes from the line of Dan Perlin from RBC. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nDan Perlin: Thanks, and good evening, everyone. Julie, I had a question about the investments, I might have missed it, but is there a way you can kind of dimensionalize the size of the investments to planning, maybe the cadence throughout the year that those were expected? And then really the second part of the question is, you know, your outlined three areas. And, Jay, you've talked about it as well, in your prepared remarks. I'm just wondering how do we think about, you know, how those investments break down as it pertains to really focus areas outside of mortgage, right, in order to continue to diversify the business over time?\nJulie Booth: You know \u2013 I'll start and I guess I'll say that continuing to invest is something that we will do, as Jay mentioned, in terms of, you know, looking at things from an ROI standpoint, and is that investment going to be one that is going to be a good use of our capital. So, we'll evaluate the opportunities based on that and think about the best use for our capital. So, that's one of the things that we certainly think about as we evaluate the amount of capital in the business. So\u2026\nJay Farner: Yeah. Maybe a clarifying question, when you mentioned investments, are we talking capital allocation or are you speaking specifically to the non-mortgage, the Rocket, the loan and the homes investments that \u2013 you know and platform added components to our platform today?\nDan Perlin: I was talking more broadly when you said brand and growth of the purchase market and product. So, I mean, it's a more of a holistic question. I'm not trying to pin down on one area in particular. And given the significant outperformance that you guys have had and just leveraging the platform that clearly shows through, I\u2019m just trying to figure out, you know what that number, size of that number, cadence of that number might look like throughout the year?\nJay Farner: Yeah, I would say that we feel very good about how we invested in 2020. And so, I think you'll see similar investments in 2021. You know, behind the scenes, a lot of the incredible work that was done to our tech platform supporting our brand that occurred in, you know very similar in 2020 to 2021. The one area you'll probably see us lean into even more is our performance marketing. And that's an area where we can invest, grow our brand, but also grow revenue and lifetime value. And it's very, very measurable. And so that'll be probably an area you'll see even increased investment in 2021.\nDan Perlin: Okay, thank you so much.\nJay Farner: Yeah.\nOperator: Your next question here comes from a line of Arren Cyganovich from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nArren Cyganovich: Thanks. I was wondering if you could touch about the purchase market, you highlighted that you had a record level of purchase volume and some of the steps that you're taking to ensure that you, you know, capture a sizable piece of that as [the refi], eventually burns off. One of the areas that I thought was interesting was the Rocket Pro insight. You had highlighted 25,000 real estate agents already signed up on that. How's that tracking versus your expectations? And what's the level of engagement you're seeing there?\nJay Farner: Yeah. You touched on important component and there are quite a few. I always [stop], Bob Walters always reminds me that regardless of interest rate market refinance makes up a very large portion of mortgages done in this country each and every year. So, as we touched on before there, of course our cash out, people are investing in their home at record levels. We're seeing that in some of the non-revolving debt that's increasing across the country. Of course, there's always life events that cause people to move. And we're also seeing second home investment be very strong. So, we'll keep seeing, I think refinancing, regardless of interest rate, but to the to the purchase question that you're asking, we touched on our realtor.com relationship and partnership. So, we're thinking about how we bring more clients directly to our 6,600 Rocket Cloud Force team members. That's the investment in Rocket Homes, which will allow for the same and ForSaleByOwner.com. Large partnership like E*Trade gives us access to great clients who are saving money and thinking about investing in homes, as does the Schwab network, which I think is having a had a record year in 2020. So, all of these things give us reach into people at the very front-end of when they're thinking about purchasing. But then there's another important component as well, which is our broker network, and the thousands of brokers that we're working with, that we're supporting, and we continue to support more and more not only with great technology, and a great salesforce, but also great marketing. And that's why we mentioned the Super Bowl spot, because we are now turning the millions of people that come to our Rocket Mortgage website onto the fact that they can work with a broker, as well as our Rocket Cloud Force. And so that will help drive more purchase volume into our funnel. And then let's go to Insight because Insight and the thousands of agents that are joining there, they want certainty, and they want visibility into what's happening with the real estate transaction. And we believe we're uniquely positioned to provide this because we've also got thousands of agents that are already signed up on our Rocket Homes Platform. So, we're working with them each and every day. We're getting feedback from them. We're taking that, we're sending it into product strategy. We're adding features to that technology to give them that visibility and that certainty. And I think that's why we're seeing such growth. So to answer your question about the pace, the pace is exactly where we thought it would be for Insight, and as we get into the purchase at home buying market, we think that will continue to grow.\nArren Cyganovich: Thank you.\nJay Farner: You bet.\nOperator: Your next question here comes from the line of Ryan McKeveny from Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nRyan McKeveny: Yes, thank you and congratulations on the great results this year. So, we're all obviously very focused on the rise in the 10-year, the relationship there between spreads getting on sale margins and apologize because I realized this is a bit repetitive with other analysts questions, but around the concept of just protecting gain on sale, I'm hoping you can talk to how the competitive environment has historically influenced things, because I guess an environment of higher rates, capacity in the industry that has expanded, still probably not scaled. But, you know, I think there is a level of concern that we're approaching a period of just more competition amongst lenders, and I understand what you're saying on the market share side, the opportunity to take incremental share and tougher periods, but how does this competitive side of things, you know, play into that gain on sale margin? And I guess why or why not should we, you know, trend backwards \u201cnormal levels of getting on sale\u201d or, you know, someday, obviously, they have to go below average? So, can you help me tease that out a little bit?\nJay Farner: Sure. And maybe I'll start and Bob, you can give your thoughts as well, as you've been watching that for the quarter of a century now. So, if you'll kind of maybe take a step back, as the market \u2013 as we see rates tick down, what you'll typically see is a lot of folks join the industry and you referenced increasing capacity. But when they join the industry, it's not with hundreds of millions or billions of dollars in investment in technology. It's not with billions of dollars of investment in brand and that's why they don't see $0.85 or $0.80 or wherever we were, Julie can clarify, dropped to the bottom line the way that we do. So, then as the market compresses and these things happen pretty quickly, folks who decided to get into the market by hiring folks and adding bodies and spending money, they find that it gets very hard to be in the mortgage business very quickly. And so, the same slack that \u2013 the same capacity that went in comes out. And so, sure there can be ups and downs in margin and interest rate for a short period of time as that kind of works it through, but as we get to the other side of that, what you find is, usually fewer competitors. And so for those remaining, not only does the margin stabilize and give you the opportunity to see that increase, but it also gives you what you pointed out great opportunity to grow market share. And then again, I'll mention this because it's so critical to our business model. For us, as we think about the acquiring of clients onto our platform, we're sitting in a situation where not only will we recognize the profitability of that first transaction with our operational efficiency, but if people are coming in at a higher interest rate, and we're servicing now, nearly 2.2 million clients, well, then the minute that rates tick down, while the opportunity to help them with a lower interest rate, thus recognizing the profit, again, at a higher margin, with no marketing cost. And then of course, help them with the purchase of a new home to Rocket Homes; help them with a purchase of a car through Rocket Auto. So, it really is a very exciting opportunity for us as we see rates tick up a bit, because it creates this process I've just discussed, which leads to market share growth, and leads a lot of sight to really strong future profitability as well for us. Bob, anything to add?\nBob Walters: Yeah, I think just a couple of things. So that, you know, we have the luxury of being a 35 year old company. If you look back decades, you will see a very consistent track record of gain on sale. And it's really one of the, I think one of the hallmarks of the company. And there's a number of reasons for that. Jay\u2019s also talked a lot about lifetime value. You mentioned the service clients, over $400 billion of service clients. So, you know, in the rising rate environment that becomes incredibly valuable and let alone all the other things that we talked about, the other businesses and markets that we are in. So quarter-to-quarter, we don't spend a lot of time thinking about, it's just gaining share and gaining lifetime value.\nRyan McKeveny: That's very helpful. Thank you. And second question. So, on the topic of, you know, just the strength of the platform, obviously, you know, very robust dynamics in the mortgage space, you know, strong traction with the ancillary channels, auto homes, I guess, this concept of just launching into entirely new verticals, I'm curious, you know, what are the characteristics there that you think, are kind of most critical for us to think about? And when you talk about new verticals, you know, are you still thinking within the realm of, you know, real estate lending auto or can there be, you know, bigger opportunities above and beyond that, you know, don't even necessarily relate to those aspects of the business?\nJay Farner: Yeah. We\u2019ll have Dan join the call next time to discuss this. I'll go back to the comments that he made or in the letter. Our real mission is to take complicated transactions that humans tend to shy away from because of the complexity and the fact that they're not that frequent, and make them simple for people. And so that's where you're going to see us focus in on because that's the power of our platform between the data that we have, the incredible client experience, we can deliver with our rocket cloud force, the marketing brand that brings confidence and the technology that streamlines these complex things. That's where we can win. That's where we differentiate. So, of course, real estate is kind of centered to that. We think auto is right there as well. But other things of that nature are of interest to us. In addition, we're always looking for the things that come natural with the purchase of a home or the ownership of a home or a car. And so, you know, think about when you buy a house now, what are the other things that you have to invest in, the other things that you have to keep track of. As we've got a relationship with the client, as we have the data around that, from the appraisal data, to the credit data, how can we assist that client in streamlining all these ginormous fragmented markets that surround the home or the auto. And so those are the places, when we talk about Rocket Labs in investing and setting up these two [indiscernible] teams to quickly develop technology and put it into the wild, we can leverage our servicing book and other client bases to test it out. That's where you're going to see that \u2013 those groups focus.\nRyan McKeveny: Very helpful. Thanks, Jay.\nJay Farner: Absolutely.\nOperator: Your next question here comes from the line of Rich Shane from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nRich Shane: Thanks, everybody, and good afternoon and appreciate you taking my question. A couple of things, can we talk a little bit about the dividend policy and how we should think about the special dividend? Should we think about that in the context of fourth quarter earnings? Should we think about that in the context of earnings since going public or should we think about it in context of all of 2020?\nJulie Booth: Yeah. I would say that at any point in time, we're more looking at the capital that we have in the business. And certainly this year was a year when we generated a lot of capital. It gave us the opportunity to not only continue to invest in the business, but also to think about whether there's additional capital that it might be the right time to return some of that to our shareholders. So, after evaluating that here, just recently, we decided that the right thing to do was to do this dividend. And we're really excited to be able to share in the successes that we have had here in 2020 with our shareholders.\nJay Farner: The only thing that I'll add is, and you've probably heard that through the entire call. So, our focus is long-term. And our focus is the \u2013 what we believe this company will be over the coming years and satisfying these challenging problems for consumers across multiple, you know, industries. And so, you know, growth is our focus and because of the platform that we've got, and Julie just touched on this \u2013 the scale and the efficiency, we can generate profits very quickly, large profits very quickly. And so, you know, we have to take into consideration all the opportunities that are in front of us to grow the business in the long-run. But we've also got to think about situations where we're \u2013 we made $11 billion last year. We're making a billion dollars a month. Even with all those opportunities out there, it still may be the best thing to do to issue a dividend to our shareholders. So, we're fortunate to have these choices, and we'll \u2013 but we're always thinking the long-term success and growth of this business first.\nRich Shane: Look, no question I, you know, you think about the investments you made in 2018 and 2019, and you didn't necessarily expect that they would manifest in terms of the, at the time, the level of profitability you enjoyed in 2020. So, makes sense to continue to do that. One other question, you know, when we think about your guidance, historically, it's been conservative in terms of volume and gain on sale margin. When we look at the guidance on gain on sale for the first quarter, how should we think about that in context of primary, secondary spreads had come in pretty significantly, but also, and this is the \u2013 I think, the more interesting nuanced point, how are you thinking about your pipeline hedge and potentially [indiscernible] a decrease in fallout with the slicing rates?\nJay Farner: Yeah. Great question. I can tell you that those type of things are what our capital markets folks are looking at every day and the data that we have, and I'm going to go back to the importance of the data from the top of the funnel, even pre-application to understand pull-through rates. And so those type of data points are priced in to the guidance that Julie has provided.\nRich Shane: Got it. So, you\u2019re changing that pipeline hedge constantly based upon a dynamic in pull-through rates or fallout rates?\nJay Farner: That's right.\nRich Shane: Okay, great. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. That is all the time that we have for questions. I will turn the call back over to you, Jay, for closing comments.\nJay Farner: Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, I just want to thank everybody, and particularly our team members who are listening, couldn't be more proud of the year that we had. Of course, the record revenue and profitability, but I think even more importantly, all the impact that we're able to have on the communities that we live and work and play in supporting the city of Detroit, the massive investments that we've made here in COVID, not only of our money, but of the time, energy, and effort that so many team members did to support the community, just so proud. And so thanks to all of you, and thanks to our investors, and we'll keep plugging away here to do great things at Rocket Companies.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. And you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Julie Booth",
            "content": "Thanks, Jay and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to again report strong financial results for Rocket Companies. For the full-year 2020, Rocket Companies generated $16.9 billion of adjusted revenue and $11.1 billion of adjusted EBITDA as we wrapped up a record setting year. In discussing today's results, I'll walk through some of the key advantages of Rocket Companies business model. In particular, I'll highlight the power of our platform to unlock scale, drive efficiency, and serve as a launch pad for new businesses focused on simplifying complicated transactions. I will also provide some insights on our capital allocation priorities. Our 2020 results demonstrate true growth at scale. For the full-year 2020, we generated $320 billion of closed loan volume, representing an increase of 121% year-over-year. Our success in 2020 was broad based with consistent increases across both our direct-to-consumer and Partner Network channels. Our growth was also balanced between new and existing client relationships. 2020 was also a year of robust growth across Rocket Companies with particular strength at Amrock, our title company with revenues increasing 124% to $1.3 billion during the year. Rocket Auto, our automotive retail marketplace also generated robust results orchestrating more than $750 million in gross merchandise value of automotive e-commerce transactions. This equates to just over 32,000 auto units in 2020, up more than 60% as compared to 2019. We finished 2020 on a particularly strong note, with fourth quarter rate lock volume of $96 billion and closed loan volume of $107 billion, both significantly exceeding the high-end of our expectations. Multiple drivers contributed to the outperformance in Q4. In particular, we are seeing a consumer that is increasingly comfortable completing large complex transactions online. Continuing the trend we've seen throughout 2020, our automated self-serve digital experience was our fastest growing channel in Q4. We also saw strengthen Q4 from our branded partnerships and mortgage broker partners after launching the Rocket Pro TPO brands to the broker community and releasing multiple enhancements to our TPO software portal during the fourth quarter. Rocket Homes also finished the year on a strong note as they assisted clients with nearly $1.6 billion of real estate transactions during the fourth quarter alone. While current industry estimates on market size vary widely, it is clear that rocket gained meaningful market share in 2020. Our full-year closed volume growth of 121% substantially exceeded any estimate of the overall industry's growth from third party sources, which estimate 67% growth on average. Our platform business model is the key to enabling our growth at scale that is truly unmatched. To put this in perspective, Rocket Mortgage's incremental closed volume of $175 billion in 2020 was more than double the growth of any other market participant. In fact, our incremental gain in 2020 alone was nearly large enough to eclipse the entire all-in closed loan volume of the nation's second largest originator last year. Growing at this pace in a complex category, like home loans, requires a platform with broad reach, scalable infrastructure, and centralized software driven operations. The Rocket Platform is built to perform and grow in the largest, most complex markets. Our infrastructure also leads to a highly efficient economic model with substantial operating leverage. Our 2020 results demonstrate Rocket's ability to drive increased scale from a single platform with limited incremental cost. For the full-year 2020, Rocket's adjusted revenue increased by $11 billion year-over-year. We drove this revenue growth, while only adding $2 billion of expenses during the year or $3 billion of annualized operating expenses based on our fourth quarter. To demonstrate the efficiency of the business model, Rocket's transactions per production team member in 2020 were roughly triple the industry average. While our low cost platform model is driving record profitability, we're continuing our long-term strategy to reinvest in the business. Key targets for investment include our brand, product development, and initiatives to drive growth in the purchase market. We continue to invest in talent growth, particularly in technical roles. As an example, our data science team now includes over 300 professionals. We're seeing high performers choose to join Rocket across multiple teams, including the ongoing expansion of our technology and product strategy teams. Our brand is another key investment priority, including our recent Super Bowl ads, which generated significant brand recognition and drove record traffic to our online and mobile properties. Among our key product development priorities is Rocket Logic, the next generation of our core workflow management platform. The new platform guides users through the next best action, resulting in faster, more accurate workflows. We are very impressed with our initial pilot, where we are seeing 20% improvement in turn times within the pilot group. What's even more exciting is that Rocket Logic can be applied to enhance processes beyond mortgage origination. We expect Rocket Logic and our many automation initiatives to drive continued efficiency in the business model. The core of our economic flywheel is that we are constantly leveraging our profitability advantages to reinvest in the business, further strengthening our competitive position. Another key advantage of the Rocket Companies platform is our ability to test, launch, and rapidly scale new business models. This entrepreneurial approach can be seen in our scaled mortgage operations. In two years, our partner network has grown from less than $20 billion in close loan volume to $120 billion on an annual basis. We see similar opportunity within our early stage rapidly expanding businesses, such as Rocket Auto, Rocket Loans, and Rocket Homes. To that end, and as Jay announced a few minutes ago, the launch of Rocket Labs will further accelerate our focus on expanding the business in ways that leverage our platform and serve our client base. We believe our clients will be greatly served over time with these additional business lines. Turning to our first quarter outlook, we expect close loan volume of $98 billion to $103 billion, compared to $51.7 billion in the first quarter of 2020, net rate lock volume of $88 billion to $95 billion, up from $56 billion in the first quarter of 2020, and gain on sale margins of 3.6% to 3.9%, compared to 3.25% in the first quarter of 2020. We're excited about the continued strength and momentum of the Rocket Platform. We ended 2020 with an extremely strong balance sheet, including $2 billion of cash and $7.7 billion of total liquidity. Total liquidity includes cash on hand, undrawn lines of credit, undrawn MSR lines, and corporate cash used to sell fund loan originations, which could be transferred to funding facilities at our option. As we communicated at the time of our IPO last summer, our capital allocation priorities always start with properly capitalizing and reinvesting in the business. As I discussed earlier, we are actively deploying capital with investments in our platform, our brand, and our talent. We also want to deploy through add-on acquisitions that would be additive to our economic flywheel and bring value to our client base. Our next priority is to return capital to shareholders through dividends, opportunistic use of share buybacks, or a combination of the two. Given our record level of profitability in 2020, the board approved a special dividend of $1.11 per Class A Common Share funded by an equity distribution of $2.2 billion. Our substantial cash generation provides us significant optionality to drive long-term value for our shareholders. Additionally, we remain authorized to repurchase up to $1 billion of Rocket Companies common stock. With that, we are ready to turn it back to the operator for questions. Yeah, sure. First I'll say, we're still in a very strong demand environment with the Fed buying 95% or so of all conforming mortgage production today, the demand environment is very strong. One thing to remember about us as well as the market leader, we also benefit from the scale of our business when we execute into the secondary market. So, we have advantages because of that. So, we've seen gain on sale margins of 4.52% in Q3 of this year and then we saw continued strength as we came into Q4 coming in at 4.41%. And then, you know, as we look ahead into Q1, our expectations, as I said, for gain on sale margins are between 3.6% and 3.9%. And this is up from 3.25%, in Q1 of last year. So, margins are still well ahead of where they were a year ago. And then I'll also point at same time, we're still seeing strong close loan volume. Our close loan volume in Q4 of [$170 billion] and then looking ahead into Q1 between 98 billion and 103 billion, with those numbers, that would be the second biggest quarter in our company's history. So, to put this in perspective, just a little bit more than midpoint for our guidance is roughly 95% higher than our Q1 volumes. So, you know, the flexibility of our platform that we've talked about allows us to really run our business for long-term growth and for profitability in any environment and we're really feeling good about the momentum that we're seeing. Yeah. Sure. I'll start with the dividend and mechanics, and then maybe I'll let Jay comment on your other questions. So, the way to think about the dividends is that the $2.2 billion is being distributed to all shareholders based on their economic interest. So, our public Class A shareholders have roughly a 6% economic interest, and then RHI has a 94% economic interest. So, they are each receiving a dividend in proportion to that economic interest. You know \u2013 I'll start and I guess I'll say that continuing to invest is something that we will do, as Jay mentioned, in terms of, you know, looking at things from an ROI standpoint, and is that investment going to be one that is going to be a good use of our capital. So, we'll evaluate the opportunities based on that and think about the best use for our capital. So, that's one of the things that we certainly think about as we evaluate the amount of capital in the business. So... Yeah. I would say that at any point in time, we're more looking at the capital that we have in the business. And certainly this year was a year when we generated a lot of capital. It gave us the opportunity to not only continue to invest in the business, but also to think about whether there's additional capital that it might be the right time to return some of that to our shareholders. So, after evaluating that here, just recently, we decided that the right thing to do was to do this dividend. And we're really excited to be able to share in the successes that we have had here in 2020 with our shareholders."

            "content": "Good afternoon and welcome to the fourth quarter earnings call for Rocket Companies. Before we discuss another incredible quarter, I'd like to thank our 24,000 team members, many of whom are listening now. The excellent results that we are about to discuss and the innovations that drove them are a testament to your focus and dedication in what was an incredibly difficult year for the world. Your contributions to our clients and communities were a shining example of how successful our, for more than profit mindset can truly be. On today's call, I'll be speaking to a very important topic here at Rocket Companies, our platform. The platform continues to be the key to our long-term success in the verticals where we operate, as well as the record results that we've achieved in 2020. Over the next few minutes, you'll see how the technology that we've built and refined over decades will continue to drive success not only in the products that you're familiar with today, but also in product extensions and entirely new verticals in the future. If you were to ask us what our most important product is, we'd say it's the platform itself. In walking through our results, I'll provide updates on each of the key pillars of the Rocket platform, our technology, the strength of our brand, the Rocket Cloud Force, which I'll discuss later, and our data science foundation. I'll finish today's remarks by talking about how our platform allows us to continue to grow and become more efficient in our existing lines of business, while also launching and rapidly scaling new businesses. Our mission over the last several decades has been to take the most complicated and stressful transactions in life and simplify them with technology. Whether those transactions are mortgage, real estate, auto sales, or any number of new initiatives we're currently incubating, we provide a simple digital process, exceptional client experience, and certainty. This mission began in 1998 when our Founder and Chairman, Dan Gilbert, wrote an email committing all of the company's resources to moving online. His vision was simple, but decades ahead of its time. Most of the internet companies of that era focused on problems like search, advertising, or basic e-commerce. Dan saw things differently. He spotted the potential to take the most complex transaction in a consumer's life, the buying and financing of a new home and leverage technology to make it accessible online to consumers across the country. For more than two decades, we've been quietly building our technology platform right here in Detroit. To transform the way our clients experience life's most important events, we've continued to strengthen our digital products and infrastructure in 2020, deploying nearly 4,500 product features throughout the year, and delivering improvements to our platform every 28 minutes on average. Supporting our platform is our strong national brand that consumers and partners know and trust. As we grow, we continue to invest and find new ways to extend our reach and expand our marketing channels we leverage, allowing us to connect with more and more clients. I'm pretty sure the majority of you were among the nearly 100 million fans who watched the Super Bowl a couple weeks ago. In that game, we ran two 60 second advertisements highlighting that certain is better when it comes to buying a home. We aired one commercial highlighting Rocket Mortgage, and our technology that helps bring certainty to the home buying process, something that is needed now more than ever in today's red hot real estate market. The second demonstrated the significant role mortgage brokers play in American home ownership. As you know, brokers are important partners as we continue to extend the reach of our platform. This massive exposure, the first ever national advertisement showcasing brokers during a Super Bowl allows them to align with the power of the Rocket brand to create differentiation in their local markets. Our ads were ranked numbers one and two on USA Today's ad meter, which I am certain is the most prestigious consumer ranking of top Super Bowl Ads. This means not only were our ads loved by millions of consumers, but also received tremendous lift and visibility through social media, news articles, and TV networks playing our ads for free. All told, our Super Bowl activation resulted in more than 3.3 billion consumer impressions. When you look at the areas where we continue to excel and set the standard, you see both a company and a brand that some of the most well respected organizations in the world want to associate with. We've talked about our relationship with American Express, with State Farm, Intuit, Charles Schwab, and others in the past. On our last call, I also hinted that we would soon be announcing a new partnership. Today, I am happy to share that Morgan Stanley and E*Trade have entered into a new agreement with Rocket Mortgage where our company will originate, close, and service conforming mortgages for their clients. This arrangement allows Morgan Stanley to continue focusing on its jumbo lending, while allowing Rocket Mortgage to provide conforming loan options to the firm's millions of clients. We are very excited about this opportunity, which will kick off this year. Another pillar of our business model is the incredible Rocket Cloud Force, now consisting of more than 6,600 U.S. based professionals, trained to advise our clients on complex transactions. The COVID pandemic truly proved that the power of our Rocket Cloud Force can be harnessed anywhere, as our team member's work from home in locations across the country. The versatility and skill of this team allows us to continue exploring new verticals and services. Our ability to build, train, and license large scale sales teams provides us a significant competitive mode. Today's consumer expects simple, powerful digital experiences backed by support and consultation from trusted advisors. The Rocket Cloud Force's ability to seamlessly integrate into the online experience with timely, accurate, and actionable information is a game changer. In-markets where the legacy experience can be confusing and discouraging like buying or selling a home, searching for a car or considering a personal loan, our digital solutions and trusted advisors provide confidence and certainty. Along with our powerful Rocket Cloud Force, our company also continues to rapidly grow its use of ethical artificial intelligence and machine learning to streamline the business. This acceleration is made possible thanks to our vast data lake, which includes proprietary first party data on more than 58 million consumers and extends to 220 million consumers in total or 85% of the adults in the United States. We have the benefit of millions of clients working with us each year to buy a car, get a personal loan, buy a home, or refinance a mortgage. And we've been able to leverage this information to build sophisticated models to ensure our brand is in front of our clients and top of mind when they're ready to transact. In fact, since the beginning of 2019, data science has driven more than $75 billion in application value. The importance of data cannot be overstated. It is this information that allows us to quickly innovate, anticipate the market, and in some cases develop new companies altogether. These real time insights are a significant market advantage and consistently guide us to the right decisions with incredible efficiency. Together these pillars of our business, our scalable platform, our national brand, our Rocket Cloud Force, and our strategic use of data combine to create a technology powerhouse that continues to accelerate at scale. Consider this; it took our company 25 years to close our first 1 million loans. In 2020 alone, we have helped more than 1.1 million clients with their mortgage, automotive, real estate, or personal loan needs, innovation and execution paired with a highly trained Rocket Cloud Force creates a flywheel that continues to rapidly accelerate. I'm even more excited about where we're going in the future. Just three years ago, we launched Rocket Auto with the belief that we could leverage our platform and Rocket Cloud Force to help simplify the process of purchasing a car. Everyone knows buying a car is complicated, and intimidating. It's an experience that few consumers look forward to, but we've been able to make it approachable and enjoyable. Starting from zero in 2017, we've organically scaled Rocket Auto to more than $750 million of gross merchandise value in 2020. Now that we've validated the model, we will continue to invest in accelerating the growth in 2021 and beyond. Our partner network is another increasingly important growth driver for Rocket Companies. We continue to evolve and diversify from our original direct-to-consumer business model. Partner volume made up 38% of our closed loan volume in 2020, up from 23%, just two years ago. We view this evolution similar to Amazon's past decision to open up its marketplace to third party sellers.  Like Amazon, we've built a proprietary platform and have the capacity to process millions of transactions a year. The Partner Network brings growth and diversification to our business. Supporting these efforts, in late January, we announced that we launched a directory of nearly every broker in the country on RocketMortgage.com. We then promoted that directory with the Super Bowl ad that I mentioned earlier. The impact has been tremendous. In less than a month, since launching, we've had tens of thousands of consumers visit the directory and click through to contact a broker. All of these elements together have created an incredibly profitable company that has shown an ability to grow, strengthen, and scale in any market environment. The fourth quarter of 2020 was no exception. All of our businesses performed above expectations, leading to a full-year adjusted revenue of $16.9 billion, and adjusted EBITDA of $11.1 billion. As a result of our exceptional financial performance, Rocket Companies has generated substantial capital and today we're excited to announce that we are sharing our success with our shareholders. As Julie will soon explain, our board has authorized a special dividend of $1.11 per share for holders of our stock as of March 9 to be paid on March 23. We're also accelerating our long-term approach of launching and scaling new businesses from the ground up. I'm pleased to announce the creation of Rocket Labs. Rocket Labs mission is to incubate new businesses within Rocket Companies that leverage our platform and provide our clients with services that complement our existing core products. Our approach is to empower small, independent teams to work on big ideas and concepts, which will form the core of our future products. We're excited about Rocket Labs and the possibilities that represents. Before I turn things over to Julie to share our financial results, I'm going to take a moment to give her a proper introduction. Julie and I have worked together inside this company for 17 years. During that time, she's led the finance and accounting teams and done a tremendous job managing all aspects of our liquidity. It's Julie's foresight that has helped us continue to grow in all market cycles. Not only that, but there's nobody who knows the financial side of this industry better. We're all lucky to be working alongside her. With that introduction, Julie, take it away. Thanks, Tim. Jay Farner here Absolutely. When we think about Dan Gilbert's vision for the company, over 20 years ago, I think I referenced the email that Dan had sent out about our ability to transform these major life events that people have leveraging the internet. Well, here we are 20 years later. And we're talking about mortgage, we're talking about real estate, we're talking about auto sales. As you know, that's over a $5.5 trillion market that we're playing in. And these investments that I discussed in the prepared remarks around our technology platform, the brand that we have built, the Rocket Cloud Force that allows us to step-in and take action at the right moment with consumers. And then this massive data lake that allows us to market to consumers. Well, now we're leveraging that across multiple channels, this platform that you're asking about. So, one thing I'll draw your attention to. We did 750 million in gross merchandise value at Rocket Auto in 2020. We're looking to see that double as we go into 2021. So that's really kind of our direct impact, but you also asked about the indirect. If you think about the importance here with the retention rate that's, I think nearly 90% industry tops then these points for us to help our clients with other transactions and have a car delivered directly to their doorstep that keeps our engagement strong. And so the next time they need to purchase or refinance or roll in debt, or have a life event, we're right there, and they think about us as more than a mortgage lender. On our real estate side, even with COVID and some of the delays that we saw in the spring time with home buying, we did $6 billion in transaction value from Rocket Homes. We invested heavily in our MLS platform, and launched that new technology here in January. We're rapidly adding states. I think we'll be up to 45 states by the end of March. And so that gives us great reach into the client base out there that's thinking about buying a home. And now we're interacting with them at the top of the funnel, and we can bring them through for mortgage title. And if you're not ready to buy a home right now, well, that's okay, maybe a [indiscernible] is the right thing for them. So, you're starting to see the power of this platform that we're building. Yeah. I think not only how broad it can be, but it moves us up to the top of the funnel as we see our clients starting to think about or purchase a home. The other important component, though, is, is that we've got more than just MLS. ForSaleByOwner.com, which allows us to help clients who aren't ready to transact with the real estate agent, we've got a realtor network. So those who are ready, we can refer off to the best agents in the country. And of course, then we can supply with our full blown approvals to ensure that anybody that's interacting with our real estate agents, is an active buyer. And as you know, in a real estate market, that's red hot, with such low inventory, the need for that client to walk through the door with a Rocket Mortgage, full approval is absolutely critical. So, it's really tying all of those threads together that gives our clients the best shot at getting the house from start to finish and all along the way we're able to collect data to determine someone's interest and make sure that we're putting our Rocket Cloud Force in the right point at the right time to help that client through the process. Of course. Well, as we've been on this journey for 35 years as a company, 25 years for me here and Julie 17, Bob 24, you know, rates will that tick up and rates will tick down. Our real focus is making sure we're providing an experience that draws clients and consumers into our funnel, and allows us to grow market share in particular, when things get a bit more challenging, and others tend to step away from investments in marketing and technology and other things.  We're seeing strong consumer demand, especially in the housing market, and it's a strongest that it's been here in the last decade, and current rates are still incredibly low. So that means it's very affordable to buy a home. And there are still millions of Americans out there that can save well over $100 a month on their monthly payment by refinancing their home. There are also many Americans out there that are looking to invest in their home, home improvements and those sorts of things. So, like I said, we're seeing strong consumer demand. I know Julie's given the guidance for the next quarter, which is kind of where we're willing to go at this point in time. I'll draw your attention to the fact that overall, we were able to grow volume twice as fast as the industry in 2020. And so when we think about our opportunity to invest in marketing, invest in technology, and continue to grow market share in 2021 we feel very strong about that. And we think that that investment won't \u2013 it will not only grow our market for mortgage and real estate, but it will start feeding these other businesses like I talked about auto for example on our platform. Good evening. All right and then maybe going into the capital allocation, just to be clear, the board approved up to a billion dollar share repurchase, we have not repurchased shares up to this point in time. In looking at, and Julie walked through the waterfall nicely, I'll recap it again, we always first are focused on maintaining a very strong balance sheet, which we have today.  Second, is just investing in our business, like we've been doing now for 35 years, whether it's the brand activity, you saw the Super Bowl spots, the technology platforms here, that we have been rolling out, strengthening, adding features to. Rocket Labs, which I talked about, which is an important investment for us to make sure we're incubating all of these ideas that we can grow and then add to the platform. And we're very active and looking for acquisitions that would allow us to grow. After going through that waterfall, we determined at this moment in time, the best use of those funds was to issue a dividend. And we'll follow that process moving forward here, as we've got a great track record of being profitable and throwing off a lot of cash, what's the best use in the long-term for our shareholders. And so that's the process we use. That's a process we'll continue to use. And we'll be opportunistic. If we feel like the share prices is at a place where the right thing to do is buy back those shares. We'll do that as well. Well, I'll start with the partner segment. I know we made an announcement today that Morgan Stanley and E*Trade will be joining the platform. They'll be joining Charles Schwab, State Farm, Intuit, [indiscernible] TurboTax, Realtor.com. So, you know, as the market becomes more challenging and others experience headwind, typically what we find is that, you know, large partners like this will look for the steady driving force in the market and that's us. And so that usually bodes well for our opportunity to grow market share and grow partnerships. When it comes to our third party or what we call TPO space, it's the same situation. Brokers out there who are in a more challenging market are going to look for somebody who will deliver the technology, a brand that they can lean into. And that's why we did the Super Bowl spot to give them that Rocket Brand that they could leverage to grow their business. And so, usually as we see these interest rates tick up a bit, what we're going to see is an opportunity for us to lean in to spend more money, and now to talk about the retail or direct-to-consumer space, same situation here. There are so many marketing opportunities out there for us. And as others tend to step away or back away from the space this is where we can lean in, we can grab market share. And not only are we thinking about the profitability that we achieve on the first transaction. We're thinking about the lifetime value of that client, and we're now thinking about the lifetime value not only over mortgage, but real estate, auto, and these additional businesses that we'll be adding. So, I guess you can tell we're pretty excited about it and don't see interest rates going up or down really having an impact on our business one way or the other. Well, maybe I'll let Bob speak a moment about the margin because we've got a pretty long track record of protecting that over time, and then I can dive a little bit into the things that we'll do to continue to grow market share. Yeah, maybe I'll jump in here. If you think about our operational efficiencies, and how much of every dollar we earn in revenue drops to the bottom line, and the scale that we have in our platform, and you can see the guidance that Julie provided in Q1. We've obviously seen market shifting and changing the last few months and our guidance is based on that. We have this very unique advantage to make the investment in marketing. And that can be marketing to drive more purchase leads to our 6,600 Cloud Force individuals that can be marketing with our partners like Realtor.com to drive purchase leads that can be marketing inside of E*Trade clients or Schwab clients. And so, as Bob touched on, those operational efficiencies give us the opportunity to increase our investment and grow that market share. And we're fortunate that so many different places to go spend those dollars. That's what you will see us do. And that's the plan that we will execute on to continue to grow through 2021. Yeah, I'll give some many themes that we're looking at. I want to be cautious about going too far down the funnel there. But we're thinking about the tech stack that exists in auto. One of the key differentiators for us on the Rocket Auto piece is connecting the highly fragmented buyers across America with the highly fragmented distributors across America. And so there's a unique tech stack opportunity there that could accelerate our growth. We look at other add-ons that could bring efficiency or accelerate growth in mortgage out of mortgage. We look at other tech add-ons that could allow our Rocket Homes platform to grow efficiently. So, you'll find us exploring things that we can add-on to our platform that will accelerate your organic growth that we're already seeing. Yeah. Maybe a clarifying question, when you mentioned investments, are we talking capital allocation or are you speaking specifically to the non-mortgage, the Rocket, the loan and the homes investments that \u2013 you know and platform added components to our platform today? Yeah, I would say that we feel very good about how we invested in 2020. And so, I think you'll see similar investments in 2021. You know, behind the scenes, a lot of the incredible work that was done to our tech platform supporting our brand that occurred in, you know very similar in 2020 to 2021. The one area you'll probably see us lean into even more is our performance marketing. And that's an area where we can invest, grow our brand, but also grow revenue and lifetime value. And it's very, very measurable. And so that'll be probably an area you'll see even increased investment in 2021. Yeah. Yeah. You touched on important component and there are quite a few. I always [stop], Bob Walters always reminds me that regardless of interest rate market refinance makes up a very large portion of mortgages done in this country each and every year. So, as we touched on before there, of course our cash out, people are investing in their home at record levels. We're seeing that in some of the non-revolving debt that's increasing across the country. Of course, there's always life events that cause people to move. And we're also seeing second home investment be very strong. So, we'll keep seeing, I think refinancing, regardless of interest rate, but to the to the purchase question that you're asking, we touched on our realtor.com relationship and partnership. So, we're thinking about how we bring more clients directly to our 6,600 Rocket Cloud Force team members. That's the investment in Rocket Homes, which will allow for the same and ForSaleByOwner.com. Large partnership like E*Trade gives us access to great clients who are saving money and thinking about investing in homes, as does the Schwab network, which I think is having a had a record year in 2020. So, all of these things give us reach into people at the very front-end of when they're thinking about purchasing. But then there's another important component as well, which is our broker network, and the thousands of brokers that we're working with, that we're supporting, and we continue to support more and more not only with great technology, and a great salesforce, but also great marketing. And that's why we mentioned the Super Bowl spot, because we are now turning the millions of people that come to our Rocket Mortgage website onto the fact that they can work with a broker, as well as our Rocket Cloud Force. And so that will help drive more purchase volume into our funnel. And then let's go to Insight because Insight and the thousands of agents that are joining there, they want certainty, and they want visibility into what's happening with the real estate transaction. And we believe we're uniquely positioned to provide this because we've also got thousands of agents that are already signed up on our Rocket Homes Platform. So, we're working with them each and every day. We're getting feedback from them. We're taking that, we're sending it into product strategy. We're adding features to that technology to give them that visibility and that certainty. And I think that's why we're seeing such growth. So to answer your question about the pace, the pace is exactly where we thought it would be for Insight, and as we get into the purchase at home buying market, we think that will continue to grow. You bet. Sure. And maybe I'll start and Bob, you can give your thoughts as well, as you've been watching that for the quarter of a century now. So, if you'll kind of maybe take a step back, as the market \u2013 as we see rates tick down, what you'll typically see is a lot of folks join the industry and you referenced increasing capacity. But when they join the industry, it's not with hundreds of millions or billions of dollars in investment in technology. It's not with billions of dollars of investment in brand and that's why they don't see $0.85 or $0.80 or wherever we were, Julie can clarify, dropped to the bottom line the way that we do. So, then as the market compresses and these things happen pretty quickly, folks who decided to get into the market by hiring folks and adding bodies and spending money, they find that it gets very hard to be in the mortgage business very quickly. And so, the same slack that \u2013 the same capacity that went in comes out. And so, sure there can be ups and downs in margin and interest rate for a short period of time as that kind of works it through, but as we get to the other side of that, what you find is, usually fewer competitors. And so for those remaining, not only does the margin stabilize and give you the opportunity to see that increase, but it also gives you what you pointed out great opportunity to grow market share. And then again, I'll mention this because it's so critical to our business model. For us, as we think about the acquiring of clients onto our platform, we're sitting in a situation where not only will we recognize the profitability of that first transaction with our operational efficiency, but if people are coming in at a higher interest rate, and we're servicing now, nearly 2.2 million clients, well, then the minute that rates tick down, while the opportunity to help them with a lower interest rate, thus recognizing the profit, again, at a higher margin, with no marketing cost. And then of course, help them with the purchase of a new home to Rocket Homes; help them with a purchase of a car through Rocket Auto. So, it really is a very exciting opportunity for us as we see rates tick up a bit, because it creates this process I've just discussed, which leads to market share growth, and leads a lot of sight to really strong future profitability as well for us. Bob, anything to add? Yeah. We'll have Dan join the call next time to discuss this. I'll go back to the comments that he made or in the letter. Our real mission is to take complicated transactions that humans tend to shy away from because of the complexity and the fact that they're not that frequent, and make them simple for people. And so that's where you're going to see us focus in on because that's the power of our platform between the data that we have, the incredible client experience, we can deliver with our rocket cloud force, the marketing brand that brings confidence and the technology that streamlines these complex things. That's where we can win. That's where we differentiate. So, of course, real estate is kind of centered to that. We think auto is right there as well. But other things of that nature are of interest to us. In addition, we're always looking for the things that come natural with the purchase of a home or the ownership of a home or a car. And so, you know, think about when you buy a house now, what are the other things that you have to invest in, the other things that you have to keep track of. As we've got a relationship with the client, as we have the data around that, from the appraisal data, to the credit data, how can we assist that client in streamlining all these ginormous fragmented markets that surround the home or the auto. And so those are the places, when we talk about Rocket Labs in investing and setting up these two [indiscernible] teams to quickly develop technology and put it into the wild, we can leverage our servicing book and other client bases to test it out. That's where you're going to see that \u2013 those groups focus. Absolutely. The only thing that I'll add is, and you've probably heard that through the entire call. So, our focus is long-term. And our focus is the \u2013 what we believe this company will be over the coming years and satisfying these challenging problems for consumers across multiple, you know, industries. And so, you know, growth is our focus and because of the platform that we've got, and Julie just touched on this \u2013 the scale and the efficiency, we can generate profits very quickly, large profits very quickly. And so, you know, we have to take into consideration all the opportunities that are in front of us to grow the business in the long-run. But we've also got to think about situations where we're \u2013 we made $11 billion last year. We're making a billion dollars a month. Even with all those opportunities out there, it still may be the best thing to do to issue a dividend to our shareholders. So, we're fortunate to have these choices, and we'll \u2013 but we're always thinking the long-term success and growth of this business first. Yeah. Great question. I can tell you that those type of things are what our capital markets folks are looking at every day and the data that we have, and I'm going to go back to the importance of the data from the top of the funnel, even pre-application to understand pull-through rates. And so those type of data points are priced in to the guidance that Julie has provided. That's right. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, I just want to thank everybody, and particularly our team members who are listening, couldn't be more proud of the year that we had. Of course, the record revenue and profitability, but I think even more importantly, all the impact that we're able to have on the communities that we live and work and play in supporting the city of Detroit, the massive investments that we've made here in COVID, not only of our money, but of the time, energy, and effort that so many team members did to support the community, just so proud. And so thanks to all of you, and thanks to our investors, and we'll keep plugging away here to do great things at Rocket Companies."

            "content": "Yeah, Jay, I think it's a good question. It's important one. In a lot of ways, when interest rates have risen in the past those have been and we've made some [indiscernible] powerful share gains. We have a lot of advantages that our competitors don't have and as Jay and Julie touched on, because of the brand, because of our brand, there's only one National Mortgage brand, it really allows for the consistency of those margins. So, not only are we able to protect those, but also gain share in these sorts of environments. There's a lot of different areas that we are gaining those shares. We have multiple channels, a lot of our competitors don't have those multiple. We talked about the Pro channel, and we \u2013 certainly the direct-to-consumer channel. And there's also a pretty persistent market of less interest rate sensitive products whether it be mortgage insurance, whether it be equity extraction, so cash out, you know that homes have risen in an incredible amount. The amount of equity in the market is really substantial. That is something that really will drive the market in the years to come. And then there's also a very, very robust purchase market and that we're very active in. So, you know, you asked for that ideal, that ideal channel, or ideal, it's really \u2013 it is these sorts of markets that we have grown in the past and taken advantage of a lot of the attributes that we have that are competitive. Yeah, I think just a couple of things. So that, you know, we have the luxury of being a 35 year old company. If you look back decades, you will see a very consistent track record of gain on sale. And it's really one of the, I think one of the hallmarks of the company. And there's a number of reasons for that. Jay's also talked a lot about lifetime value. You mentioned the service clients, over $400 billion of service clients. So, you know, in the rising rate environment that becomes incredibly valuable and let alone all the other things that we talked about, the other businesses and markets that we are in. So quarter-to-quarter, we don't spend a lot of time thinking about, it's just gaining share and gaining lifetime value."

We're demonstrating true leadership at a critical time for our industry and our clients. I'm extremely proud of our 22,000 plus team members whose dedication and drive have helped deliver the results, we will share with you today. First I want to congratulate our team on being named the number one company for client satisfaction in mortgage origination by JD Power yesterday. This marks our 11th straight year being named to the top of the list. And when you add in our seven consecutive number one rankings for mortgage servicing we've taken home 18 JD Power awards in the last 11 years. This one in particular special to us however, it's proof that our platform is so powerful that we can more than double loan originations year-over-year and still deliver on our commitment to servicing our clients at the highest levels. Again team, congratulations. Our industry has reached an important moment. The COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed the way Americans think of their homes. For decades, many of you -- there house as their most important investment. Today, home in so much more. It is now, where we work, where we teach our children and where we gather with friends. Bringing new meaning and significance to the place where we live, our home. This enthusiasm around the value of home is clear in the numbers. For instance, the National Association of Realtors existing home sales report, show that September sales of previously owned homes were more than 20% higher than the same month in 2019. Also, recent reports in the New York Times and San Francisco Chronicle, tell residents moving from the city centers to buy homes in the surrounding suburbs in search of more space. Homeownership is on the rise across the country led by a new generation of first time homebuyers. As a result of shifting demographics and the ongoing pandemic, we are seeing a rapid acceleration in the long-term shift from physical to digital transactions across the industries where we participate. Consumers today don't just prefer -- they demand a completely digital experience. [Audit Start] At the same time, the digital transformation of the lending process has become more important than ever. As an unprecedented number of consumers look to leverage today's favorable interest rates, we are seeing the strongest growth among our most digitally engaged clients, application volume through our self-serve digital experience has grown significantly faster than overall volume year-to-date. This trend accelerated earlier this year and continued through the third quarter. The Rocket Mortgage platform is particularly powerful for first time homebuyers, who can receive loan approvals within minutes. In the third quarter, we delivered more purchase approval letters through our digital experience than in any quarter in our company's history. In addition to becoming the overwhelming choice for millennial homebuyers, Rocket Mortgage has continued to serve a large number of clients looking to take cash out of their homes, reduce their loan terms or refinance due to changes in life situations such as divorce. These clients who are not rate sensitive, remain an important population when you consider Rocket Companies incredible footprint, serving all 50 states and more than 3,100 counties in the United States, and a growing presence in Canada. Our marketplace has reached a significant inflection point due to consumers demanding a simple digital experience. And I'm proud to say Rocket Mortgage is executing at enormous scale. In the third quarter, we delivered a record performance with $89 billion of closed loan volume, representing a 122% increase year-over-year. The growth we're achieving is unmatched. In Q3, we added nearly $50 billion of year-over-year closed loan volume. Consider this, our incremental volume in the third quarter is so large, that if alone would have made us the second largest retail mortgage lender in the nation. To further illustrate the scale of this growth, Rocket Mortgage closed nearly $1 billion of origination volume each day in the third quarter. The scale and efficiency of our platform continues to drive substantial earnings power. We achieved a 69% adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter and have generated $5.9 billion of adjusted net income in just the first nine months of 2020. The guidance that Julie will share with you today assumes us among the most profitable FinTech companies in the world. And we're not stopping there. Our mission is simple. We will continue to lead from the front as the most admired brand and technology platform in our industry. Recently, we hosted tech TechCon our in-house technology conference for all Rocket Companies technologists drawing more than 4,000 of the brightest minds in the industry. One of the most important topics covered was ethical artificial intelligence and its ever-increasing role in business. We crossed an important milestone in Q3 by generating more than $60 billion in application volume over the last two years using data science and AI. Our data science teams are now generating organic lead flow at higher conversion rates than paid marketing channels. We are also using automation to improve the efficiency of our operations and are now making more than 1 million decisions per day using machine learning. All these processes get better with scale. Strengthening our competitive lead and reinforcing the Rocket Companies flywheel. In addition to leveraging our rich data insights, we continue to expand the ways we are reaching consumers through innovations, partnerships and marketing. In the last 30 days alone, we have announced enhancements to our Rocket Pro platform, that grant real estate professionals never before available insights into their clients\u2019 mortgages. Now they can help guide homebuyers through the mortgage process from approval to closing using the Rocket Pro mobile app or website. Rather than calling one of our mortgage bankers we\u2019re asking the client real estate agents can now use Rocket Pro insight to check in on a loan status, that leaves more time for Mortgage Bankers to help other home buyers and the agent can focus on showing and closing houses with their clients. The reaction from those in the real estate community has been overwhelming. In fact, in the first day, more than 1,100 agents joined Rocket Pro Insights, and the momentum has only increased. We anticipate nearly 15,000 real estate professionals will sign up to use the platform by the end of the year, providing a significant touch point with one of the largest influencers in the home purchase lifecycle. Another program to help both home buyers and their agents was launched in early October. We checked off a new relationship with Realtor.com that allows the tens of millions of homebuyers visiting their website to seamlessly apply for a Rocket Mortgage. The new venture was quickly followed by an announcement highlighting Rocket Mortgage's partnership with Intuit\u2019s Mint Personal Finance tool. Now Mint users can easily import their personal financial information into a Rocket Mortgage loan application with the tap of the finger, allowing them to lock in a mortgage rate and as little as eight minutes all while staying in the Mint app. Quicken Loans Mortgage Services, which serves the needs of our mortgage broker partners recently rebranded to Rocket Pro TPO. This transition allows our partners to continue to meet the needs of their clients, while also providing them with the ability to leverage the best-known brand in consumer lending with Rocket Mortgage. To celebrate, we provided 10,000 fresh purchase leads to a Rocket Pro TPO partners. Something that's never been done before in the industry. As part of the rebranding. We've also announced new AI and machine learning innovations in partnership with Google technology. Additional tech focused enhancements to our platform and new ways to align with and support our brokers. Overall, the feedback we've received about the rebrands and technology rollouts has been extremely positive. In addition to all the fantastic partnerships we've already shared with you. We are proud to announce that as of last week, we have forged a relationship with one of the largest financial services companies in the world. This collaboration, similar to the program, we created with Charles Schwab will allow us to originate mortgages for a new base of clients. We anticipate that we'll share more information in the New Year. Our exceptional brand marketing also continues to be a true differentiator in the industry. Our Rocket can [ph] campaign has been incredibly successful. We're proud to soon be rolling out a new slate of ads, including our first exclusively targeting the growing what next community. We continue to also leverage well known talent like Jason Momoa, star of our Super Bowl ad. And Future NFL, Hall of Fame wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald in our marketing to appeal to a broad consumer base. The fact is Rocket Companies is leveraging the scale and flexibility of our platform to deliver first to market innovations with the best partnerships in real estate, technology and finance. All while reinforcing our brand with best-in-class marketing. Outside of mortgage, innovation is taking place throughout our entire ecosystem. In the last several months, Nexus, our title and closing technology company announced it had partnered with insurance leaders, Farmers and Lemonade to simplify homeowners insurance verifications using it's Clear HOI platform. These companies joined others including all State and Liberty Mutual in helping provide a digital solution to lenders looking to confirm the presence of an insurance policy in a real-time, eliminating the need to manually call to confirm a process that is deceptively tedious. At Amrock, our Title company, we closed more than 100,000 mortgage transactions in September, a record that proves the scalability of our platform. In addition, Amrock continues to be a trailblazer, digitizing the title industry, much like Rocket Mortgage did for loan originations. In the first three quarters of 2020, the company is responsible for 90% of all eClosings in the industry, providing safety and convenience to our clients amid the ongoing pandemic. [Audit End] Additionally, Amrock is implementing machine learning and ethical AI into its workflow, through its proprietary titled decision engine or TDE. This tool, which is currently being used on more than 30% of Amrock tunnel work automates the traditionally manual process of reviewing documents, maps and records of sale cutting down the time, our team members working on files by nearly 70%. This frees us up to work on other more specialized items significantly increasing our productivity. Finally, I'd like to take a moment to talk about our approach to client retention and increasingly important driver of our business. After we originate alone we maintain monthly touch points with our clients and generate recurring revenue by processing their payments and servicing their loan over its lifetime. Julie will give more detail in a moment, but we are sharing today that Rocket Mortgage consistently retains over 90% of our total servicing clients on an annual basis. Retention at these levels, has never been seen in the mortgage business and rivals any subscription-based model across industries including cable, streaming and wireless services. Before I turn things over to Julie. I wanted to announce an addition to our Board of Directors. Our Board has voted unanimously to make Jonathan Mariner, the Founder and President of TaxDay, an Independent Board member and new Chair of our Audit Committee. Prior to TaxDay, Jonathan spend 23 years in professional sports serving as the Chief Financial Officer for Major League Baseball, the Florida Marlins, the Florida Panthers and Dolphins Stadium. In addition to our Board. He also serves as an Independent Board Member for Tyson Foods, McGraw-Hill Education, Major League [ph] baseball and several others. We are very excited to have him join us. And with that, I'll ask Julie to share with you the details of our financial performance in this quarter. Julie?\nJulie Booth: Thank you, Jay, and good afternoon everyone. Thanks to the hard work of the entire Rocket Companies team we achieved another quarter of incredible results. In the third quarter, we achieved year-over-year quarterly adjusted revenue growth of 163% to $4.7 billion and adjusted net income growth of 365% to $2.4 billion. We also produced another quarterly record in close loan volume, which was up a 122% year-over-year to $89 billion. Based on what banks and mortgage lenders have publicly reported, we believe that our closed loan volume growth was substantially higher than the overall industry in the three and nine months ended September 2020 compared to a year earlier. We generated record quarterly net rate lock volume of $94.7 billion, which represented a gain of 101% year-over-year. As a reminder, we recognized revenue at the time when we lock the interest rate with our client. Rate lock typically occurs approximately 30 to 45 days prior to the closing of a loan. We produced robust growth in both of our segments. Funded loan volume in our direct-to-consumer channel was up by 131% to $53.5 billion, an increase in our partner network by 127% to $29.6 billion both compared with the year-earlier quarter. We consider a loan funded when it is sold to investors on the secondary market. While we continue to benefit from the low interest rate environment. we also produced strong year-over-year growth in the quarter from less rate sensitive products. Demand for these products are driven by factors including clients wanting to purchase a home take cash out of their homes, reduce the terms on their mortgages, changes in their life situations and the demand for Investment Properties. Although rate term refinancing activity has been very high in 2020, we have historically had a balanced mix of origination. For example, from the first quarter of 2017 through the third quarter 2020 more than half, our overall volume was [indiscernible] are less rate sensitive products. Gain on sale margin of 4.52% increased substantially from 3.29% in the prior year period and remained strong by historical standards. The sequential change from record gain on sale margins of 5.19% in the second quarter was driven primarily by changes in channel and product mix. As a reminder, record gain on sale margins in the second quarter, reflecting our ability to rapidly scale, our direct-to-consumer volume during a period of pandemic related market disruption, particularly during April and May. Breaking down the 67 basis point variance and gain on sale margins sequentially, changes in loan pricing represented less than 10 basis points of the quarter-over-quarter difference in our gain on sale margins. Approximately 40 basis points of the change resulted from differences in channel and product mix, particularly the strong growth of our partner network volume during the quarter. Overall, our margins exceeded the high end of our expectations and remained at historically elevated level throughout the third quarter. In the past, we have typically seen primary, secondary spreads normalized within a month or two. However since March, these spreads have remained well above historical averages. We believe this speaks to the strength of demand in the current environment as you heard from Jay. Managing gain on sale margins is an important advantage of the Rocket Mortgage business model, our centralized technology driven operating model allows us to dynamically price our products on a real-time basis. As the largest mortgage lender in the country, we also benefit from the scale and sophistication of our capital markets capabilities, including superior hedging, proving and secondary market execution. Client retention is another key differentiator, of the Rocket Companies ecosystem. We've spoken to many of you about our ability to recapture clients who pay off out of our servicing portfolio, because of our unique business model, our recapture is more than 4 times the industry average based on the latest figures from Black Knight. Today, we are also introducing a new metric called our net client retention rate. This metric is intended to be comparable with retention figures across multiple industries, including cable and wireless service providers. Our new metric is calculated based on the clients who remain active with Rocket as a percentage of the total starting client base. As we show in today's press release, our net client retention rate has consistently and about 90% over the past few years. Retention at these levels, drive substantial lifetime value advantages for the company. Our high net retention rate allowed us to benefit from the continued cash flow from our servicing portfolio and also have the opportunity to hear out with our clients in the businesses throughout our ecosystem. This metric reflects the high lifetime value of our portfolio. The unique strength of our business is that when the net client retention rate fall, it is generally the result of lower interest rates, leading to higher refinance activity, because our recapture rate is 4.6 times the industry average, we generate even more revenue from increased loan origination volume. Our [indiscernible] as a natural hedge to our retention rate. In the current environment, we are driving strong repeat transaction activity, which represented 42% of overall mortgage volume in the third quarter. We are also adding hundreds of thousands of new clients into our ecosystem creating and expanding foundation for future growth. Our total Q3 expenses increased by 46% year-over-year primarily driven by higher variable compensation and an increase in team members in production roles to support our growth. Turning to our balance sheet. We remain in a strong liquidity position, with total liquidity of $6.9 billion, which included $3.5 billion of cash as of quarter end. We define total liquidity as cash and cash equivalents plus bond drawn NSR lines, undrawn unsecured lines of credit and self-funded mortgages that can be transferred to our funding facilities out our option. These figures reflect the strong underlying cash generation of the company and our recent issuance of $2 billion in senior notes at substantially lower interest rates then the notes refinanced. After the end of the quarter, we repaid the $1.25 billion of senior notes due 2025. Overall, we are extremely proud of our long-term track record of delivering profitable growth at scale and our record performance in the quarter and year-to-date. To illustrate, just how amount of our scale, is the company has been consistently profitable on an annual basis. Having generated double-digit GAAP pre-tax income margins every year from 2015 through 2019. Over just the first nine months of 2020, we produced approximately $6.6 billion in GAAP pre-tax income, which represented a dramatic improvement compared with a year earlier. Our strategic objective remains to achieve 25% market share of the mortgage market by 20-30 while continuing to generate industry leading profitability over the long run. To achieve these long-term objectives, we are investing in our brand and technology, so that we can profitably grow through all market environment. For example, over the 12 months ended September 30th, 2020, we leveraged more than $500 million invested in technology and are approximately 2,900 technology team members to further increase monthly loan production capacity and enhance efficiency, including some of the enhancements Jay discussed. We also invested approximately $900 million in marketing over the same timeframe. Moving on to our outlook, we currently are [ph] expect closed loan volume of between $88 billion and $93 billion or an increase of 73% to 83% compared to $50.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019. We expect net rate lock volume of between $80 billion and $87 million, which would represent an increase of 82% to 98% compared to $43.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019. And we expect, gain on sale margins of 3.8% to 4.1% which would be an improvement of 11% to 20% compared to 3.41% in the fourth quarter of 2019. Lastly, the company's Board of Directors approved a $1 billion share repurchase program effective today. The authorization reflects the Board and senior leaderships confidence in Rocket Companies long-term prospects. The program gives us the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities if we believe the market is undervaluing our business. We are committed to using our substantial cash generation to create long-term value for our shareholders. With that, we are ready to turn it back to the operator for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley, your line is open.\nJames Faucette: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, Jay. Good afternoon Julie. I'm wondering if we could start with the new retention metric that you highlighted. And maybe you can just spend a minute or two helping us understand how you look at that and how that's different than the other net retention metrics you've used in the past, maybe, Jay, in particular, if you look at that 92% kind of how did what goes through your mind in terms of the different ways that you can look to take advantage of that and increase the lifetime value of those customers?\nJay Farner: Yes, thanks for the question. I know we talked a lot about this during the IPO process and Bob Walters in particular about our recapture capabilities, which are now LNG [ph] references north of 4.5 times the industry average. So if someone's going to be paying off on our portfolio, we are recapturing that client, which is great because it generates very good revenue for us. And that recapture rate is one of the reasons we can, we were able to have this very high retention rate. And you just touched on it when the retention rate is high. Of course of these longer client lifetimes and when you think about the lifetime value of a client more opportunity to help them with the refinance, some opportunity ultimately to purchase, more opportunity to help them with other products such as auto or personal loans, and --, I think something different for us, but we benefit from out of a lot of other retention type businesses that were profitable on the first transaction as you saw today very profitable. But if this is actually even more unique for us because in our business, when the retention rate rises, you're probably looking at increased interest rates. And so as a servicer we collecting those monthly payments will also having the ability to market to those clients for other services, but if rates are falling and we might see the retention rate drop a bit, the rate today here in the low '90s, which is still incredible. We're still benefiting because of that recapture rate allows us to generate significant revenue on the refinance of their mortgage, so in retention rate and the recapture rate work together, but also like a natural hedge, I think Julie referenced that really allows us to win -- and whether interest rates are rising or interest rates are falling. And that really supports that broader ecosystem that we're building, as I touched on before, keeping the client in our ecosystem to be able to offer additional products and services to them, that's how like, it is think about it.\nJames Faucette: That's really helpful. And then I guess to build on that one of the key things that we look at is how quickly can you get people into the Rocket ecosystem and can you do that it kind of the beginning of their professional and working careers as and when they are buying their first homes. I think you made some comments that you're seeing some success there. But maybe you can talk a little bit about where you are seeing success. And how we should think about the trajectory on that initial purchase volume and how that can contribute to the lifetime value, particularly if you're able to maintain most high retention rates? Thanks a lot.\nJay Farner: Yes. And thanks again for the question. As I referenced in the comments on the call here, the demand for the digital experience is stronger than ever and we're seeing significant growth there, and in particular for us on the purchase side. So were talking about millennials, we're talking about folks who've been thinking about buying a home, and as I touched on COVID is really driven these clients are accelerated their desire to be home owners moving from urban centers into suburban places and looking for home purchase in fact, I think Q3 was the strongest one of our strongest purchase quarters and we issued more verifiable approval letters declines in Q3 than any other quarter in our company's history. So that's one way that we engage that client early on in their life cycle. And then I'd like you to think about the Rocket Auto business that we are excited about because that also tends to skew to a younger demographic, and so if Mortgage or home isn't the initial purchase loan or Auto may be. And so all of those initiatives in our ecosystem that we're working on, allow us to start that relationship building with the younger client base, that then will retain for 20, 30, 40 years to come.\nJames Faucette: Great, thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Chiodo from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nTimothy Chiodo: Thanks a lot. Thank you for taking the question. Wanted to bring up the topic that comes up often in investor discussions. It's around some of the technology advantages that you have that it's taken clearly years and lots of investment to build up. The question is really around, can you bring to light, some of these advantages that might be behind the scenes that are may be tougher for the consumer to see by looking at the user interface, some actually you work with like -- anything into sort of local or municipal systems anything along those lines would be much appreciated?\nJay Farner: Yes, thanks for the question. I believe Julie referenced this as we think about the investments that we've made here in the last 12 months, $500 million when it comes to our now nearly 3,000 technologist and the platform that we've been building. I think the best example that I can give you is that the growth year-over-year. If we look at the first nine months of '19, I think $94 billion closed. Now, we look at $213 billion in the same nine-month period in 2020. $94 billion is a huge base, the largest lender in the country and now more than doubling that demonstrates the power of that platform and those investments that we've made in technology across the board. So we talked about some of the more recent rollouts one, I'll draw your attention to is the Rocket Pro Insight platform that's giving real estate agents real time updates on the status of their clients mortgage, and that's important to them, of course because they feel in control, it's very important that loan closes, but it also frees up time for our team members to now will focus on the next loan making us more efficient versus taking those calls, it also allows the recession to drive referral business into our platform. Another one that I believe Julie referenced is the mid-partnership we've been partners with into it for a long period of time, but we been working hand-in-hand to have a fully integrated Rocket Mortgage experience in the mid-experience for their clients they don't have to leave that app and we've launched at now and not only does that allow us to provide that experience to mid-users, but the APIs that were built, we can leverage across additional partnerships. I know another one that we referenced it's been tech investment for us is the partnership into realtor.com where we're reaching now tens of millions of prospective homebuyers. And again that takes that takes good strong growth from our technology team to be able to do that. On the internal side maybe other things that are less evident. A significant portion of our underwriting process has been leveraging ethical AI as we talked about machine learning a lot of our decisions around verifications of assets, a verifications employment, verification of insurance is now done using automated systems. In fact, I think we referenced that there are over 1 million decisions each day, they are not automated all bringing great efficiency to our platform, which is what makes it so scalable.\nTimothy Chiodo: That's extremely helpful. Thank you so much. And then a quick follow-up, you actually, you're one step ahead of me there and mentioned on the realtor.com, which I know you mentioned in your prepared remarks as well, but it does seem to have a tilt towards the purchase market, obviously, and I was wondering if you could just expand on that partnership in terms of the potential relative to some of your other large brand name partners like State Farm?\nJay Farner: The real product, -- partnership represents yet another example of us be integrating our platform into their experience. And so we started that process, but the sky's the limit and what that integration can look like when you think to, think of the data and information we have about home values in markets, the real estate connections that the restage of connections that they have the equity information that we have about a 2 million plus folks in our servicing book. And so what we're really trying to create there is a seamless process from the very moment that you think about purchasing home until closing the home. And so the real reagent the mortgage approval, Amrock Title business, Nexus and we are closing the eClosing platforms that we've built. This is just a great way for us to wrap that altogether in create a very unique and best-in-class experience for our clients and for realtor.com clients.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nRyan Nash: Good evening, guys. So Jay, maybe it bring together a handful of things that you touched upon. I think a big part of the narrative with the ability to take market share. And I guess based on where you're running, I think you're about the 7.5% year to date, maybe closer to 8% in the quarter. Although, I know you don't manage to any one individual quarter. So with that as the backdrop, can you maybe just talk about the sustainability of volumes at these levels? And second, we're obviously seeing rates moving up a bit and I think market expectations are for them to continue to increase. So can you maybe just talk about how you expect to drive market share in a more purchase oriented market will be leaning more heavily into the broker channel. Can you maybe just talk about, you talked a little bit about cash out as party originations. Is that a big part of the volume and can that to help serve as an offset as in a smaller-refi market? Thanks.\nJay Farner: Yes, great question Ryan. Julie touched on over the last 2.5 plus years when you look at the volume breakdown of that for the kind of the reason for a refinance or a loan between purchase and cash out and in term changes and life changes like divorce more than 50% of our production is really not interest rate sensitive. So that's a critical component, we demonstrated that for years, and that will continue to happen also, when we look at the clients that could save a substantial amount of money here in this environment and we're still in a situation, I believe we're 70% of the folks out there it makes sense to refinance. So we feel very good about the continued strength in demand, not only on the refinance side but on the home purchase side, home ownership is back to kind of pre-crisis levels. And as I referenced before Millennials are very focused on home ownership moving from urban areas. It was great welcome news that the vaccine or a vaccine may be on its way. But we don't believe this will alter the course that has been set now for more work-from-home, leveraging the home for family and work in all of those things all things bode very well for homeownership. And so we imagine that will continue. And I think as Julie gave for guidance for Q4, really what you're looking at, if you back out a little bit of pressure we saw in October due to marketing spend for the election, which of course makes a little bit more challenging for us from a marketing perspective. And the fact that Q4 has four, five fewer what I'll call actionable business day as you know, the day before Thanksgiving, the day before Christmas Eve, which can be a bit more challenging. If you back that out and looked at what we're forecasting for production in Q4., it's very, very similar to what we accomplished in Q3. And as you touched on, this is where our ability to reach into the market leveraging whether it's our partners at Schwab, realtor.com meant or our go-to-partners along with leading into our direct-to-consumer advertising. It really positions us to grow market share when others are pulling back because of site, changes in interest rate.\nRyan Nash: Got it. And maybe one for Julie. I don't want to feel left out here. So Julie, could you maybe just talk about how, gain on sale spreads trended across the quarter given that they came in well above the guidance. And can you maybe just talk about what you're seeing that will drive the compression into the fourth quarter, how much of that is being driven by channel mix expectations versus competition and as you look out over the next few quarters, based on what you're seeing today, just any sense for how long you think we can continue to operate with these elevated spreads?\nJulie Booth: Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. And in Q3, our gain on sale margins exceeded our expectations and remained elevated by historical standards. So our margins have remained elevated for longer than expected. If you look at their changes I mentioned from Q2 to Q3, changing the loan pricing, represented less than 10 basis points of that variance channel and product mix were the biggest drivers of this variance and about 40 basis points of this net resulted from our strong partner network growth that we saw during Q3. So as we head into Q4 margins are still strong by historical standards, and they're continuing to stay elevated, we think that demand that we're going to continue to see with 70% of folks able to refinance and the amount of repairs volume, that you take that into the next couple of years, if there are 6 or 7 trillion out there ready to be refinanced, that is something that's going to take years to work through, which will continue to elevate that demand, we believe going into the upcoming years. And so we feel really good about where our gain on sale margins and volumes heading here into the fourth quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rich Shane from JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nRich Shane: Good afternoon everybody and thanks for taking my questions. One sort of business related. And then one stock related. As we look forward to the implementation of the GSE adverse market fees coming into place. I'm curious whether or not you think the primary markets were repriced or whether or not you think originators will start to absorb some of this. And that will adversely impacting on sale? [Audit Start]\nBob Walters: This is Bob Walters and thanks for the question. Largely most of that pricing has been absorbed and you've got a test run at it before the changes that we made a month or so ago. So they\u2019ve largely been absorbed at this point and are fairly fully priced into the margins.\nRich Shane: Great. Okay, thank you. And then when many situation you guys have announced a $1 billion potential buyback. I am curious how that works with the combination of A and D shares? Are D shares eligible for repurchase as well?\nJay Farner: Yes. That's probably a question, Julie - you want to field that or you want to push that to a different time.\nJulie Booth: Yes. I can just answer generally, no, the D shares are not eligible for repurchase. This would be a Class A share repurchase program that we have announced.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan McKeveny from Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.\nRyan McKeveny: Hey, thank you and congratulations on the results and guidance. So first question on gain on sale margins. Julie, taking some of your commentary about 4Q may be a step further. I think one of the debates out there is really thinking about that outlook into 2021, 2022 and sort of theoretically, how much compression there could be on gain on sale margins, especially if the environment is such where rates do back up at some point and industry volumes begin to fade. So definitely not looking for specific guidance on volumes or gain on sale margins for next year, but I'm just hoping you could maybe elaborate on the puts and takes to the gain on sale margins. I appreciate all the color that you did provide around the differentiation with your recapture and dynamic pricing but, maybe you can share some color on what you've seen historically in periods that might be somewhat analogous to today, where you have 2020 is a pretty massive year, but effectively what happens after that and why, what are those, what are those primary factors that we should think about for the puts and takes?\nJulie Booth: Yes, sure. If we look back, how can we kind of look at maybe more normalized, gain on sale margins, you'll see our direct-to-consumer margins have clinched [ph] between 400 basis points and 450 basis points. And then on the partner network side of things, probably between 100 basis points and 150 basis points if you look back over time. So I think as I mentioned that the demand that we're seeing now will continue to probably have a nice upward impact on those margins relative to the sort of historical levels that we have seen in to this upcoming year, how long that will last, you know it's just to be seen. But like I said, there is quite a lot of demand still out there into the upcoming years.\nRyan McKeveny: Got it. That's very helpful. And on the partner segment, exciting to hear about that new partnership that was struck last week, but curious on the Rocket Pro TPO changes this quarter, I was hoping you could address just how you think about your positioning in the wholesale channel, how you think about your differentiation from others maybe in terms of execution speed, pricing platform you kind of, you name it and how that benefits your mortgage partners? And along those lines, how does that positioning and some of the advantages are bringing into that market influence the gain on sale margin in that segment kind of above and beyond the overall mortgage market influences on the margin? Thank you so much.\nJay Farner: Well, I would say, as we think about our partner network which is large and growing, both the branded partnerships that we've accomplished with Charles Schwab, State Farm, Intuit. But another partnership we referenced today that will be talking more about as we get into 2021. They are incredibly important, they reflect margin that is between maybe your traditional third-party and direct-to-consumer, which is certainly beneficial. And they leverage our brand. And that's the unique thing also about the third-party channel that you're talking about brokers, and I think the uniqueness that we bring to the table, not only our process and our technology, but now as we've rebranded to Rocket Pro TPO, we are giving the brand that is so highly regarded in the industry and allowing these brokers to leverage that. I think I also referenced something that they set us apart, whatever is best for our clients, we want to help them achieve that and so we were able to offer 10,000 purchase leads to our GPO partners here as we rolled out the new Rocket Pro platform and we'll be able to continue to do that. And so those brokers have the advantage of using great technology, allowing their client to access the process that has won the 11th JD Power Award in a role for loan origination. And now, leverage the brand that people know and trust and received lead flow to allow them to grow their businesses as well. So when we think about that space, we're really focusing on all of those things that we can do to continue to grow and also differentiate ourselves from kind of the traditional players in that space.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Roswell from RBC. Your line is open.\nMatt Roswell: Yes, thank you very much for taking my question. I was wondering if we could think about the expense side going into the fourth quarter. And is there any sort of seasonality we should be aware of, or anything as we kind of think about adjusted EBITDA?\nJulie Booth: Yes. While we don't give guidance on expenses going into the fourth quarter, certainly, we will see the variable expenses vary every quarter with production, but there is nothing in particular that we're looking at in Q4 that is I think I've noted as we think at half year. So nothing really special to comment on, as we look ahead.\nMatt Roswell: Okay. And then a bigger picture question. However, probably the efforts going into sort of the non-mortgage loans going for you so busy in the mortgage space that you're not really focused that much going into auto and personal?\nJay Farner: We're very focused on that. And this is one of the key strengths of our platform, not only is the technology, the client base to brand, but also the leadership. And so our ability to leverage our leadership across those areas both real estate, Rocket Homes, Rocket Auto and Rocket Loans is going very well. I know we're not providing guidance right now on those businesses, but when we think about 2021, we're looking at businesses that will see substantial growth. [Audit Ends]\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Arren Cyganovich from Citi. Your line is open.\nArren Cyganovich: Thanks. Maybe you just touched a little bit on your expansion plans into Canada and how that's progressing and I guess what your thoughts are in terms of the proportion of mortgage production you would expect to get over the next couple of years?\nJay Farner: Yes, we're very excited about the work that we're doing in Canada. I know we released here in the last week or two that we made an acquisition of a company called Finmo to partner with Lendesk. And so that really allows a deeper direct access to the mortgage brokers in Canada. And our focus today is really developing the best tech process between the broker and the lender and so that Finmo acquisition was critical, I've seen a lot of positive response from both the brokerage community in Canada. And so just things are going as planned and we continue to develop out that technology. It's the areas right for disruption and between Lendesk and Finmo. I believe we're bringing an experience that no one else is to the table.\nArren Cyganovich: Thanks. And then on the back on the share repurchased authorization. This is something that you intend to use on a regular basis or is this more kind of episodic whenever you see opportunities in your stock or a bit too much excess capital?\nJay Farner: Yes. So I think this is goes back to the broader concept of there just how we're going to handle capital allocation and so remember got a 35-year track record here I think of allocating capital in a pretty strategic manner as Julie touched on our first priority is always ensure and we've got a very strong balance sheet, our business is well capitalized and then making sure we're investing in our business for us, there's never been a better return than investing those dollars back into our business, whether it's spending the dollars on marketing to grow that brand spending the dollars on, technology to continue to grow that platform that we've been able to leverage, clearly we're always considering different M&A activities. And then, finally, a special dividend that we've talked about. We did that as a privately held organization from time to time about it, we're public another way for us to help of course shareholders is to repurchase our shares and I think that was an important move that the Board made, we're going to be thoughtful and disciplined but as always opportunistic, we have a strong feeling about the value of our organization and if there is an opportunity to buy back shares that we think are undervalued and will do so.\nOperator: Your next question comes from all of Mark DeVries from Barclays. Your line is open.\nMark DeVries: Thank you. Is there any color you can provide us today on the percentage of blocks you're getting from refi versus purchase and also kind of broken down by your two channels?\nJulie Booth: Yes, that it is not something that we have disclosed in the past, I think, we disclosed our mix in our S1 kind of for 2019 it and what that looks like, but that is something where we're still seeing very strong purchase demand here and something that we're very focused on. So we're just not just closing right now the mix between now in the channel.\nMark DeVries: Okay. Second question, maybe similar response that, what percentage of your Title business are you capturing from originations and how high do you think that can ultimately go? And are you generating third-party business there?\nJay Farner: Yes, I don't think we disclose the percentages, but as I referenced before our Amrock had, it's a record quarter as well. And so, a significant portion of the Title that we do here is we leverage to Amrock and they also have a robust third-party Title business that is not based on Rocket Mortgage -- amounts. But we don't give specific -- by percentages.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jack Micenko from SIG. Your line is open.\nJack Micenko: Hey, wanted to revisit the buyback versus the special dividend, pretty in-flow the buybacks, maybe half of the shares that are trying to currently trading. What was the thought process between maybe a buyback or a special dividend. At this point?\nJay Farner: I think really just, what's the best opportunity for us. If we see the stock price dropped to a place that we think is advantageous, the better reduced our capital will be to buy that those shares back.\nJack Micenko: Okay. And then, I'm looking at the marketing spend, it grew, as a percent of revenue and I know you guys are pretty consistent with your marketing spend was there, was there anything, this quarter, as you think about the spend there and the timing maybe in the spring selling, '21 or was it just you just kind of a mismatch the spend versus the revenue or are you making a conscious effort to really deploy more of this elevated revenue into marketing while it's available to you?\nJay Farner: Well, as we've talked about for a long period of time, if there is a marketing dollars, that can be spent that is profitable, especially on the first transaction, we will spend it because the lifetime value of that client is multiples more than the initial revenue that we've been profit that we generate in the first transaction. We also, of course, increased media costs as we went into this quarter with the election and I'm sure you are watching the television, listen the radios and going in line as much of that was and it was hard to see an add that wasn't related to the election. So that brought cost of a bit for us as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bose George from KBW. Your line is open.\nBose George: Hey, good afternoon, if you can give the recapture rates on borrowers who are paying off loans to make a purchase transaction and I was just wondering does that work into the retention metrics?\nJay Farner: No, I don't think we give the specific number for that. But I will share with you as we think about the broader ecosystem Rocket Homes plays a critical role in providing to our mortgage clients, the homes they can afford, the equity that they have in their home and even getting them what we call Rocket ready or verified approval. And so someone in our servicing portfolio whose then demonstrating behavior, looking at homes in there [indiscernible] that verified approval gives us a heads up or trigger to be able to work with that client to ensure that we're bringing them back from a purchase perspective as well. And so that's why this robust ecosystem is so important to us.\nBose George: Okay. Great, thanks. And then, actually the, in terms of. I wanted to ask about G&A buyouts. Is that contributing much to earnings and with the kind of size, that is a potential?\nJulie Booth: Yes. We have done some Ginnie Mae buyouts, and you can see that we have borrowed on our line of credit on our balance sheet, but it is an opportunity that we're continuing to evaluate for right now that is the amount that we're going to do is kind of what you see in our balance sheet there about $250 million so far.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nDon Fandetti: Hi, good evening. I was just wondering if there's been a lot of activities with the non-banks staff. I'm just curious, I don't know you also want to take market share, I'm Just curious if you thought the competitive dynamic, if that will change competition and then also what you're seeing from some of the large banks?\nJay Farner: Well, we do see other folks who participate in the mortgage and real estate space, thinking about going public. I think when we think of Rocket Companies in our focus on helping consumers with some of the most exciting experience as they have in their life, whether it's buying a home or refinancing their home or buying a car, we think we're uniquely positioned. Obviously we've talked a lot about brand here today, we've become the household name when it comes to thinking about a great high quality mortgage or now real estate experience, it's spending nearly $900 million close to $1 billion in marketing. Also let me think about the client service we're providing, reference JD Power awards a few times here, but we think that the separates us from others that may be in a similar situation. And then of course the dollars that we're able to invest in the technology to grow this platform and separate us from others, we've now 2 million clients on our servicing book with the retention rate, north of 90% with a recapture rate that's 4.5 times, the industry according to Black Knight and watching this base grow, how we think about this fintech platform that we feel the growth that we're seeing, we think that's quite a bit different than some other folks that may be in the space doing mortgages.\nDon Fandetti: Thank you.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Henry Coffey from Wedbush. Your line is open.\nHenry Coffey: Yes, good evening and thank you for taking my question. I know on the last call, you talked about your objectives in terms of building capacity for next year. Maybe you could talk about that a little bit more and depending on where the refi and the purchase money market falls out? How do you see that affecting your channel mix between the independent -- between the brokers that partner network and your direct retail origination?\nJay Farner: While the progress is going very well. As you look at the close volume that we were able to achieve in Q3 and our projections for Q4, the technology to allow us to that our target goal has been 25% of a normalized mortgage market. So that's a $2 trillion, give or take, which would be $525 billion [ph] at just about 40 years or so $1 billion a month. And so from a technology perspective, from an operations perspective, the platform is performing incredibly well. When we think about the future and we talk about this a lot we touched on the realtor.com partnership, we've talked about another very large partnership that we'll be announcing with more detail in 2021. We've talked about the rollout of Rocket Pro TPO giving brokers that brand in that technology. All of these things will allow us to continue to lean into the marketing, grow share regardless interest rate condition. And so we just continue on our path building all of the right long-term strategies to allow the company to achieve that long-term goal of 25% market share by 2030.\nHenry Coffey: Just kind of a second question is not really related, but what about the other areas, how is that playing Auto and direct lending. We saw a whole other follow that you've talked about so much and with that, I'll say thank you for taking my question.\nJay Farner: Well, as I touched on before, I do not providing guidance, but I can state that much like the mortgage platform building out the different channels in our real estate from Rocket Homes which now millions of visitors a month. Our for sale by owner platform, the Rocket Auto platform, all of those things are going as planned and we are very excited about the growth we've seen here in Q3, and even more excited about the growth that we believe do experience in the future.\nJulie Booth: I just have one quick -- one. I'm sorry...\nJay Farner: Go ahead, Julie.\nBob Walters: Want to clarify\u2026\nJulie Booth: The only thing I wanted to make sure that I did clarify here, looking sure earlier the question regarding the share repurchase plan, the question was regarding D or D shares. So I just want to clarify since the share repurchase plan applies to both A and D shares.\nJay Farner: Thank you. Thank you, Julie.\nJason McGruder: Well, great. We appreciate everyone joining today. And I think that's going to wrap up the questions, but thank you so much for taking the time.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference call. Thank you everybody for joining. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Julie Booth",
            "content": "Thank you, Jay, and good afternoon everyone. Thanks to the hard work of the entire Rocket Companies team we achieved another quarter of incredible results. In the third quarter, we achieved year-over-year quarterly adjusted revenue growth of 163% to $4.7 billion and adjusted net income growth of 365% to $2.4 billion. We also produced another quarterly record in close loan volume, which was up a 122% year-over-year to $89 billion. Based on what banks and mortgage lenders have publicly reported, we believe that our closed loan volume growth was substantially higher than the overall industry in the three and nine months ended September 2020 compared to a year earlier. We generated record quarterly net rate lock volume of $94.7 billion, which represented a gain of 101% year-over-year. As a reminder, we recognized revenue at the time when we lock the interest rate with our client. Rate lock typically occurs approximately 30 to 45 days prior to the closing of a loan. We produced robust growth in both of our segments. Funded loan volume in our direct-to-consumer channel was up by 131% to $53.5 billion, an increase in our partner network by 127% to $29.6 billion both compared with the year-earlier quarter. We consider a loan funded when it is sold to investors on the secondary market. While we continue to benefit from the low interest rate environment. we also produced strong year-over-year growth in the quarter from less rate sensitive products. Demand for these products are driven by factors including clients wanting to purchase a home take cash out of their homes, reduce the terms on their mortgages, changes in their life situations and the demand for Investment Properties. Although rate term refinancing activity has been very high in 2020, we have historically had a balanced mix of origination. For example, from the first quarter of 2017 through the third quarter 2020 more than half, our overall volume was [indiscernible] are less rate sensitive products. Gain on sale margin of 4.52% increased substantially from 3.29% in the prior year period and remained strong by historical standards. The sequential change from record gain on sale margins of 5.19% in the second quarter was driven primarily by changes in channel and product mix. As a reminder, record gain on sale margins in the second quarter, reflecting our ability to rapidly scale, our direct-to-consumer volume during a period of pandemic related market disruption, particularly during April and May. Breaking down the 67 basis point variance and gain on sale margins sequentially, changes in loan pricing represented less than 10 basis points of the quarter-over-quarter difference in our gain on sale margins. Approximately 40 basis points of the change resulted from differences in channel and product mix, particularly the strong growth of our partner network volume during the quarter. Overall, our margins exceeded the high end of our expectations and remained at historically elevated level throughout the third quarter. In the past, we have typically seen primary, secondary spreads normalized within a month or two. However since March, these spreads have remained well above historical averages. We believe this speaks to the strength of demand in the current environment as you heard from Jay. Managing gain on sale margins is an important advantage of the Rocket Mortgage business model, our centralized technology driven operating model allows us to dynamically price our products on a real-time basis. As the largest mortgage lender in the country, we also benefit from the scale and sophistication of our capital markets capabilities, including superior hedging, proving and secondary market execution. Client retention is another key differentiator, of the Rocket Companies ecosystem. We've spoken to many of you about our ability to recapture clients who pay off out of our servicing portfolio, because of our unique business model, our recapture is more than 4 times the industry average based on the latest figures from Black Knight. Today, we are also introducing a new metric called our net client retention rate. This metric is intended to be comparable with retention figures across multiple industries, including cable and wireless service providers. Our new metric is calculated based on the clients who remain active with Rocket as a percentage of the total starting client base. As we show in today's press release, our net client retention rate has consistently and about 90% over the past few years. Retention at these levels, drive substantial lifetime value advantages for the company. Our high net retention rate allowed us to benefit from the continued cash flow from our servicing portfolio and also have the opportunity to hear out with our clients in the businesses throughout our ecosystem. This metric reflects the high lifetime value of our portfolio. The unique strength of our business is that when the net client retention rate fall, it is generally the result of lower interest rates, leading to higher refinance activity, because our recapture rate is 4.6 times the industry average, we generate even more revenue from increased loan origination volume. Our [indiscernible] as a natural hedge to our retention rate. In the current environment, we are driving strong repeat transaction activity, which represented 42% of overall mortgage volume in the third quarter. We are also adding hundreds of thousands of new clients into our ecosystem creating and expanding foundation for future growth. Our total Q3 expenses increased by 46% year-over-year primarily driven by higher variable compensation and an increase in team members in production roles to support our growth. Turning to our balance sheet. We remain in a strong liquidity position, with total liquidity of $6.9 billion, which included $3.5 billion of cash as of quarter end. We define total liquidity as cash and cash equivalents plus bond drawn NSR lines, undrawn unsecured lines of credit and self-funded mortgages that can be transferred to our funding facilities out our option. These figures reflect the strong underlying cash generation of the company and our recent issuance of $2 billion in senior notes at substantially lower interest rates then the notes refinanced. After the end of the quarter, we repaid the $1.25 billion of senior notes due 2025. Overall, we are extremely proud of our long-term track record of delivering profitable growth at scale and our record performance in the quarter and year-to-date. To illustrate, just how amount of our scale, is the company has been consistently profitable on an annual basis. Having generated double-digit GAAP pre-tax income margins every year from 2015 through 2019. Over just the first nine months of 2020, we produced approximately $6.6 billion in GAAP pre-tax income, which represented a dramatic improvement compared with a year earlier. Our strategic objective remains to achieve 25% market share of the mortgage market by 20-30 while continuing to generate industry leading profitability over the long run. To achieve these long-term objectives, we are investing in our brand and technology, so that we can profitably grow through all market environment. For example, over the 12 months ended September 30th, 2020, we leveraged more than $500 million invested in technology and are approximately 2,900 technology team members to further increase monthly loan production capacity and enhance efficiency, including some of the enhancements Jay discussed. We also invested approximately $900 million in marketing over the same timeframe. Moving on to our outlook, we currently are [ph] expect closed loan volume of between $88 billion and $93 billion or an increase of 73% to 83% compared to $50.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019. We expect net rate lock volume of between $80 billion and $87 million, which would represent an increase of 82% to 98% compared to $43.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019. And we expect, gain on sale margins of 3.8% to 4.1% which would be an improvement of 11% to 20% compared to 3.41% in the fourth quarter of 2019. Lastly, the company's Board of Directors approved a $1 billion share repurchase program effective today. The authorization reflects the Board and senior leaderships confidence in Rocket Companies long-term prospects. The program gives us the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities if we believe the market is undervaluing our business. We are committed to using our substantial cash generation to create long-term value for our shareholders. With that, we are ready to turn it back to the operator for questions. Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. And in Q3, our gain on sale margins exceeded our expectations and remained elevated by historical standards. So our margins have remained elevated for longer than expected. If you look at their changes I mentioned from Q2 to Q3, changing the loan pricing, represented less than 10 basis points of that variance channel and product mix were the biggest drivers of this variance and about 40 basis points of this net resulted from our strong partner network growth that we saw during Q3. So as we head into Q4 margins are still strong by historical standards, and they're continuing to stay elevated, we think that demand that we're going to continue to see with 70% of folks able to refinance and the amount of repairs volume, that you take that into the next couple of years, if there are 6 or 7 trillion out there ready to be refinanced, that is something that's going to take years to work through, which will continue to elevate that demand, we believe going into the upcoming years. And so we feel really good about where our gain on sale margins and volumes heading here into the fourth quarter. Yes. I can just answer generally, no, the D shares are not eligible for repurchase. This would be a Class A share repurchase program that we have announced. Yes, sure. If we look back, how can we kind of look at maybe more normalized, gain on sale margins, you'll see our direct-to-consumer margins have clinched [ph] between 400 basis points and 450 basis points. And then on the partner network side of things, probably between 100 basis points and 150 basis points if you look back over time. So I think as I mentioned that the demand that we're seeing now will continue to probably have a nice upward impact on those margins relative to the sort of historical levels that we have seen in to this upcoming year, how long that will last, you know it's just to be seen. But like I said, there is quite a lot of demand still out there into the upcoming years. Yes. While we don't give guidance on expenses going into the fourth quarter, certainly, we will see the variable expenses vary every quarter with production, but there is nothing in particular that we're looking at in Q4 that is I think I've noted as we think at half year. So nothing really special to comment on, as we look ahead. Yes, that it is not something that we have disclosed in the past, I think, we disclosed our mix in our S1 kind of for 2019 it and what that looks like, but that is something where we're still seeing very strong purchase demand here and something that we're very focused on. So we're just not just closing right now the mix between now in the channel. Yes. We have done some Ginnie Mae buyouts, and you can see that we have borrowed on our line of credit on our balance sheet, but it is an opportunity that we're continuing to evaluate for right now that is the amount that we're going to do is kind of what you see in our balance sheet there about $250 million so far. I just have one quick -- one. I'm sorry... The only thing I wanted to make sure that I did clarify here, looking sure earlier the question regarding the share repurchase plan, the question was regarding D or D shares.

            "name": "Jay Farner",
            "content": "Good afternoon and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. I'm pleased to report Rocket Companies six consecutive quarter of record-breaking volume, highlighting the power of our platform and the strength of the Rocket brand. We're demonstrating true leadership at a critical time for our industry and our clients. I'm extremely proud of our 22,000 plus team members whose dedication and drive have helped deliver the results, we will share with you today. First I want to congratulate our team on being named the number one company for client satisfaction in mortgage origination by JD Power yesterday. This marks our 11th straight year being named to the top of the list. And when you add in our seven consecutive number one rankings for mortgage servicing we've taken home 18 JD Power awards in the last 11 years. This one in particular special to us however, it's proof that our platform is so powerful that we can more than double loan originations year-over-year and still deliver on our commitment to servicing our clients at the highest levels. Again team, congratulations. Our industry has reached an important moment. The COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed the way Americans think of their homes. For decades, many of you -- there house as their most important investment. Today, home in so much more. It is now, where we work, where we teach our children and where we gather with friends. Bringing new meaning and significance to the place where we live, our home. This enthusiasm around the value of home is clear in the numbers. For instance, the National Association of Realtors existing home sales report, show that September sales of previously owned homes were more than 20% higher than the same month in 2019. Also, recent reports in the New York Times and San Francisco Chronicle, tell residents moving from the city centers to buy homes in the surrounding suburbs in search of more space. Homeownership is on the rise across the country led by a new generation of first time homebuyers. As a result of shifting demographics and the ongoing pandemic, we are seeing a rapid acceleration in the long-term shift from physical to digital transactions across the industries where we participate. Consumers today don't just prefer -- they demand a completely digital experience. [Audit Start] At the same time, the digital transformation of the lending process has become more important than ever. As an unprecedented number of consumers look to leverage today's favorable interest rates, we are seeing the strongest growth among our most digitally engaged clients, application volume through our self-serve digital experience has grown significantly faster than overall volume year-to-date. This trend accelerated earlier this year and continued through the third quarter. The Rocket Mortgage platform is particularly powerful for first time homebuyers, who can receive loan approvals within minutes. In the third quarter, we delivered more purchase approval letters through our digital experience than in any quarter in our company's history. In addition to becoming the overwhelming choice for millennial homebuyers, Rocket Mortgage has continued to serve a large number of clients looking to take cash out of their homes, reduce their loan terms or refinance due to changes in life situations such as divorce. These clients who are not rate sensitive, remain an important population when you consider Rocket Companies incredible footprint, serving all 50 states and more than 3,100 counties in the United States, and a growing presence in Canada. Our marketplace has reached a significant inflection point due to consumers demanding a simple digital experience. And I'm proud to say Rocket Mortgage is executing at enormous scale. In the third quarter, we delivered a record performance with $89 billion of closed loan volume, representing a 122% increase year-over-year. The growth we're achieving is unmatched. In Q3, we added nearly $50 billion of year-over-year closed loan volume. Consider this, our incremental volume in the third quarter is so large, that if alone would have made us the second largest retail mortgage lender in the nation. To further illustrate the scale of this growth, Rocket Mortgage closed nearly $1 billion of origination volume each day in the third quarter. The scale and efficiency of our platform continues to drive substantial earnings power. We achieved a 69% adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter and have generated $5.9 billion of adjusted net income in just the first nine months of 2020. The guidance that Julie will share with you today assumes us among the most profitable FinTech companies in the world. And we're not stopping there. Our mission is simple. We will continue to lead from the front as the most admired brand and technology platform in our industry. Recently, we hosted tech TechCon our in-house technology conference for all Rocket Companies technologists drawing more than 4,000 of the brightest minds in the industry. One of the most important topics covered was ethical artificial intelligence and its ever-increasing role in business. We crossed an important milestone in Q3 by generating more than $60 billion in application volume over the last two years using data science and AI. Our data science teams are now generating organic lead flow at higher conversion rates than paid marketing channels. We are also using automation to improve the efficiency of our operations and are now making more than 1 million decisions per day using machine learning. All these processes get better with scale. Strengthening our competitive lead and reinforcing the Rocket Companies flywheel. In addition to leveraging our rich data insights, we continue to expand the ways we are reaching consumers through innovations, partnerships and marketing. In the last 30 days alone, we have announced enhancements to our Rocket Pro platform, that grant real estate professionals never before available insights into their clients' mortgages. Now they can help guide homebuyers through the mortgage process from approval to closing using the Rocket Pro mobile app or website. Rather than calling one of our mortgage bankers we're asking the client real estate agents can now use Rocket Pro insight to check in on a loan status, that leaves more time for Mortgage Bankers to help other home buyers and the agent can focus on showing and closing houses with their clients. The reaction from those in the real estate community has been overwhelming. In fact, in the first day, more than 1,100 agents joined Rocket Pro Insights, and the momentum has only increased. We anticipate nearly 15,000 real estate professionals will sign up to use the platform by the end of the year, providing a significant touch point with one of the largest influencers in the home purchase lifecycle. Another program to help both home buyers and their agents was launched in early October. We checked off a new relationship with Realtor.com that allows the tens of millions of homebuyers visiting their website to seamlessly apply for a Rocket Mortgage. The new venture was quickly followed by an announcement highlighting Rocket Mortgage's partnership with Intuit's Mint Personal Finance tool. Now Mint users can easily import their personal financial information into a Rocket Mortgage loan application with the tap of the finger, allowing them to lock in a mortgage rate and as little as eight minutes all while staying in the Mint app. Quicken Loans Mortgage Services, which serves the needs of our mortgage broker partners recently rebranded to Rocket Pro TPO. This transition allows our partners to continue to meet the needs of their clients, while also providing them with the ability to leverage the best-known brand in consumer lending with Rocket Mortgage. To celebrate, we provided 10,000 fresh purchase leads to a Rocket Pro TPO partners. Something that's never been done before in the industry. As part of the rebranding. We've also announced new AI and machine learning innovations in partnership with Google technology. Additional tech focused enhancements to our platform and new ways to align with and support our brokers. Overall, the feedback we've received about the rebrands and technology rollouts has been extremely positive. In addition to all the fantastic partnerships we've already shared with you. We are proud to announce that as of last week, we have forged a relationship with one of the largest financial services companies in the world. This collaboration, similar to the program, we created with Charles Schwab will allow us to originate mortgages for a new base of clients. We anticipate that we'll share more information in the New Year. Our exceptional brand marketing also continues to be a true differentiator in the industry. Our Rocket can [ph] campaign has been incredibly successful. We're proud to soon be rolling out a new slate of ads, including our first exclusively targeting the growing what next community. We continue to also leverage well known talent like Jason Momoa, star of our Super Bowl ad. And Future NFL, Hall of Fame wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald in our marketing to appeal to a broad consumer base. The fact is Rocket Companies is leveraging the scale and flexibility of our platform to deliver first to market innovations with the best partnerships in real estate, technology and finance. All while reinforcing our brand with best-in-class marketing. Outside of mortgage, innovation is taking place throughout our entire ecosystem. In the last several months, Nexus, our title and closing technology company announced it had partnered with insurance leaders, Farmers and Lemonade to simplify homeowners insurance verifications using it's Clear HOI platform. These companies joined others including all State and Liberty Mutual in helping provide a digital solution to lenders looking to confirm the presence of an insurance policy in a real-time, eliminating the need to manually call to confirm a process that is deceptively tedious. At Amrock, our Title company, we closed more than 100,000 mortgage transactions in September, a record that proves the scalability of our platform. In addition, Amrock continues to be a trailblazer, digitizing the title industry, much like Rocket Mortgage did for loan originations. In the first three quarters of 2020, the company is responsible for 90% of all eClosings in the industry, providing safety and convenience to our clients amid the ongoing pandemic. [Audit End] Additionally, Amrock is implementing machine learning and ethical AI into its workflow, through its proprietary titled decision engine or TDE. This tool, which is currently being used on more than 30% of Amrock tunnel work automates the traditionally manual process of reviewing documents, maps and records of sale cutting down the time, our team members working on files by nearly 70%. This frees us up to work on other more specialized items significantly increasing our productivity. Finally, I'd like to take a moment to talk about our approach to client retention and increasingly important driver of our business. After we originate alone we maintain monthly touch points with our clients and generate recurring revenue by processing their payments and servicing their loan over its lifetime. Julie will give more detail in a moment, but we are sharing today that Rocket Mortgage consistently retains over 90% of our total servicing clients on an annual basis. Retention at these levels, has never been seen in the mortgage business and rivals any subscription-based model across industries including cable, streaming and wireless services. Before I turn things over to Julie. I wanted to announce an addition to our Board of Directors. Our Board has voted unanimously to make Jonathan Mariner, the Founder and President of TaxDay, an Independent Board member and new Chair of our Audit Committee. Prior to TaxDay, Jonathan spend 23 years in professional sports serving as the Chief Financial Officer for Major League Baseball, the Florida Marlins, the Florida Panthers and Dolphins Stadium. In addition to our Board. He also serves as an Independent Board Member for Tyson Foods, McGraw-Hill Education, Major League [ph] baseball and several others. We are very excited to have him join us. And with that, I'll ask Julie to share with you the details of our financial performance in this quarter. Julie? Yes, thanks for the question. I know we talked a lot about this during the IPO process and Bob Walters in particular about our recapture capabilities, which are now LNG [ph] references north of 4.5 times the industry average. So if someone's going to be paying off on our portfolio, we are recapturing that client, which is great because it generates very good revenue for us. And that recapture rate is one of the reasons we can, we were able to have this very high retention rate. And you just touched on it when the retention rate is high. Of course of these longer client lifetimes and when you think about the lifetime value of a client more opportunity to help them with the refinance, some opportunity ultimately to purchase, more opportunity to help them with other products such as auto or personal loans, and --, I think something different for us, but we benefit from out of a lot of other retention type businesses that were profitable on the first transaction as you saw today very profitable. But if this is actually even more unique for us because in our business, when the retention rate rises, you're probably looking at increased interest rates. And so as a servicer we collecting those monthly payments will also having the ability to market to those clients for other services, but if rates are falling and we might see the retention rate drop a bit, the rate today here in the low '90s, which is still incredible. We're still benefiting because of that recapture rate allows us to generate significant revenue on the refinance of their mortgage, so in retention rate and the recapture rate work together, but also like a natural hedge, I think Julie referenced that really allows us to win -- and whether interest rates are rising or interest rates are falling. And that really supports that broader ecosystem that we're building, as I touched on before, keeping the client in our ecosystem to be able to offer additional products and services to them, that's how like, it is think about it. Yes. And thanks again for the question. As I referenced in the comments on the call here, the demand for the digital experience is stronger than ever and we're seeing significant growth there, and in particular for us on the purchase side. So were talking about millennials, we're talking about folks who've been thinking about buying a home, and as I touched on COVID is really driven these clients are accelerated their desire to be home owners moving from urban centers into suburban places and looking for home purchase in fact, I think Q3 was the strongest one of our strongest purchase quarters and we issued more verifiable approval letters declines in Q3 than any other quarter in our company's history. So that's one way that we engage that client early on in their life cycle. And then I'd like you to think about the Rocket Auto business that we are excited about because that also tends to skew to a younger demographic, and so if Mortgage or home isn't the initial purchase loan or Auto may be. And so all of those initiatives in our ecosystem that we're working on, allow us to start that relationship building with the younger client base, that then will retain for 20, 30, 40 years to come. Yes, thanks for the question. I believe Julie referenced this as we think about the investments that we've made here in the last 12 months, $500 million when it comes to our now nearly 3,000 technologist and the platform that we've been building. I think the best example that I can give you is that the growth year-over-year. If we look at the first nine months of '19, I think $94 billion closed. Now, we look at $213 billion in the same nine-month period in 2020. $94 billion is a huge base, the largest lender in the country and now more than doubling that demonstrates the power of that platform and those investments that we've made in technology across the board. So we talked about some of the more recent rollouts one, I'll draw your attention to is the Rocket Pro Insight platform that's giving real estate agents real time updates on the status of their clients mortgage, and that's important to them, of course because they feel in control, it's very important that loan closes, but it also frees up time for our team members to now will focus on the next loan making us more efficient versus taking those calls, it also allows the recession to drive referral business into our platform. Another one that I believe Julie referenced is the mid-partnership we've been partners with into it for a long period of time, but we been working hand-in-hand to have a fully integrated Rocket Mortgage experience in the mid-experience for their clients they don't have to leave that app and we've launched at now and not only does that allow us to provide that experience to mid-users, but the APIs that were built, we can leverage across additional partnerships. I know another one that we referenced it's been tech investment for us is the partnership into realtor.com where we're reaching now tens of millions of prospective homebuyers. And again that takes that takes good strong growth from our technology team to be able to do that. On the internal side maybe other things that are less evident. A significant portion of our underwriting process has been leveraging ethical AI as we talked about machine learning a lot of our decisions around verifications of assets, a verifications employment, verification of insurance is now done using automated systems. In fact, I think we referenced that there are over 1 million decisions each day, they are not automated all bringing great efficiency to our platform, which is what makes it so scalable. The real product, -- partnership represents yet another example of us be integrating our platform into their experience. And so we started that process, but the sky's the limit and what that integration can look like when you think to, think of the data and information we have about home values in markets, the real estate connections that the restage of connections that they have the equity information that we have about a 2 million plus folks in our servicing book. And so what we're really trying to create there is a seamless process from the very moment that you think about purchasing home until closing the home. And so the real reagent the mortgage approval, Amrock Title business, Nexus and we are closing the eClosing platforms that we've built. This is just a great way for us to wrap that altogether in create a very unique and best-in-class experience for our clients and for realtor.com clients. Yes, great question Ryan. Julie touched on over the last 2.5 plus years when you look at the volume breakdown of that for the kind of the reason for a refinance or a loan between purchase and cash out and in term changes and life changes like divorce more than 50% of our production is really not interest rate sensitive. So that's a critical component, we demonstrated that for years, and that will continue to happen also, when we look at the clients that could save a substantial amount of money here in this environment and we're still in a situation, I believe we're 70% of the folks out there it makes sense to refinance. So we feel very good about the continued strength in demand, not only on the refinance side but on the home purchase side, home ownership is back to kind of pre-crisis levels. And as I referenced before Millennials are very focused on home ownership moving from urban areas. It was great welcome news that the vaccine or a vaccine may be on its way. But we don't believe this will alter the course that has been set now for more work-from-home, leveraging the home for family and work in all of those things all things bode very well for homeownership. And so we imagine that will continue. And I think as Julie gave for guidance for Q4, really what you're looking at, if you back out a little bit of pressure we saw in October due to marketing spend for the election, which of course makes a little bit more challenging for us from a marketing perspective. And the fact that Q4 has four, five fewer what I'll call actionable business day as you know, the day before Thanksgiving, the day before Christmas Eve, which can be a bit more challenging. If you back that out and looked at what we're forecasting for production in Q4., it's very, very similar to what we accomplished in Q3. And as you touched on, this is where our ability to reach into the market leveraging whether it's our partners at Schwab, realtor.com meant or our go-to-partners along with leading into our direct-to-consumer advertising. It really positions us to grow market share when others are pulling back because of site, changes in interest rate. Yes. That's probably a question, Julie - you want to field that or you want to push that to a different time. Well, I would say, as we think about our partner network which is large and growing, both the branded partnerships that we've accomplished with Charles Schwab, State Farm, Intuit. But another partnership we referenced today that will be talking more about as we get into 2021. They are incredibly important, they reflect margin that is between maybe your traditional third-party and direct-to-consumer, which is certainly beneficial. And they leverage our brand. And that's the unique thing also about the third-party channel that you're talking about brokers, and I think the uniqueness that we bring to the table, not only our process and our technology, but now as we've rebranded to Rocket Pro TPO, we are giving the brand that is so highly regarded in the industry and allowing these brokers to leverage that. I think I also referenced something that they set us apart, whatever is best for our clients, we want to help them achieve that and so we were able to offer 10,000 purchase leads to our GPO partners here as we rolled out the new Rocket Pro platform and we'll be able to continue to do that. And so those brokers have the advantage of using great technology, allowing their client to access the process that has won the 11th JD Power Award in a role for loan origination. And now, leverage the brand that people know and trust and received lead flow to allow them to grow their businesses as well. So when we think about that space, we're really focusing on all of those things that we can do to continue to grow and also differentiate ourselves from kind of the traditional players in that space. We're very focused on that. And this is one of the key strengths of our platform, not only is the technology, the client base to brand, but also the leadership. And so our ability to leverage our leadership across those areas both real estate, Rocket Homes, Rocket Auto and Rocket Loans is going very well. I know we're not providing guidance right now on those businesses, but when we think about 2021, we're looking at businesses that will see substantial growth. [Audit Ends] Yes, we're very excited about the work that we're doing in Canada. I know we released here in the last week or two that we made an acquisition of a company called Finmo to partner with Lendesk. And so that really allows a deeper direct access to the mortgage brokers in Canada. And our focus today is really developing the best tech process between the broker and the lender and so that Finmo acquisition was critical, I've seen a lot of positive response from both the brokerage community in Canada. And so just things are going as planned and we continue to develop out that technology. It's the areas right for disruption and between Lendesk and Finmo. I believe we're bringing an experience that no one else is to the table. Yes. So I think this is goes back to the broader concept of there just how we're going to handle capital allocation and so remember got a 35-year track record here I think of allocating capital in a pretty strategic manner as Julie touched on our first priority is always ensure and we've got a very strong balance sheet, our business is well capitalized and then making sure we're investing in our business for us, there's never been a better return than investing those dollars back into our business, whether it's spending the dollars on marketing to grow that brand spending the dollars on, technology to continue to grow that platform that we've been able to leverage, clearly we're always considering different M&A activities. And then, finally, a special dividend that we've talked about. We did that as a privately held organization from time to time about it, we're public another way for us to help of course shareholders is to repurchase our shares and I think that was an important move that the Board made, we're going to be thoughtful and disciplined but as always opportunistic, we have a strong feeling about the value of our organization and if there is an opportunity to buy back shares that we think are undervalued and will do so. Yes, I don't think we disclose the percentages, but as I referenced before our Amrock had, it's a record quarter as well. And so, a significant portion of the Title that we do here is we leverage to Amrock and they also have a robust third-party Title business that is not based on Rocket Mortgage -- amounts. But we don't give specific -- by percentages. I think really just, what's the best opportunity for us. If we see the stock price dropped to a place that we think is advantageous, the better reduced our capital will be to buy that those shares back. Well, as we've talked about for a long period of time, if there is a marketing dollars, that can be spent that is profitable, especially on the first transaction, we will spend it because the lifetime value of that client is multiples more than the initial revenue that we've been profit that we generate in the first transaction. We also, of course, increased media costs as we went into this quarter with the election and I'm sure you are watching the television, listen the radios and going in line as much of that was and it was hard to see an add that wasn't related to the election. So that brought cost of a bit for us as well. No, I don't think we give the specific number for that. But I will share with you as we think about the broader ecosystem Rocket Homes plays a critical role in providing to our mortgage clients, the homes they can afford, the equity that they have in their home and even getting them what we call Rocket ready or verified approval. And so someone in our servicing portfolio whose then demonstrating behavior, looking at homes in there [indiscernible] that verified approval gives us a heads up or trigger to be able to work with that client to ensure that we're bringing them back from a purchase perspective as well. And so that's why this robust ecosystem is so important to us. Well, we do see other folks who participate in the mortgage and real estate space, thinking about going public. I think when we think of Rocket Companies in our focus on helping consumers with some of the most exciting experience as they have in their life, whether it's buying a home or refinancing their home or buying a car, we think we're uniquely positioned. Obviously we've talked a lot about brand here today, we've become the household name when it comes to thinking about a great high quality mortgage or now real estate experience, it's spending nearly $900 million close to $1 billion in marketing. Also let me think about the client service we're providing, reference JD Power awards a few times here, but we think that the separates us from others that may be in a similar situation. And then of course the dollars that we're able to invest in the technology to grow this platform and separate us from others, we've now 2 million clients on our servicing book with the retention rate, north of 90% with a recapture rate that's 4.5 times, the industry according to Black Knight and watching this base grow, how we think about this fintech platform that we feel the growth that we're seeing, we think that's quite a bit different than some other folks that may be in the space doing mortgages. While the progress is going very well. As you look at the close volume that we were able to achieve in Q3 and our projections for Q4, the technology to allow us to that our target goal has been 25% of a normalized mortgage market. So that's a $2 trillion, give or take, which would be $525 billion [ph] at just about 40 years or so $1 billion a month. And so from a technology perspective, from an operations perspective, the platform is performing incredibly well. When we think about the future and we talk about this a lot we touched on the realtor.com partnership, we've talked about another very large partnership that we'll be announcing with more detail in 2021. We've talked about the rollout of Rocket Pro TPO giving brokers that brand in that technology. All of these things will allow us to continue to lean into the marketing, grow share regardless interest rate condition. And so we just continue on our path building all of the right long-term strategies to allow the company to achieve that long-term goal of 25% market share by 2030. Well, as I touched on before, I do not providing guidance, but I can state that much like the mortgage platform building out the different channels in our real estate from Rocket Homes which now millions of visitors a month. Our for sale by owner platform, the Rocket Auto platform, all of those things are going as planned and we are very excited about the growth we've seen here in Q3, and even more excited about the growth that we believe do experience in the future. Go ahead, Julie. Thank you. Thank you, Julie."

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your speaker today, Jason McGruder, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJason McGruder: Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us for a Rocket Companies earnings call covering the second quarter of 2020, it's first as a public company. My name is Jason McGruder, and I'm the new Vice President of Investor Relations for the company. I had the opportunity to email a number of participants on this call earlier this week, and I look forward to working closely with all of you in my new role. We are excited to share the results of a terrific quarter with you. But before I turn things over to Jay Farner to get us underway, I will read the policy regarding forward-looking statements. Today's call is to provide you with information regarding our second quarter 2020 performance in addition to our financial outlook. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. For more information about factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to the earnings release that we issued today, as well as risk described in filings with the SEC, particularly in the section of these documents titled Risk Factors. Our commentary today will also include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP metric for our reported results can be found in our earnings release issued today. Please refer to our filings with the SEC for more information. And with that, I'll turn things over to Jay Farner to get us started. Jay?\nJay Farner: Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Rocket Companies second quarter earnings call, our first as a public company. Before we get started, I'd like to thank our 20,000 team members for the dedication and unwavering commitment to our clients. Because of their efforts, I'm proud to share that Rocket Companies achieved record breaking results in the second quarter. Culture is the foundation of everything we do here at Rocket Companies. Our Founder, Dan Gilbert created 19 principles known as ISMs, and they are the heart and soul of our culture and drive every decision we make. They are who we are, our DNA. Our culture has been the secret to our success over the last 35 years and the second quarter was no exception. One of those ISMs is do the right thing, a charge that we take very seriously. Earlier this year, when we saw the impacts of COVID-19 overseas, we quickly invested in the tools and technology that was needed to ensure that all our team members could effectively work from home, weeks faster than many other large businesses. This allowed us to keep our team members and community safe, while also meeting the needs of our clients as mortgage rates begin to fall. This is just one of the many examples of our company making sensible investments in the future. We spoke to many of you during the IPO process about our focus on investing for the long-term. We're extremely proud of protecting our team members and achieving record results in the second quarter, but that performance has been years in the making. Thousands of our technology team members have continuously built and refined a platform that has truly risen to the occasion, allowing us to scale to meet unprecedented demand, all while 98% of our team is working from home. It's a pleasure to be here today to talk about our second quarter results. The way we think about our business and why we believe Rocket Companies is well-positioned to capitalize on the substantial opportunities ahead. In the second quarter, Rocket Mortgage closed $72.3 billion in loan volume, more than any quarter in our 35-year history. Record low interest rates are driving demand for home loans and as we've highlighted, the power of our platform is proving a key differentiator for Rocket Mortgage. In fact, we've been able to achieve record volumes, while maintaining impressive long turn times. Industry-wide capacity constraints have led to significant gain on sale margins during the second quarter with overall margins increasing to 5.19%, up from 3.25% in the first quarter. Our ability to scale volume at these elevated margins led to substantial incremental profitability in the quarter. While second quarter gain on sale margin were certainly elevated by historical standards, this is exactly the kind of market environment we built our platform to performance. Quite simply, we're able to meet the needs of our growing client base and provide award-winning client experience. Our mortgage servicing business was a key driver of overall performance in the quarter, which Julie will talk about in a moment. I'm also proud to share that we recently earned an unprecedented seventh consecutive J.D. Power Award for Customer Satisfaction in Mortgage Servicing, an award we've won every year we've been eligible. This award is based entirely on feedback from our clients and it's an honor our team members take tremendous pride in. Turning to our broader ecosystem of businesses, we believe we have substantial opportunities to apply the same focus on client experience, technology, and operations across multiple industries. When we look at our companies holistically, Rocket Companies generated 300% year-over-year growth in adjusted revenue and $2.8 billion of adjusted net income in the second quarter. We are delivering profitable growth at substantial scale. As you continue to get to know Rocket Companies, you will also learn we are passionate about the communities where our team members work, live, and play. We are keenly aware of the role our company plays in building the American dream and how communities are the foundation of progress, education, and pride. We recently announced the very important Changing the Course initiative here in Detroit. Unfortunately, Detroit ranks last in digital connectivity among all major cities. We saw the effects of this digital divide truly manifest with the onset of COVID-19, when many of our community members found themselves without access to the technology needed to participate in telemedicine, schooling, or find a job. We knew we needed to step in and make a change. Through the Rocket Mortgage Classic, our PGA Tour event in Detroit, we have risen to the task to ensure that by 2025, every Detroiter will have access to technology within a 10-minute walk from their home. As a technology company and the largest employer in the City of Detroit, this is a program that is near and dear to all our hearts and one we look forward to bringing to life. Finally, many of you have asked us how things will change now that we're a public company. The short answer is they won't. We have many more investors today than we did as a private company, including all of our team members who once vested will become shareholders, but that doesn't affect who we are. We are committed to providing you with the same plainspoken transparency that has been a hallmark of our company. We also commit to you that we will continue intense dedication to our culture, our focus on the long-term, and our commitment to doing the right things the right way. Julie will talk more about our current outlook in just a minute. But as we look to the second half of the year, we continue to see strength and durability in consumer sentiment. Record low interest rates and an improving U.S. real estate market continue to drive demand for home loans. The purchase market, in particular, continues to recover following COVID-related disruption in the second quarter. In fact, we expect the third quarter to be one of our best for purchase origination volume ever at Rocket Mortgage. Demand for a completely digital experience has never been stronger and Rocket is delivering. With that, I'll turn things over to Julie Booth, who will take you through our second quarter results in more detail.\nJulie Booth: Thanks Jay and good afternoon, everyone. We spoke to many of you during the IPO process about the multiple drivers that we have to profitably grow our business. In the second quarter, broad-based strength across these areas led to record financial performance, highlighted by adjusted revenue of $5.3 billion and adjusted net income of $2.8 billion. Strength in both our direct-to-consumer and Partner Network channels drove record closed loan volume of $72.3 billion, an increase of 40% from the first quarter of 2020 and 126% compared to the second quarter of 2019. Closed loan volume of $46.8 billion in our direct-to-consumer channel increased to 143% year-over-year. The Partner Network also contributed strong growth with volume of $19.7 billion compared to $11.2 billion in the same period one year ago, an increase of 76%. Net rate lock volume of $92 million significantly exceeded closed loan volume in the second quarter. As a reminder, we recognized revenue at the time when we locked the interest rate with our client. Rate lock typically occurs 30 to 45 days prior to the closing of a loan. As a result, rate lock volume is a leading indicator of closed loan volume. Accelerating momentum throughout the second quarter drove elevated rate lock volume relative to closings. As Jay referenced earlier, Rocket Mortgage achieved historically strong gain on sale margins in the second quarter, with overall margins increasing to 5.19% from 3.25% in the first quarter of 2020. Gain on sale margins were strong across both channels coming in at 5.09% in the direct-to-consumer channel and 2.1% in the Partner Network. As a reminder, overall margins are measured on a rate lock basis, while segment level margins are reported on a funded loan basis. The difference in down sale margins by channel reflects the partial sharing of economics with our partners in the Partner Network. Lower client acquisition costs in the Partner Network lead to strong contribution margins across both channels. Our mortgage servicing business with an important driver of overall loan volume during the second quarter, contributing 46% of total loan volume. These repeat transactions with existing clients come with little to no client acquisition costs, leading to substantial incremental profitability. As we look to the lingering impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, approximately 5.1% of our servicing portfolio was on a forbearance plan related to COVID as of June 30th. The positive news is that we continue to see improvement in forbearance trends into the third quarter. Outside of our Rocket Mortgage business, growth in other revenue was driven by Amarok, our title insurance and settlement services business. Our investments in technology and process at Amarok paid off in the second quarter as the business was able to scale up and meet the increased demand for mortgages and the related title insurance and settlement services. Also during the second quarter, we extended our industry leading position in eClosings by deploying our remote online notarization platform, which further enables the eClosing experience. Amarok processed more than 240,000 settlement transactions during the second quarter of 2020, up 45% as compared to the first quarter of 2020, and up 171% from the second quarter of 2019. Total expenses of $1.6 billion increased 24% compared to the first quarter of 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to higher variable compensation in production costs as a result of increased origination volume. Marketing expenses declined 7% and 11% compared to the prior quarter and prior year periods, respectively. Turning to cash and liquidity, after June 30th, and prior to the IPO, Rocket Companies distributed $2.26 billion to its parent company Rock Holdings. We remain in a strong liquidity position following our IPO with total liquidity of $3.7 billion, including $1 billion of cash on hand, plus $2.7 billion of undrawn lines of credit and corporate cash used to sell fund mortgage loans, which couldn't be transferred to warehouse lines at our option. Overall, we're extremely proud of our record performance in the second quarter, demonstrating our ability to deliver profitable growth at scale. Now, I'd like to take a moment to discuss our current outlook and our approach to the investment community as a public company. The guidance philosophy we're sharing today reflects the way we think about in manage of business. As we shared with many of you during the IPO process, our long-term strategic objective is to achieve 25% share of the mortgage market. We manage the business for long-term growth and aim to continue investing in our brand and technology to all market environments. While our focus remains on the long-term, we are committed to providing transparency to our analysts and investors about the trends we are seeing in our business. Today, we are providing our current outlook for loan volume in the third quarter. Given the unique dynamics around gain on sale margins in the current environment, we are also providing our current outlook for third quarter gain on sale margins. Entering the second half of 2020, we continue to see strong consumer demand. As you've heard from Jay, we currently expect third quarter closed loan volume of $82 billion to $85 billion and net rate lock volume of $93 billion to $98 billion. Regarding gain on sale margins, we expect third quarter margins to moderate from the historically elevated levels experienced in Q2, but remain elevated relative to longer term historical averages. We currently expect third quarter gain on sale margins of 4.05% to 4.3%. Finally, for those of you thinking about updating your models, I did want to remind everyone of the normal seasonality we experienced at Rocket Mortgage, our typical pattern follows the seasonality of the U.S. real estate market, with lower sequential volumes in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. We are proud to deliver you these second quarter results and even more excited about the investments we continue to make in our platform that will guide us to our goal of 25% market share by 2030. With that, we are ready to turn it back to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJames Faucette: Great, thank you very much. I wanted to just quickly ask you the first question was around the seasonality. You talked about fourth quarter being a little bit lower. I'm wondering how we should think about that from a normal percentage basis? And are you seeing the moves in at least treasury rates, et cetera, having any impact on how you're thinking about that seasonality for the time being?\nJay Farner: Thanks James. And just to open up as our first call, just to get folks familiar with voices, this is Jay Farner, the CEO. I'll be joined by Julie Booth, our CFO, and Bob Walters, our COO. And good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for being here on our first call. Now, heading to your question, I know Julie touched on some of our guidance around Q3 and also referenced that typically we see some seasonality as we enter the fourth quarter December in particular. And Julie was referencing kind of the traditional seasonality that you might experience in housing, in particular purchase; obviously, we're in a different market right now. And I'll let Julie comment, but when it comes to kind of current expectations around interest rates or treasuries. I would say that what we're experiencing today, we anticipate we'll continue forward here through the rest of the year. Julie?\nJulie Booth: Yes, I agree Jay and certainly while we're happy to provide some guidance for Q3 really, we typically do see that that decrease in the fourth quarter and really wanted to just remind those thinking about our results, but that is kind of a typical seasonality in the business. So, I don't think we're expecting necessarily anything unusual this year, other than what we typically see. But, of course, that could always change.\nJames Faucette: That's great. And then my other question is on we talked and Julie highlighted the long-term target of 25% market share, can you help sketch out for us or how you're thinking about what that progression should look like? I mean are there going to be fits and starts or is there continuity? And are there some medium term milestones you could share with us on your marketer ambitions? Thanks a lot.\nJay Farner: Yes, thanks, James. And I'll start out here and then Julie or Bob, feel free to chime in. I think it's important we take a step back and think about strategically how we at Rocket Companies go about our planning. We obviously don't control interest rate and so for us, it's critical that we think about long-term growth over an extended period of time and then make all the right moves to make sure that we're growing and gaining market share. And so we really look at the mortgage market as roughly a $2 trillion market. There'll be years like this year where the market is much larger than that and based on our tech platform and our ability to scale, we will take advantage of that and grab far more growth in in volume than maybe we had prepared for. But year-in year-out, we look more towards a normalized market. And then we set our strategy to ensure that we're growing market share. We're growing clients throughout any interest rate market. And as you followed maybe our last 15 or 20 years that we've shared, especially over the course of the roadshow, certainly it's not a straight line for growth. There are moments in time where production may be flatter, but we're growing market share. But please understand behind the scenes, strategically, as we think about our model, direct-to-consumer, our Partner model, and now the ecosystem that we're building, that's just targeted to continue to strengthen the platform, grow the capabilities of the platform, and continually be able to grow that market share over time. And you'll see things happen like they've occurred this year where, due to interest rates, we're able to see a significant increase and where we really leverage the platform and exceed what our expectations have been. We set the strategy back in the fall of 2019. Julie, feel free to add or make comment.\nJulie Booth: No, I guess the thing that I would maybe add to that is while we do expect to see growth over the next 10 years; it really is not something that we are going to be watching on a quarterly basis. So, we may see some ups and downs when we look quarter-to-quarter. But really, we're focused on kind of that, more annualized look at market share. So, I just would encourage folks to kind of think about that when you're looking at market share quarter-after-quarter here and really thinking about how that's going to come out through the year.\nJay Farner: Yes, I think that's a critical component as we take a long-term view. There'll be times for us where opportunity to grow market share or acquire clients is the most important move, focusing less on EBITDA and more on that client growth. And Bob Walters can probably chime in on that because I think Julie pointed out a significant percentage of the loan volume that we've done this year has come from our clients -- our servicing book, and our retention rates, which is an important component of our business. And so when others are pulling away from the market, we tend to lean in because we can grow that client servicing book. Bob, I don't know if you want to touch on that just help educate everybody.\nBob Walters: Yes, I think we talked a lot about this in the road shows in one of our key differentiators for us we have a very large servicing platform. When we think about servicing quite differently than a lot of services, especially publicly-traded services that are really looking at return on capital. Now we [Indiscernible] as a retention play, and we have on our refinanced loans 80% retention, now. So our ability to monetize -- even those loans are paying off and they're paying off for everyone, but our ability to monetize those, so surpasses most of our competitors, but it really is a key differentiator and you're seeing that in a lot of our results now. So, it's that ability was continually building out that platform that Jay talked about, that we're driving that new business and we're not leaking out that those loans pay off like many of our competitors, we retain those while we continue to bring in new clients and that's march to 25%. That's -- but as Julie said, that'll come in [Indiscernible]. We've seen that over the last number of -- over the last decade, quite frankly, we will grab quite a bit and then hold it down -- quite a bit and hold it. But not giving it up is key and that retention is a big part of that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nRyan Nash: Hey good evening everyone.\nJay Farner: Hey Ryan.\nRyan Nash: Jay, maybe we could start with being on sale margins in 2Q, they were really wide of the industry phase, you know, capacity constraints, we're obviously trying to see a little bit of that coming back on you for 3Q, I think you're talking about 405 to 430. Just given your mixes stills out elevated relative to history. Can you maybe just talk about what you're seeing competitively in the marketplace for mortgage originations? And your views on the ability to continue to sustain elevated margins in the coming quarters?\nJay Farner: Certainly, I'll start here and Julie can jump in. But as we talked about defend your margin mentality is critical for our business. We've demonstrated that over the course of 35 years that client service and technology, the experience is really what drives our growth. And so you'll find that our margins remain robust, year-in and year-out, specific to where we are today. Certainly, there's a bit more capacity in the system than we saw back in March or April. We still feel great about consumer demand. And so -- as Julie gave the guidance around those margins, I think we think about where we are today, the demand we're seeing our ability to defend our margins and that helps inform us on that guidance. Julie, other thoughts?\nJulie Booth: Yes, I would say that as we kind of look at the runway here, I think there is quite a long runway of working through the demand that is in the market, given the constraints that we are seeing. So, I think that with where rates are kind of anticipated to be here, I think we'll continue to see strong demand for some time. Primary, secondary spreads are wide right now. So, you may see an opportunity for those to come back in here, but I think, the 405 to 430 that we're looking at here, in Q3, certainly still very strong. We will continue as we did talk about on the roadshow defending our margin, and that is something that that won't change, and I think over time we'll probably see those margin comebacks and more normalized levels. But I think we'd have some runway here, given the demand that we think it's still coming yet over the coming quarters.\nRyan Nash: Got it. And if I can maybe ask another question just on the size of the market. So, originations Jay, you alluded to, they're likely to pass $3 trillion this year, given how low interest rates are. I think most of the market is eligible for a refinance, which means activity should be elevated again next year. So, just talk about your expectations for the market. Obviously, we see the industry forecast, which tend to be a little bit of lagging indicators. And I'm just curious, based on what you see your portfolios, what do you think about expectations for the size of the market? And then to follow-up on the question from earlier, how do you think about the ability over a one to two year timeframe to continue to drive market share? Thanks.\nJay Farner: Yes, so as we've already alluded to in the past anchoring to a forecast, whether it's NBA or Fannie or others is very, very challenging. It's not as if they're off by a 5% or 10% margin, they're off, usually considerably. So, I'll go back first the statement I made, which is for our planning purposes for, for thinking strategically, we really don't look at the forecast, we look at a more normalized market and we structure our growth around that. If the market is larger, of course, then we benefit from it. And as we've talked about, by the end of the year, our goal is to have a platform that can close $40 billion a month. And so we will continue to grow that platform, the tech, the client experience, the brand, and the people required. And if the market shrinks, we'll be able to grow market share and if the market is larger than the forecast may state well our capacity will be there to take advantage of it. I think Bob can probably speak to who's in the market today, as you pointed out, a significant portion of mortgages here in the United States are in the money and we expect them to be in the money for quite some time.\nBob Walters: Yes, I guess, the total size of the market $11 trillion and $12 trillion and depending on how you want to look at $9 trillion or $10 trillion of that is in the money would benefit substantially from a refinance. And so given the 10-year between 60 and 70 basis points in the Fed, essentially, taking a really strong long-term view on that. At these levels, it could take two or three years to work through that and so it really will become a capacity gain. And so as Jay said, building out close to $0.5 trillion of annual capacity, the ability to take advantage of that I think is really -- that is really the cornerstone of us picking up share in an environment like this. It's truly capacity. The market is there for the taking. And so absent a surprise with longer term interest rates, we're hard at work, adding accessing and taking advantage of high margin.\nJay Farner: Yes, I want to jump into that. I know I've mentioned this in the call, but I couldn't be more proud of our group and a lot of feature seeing some growth, which is expected in a market like this. For us to go from $15 billion to $30 billion over the course of the first six months of the year, I think speaks to the true scale that our platform allows for. And I just can't say enough about the team members here that allowed that to happen, our tech team and others.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Timothy Chiodo with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nTimothy Chiodo: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for taking my question.\nJay Farner: You bet.\nTimothy Chiodo: Thanks. I want to ask about the Partner opportunity. So, -- and talking about how that could relate to share in the purchase market. So, you gave stats around 18,000 existing influencers, which is de minimis relative to the potential opportunity of 2 million plus financial professionals. I know that you've already got contracts at the parent level with approaching 200,000 of that 2 million, maybe you could just talk about the approach to attacking that other 1.8 million or so.\nJay Farner: Yes, take a step back. Thanks for the question. Very good question, and truly speaks a lot about this. But just to kind of level set how we think about that -- our platform and the growth. I think kind of the old line thought process has been purchased or refined. And that's a question we'll receive quite a bit. It's important to understand our organization, to understand the differences in how we think our approach to business. We think capacity; we think capacity, brand, and client experience. And so, at any moment in time, there's another loan to add to our platform. And the way that we view it is we had the most profitable loan will be the next loan to the platform. In some cases, that'll be a refinance loan. In other cases, that will be a purchase loan. But we don't specify purchase as a refi. We think we have a platform that's capable of underwriting processing closing X amount of loans growing each and every day. And how do we put the next most profitable loan on there? So, in a market where refinances are more prevalent, you may see more refinance volume from us. In a market where purchases are more prevalent, you may see more purchase volume for us. But that's -- you need to kind of view it from the perspective of like excellence in operations is really our focus and then maximizing profitability with that excellence. Now, pivoting to the Partner or Rocket Pro channel as we reference it. We've rolled that out in the last few years; we've seen great growth from that channel. And yes, I think that channel gives us flexibility to reach prospective clients that our direct-to-consumer advertising may not reach. And in particular, in a heavy purchase market, that channel allows us to have access to those purchase loans that direct-to-consumer advertising may not have the same reach, because we're talking to financial planners, insurance agents, et cetera, who are right there at the point of sale. And so, we have, of course, a sales team that specializes in that. We've got a marketing group that specializes in that. And just like we do with direct-to-consumer, that team is out there each and every day being thoughtful about the partners that we want to approach, taking on a lot of inbound requests, and then figuring out the proper approach to onboard those partners for us, one of the most complicated things in the industry that we have built proprietary technology to sales force is the licensing requirements. So we're able to onboard those partners licensed them. So they are legal to originate loans in all 50 states and, and then move forward with that. So, our approach will be the same that we've taken to this point in time and Julie talks about it and I can turn it over to her in terms of size and scope, you reference a lot of those numbers. But kind of a methodical, strategic approach of rolling out that channel, finding the right partners, licensing those partners and allowing them to continue to grow the Rocket Pro a business. So I think the same process you've seen in the last few years of his growth will continue here in the years to come. Julie you feel free to -- \nJulie Booth: Yes, one of the things that we think about when we consider this channel is really the brand that we have built and these partners that we are approaching, also has very strong brands and really, we want to partner with them and they want to partner with us. So I think that's important to think about as we're considering who those right partners are for us. And the technology that we are building and the effort that we have been putting into that platform, which allowed us to launch and grow as we have over the last couple of years here. We'll continue to invest in that heavy source of where we've been investing here as of late and trying to really continue to hone that process that we've got, so that we can continue to bring on new partners that want to know we partner brands for technology.\nJay Farner: Yeah. I think that also kind of those partners were talking about, I think I referenced this in the call, but our Q3 while refinances are at the record levels, and Q3 will be one of, if not the best purchase quarter we've ever had. So we're seeing strong demand and a lot of that's coming through that partner channel, which is great.\nTimothy Chiodo: Great. Thank you so much for taking the question.\nJay Farner: Of course.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Rich Shane with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRich Shane: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions this afternoon. One of the topics that's been addressed is the scaling of -- of your peers. And you've talked about the impact over the intermediate term in terms of gain on sale margin and really trying to defend that. You've also talked longer term about market share. I'm curious, in a market where supply and demand are changing, or capacities changing. Do you think that that may put some pressure on the short term on market share?\nJay Farner: Yes, I think the market share for us is something that we look at yearly, two year, three year period of time, at any moment in time, and as we touched on, even getting the right denominator that can be a bit challenging to determine what exactly is happening. They're always revising and revising. So we don't necessarily fixate on month or a quarter when we think about market share. But long term, there are really three components to scale. One, of course, is the tech platform and operations process platform. And Bob is touches on this. There are a lot of folks that might go from 5,000 loans to 10,000 loans or 10 to 15. But to go from where we were 50,000 or 60,000, to over 100,000 and I will turn it over to you in a second Bob, you can talk speak to this is really a challenge. So we find a lot of our competition getting stuck somewhere along the way that, benefits us that we're able to continue to scale. The other thing of course, is the financing that's required. So as you grow, even if you have the technology or the process to allow for that, having the deep financing that we have Julie can speak to this is another thing that that many will struggle with. And then I think the third is the brand. And this really helps us quite a bit speed with our operations, a client experience with our operations, and then brand, all form of strong moat around price. And so we of course have to be competitive with pricing as capacity comes and goes, as it typically does in the mortgage space. It can apply a little bit of pressure, and Julie talked about the fact that margins can go up and down a bit, but client service, speed to close and in that brand, really give us a competitive advantage that drive consumers to our experience, and make it less about price -- for the last 25 plus years, it's really worked in our benefit to defend our margins and have that strong margin that you're seeing today. Bob, I don't know if you want to put a touch on the capacity piece, which I think is the stopper for most of our competition.\nBob Walters: Yeah. I think it's a great question about thinking about market share, and as we talked about how we think about when it comes along. And usually, we grab it that it's an opportunistic times. And what we find a lot of times is we scale faster than our competitors. And we were like a rabbit we run out ahead, and then they can -- they begin to add some capacity. And so at that point, we'll hold it. There are two long-term, bigger picture systemic things that allow us to continue gain interest in. One is that smaller numbers, unlike pre-financial crash, where anyone could come rushing into the industry, and often did, they were selling cars, they're like, oh, look at top mortgage industry, they're going to jump in. That's very different. Now, licensing is a big moat, around that. And so people can easily enter small entities and then big entities as Jay said, they can add capacity, but it's not linear. It's exponential in the sense of it becomes more and more difficult to add that capacity, so they begin to hit limits. And so, I think we're in that, we're in that range now, where we will find out who can truly add capacity and be able to take advantage of this ongoing market, and I think we're very well positioned to do that.\nRich Shane: Got it. Okay. That's great, very helpful. Thank you. Just one housekeeping question. What is the UPB now on servicing portfolio? Did I miss that?\nJay Farner: About 400 billion.\nRich Shane: 400 billion. Okay. Terrific. Thank you guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Dennis McGill with Zelman. Please go ahead.\nDennis McGill: Hi. Thank you guys. First question just has to do with headcount. And you've talked about and we\u2019ve seen obviously an unprecedented environment for the industry and a lot of competitive dynamics in play loan officers being bid away, people trying to build their own capacity, but you're set up differently. I was just hoping you could maybe explain a bit about how you handled headcount during the quarter? And then, what you've seen from a turnover standpoint?\nJay Farner: Well, yeah, I think Bob talks a lot about this. But our business model is structured differently. So we're able to flex capacity, grow capacity without having to add the same number of heads. Now, of course, when you're growing the way that we are -- we're still hiring individuals. But we really get -- we get a lot of extended capacity to the same team members really using technology and bringing efficiencies to those team members. In terms of turnover, our folks are very happy, as we mentioned before all now working on their investing to become shareholder and experiencing great success. So we've had a strong, our culture is very strong, and it's been very strong going through this period of time, even with COVID, we've got 98% of our team members working from home very successfully. So we're in great shape from a retention perspective. Bob, I don't want if you want to touch a little bit more about how we think about -- we're not hiring, we're not hiring the same types of folks, our competition might be, because we don't require someone with 20 years of experience to come in for our -- for our group to grow.\nBob Walters: Yeah. That's right. They keeps coming back to this capacity thing that we've been talking about the ability to get -- to get scale, because that is really key is the -- you have to add one individual get the same amount loans, as you're getting before, you can add one individual and get more loans, and we've seen a pretty dramatic increase in the number of closings per team number. And so we talked a lot in the roadshow about what we call rocket logic and the algorithms that have guiding that work, which allow us to plug people in, where it's circular industry and even today, you have you're plugging in highly seasoned people, there's only so many of them, and so that that remains an impediment for a lot our competitors to truly grow. And so utilizing technology to assist people and because you, but we've also bifurcated those roles. So, you don't just have a loan processor who needs a couple of years of experience to be able to be confident, you can plug people in and teach them and show them and guide them through technology and things to work. And then you can reduce those choke points and so that's been really, really successful for us.\nDennis McGill: Very helpful. And then second question, just there were a couple steps you mentioned. I didn't catch them. I think one was 40% -- 46% of closed volume came from the servicing book. And I think you've talked about the 80% retention rate. As you've grown in service and add more clients to the portfolio. Can you just give us any historical perspective on ratios like that? Have you been able to improve those ratios over time as you've gotten larger?\nJay Farner: Yeah. I think you can speak to this Bob, but they continue to get better. I think the most recent numbers are maybe the higher -- at the presented where we've been and go ahead.\nBob Walters: We're always industry leading, but usually in that 60, 65 range than we the last couple of years, it's been in that 70s and pushing into there. So I think it's really a continuation of a number of things. A, we continue to get better at it. I mean, we really focus on the data, the analytics to drive that and just continue to refine because speed to the client is everything. But also this is where the brand continues to kick in plus people, we talked about barrier to exit as it pertains to servicing. We want to provide an experience that because servicing doesn't have the greatest reputation in our industry of high client service. Jay mentioned our 7th J.D. Power award in a row and every year that we've been eligible to win that, people want to come back to that experience, a lot of people have had experiences that weren't so great elsewhere. And so that leads to higher and higher retention. So it's not a surprise that that number continues to go north.\nJay Farner: Yeah. I think when you think about the investments that we make technology investments. When we think about servicing, we invest there just like we do in origination. And a lot of folks are trying to cut costs to drive -- increase I suppose profit around the servicing. But for us, the client experience having access to property data, what's happening in their market, in their neighborhood, having access to get answers to questions they have about their payment real time not wait on hold for half an hour. It's all important because as we talked about lifetime data, that client is critical to the success of our business. And as we think about the amount that we can pay to acquire clients, we can get even more competitive because the second time around, there is no acquisition cost for that client if they enjoy our experience. So we really do servicing as a strategic advantage to grow our origination platform.\nDennis McGill: Very good. Appreciate it. Good luck guys.\nJay Farner: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC. Please go ahead.\nDan Perlin: Thanks. Good evening and congratulations on your first quarter out. Obviously, a great setup for you guys. I had a question, if I could revisit the gain on sale margin just for one second. And it really is trying to understand the dynamic around price sensitivity embedded in that when some of that is so much focused on the servicing portfolio, I'm trying to understand the difference between price sensitive clients versus maybe non-price sensitive clients that you have to go out and be a little bit more aggressive to acquire?\nJay Farner: Yeah, good question. So I don't think there's a significant difference around price sensitivity. I do think it's important to point out that there's a -- we operate differently, but there's a floor and Bob can speak to this as well, a floor to price. And that floor is created by the cost to underwrite process and close mortgage. And so we benefit in this area, because although margins can go up and down and Julie talked about how robust they were here in Q2 and how good we feel about the margins in Q3. But as -- we even see more pressure on margin, what stops our competitors for dropping margin is, is the cost that they have to acquire process to underwrite and close. And so we have to be competitive. I touched on that before. We have to be within an 8.25 of interest rate. But that difference for us and the profitability of brains versus our competition, which is kind of stuck because of their cost to underwrite process and closed really allows us to have very strong margins in tight -- in tougher markets, in easier markets, regardless because of the advantage we have around the efficiencies to underwrite. We've seen that for years and years and years now, Bob.\nBob Walters: Yes, that's another thing we talked about a lot in the roadshow was losing control of the business. And so with a lot of traditional mortgage lenders, what you find is that the loan officers are in control of the business. And so as they are the brand, they're the reason that the client is coming to them. So they are the ones that then can really drive those margins. And of course since they get paid the same, whether margins are higher margins are low, they're always going to be advocating for lower margins. And so that is a very real and very powerful force at a lot of faces driving those down. It doesn't really exist here. And so as they said, we find that a mortgage is a very difficult thing to price shop, because you have interest rates and you have points and USPs and you have -- it's a very, very difficult thing and yet the difference between one-eight, which can often be pretty imperceptible day-to-day, since the market is constantly changing, to mean a half a point in price which on a $4,000 loan is $20,000. And then coupled that with our ability to maximize execution size. And that's when you can really see that we can carry most experience on margins than a lot of our competitors over the long haul.\nDan Perlin: That's super helpful. The follow-up I had is, clearly you've outperform plan, the guidance suggests that that's likely to continue. And now you got a public currency. And I know that a big part of the strategy long-term is to continue to expand into some new verticals, as well as geographies. And so I'm just wondering, two things, what is your kind of near term appetite for this excess capital is flowing through the model? And then secondly, now you have the public currency as well what are your thoughts around M&A to accelerate some of that expansion plan? Thank you very much.\nJay Farner: Yes, I'll take that and then Julie chime in as well here. We've always been, I think opportunistic when it comes to leveraging capital to grow and usually organic is the first place that we look. We've touched on our drive to $40 billion a month, investing in technology growth at the origination and servicing level. So that's the first place that we will go. As a private company, we've historically done special dividends over the course of time. We have lots of cash coming in right now. So, something like that is certainly a possibility for us as we think about the future. And we feel good about our ability to continue to grow the business, doesn't mean that we're not always out looking for opportunities. So, an acquisition is something that we think about as a use for the currency as well, and of course repurchase, if we think that that makes sense. I mean, Julie, am I missing any of our kind of?\nJulie Booth: No, actually, you said it great, Jay. I think that's right. In terms of kind of the waterfall of how we think about using our capital investing in the business, we found is generally the best way to deploy that capital. And we're certainly looking very hard at all the opportunities that we have to continue to use that capital to invest in technology, invest in our processes, think about things that might be strategic to add to the platform from an M&A standpoint. So, I think we'll keep looking at that, just like we always have here. And as Jay said, if it gets to the point where we say, you know what, there's not something that we want to invest in beyond what we're doing already. And we have opportunity to consider that it is something that we may consider down the road.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Arren Cyganovich with Citi. Please go ahead.\nArren Cyganovich: Thanks. If you think about maybe where you started this year in the real massive amount of customer acquisition that you've created through this environment, how does that change your view, has this accelerated your kind of growth expectations for the business in some of the other businesses you have within the ecosystem?\nJay Farner: I'll go back to the comment around kind of strategic thinking, certainly, this is some wind at our back. But the long-term strategies, that marketing technology to allow us to grow in markets, whether it's real estate, auto mortgage, I think we're still on track with all of those things. We certainly benefit from having a larger book of clients that have had a great experience on the mortgage side. It offers up opportunity for us to reach out to them, not only for mortgages down the road, but of course, some of the other businesses that are growing in our ecosystem. So I think it's helpful, but nothing that would deviate is from the strategy that we've set out to see growth in all of the businesses here in our in our ecosystem.\nArren Cyganovich: Okay. And then just last the GSE adverse market fee, maybe you just talk a little bit about how that might impact your gain on sale volumes, or just general mortgage market volumes overall, once that's implemented?\nJay Farner: Yes, we know, Julie can speak to this, there's been a change, I'm sure everyone's aware of where it was pushed back. But Julie can kind of elaborate on what's happening, and how we think about it?\nJulie Booth: Yes, so the fee was pushed back to December 1 now, and that's going to be effective for us. So that was good news to hear that and I think that, what we'll see really depends kind of on how others we react to. I think everybody's going to be subject to the same fee. So the thing is that is consistent across everybody that's originating mortgages. So what sort of impact that has on pricing? I think we'll have yet to see. There's certainly other factors that I can let Bob chime in on this as well, that we consider in thinking about that, Bob, do you want\u2026\nBob Walters: Yeah. We have a real life experience with how it's going to -- because it went live for us for two weeks. The FHFA came out and said that the fee is effective right now that was I don't know earlier last month. And so for two weeks that was in place, we didn't see a material change. Because again, at capacity which the industry is at and will be at for quite some time, primary, secondary spread largely absorbed much of that, whether all or not we can talk about, but we didn't see a fundamental change to our volumes or to our margins for that period of time. So that pricing that goes live on December 1 will largely be reflected in sheet and mortgage companies rate sheets early October. And I would imagine the experience will largely be the same. It'll be a path, so. \nArren Cyganovich: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMihir Bhatia: Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking our questions. This is Mihir on for Jason. I wanted to just quickly start with a cost structure, maybe if you could just talk about that a little bit. How much of it is related? How much of your costs are related, specifically tied to origination volume? So we'll move in lockstep as we go quarter-over-quarter if the seasonality, if you will. And then just any comments overall and just how much is variable versus fixed would be great?\nJay Farner: Yes. I'll let Julie to fill most of this question. But I think that's another really important concept to understand about our platform. And Bob talked about it from the mortgage banker loan officer perspective, from the operational perspective. But the next loan that we load to our platform, the vast majority drops to the bottom line. And I think that makes us much different than others who grow capacity. They're growing expense right along with capacity. We're not so. Julie can kind a give you some more specifics.\nJulie Booth: Yes. The things that tend to vary more directly with production are the banker commissions and compensation that we pay, our operations folks as well. Production costs that we have also increased. And it's about 25% of our costs that will vary. So we're adding new loan production to our platform, about 75% of that tends to default the bottom line. So it is pretty substantial amount as we continue to add on production to our platforms in terms of the profitability of that.\nMihir Bhatia: Great. Thank you. And then just a quick question on the other income line item, obviously you had strong growth this quarter, but some of that, I think, is the Small Business Administration. I think there are like 248 million extra from that in Rocket loans. Is that -- can you just talk about to see how the growth expectations for that for the rest of the year? And is there -- has there been other things that absolutely in there in any business is to call out other than, I guess, Amrock, which is directly based origination? Thank you.\nJay Farner: Right. Yes. I think Julie can speak to this. I think, as you go through the document, you'll see growth and a lot of those businesses. In particular, we touched on this on the road show, our Rocket loans business is really designed as a flex lending tech platform. And so the relationship that was established, in particular here with the SBA allowed that group to do somewhere near or over 9 million loans or grants that is reflected in that other income that Julie can speak to. So that's over a limited period of time, but the underlying ability for that technology to be adjusted, I think, is something we're very excited about. But Julie, do you want to talk to this.\nJulie Booth: Yes. That's right. And you got that right. The other income increasing from 244 million to 562 million quarter-over-quarter. There are two significant things and you mentioned both of them. So that opportunity that Jay just mentioned and also Amrock increasing really kind of alongside the Rocket Mortgage business as well those two things do have the majority of the impact on that increase in other income for the quarter. As we look ahead, there may be some additional income that comes in through the rest of the year from that, but we do not expect that. As you'll see when you look at our 10-Q to be necessarily a recurring source of revenue. But I think it's a great point, Jay, that the platform is built to do things like this and from time-to-time, there may be further opportunities.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMark DeVries: You mentioned potentially investing in servicing. Would you consider bulk servicing acquisitions or correspondent lending? Seems like it could be a good use of capital with such an unusually high recapture rate?\nJay Farner: I\u2019ll let Bob take this on, as he is the expert with capital markets as we've talked about that. Certainly, we think a lot about MSRs and understanding the value of MSRs on our platform, and in some cases, you may see us sell MSRs, if that's the right move. And other cases, we may acquire them. Bob, you can elaborate.\nBob Walters: Yes. We -- there is really the two ways to think about acquiring MSRs from a profitability standpoint. One is a simple return on capital, and how you might lever that and how that might play out. But the other pieces I talked about earlier, is retention. And so often, when we look at acquiring MSR, we look at not only acquiring the MSR to get that cash flow, but also to get that client and how many -- how much of that future stream of cash when they refinance or buy another home, we'd be able to acquire. It's something that we've done in the past. It's been incredibly valuable to us. But a lot of it also depends on what the market looks like and what the capacity is to handle that market. So we're always out there. We're always looking. I don't know as right now what they can do, and you can talk about that as far as putting capital to work to get some kind of a levered or unlevered return. But from a retention standpoint in many different ways, we're very active in that market.\nJay Farner: And the last part, and I think this is an important thing to point out. When you think of other folks who service loans, again, we're an originator and we leverage the servicing of those clients to really drive our origination and will drive our additional ecosystem moving forward. So we can be really thoughtful about how we acquire MSRs and we also of course, in the largest engine in the world to produce them ourselves. Our competition has to buy servicing, whether its -- return is, that that's the only way for them to grow that business. And so we're probably more strategic in thinking about how we buy because we have the luxury of being able to produce them ourselves.\nMark DeVries: Okay. Got it. Could you help us size how meaningful the Ginnie EBO opportunity is for you guys and kind of timing as to when that that could flow through the earnings?\nJay Farner: Sure. Go ahead, Julie.\nJulie Booth: Yes. There is something that we're looking at, certainly as an opportunity given what you see on our balance sheet. Right now you can kind of size that opportunity and see that. We've got about $3.5 billion of loans on our balance sheet, because those loans are 90 days past due, which does trigger the ability to buy those loans out of the portfolio. And really, the analysis is the pass-through rate that we continue to have to pass-through versus how we can finance those loans, what the cost is to do so. So we are actively looking at that. We have bought some loans out already and our -- I think, the liability about $241 million, our balance sheet year end that we had bought out, so we're thinking about whether it makes sense to continue to do more of that right now. In fact, so it may be something that we do, but we'll see.\nMark DeVries: Okay. Any color you can provide on what percentage of those loans that are in delinquency or in forbearance or Ginnie Mae loans?\nJulie Booth: Yes. Yes. I don't know that for a quite the Ginnie Mae mix up. And maybe Bob knows.\nBob Walters: Well, so it's about 90,000 loans. And a disproportionate amount of the exact numbers that are Ginnie. So -- as soon I\u2019ll have that on top of my head.\nJulie Booth: Yes. But that the trend has been decreasing, it's a good news compared to where we thought at June 30. And we are seeing a decrease in the number of loans in forbearance. So it's been a good trend to see.\nJay Farner: Yes. I would say that trend along with just the strong market that we're experiencing right now, the strong growth that we're experiencing right now all incredibly exciting for where we're headed here for the second half of this year.\nOperator: Now we do have time for one more question from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nDon Fandetti: Hi. Good evening. I just want to ask a follow-up question on the Q3 gain on sale margin guidance. Is there a mix component in there? Or should we sort of view that as just normal capacity coming into the market? And also, in Q2, it seemed like the Partner Network gain on sale margin went up a lot quarter-over-quarter. I didn't know if you could provide a little more color on that.\nJay Farner: Well, I think, from a mix perspective, as you're referencing direct-to-consumer versus Partner, I would expect that that mix to remain the same as we -- or similar as we think about the Q3 guidance for margin. Julie, I don't know if you want to reference the top -- speak to the Partner margin in general, I think that was the second part of the question.\nJulie Booth: Yes. Yes. You have seen the Partner margin come up here as I think we\u2019ve explained the Partner margin is recorded on a funded loan basis. So there's a bit of a lag on that. But we had made some investments in the Partner Network in 2019, and you're really seeing that margin and that channel come up here into 2020 consistent with what we're seeing in the direct-to-consumer channel. So I think in both channels you're seeing the impact of the current market environment on those margins.\nDon Fandetti: Okay. Thanks for clarifying that.\nJay Farner: You bet. Well, we -- go ahead.\nOperator: That's right. That is all the time we have for questions. I'm going to turn the call back to Jay Farner for his closing remarks.\nJay Farner: All right. Thank you. Again, we appreciate everyone joining us here today, taking the time as we answered all those questions. We're excited about getting to know each of you better as we build the relationship. And as I mentioned before, really excited about where we came out here in Q2, and how we feel about Q3 and anxious to get on the phone with you in a few months to talk about those results once we can. So thanks again. Everybody have a great evening.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Julie Booth",
            "content": "Thanks Jay and good afternoon, everyone. We spoke to many of you during the IPO process about the multiple drivers that we have to profitably grow our business. In the second quarter, broad-based strength across these areas led to record financial performance, highlighted by adjusted revenue of $5.3 billion and adjusted net income of $2.8 billion. Strength in both our direct-to-consumer and Partner Network channels drove record closed loan volume of $72.3 billion, an increase of 40% from the first quarter of 2020 and 126% compared to the second quarter of 2019. Closed loan volume of $46.8 billion in our direct-to-consumer channel increased to 143% year-over-year. The Partner Network also contributed strong growth with volume of $19.7 billion compared to $11.2 billion in the same period one year ago, an increase of 76%. Net rate lock volume of $92 million significantly exceeded closed loan volume in the second quarter. As a reminder, we recognized revenue at the time when we locked the interest rate with our client. Rate lock typically occurs 30 to 45 days prior to the closing of a loan. As a result, rate lock volume is a leading indicator of closed loan volume. Accelerating momentum throughout the second quarter drove elevated rate lock volume relative to closings. As Jay referenced earlier, Rocket Mortgage achieved historically strong gain on sale margins in the second quarter, with overall margins increasing to 5.19% from 3.25% in the first quarter of 2020. Gain on sale margins were strong across both channels coming in at 5.09% in the direct-to-consumer channel and 2.1% in the Partner Network. As a reminder, overall margins are measured on a rate lock basis, while segment level margins are reported on a funded loan basis. The difference in down sale margins by channel reflects the partial sharing of economics with our partners in the Partner Network. Lower client acquisition costs in the Partner Network lead to strong contribution margins across both channels. Our mortgage servicing business with an important driver of overall loan volume during the second quarter, contributing 46% of total loan volume. These repeat transactions with existing clients come with little to no client acquisition costs, leading to substantial incremental profitability. As we look to the lingering impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, approximately 5.1% of our servicing portfolio was on a forbearance plan related to COVID as of June 30th. The positive news is that we continue to see improvement in forbearance trends into the third quarter. Outside of our Rocket Mortgage business, growth in other revenue was driven by Amarok, our title insurance and settlement services business. Our investments in technology and process at Amarok paid off in the second quarter as the business was able to scale up and meet the increased demand for mortgages and the related title insurance and settlement services. Also during the second quarter, we extended our industry leading position in eClosings by deploying our remote online notarization platform, which further enables the eClosing experience. Amarok processed more than 240,000 settlement transactions during the second quarter of 2020, up 45% as compared to the first quarter of 2020, and up 171% from the second quarter of 2019. Total expenses of $1.6 billion increased 24% compared to the first quarter of 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to higher variable compensation in production costs as a result of increased origination volume. Marketing expenses declined 7% and 11% compared to the prior quarter and prior year periods, respectively. Turning to cash and liquidity, after June 30th, and prior to the IPO, Rocket Companies distributed $2.26 billion to its parent company Rock Holdings. We remain in a strong liquidity position following our IPO with total liquidity of $3.7 billion, including $1 billion of cash on hand, plus $2.7 billion of undrawn lines of credit and corporate cash used to sell fund mortgage loans, which couldn't be transferred to warehouse lines at our option. Overall, we're extremely proud of our record performance in the second quarter, demonstrating our ability to deliver profitable growth at scale. Now, I'd like to take a moment to discuss our current outlook and our approach to the investment community as a public company. The guidance philosophy we're sharing today reflects the way we think about in manage of business. As we shared with many of you during the IPO process, our long-term strategic objective is to achieve 25% share of the mortgage market. We manage the business for long-term growth and aim to continue investing in our brand and technology to all market environments. While our focus remains on the long-term, we are committed to providing transparency to our analysts and investors about the trends we are seeing in our business. Today, we are providing our current outlook for loan volume in the third quarter. Given the unique dynamics around gain on sale margins in the current environment, we are also providing our current outlook for third quarter gain on sale margins. Entering the second half of 2020, we continue to see strong consumer demand. As you've heard from Jay, we currently expect third quarter closed loan volume of $82 billion to $85 billion and net rate lock volume of $93 billion to $98 billion. Regarding gain on sale margins, we expect third quarter margins to moderate from the historically elevated levels experienced in Q2, but remain elevated relative to longer term historical averages. We currently expect third quarter gain on sale margins of 4.05% to 4.3%. Finally, for those of you thinking about updating your models, I did want to remind everyone of the normal seasonality we experienced at Rocket Mortgage, our typical pattern follows the seasonality of the U.S. real estate market, with lower sequential volumes in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. We are proud to deliver you these second quarter results and even more excited about the investments we continue to make in our platform that will guide us to our goal of 25% market share by 2030. With that, we are ready to turn it back to the operator for Q&A. Yes, I agree Jay and certainly while we're happy to provide some guidance for Q3 really, we typically do see that that decrease in the fourth quarter and really wanted to just remind those thinking about our results, but that is kind of a typical seasonality in the business. So, I don't think we're expecting necessarily anything unusual this year, other than what we typically see. But, of course, that could always change. No, I guess the thing that I would maybe add to that is while we do expect to see growth over the next 10 years; it really is not something that we are going to be watching on a quarterly basis. So, we may see some ups and downs when we look quarter-to-quarter. But really, we're focused on kind of that, more annualized look at market share. So, I just would encourage folks to kind of think about that when you're looking at market share quarter-after-quarter here and really thinking about how that's going to come out through the year. Yes, I would say that as we kind of look at the runway here, I think there is quite a long runway of working through the demand that is in the market, given the constraints that we are seeing. So, I think that with where rates are kind of anticipated to be here, I think we'll continue to see strong demand for some time. Primary, secondary spreads are wide right now. So, you may see an opportunity for those to come back in here, but I think, the 405 to 430 that we're looking at here, in Q3, certainly still very strong. We will continue as we did talk about on the roadshow defending our margin, and that is something that that won't change, and I think over time we'll probably see those margin comebacks and more normalized levels. But I think we'd have some runway here, given the demand that we think it's still coming yet over the coming quarters. Yes, one of the things that we think about when we consider this channel is really the brand that we have built and these partners that we are approaching, also has very strong brands and really, we want to partner with them and they want to partner with us. So I think that's important to think about as we're considering who those right partners are for us. And the technology that we are building and the effort that we have been putting into that platform, which allowed us to launch and grow as we have over the last couple of years here. We'll continue to invest in that heavy source of where we've been investing here as of late and trying to really continue to hone that process that we've got, so that we can continue to bring on new partners that want to know we partner brands for technology. No, actually, you said it great, Jay. I think that's right. In terms of kind of the waterfall of how we think about using our capital investing in the business, we found is generally the best way to deploy that capital. And we're certainly looking very hard at all the opportunities that we have to continue to use that capital to invest in technology, invest in our processes, think about things that might be strategic to add to the platform from an M&A standpoint. So, I think we'll keep looking at that, just like we always have here. And as Jay said, if it gets to the point where we say, you know what, there's not something that we want to invest in beyond what we're doing already. And we have opportunity to consider that it is something that we may consider down the road. Yes, so the fee was pushed back to December 1 now, and that's going to be effective for us. So that was good news to hear that and I think that, what we'll see really depends kind of on how others we react to. I think everybody's going to be subject to the same fee. So the thing is that is consistent across everybody that's originating mortgages. So what sort of impact that has on pricing? I think we'll have yet to see. There's certainly other factors that I can let Bob chime in on this as well, that we consider in thinking about that, Bob, do you want... Yes. The things that tend to vary more directly with production are the banker commissions and compensation that we pay, our operations folks as well. Production costs that we have also increased. And it's about 25% of our costs that will vary. So we're adding new loan production to our platform, about 75% of that tends to default the bottom line. So it is pretty substantial amount as we continue to add on production to our platforms in terms of the profitability of that. Yes. That's right. And you got that right. The other income increasing from 244 million to 562 million quarter-over-quarter. There are two significant things and you mentioned both of them. So that opportunity that Jay just mentioned and also Amrock increasing really kind of alongside the Rocket Mortgage business as well those two things do have the majority of the impact on that increase in other income for the quarter. As we look ahead, there may be some additional income that comes in through the rest of the year from that, but we do not expect that. As you'll see when you look at our 10-Q to be necessarily a recurring source of revenue. But I think it's a great point, Jay, that the platform is built to do things like this and from time-to-time, there may be further opportunities. Yes. There is something that we're looking at, certainly as an opportunity given what you see on our balance sheet. Right now you can kind of size that opportunity and see that.

But that the trend has been decreasing, it's a good news compared to where we thought at June 30. And we are seeing a decrease in the number of loans in forbearance. So it's been a good trend to see. Yes. Yes. You have seen the Partner margin come up here as I think we've explained the Partner margin is recorded on a funded loan basis. So there's a bit of a lag on that. But we had made some investments in the Partner Network in 2019, and you're really seeing that margin and that channel come up here into 2020 consistent with what we're seeing in the direct-to-consumer channel. So I think in both channels you're seeing the impact of the current market environment on those margins."

            "name": "Jay Farner",
            "content": "Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Rocket Companies second quarter earnings call, our first as a public company. Before we get started, I'd like to thank our 20,000 team members for the dedication and unwavering commitment to our clients. Because of their efforts, I'm proud to share that Rocket Companies achieved record breaking results in the second quarter. Culture is the foundation of everything we do here at Rocket Companies. Our Founder, Dan Gilbert created 19 principles known as ISMs, and they are the heart and soul of our culture and drive every decision we make. They are who we are, our DNA. Our culture has been the secret to our success over the last 35 years and the second quarter was no exception. One of those ISMs is do the right thing, a charge that we take very seriously. Earlier this year, when we saw the impacts of COVID-19 overseas, we quickly invested in the tools and technology that was needed to ensure that all our team members could effectively work from home, weeks faster than many other large businesses. This allowed us to keep our team members and community safe, while also meeting the needs of our clients as mortgage rates begin to fall. This is just one of the many examples of our company making sensible investments in the future. We spoke to many of you during the IPO process about our focus on investing for the long-term. We're extremely proud of protecting our team members and achieving record results in the second quarter, but that performance has been years in the making. Thousands of our technology team members have continuously built and refined a platform that has truly risen to the occasion, allowing us to scale to meet unprecedented demand, all while 98% of our team is working from home. It's a pleasure to be here today to talk about our second quarter results. The way we think about our business and why we believe Rocket Companies is well-positioned to capitalize on the substantial opportunities ahead. In the second quarter, Rocket Mortgage closed $72.3 billion in loan volume, more than any quarter in our 35-year history. Record low interest rates are driving demand for home loans and as we've highlighted, the power of our platform is proving a key differentiator for Rocket Mortgage. In fact, we've been able to achieve record volumes, while maintaining impressive long turn times. Industry-wide capacity constraints have led to significant gain on sale margins during the second quarter with overall margins increasing to 5.19%, up from 3.25% in the first quarter. Our ability to scale volume at these elevated margins led to substantial incremental profitability in the quarter. While second quarter gain on sale margin were certainly elevated by historical standards, this is exactly the kind of market environment we built our platform to performance. Quite simply, we're able to meet the needs of our growing client base and provide award-winning client experience. Our mortgage servicing business was a key driver of overall performance in the quarter, which Julie will talk about in a moment. I'm also proud to share that we recently earned an unprecedented seventh consecutive J.D. Power Award for Customer Satisfaction in Mortgage Servicing, an award we've won every year we've been eligible. This award is based entirely on feedback from our clients and it's an honor our team members take tremendous pride in. Turning to our broader ecosystem of businesses, we believe we have substantial opportunities to apply the same focus on client experience, technology, and operations across multiple industries. When we look at our companies holistically, Rocket Companies generated 300% year-over-year growth in adjusted revenue and $2.8 billion of adjusted net income in the second quarter. We are delivering profitable growth at substantial scale. As you continue to get to know Rocket Companies, you will also learn we are passionate about the communities where our team members work, live, and play. We are keenly aware of the role our company plays in building the American dream and how communities are the foundation of progress, education, and pride. We recently announced the very important Changing the Course initiative here in Detroit. Unfortunately, Detroit ranks last in digital connectivity among all major cities. We saw the effects of this digital divide truly manifest with the onset of COVID-19, when many of our community members found themselves without access to the technology needed to participate in telemedicine, schooling, or find a job. We knew we needed to step in and make a change. Through the Rocket Mortgage Classic, our PGA Tour event in Detroit, we have risen to the task to ensure that by 2025, every Detroiter will have access to technology within a 10-minute walk from their home. As a technology company and the largest employer in the City of Detroit, this is a program that is near and dear to all our hearts and one we look forward to bringing to life. Finally, many of you have asked us how things will change now that we're a public company. The short answer is they won't. We have many more investors today than we did as a private company, including all of our team members who once vested will become shareholders, but that doesn't affect who we are. We are committed to providing you with the same plainspoken transparency that has been a hallmark of our company. We also commit to you that we will continue intense dedication to our culture, our focus on the long-term, and our commitment to doing the right things the right way. Julie will talk more about our current outlook in just a minute. But as we look to the second half of the year, we continue to see strength and durability in consumer sentiment. Record low interest rates and an improving U.S. real estate market continue to drive demand for home loans. The purchase market, in particular, continues to recover following COVID-related disruption in the second quarter. In fact, we expect the third quarter to be one of our best for purchase origination volume ever at Rocket Mortgage. Demand for a completely digital experience has never been stronger and Rocket is delivering. With that, I'll turn things over to Julie Booth, who will take you through our second quarter results in more detail. Thanks James. And just to open up as our first call, just to get folks familiar with voices, this is Jay Farner, the CEO. I'll be joined by Julie Booth, our CFO, and Bob Walters, our COO. And good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for being here on our first call. Now, heading to your question, I know Julie touched on some of our guidance around Q3 and also referenced that typically we see some seasonality as we enter the fourth quarter December in particular. And Julie was referencing kind of the traditional seasonality that you might experience in housing, in particular purchase; obviously, we're in a different market right now. And I'll let Julie comment, but when it comes to kind of current expectations around interest rates or treasuries. I would say that what we're experiencing today, we anticipate we'll continue forward here through the rest of the year. Julie? Yes, thanks, James. And I'll start out here and then Julie or Bob, feel free to chime in. I think it's important we take a step back and think about strategically how we at Rocket Companies go about our planning. We obviously don't control interest rate and so for us, it's critical that we think about long-term growth over an extended period of time and then make all the right moves to make sure that we're growing and gaining market share. And so we really look at the mortgage market as roughly a $2 trillion market. There'll be years like this year where the market is much larger than that and based on our tech platform and our ability to scale, we will take advantage of that and grab far more growth in in volume than maybe we had prepared for. But year-in year-out, we look more towards a normalized market. And then we set our strategy to ensure that we're growing market share. We're growing clients throughout any interest rate market. And as you followed maybe our last 15 or 20 years that we've shared, especially over the course of the roadshow, certainly it's not a straight line for growth. There are moments in time where production may be flatter, but we're growing market share. But please understand behind the scenes, strategically, as we think about our model, direct-to-consumer, our Partner model, and now the ecosystem that we're building, that's just targeted to continue to strengthen the platform, grow the capabilities of the platform, and continually be able to grow that market share over time. And you'll see things happen like they've occurred this year where, due to interest rates, we're able to see a significant increase and where we really leverage the platform and exceed what our expectations have been. We set the strategy back in the fall of 2019. Julie, feel free to add or make comment. Yes, I think that's a critical component as we take a long-term view. There'll be times for us where opportunity to grow market share or acquire clients is the most important move, focusing less on EBITDA and more on that client growth. And Bob Walters can probably chime in on that because I think Julie pointed out a significant percentage of the loan volume that we've done this year has come from our clients -- our servicing book, and our retention rates, which is an important component of our business. And so when others are pulling away from the market, we tend to lean in because we can grow that client servicing book. Bob, I don't know if you want to touch on that just help educate everybody. Hey Ryan. Certainly, I'll start here and Julie can jump in. But as we talked about defend your margin mentality is critical for our business. We've demonstrated that over the course of 35 years that client service and technology, the experience is really what drives our growth. And so you'll find that our margins remain robust, year-in and year-out, specific to where we are today. Certainly, there's a bit more capacity in the system than we saw back in March or April. We still feel great about consumer demand. And so -- as Julie gave the guidance around those margins, I think we think about where we are today, the demand we're seeing our ability to defend our margins and that helps inform us on that guidance. Julie, other thoughts? Yes, so as we've already alluded to in the past anchoring to a forecast, whether it's NBA or Fannie or others is very, very challenging. It's not as if they're off by a 5% or 10% margin, they're off, usually considerably. So, I'll go back first the statement I made, which is for our planning purposes for, for thinking strategically, we really don't look at the forecast, we look at a more normalized market and we structure our growth around that. If the market is larger, of course, then we benefit from it. And as we've talked about, by the end of the year, our goal is to have a platform that can close $40 billion a month. And so we will continue to grow that platform, the tech, the client experience, the brand, and the people required. And if the market shrinks, we'll be able to grow market share and if the market is larger than the forecast may state well our capacity will be there to take advantage of it. I think Bob can probably speak to who's in the market today, as you pointed out, a significant portion of mortgages here in the United States are in the money and we expect them to be in the money for quite some time. Yes, I want to jump into that. I know I've mentioned this in the call, but I couldn't be more proud of our group and a lot of feature seeing some growth, which is expected in a market like this. For us to go from $15 billion to $30 billion over the course of the first six months of the year, I think speaks to the true scale that our platform allows for. And I just can't say enough about the team members here that allowed that to happen, our tech team and others. You bet. Yes, take a step back. Thanks for the question. Very good question, and truly speaks a lot about this. But just to kind of level set how we think about that -- our platform and the growth. I think kind of the old line thought process has been purchased or refined. And that's a question we'll receive quite a bit. It's important to understand our organization, to understand the differences in how we think our approach to business. We think capacity; we think capacity, brand, and client experience. And so, at any moment in time, there's another loan to add to our platform. And the way that we view it is we had the most profitable loan will be the next loan to the platform. In some cases, that'll be a refinance loan. In other cases, that will be a purchase loan. But we don't specify purchase as a refi. We think we have a platform that's capable of underwriting processing closing X amount of loans growing each and every day. And how do we put the next most profitable loan on there? So, in a market where refinances are more prevalent, you may see more refinance volume from us. In a market where purchases are more prevalent, you may see more purchase volume for us. But that's -- you need to kind of view it from the perspective of like excellence in operations is really our focus and then maximizing profitability with that excellence. Now, pivoting to the Partner or Rocket Pro channel as we reference it. We've rolled that out in the last few years; we've seen great growth from that channel. And yes, I think that channel gives us flexibility to reach prospective clients that our direct-to-consumer advertising may not reach. And in particular, in a heavy purchase market, that channel allows us to have access to those purchase loans that direct-to-consumer advertising may not have the same reach, because we're talking to financial planners, insurance agents, et cetera, who are right there at the point of sale. And so, we have, of course, a sales team that specializes in that. We've got a marketing group that specializes in that. And just like we do with direct-to-consumer, that team is out there each and every day being thoughtful about the partners that we want to approach, taking on a lot of inbound requests, and then figuring out the proper approach to onboard those partners for us, one of the most complicated things in the industry that we have built proprietary technology to sales force is the licensing requirements. So we're able to onboard those partners licensed them. So they are legal to originate loans in all 50 states and, and then move forward with that. So, our approach will be the same that we've taken to this point in time and Julie talks about it and I can turn it over to her in terms of size and scope, you reference a lot of those numbers. But kind of a methodical, strategic approach of rolling out that channel, finding the right partners, licensing those partners and allowing them to continue to grow the Rocket Pro a business. So I think the same process you've seen in the last few years of his growth will continue here in the years to come. Julie you feel free to -- Yeah. I think that also kind of those partners were talking about, I think I referenced this in the call, but our Q3 while refinances are at the record levels, and Q3 will be one of, if not the best purchase quarter we've ever had. So we're seeing strong demand and a lot of that's coming through that partner channel, which is great. Of course. Yes, I think the market share for us is something that we look at yearly, two year, three year period of time, at any moment in time, and as we touched on, even getting the right denominator that can be a bit challenging to determine what exactly is happening. They're always revising and revising. So we don't necessarily fixate on month or a quarter when we think about market share. But long term, there are really three components to scale. One, of course, is the tech platform and operations process platform. And Bob is touches on this. There are a lot of folks that might go from 5,000 loans to 10,000 loans or 10 to 15. But to go from where we were 50,000 or 60,000, to over 100,000 and I will turn it over to you in a second Bob, you can talk speak to this is really a challenge. So we find a lot of our competition getting stuck somewhere along the way that, benefits us that we're able to continue to scale. The other thing of course, is the financing that's required. So as you grow, even if you have the technology or the process to allow for that, having the deep financing that we have Julie can speak to this is another thing that that many will struggle with. And then I think the third is the brand. And this really helps us quite a bit speed with our operations, a client experience with our operations, and then brand, all form of strong moat around price. And so we of course have to be competitive with pricing as capacity comes and goes, as it typically does in the mortgage space. It can apply a little bit of pressure, and Julie talked about the fact that margins can go up and down a bit, but client service, speed to close and in that brand, really give us a competitive advantage that drive consumers to our experience, and make it less about price -- for the last 25 plus years, it's really worked in our benefit to defend our margins and have that strong margin that you're seeing today. Bob, I don't know if you want to put a touch on the capacity piece, which I think is the stopper for most of our competition. About 400 billion. Well, yeah, I think Bob talks a lot about this. But our business model is structured differently. So we're able to flex capacity, grow capacity without having to add the same number of heads. Now, of course, when you're growing the way that we are -- we're still hiring individuals. But we really get -- we get a lot of extended capacity to the same team members really using technology and bringing efficiencies to those team members. In terms of turnover, our folks are very happy, as we mentioned before all now working on their investing to become shareholder and experiencing great success. So we've had a strong, our culture is very strong, and it's been very strong going through this period of time, even with COVID, we've got 98% of our team members working from home very successfully. So we're in great shape from a retention perspective. Bob, I don't want if you want to touch a little bit more about how we think about -- we're not hiring, we're not hiring the same types of folks, our competition might be, because we don't require someone with 20 years of experience to come in for our -- for our group to grow. Yeah. I think you can speak to this Bob, but they continue to get better. I think the most recent numbers are maybe the higher -- at the presented where we've been and go ahead. Yeah. I think when you think about the investments that we make technology investments. When we think about servicing, we invest there just like we do in origination. And a lot of folks are trying to cut costs to drive -- increase I suppose profit around the servicing. But for us, the client experience having access to property data, what's happening in their market, in their neighborhood, having access to get answers to questions they have about their payment real time not wait on hold for half an hour. It's all important because as we talked about lifetime data, that client is critical to the success of our business. And as we think about the amount that we can pay to acquire clients, we can get even more competitive because the second time around, there is no acquisition cost for that client if they enjoy our experience. So we really do servicing as a strategic advantage to grow our origination platform. Thank you. Yeah, good question. So I don't think there's a significant difference around price sensitivity. I do think it's important to point out that there's a -- we operate differently, but there's a floor and Bob can speak to this as well, a floor to price. And that floor is created by the cost to underwrite process and close mortgage. And so we benefit in this area, because although margins can go up and down and Julie talked about how robust they were here in Q2 and how good we feel about the margins in Q3. But as -- we even see more pressure on margin, what stops our competitors for dropping margin is, is the cost that they have to acquire process to underwrite and close. And so we have to be competitive. I touched on that before. We have to be within an 8.25 of interest rate. But that difference for us and the profitability of brains versus our competition, which is kind of stuck because of their cost to underwrite process and closed really allows us to have very strong margins in tight -- in tougher markets, in easier markets, regardless because of the advantage we have around the efficiencies to underwrite. We've seen that for years and years and years now, Bob. Yes, I'll take that and then Julie chime in as well here. We've always been, I think opportunistic when it comes to leveraging capital to grow and usually organic is the first place that we look. We've touched on our drive to $40 billion a month, investing in technology growth at the origination and servicing level. So that's the first place that we will go. As a private company, we've historically done special dividends over the course of time. We have lots of cash coming in right now. So, something like that is certainly a possibility for us as we think about the future. And we feel good about our ability to continue to grow the business, doesn't mean that we're not always out looking for opportunities. So, an acquisition is something that we think about as a use for the currency as well, and of course repurchase, if we think that that makes sense. I mean, Julie, am I missing any of our kind of? I'll go back to the comment around kind of strategic thinking, certainly, this is some wind at our back. But the long-term strategies, that marketing technology to allow us to grow in markets, whether it's real estate, auto mortgage, I think we're still on track with all of those things. We certainly benefit from having a larger book of clients that have had a great experience on the mortgage side. It offers up opportunity for us to reach out to them, not only for mortgages down the road, but of course, some of the other businesses that are growing in our ecosystem. So I think it's helpful, but nothing that would deviate is from the strategy that we've set out to see growth in all of the businesses here in our in our ecosystem. Yes, we know, Julie can speak to this, there's been a change, I'm sure everyone's aware of where it was pushed back. But Julie can kind of elaborate on what's happening, and how we think about it? Yes. I'll let Julie to fill most of this question. But I think that's another really important concept to understand about our platform. And Bob talked about it from the mortgage banker loan officer perspective, from the operational perspective. But the next loan that we load to our platform, the vast majority drops to the bottom line. And I think that makes us much different than others who grow capacity. They're growing expense right along with capacity. We're not so. Julie can kind a give you some more specifics. Right. Yes. I think Julie can speak to this. I think, as you go through the document, you'll see growth and a lot of those businesses. In particular, we touched on this on the road show, our Rocket loans business is really designed as a flex lending tech platform. And so the relationship that was established, in particular here with the SBA allowed that group to do somewhere near or over 9 million loans or grants that is reflected in that other income that Julie can speak to. So that's over a limited period of time, but the underlying ability for that technology to be adjusted, I think, is something we're very excited about. But Julie, do you want to talk to this. I'll let Bob take this on, as he is the expert with capital markets as we've talked about that. Certainly, we think a lot about MSRs and understanding the value of MSRs on our platform, and in some cases, you may see us sell MSRs, if that's the right move. And other cases, we may acquire them. Bob, you can elaborate. And the last part, and I think this is an important thing to point out. When you think of other folks who service loans, again, we're an originator and we leverage the servicing of those clients to really drive our origination and will drive our additional ecosystem moving forward. So we can be really thoughtful about how we acquire MSRs and we also of course, in the largest engine in the world to produce them ourselves. Our competition has to buy servicing, whether its -- return is, that that's the only way for them to grow that business. And so we're probably more strategic in thinking about how we buy because we have the luxury of being able to produce them ourselves. Sure. Go ahead, Julie. Yes. I would say that trend along with just the strong market that we're experiencing right now, the strong growth that we're experiencing right now all incredibly exciting for where we're headed here for the second half of this year. Well, I think, from a mix perspective, as you're referencing direct-to-consumer versus Partner, I would expect that that mix to remain the same as we -- or similar as we think about the Q3 guidance for margin. Julie, I don't know if you want to reference the top -- speak to the Partner margin in general, I think that was the second part of the question. You bet. Well, we -- go ahead. All right. Thank you. Again, we appreciate everyone joining us here today, taking the time as we answered all those questions. We're excited about getting to know each of you better as we build the relationship. And as I mentioned before, really excited about where we came out here in Q2, and how we feel about Q3 and anxious to get on the phone with you in a few months to talk about those results once we can. So thanks again. Everybody have a great evening."

            "name": "Bob Walters",
            "content": "Yes, I think we talked a lot about this in the road shows in one of our key differentiators for us we have a very large servicing platform. When we think about servicing quite differently than a lot of services, especially publicly-traded services that are really looking at return on capital. Now we [Indiscernible] as a retention play, and we have on our refinanced loans 80% retention, now. So our ability to monetize -- even those loans are paying off and they're paying off for everyone, but our ability to monetize those, so surpasses most of our competitors, but it really is a key differentiator and you're seeing that in a lot of our results now. So, it's that ability was continually building out that platform that Jay talked about, that we're driving that new business and we're not leaking out that those loans pay off like many of our competitors, we retain those while we continue to bring in new clients and that's march to 25%. That's -- but as Julie said, that'll come in [Indiscernible]. We've seen that over the last number of -- over the last decade, quite frankly, we will grab quite a bit and then hold it down -- quite a bit and hold it. But not giving it up is key and that retention is a big part of that. Yes, I guess, the total size of the market $11 trillion and $12 trillion and depending on how you want to look at $9 trillion or $10 trillion of that is in the money would benefit substantially from a refinance. And so given the 10-year between 60 and 70 basis points in the Fed, essentially, taking a really strong long-term view on that. At these levels, it could take two or three years to work through that and so it really will become a capacity gain. And so as Jay said, building out close to $0.5 trillion of annual capacity, the ability to take advantage of that I think is really -- that is really the cornerstone of us picking up share in an environment like this. It's truly capacity. The market is there for the taking. And so absent a surprise with longer term interest rates, we're hard at work, adding accessing and taking advantage of high margin. Yeah. I think it's a great question about thinking about market share, and as we talked about how we think about when it comes along. And usually, we grab it that it's an opportunistic times. And what we find a lot of times is we scale faster than our competitors. And we were like a rabbit we run out ahead, and then they can -- they begin to add some capacity. And so at that point, we'll hold it. There are two long-term, bigger picture systemic things that allow us to continue gain interest in. One is that smaller numbers, unlike pre-financial crash, where anyone could come rushing into the industry, and often did, they were selling cars, they're like, oh, look at top mortgage industry, they're going to jump in. That's very different. Now, licensing is a big moat, around that. And so people can easily enter small entities and then big entities as Jay said, they can add capacity, but it's not linear. It's exponential in the sense of it becomes more and more difficult to add that capacity, so they begin to hit limits. And so, I think we're in that, we're in that range now, where we will find out who can truly add capacity and be able to take advantage of this ongoing market, and I think we're very well positioned to do that. Yeah. That's right. They keeps coming back to this capacity thing that we've been talking about the ability to get -- to get scale, because that is really key is the -- you have to add one individual get the same amount loans, as you're getting before, you can add one individual and get more loans, and we've seen a pretty dramatic increase in the number of closings per team number. And so we talked a lot in the roadshow about what we call rocket logic and the algorithms that have guiding that work, which allow us to plug people in, where it's circular industry and even today, you have you're plugging in highly seasoned people, there's only so many of them, and so that that remains an impediment for a lot our competitors to truly grow. And so utilizing technology to assist people and because you, but we've also bifurcated those roles. So, you don't just have a loan processor who needs a couple of years of experience to be able to be confident, you can plug people in and teach them and show them and guide them through technology and things to work. And then you can reduce those choke points and so that's been really, really successful for us. We're always industry leading, but usually in that 60, 65 range than we the last couple of years, it's been in that 70s and pushing into there. So I think it's really a continuation of a number of things. A, we continue to get better at it. I mean, we really focus on the data, the analytics to drive that and just continue to refine because speed to the client is everything. But also this is where the brand continues to kick in plus people, we talked about barrier to exit as it pertains to servicing. We want to provide an experience that because servicing doesn't have the greatest reputation in our industry of high client service. Jay mentioned our 7th J.D. Power award in a row and every year that we've been eligible to win that, people want to come back to that experience, a lot of people have had experiences that weren't so great elsewhere. And so that leads to higher and higher retention. So it's not a surprise that that number continues to go north. Yes, that's another thing we talked about a lot in the roadshow was losing control of the business. And so with a lot of traditional mortgage lenders, what you find is that the loan officers are in control of the business. And so as they are the brand, they're the reason that the client is coming to them. So they are the ones that then can really drive those margins. And of course since they get paid the same, whether margins are higher margins are low, they're always going to be advocating for lower margins. And so that is a very real and very powerful force at a lot of faces driving those down. It doesn't really exist here. And so as they said, we find that a mortgage is a very difficult thing to price shop, because you have interest rates and you have points and USPs and you have -- it's a very, very difficult thing and yet the difference between one-eight, which can often be pretty imperceptible day-to-day, since the market is constantly changing, to mean a half a point in price which on a $4,000 loan is $20,000. And then coupled that with our ability to maximize execution size. And that's when you can really see that we can carry most experience on margins than a lot of our competitors over the long haul. Yeah. We have a real life experience with how it's going to -- because it went live for us for two weeks. The FHFA came out and said that the fee is effective right now that was I don't know earlier last month. And so for two weeks that was in place, we didn't see a material change. Because again, at capacity which the industry is at and will be at for quite some time, primary, secondary spread largely absorbed much of that, whether all or not we can talk about, but we didn't see a fundamental change to our volumes or to our margins for that period of time. So that pricing that goes live on December 1 will largely be reflected in sheet and mortgage companies rate sheets early October. And I would imagine the experience will largely be the same. It'll be a path, so. Yes. We -- there is really the two ways to think about acquiring MSRs from a profitability standpoint. One is a simple return on capital, and how you might lever that and how that might play out. But the other pieces I talked about earlier, is retention. And so often, when we look at acquiring MSR, we look at not only acquiring the MSR to get that cash flow, but also to get that client and how many -- how much of that future stream of cash when they refinance or buy another home, we'd be able to acquire. It's something that we've done in the past. It's been incredibly valuable to us. But a lot of it also depends on what the market looks like and what the capacity is to handle that market. So we're always out there. We're always looking. I don't know as right now what they can do, and you can talk about that as far as putting capital to work to get some kind of a levered or unlevered return. But from a retention standpoint in many different ways, we're very active in that market. Well, so it's about 90,000 loans. And a disproportionate amount of the exact numbers that are Ginnie. So -- as soon I'll have that on top of my head."

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Sharon Ng. Please go ahead.\nSharon Ng: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Rocket Companies' earnings call covering the fourth quarter and full year of 2021. With us this afternoon are Rocket Companies' CEO, Jay Farner; our CFO, Julie Booth; and our President and COO, Bob Walters. Before I turn things over to Jay, let me quickly go over our disclaimers. On today's call, we provide you with information regarding our fourth quarter and full year 2021 performance as well as our financial outlook. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations and the assumptions we mentioned today.

And with that, I'll turn things over to Jay Farner to get us started. Jay?\nJay Farner: Thank you, Sharon. Good afternoon, and welcome to the Rocket Companies' earnings call for the fourth quarter and full year of 2021. On today's call, I'll recap our achievements from the past year, including our success driving growth in purchased loans and cash out refinance, continuing to build on the strength of the Rocket Platform through the addition of Truebill, and I'll cover the best-in-class capital returns we have provided to our shareholders since our IPO in August of 2020. Last year was an incredibly successful year for Rocket Companies as we continue to break records. In 2021, Rocket Mortgage reached a company best of $351 billion of originations, which represented a nearly 10% increase from the previous record of $320 billion set in 2020. On a full year basis, Rocket generated $12.4 billion of adjusted revenue, $6.2 billion of adjusted EBITDA and $4.5 billion of adjusted net income. It's worth taking a step back to look at what we've accomplished over the last two years. Comparing closed loan volume and adjusted revenue in 2021, it was more than double our 2019 levels. Our adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income more than tripled in that same period. Also, we have organically grown our service client base by more than 40% since 2019, which today generates recurring cash revenue at an annual run rate exceeding $1.4 billion. The company has grown and strengthened all while generating profitability at scale, returning substantial capital to our shareholders. In the last two years, we have earned a cumulative adjusted net income of more than $12 billion. With today's announcement of our second $2 billion special dividend and the more than $300 million of stock repurchases, we've now returned $4.5 billion of capital to shareholders since our IPO in August of 2020. That represents roughly 20% of our market value based on today's trading price. We're also investing to grow our platform with strategic acquisitions like Truebill. This continued investment in our platform strengthens our core offerings to our consumers who know like and trust our brand, driving increased lifetime value. Looking at our guidance of $52 billion to $57 billion of closed loan volume in the first quarter of 2022, you see, we project to nearly triple our 2018 quarterly run rate of $20 billion, growing significantly faster than other market participants over the last three years. Our first quarter guidance reflects the impact of the Omicron outbreak, which disrupted our business and required us to again send team members home for their safety. Our 36-year history has taught us that our centralized model is a significant advantage in rising rate environments. The ability to train and coach in real time is critical to our success. I'm happy to report that as of February 14, we have returned to the office, and we're already seeing the benefits in the last few weeks. As rates rapidly increase, our strategy has always been to protect our margin and our profitability. During time periods like this, many lenders will significantly reduce their margin in an effort to sustain production. We have found that this is not a sound strategy for profitability, sustainability and maintaining a disciplined approach towards supporting our business long term. I'm certain that this question will come up again in the Q&A, and I'm excited to talk about our strategy to address rising interest rates and continue to grow our business. In fact, we have grown our Mortgage business substantially since the last market cycle by doing the right things, delivering the best client experience in the market, investing in a flexible, scalable multichannel platform that's always ready to quickly capture opportunity, and we've also driven significant mortgage volume growth from less rate-sensitive products, including purchase and cash out refinance. If we look at the last week, since we brought our team members back to the office, our non-rate sensitive products make up nearly 90% of our mortgage production. Last May, we announced our plans to become the number one retail purchase lender, excluding correspondent in the nation by 2023. I'm happy to report that 2021 represented the largest purchase mortgage volume in our company's history, and we are seeing continued momentum here in the early part of 2022. We are well on our way to reaching our stated goal. Additionally, the fourth quarter was our best ever for cash out refinance volume as we leverage our vast data lake, our client insights and, of course, our highly trained Rocket Cloud Force to help our clients take advantage of rising home values. Home equity continues to be at record levels with $25 trillion of equity available to homeowners. Along with the strong growth in the Mortgage segment, we made significant strides last year growing our platform to help Americans with life's most complex moments. We've expanded beyond our core Mortgage business to enable an end-to-end seamless home-buying ecosystem with Amrock, our title and settlement services company, which hit 1.1 million closings in 2021 and is the largest of its kind in the country. At Rocket Homes, we saw a strong growth with the company facilitating more than 30,000 transactions, representing over $8 billion in transaction value. And at Rocket Auto, we more than doubled our GMV in 2021. The talented team at Truebill also joined our family in the fourth quarter. Truebill is a strong addition to our platform as it brings millions of existing clients who have affinity for the brand and are actively working to improve their finances in anticipation of future large purchases like home or auto. Truebill's offerings expand our relationship with our clients by managing subscriptions, improving credit scores and tracking spending, all of which strengthens clients' financial health and enables Rocket to nurture clients in between large, less frequent purchases. Truebill is one of the fastest-growing FinTech businesses in America and was recently named the number one consumer Tech Company by the news publication, The Information. Truebill's growth has been impressive. The company's premium membership base increased by more than 115% in 2021 and has continued to outperform after our acquisition. This is all before we've even begun introducing and incubating the millions of clients in the Rocket ecosystem to Truebill. Rocket and Truebill are aligned in one mission to remove friction from life's complex moments. And the relationship has come together quickly. In fact, our combined teams are currently working together to create a single sign-on solution that will bring the entire Rocket ecosystem together through one unified login. We expect this new experience to launch in the next 30 to 45 days. Another strategic part of our platform that enables us to maintain ongoing relationships is mortgage servicing. With our 2.6 million service clients, our servicing book has grown substantially, providing a natural hedge to our origination business. We are now the fifth largest servicer in the country, with servicing rights representing a $5.4 billion asset as of year-end, while maintaining an industry-best retention rate of 91%. Consider this, our business has created recurring cash flows of more than $1.4 billion annualized through servicing, plus an additional $100 million to the rapidly growing Truebill business, all supporting an incredibly capital-light business. Heading into 2022, we see tremendous opportunity with robust purchase and cash out refinance demand. We view the challenging market conditions like a rising rate environment as an opportunity to shine. This is the time when we see our investments in our platform truly pay off. We don't believe any other company has invested in technology, in brand, and people and partnerships like we have. The partnerships we have with companies like Salesforce, E*TRADE, Charles Schwab, State Farm and many others are built on a proprietary platform that cannot be easily replicated by other lenders or other fintech companies. To ensure consumers are aware of our unique position in the market, we recently aired a number one rated Super Bowl commercial, our second straight year of achieving this honor. The ad time of the benefits of leveraging the combined experience of Rocket Homes and Rocket Mortgage to find and finance a home. This spot garnered billions of media impressions and is currently being reinforced through our brand and direct response advertising campaigns. This marketing is essential in reminding consumers that in a housing market that has remained highly competitive and inventory constrained, we provide the insight and the tools that help our clients into the closing table faster. These include our industry-leading home search platforms and programs like Overnight Underwrite and Rocket Pro Insight, and consumers are taking notice. In January of 2022, verified approval letters were up 50% compared to 2021, representing the most reapprovals we've had to start a year in our company's history. Finally, 2021 also marked our first full year as a public company. We have shown a track record of generating profitability and scale and returning significant capital to our shareholders. Cumulatively, we have returned $4.5 billion to shareholders since our IPO, putting Rocket in the top 10% of all S&P 500 companies and companies that have listed since 2020, ranked by capital return. Our team members are excited to continue executing on our strategy and to capture the enormous opportunity in front of us. We've already seen our industry begin to consolidate and we are well positioned to gain share and offer more value to our clients across the entire Rocket ecosystem. With that, I'll turn things over to Julie to go deeper into the numbers. Julie?\nJulie Booth: Thank you, Jay, and good afternoon everyone. Rocket delivered outstanding results in 2021 as we continue to drive growth in our less rate-sensitive products, build out our platform through continued organic investment as well as through the recent acquisition of Truebill and return substantial levels of capital to our shareholders. As Jay mentioned, 2021 was a record year for us as we delivered $351 billion in closed loan volume, 10% above the prior record set in 2020. This growth in volume was driven by our best year ever in purchase, along with record levels of cash out refinance volume. We saw purchase growth across both the direct-to-consumer and partner network channels with particularly strong growth year-over-year from our partner network, which includes both TPO and premier enterprise partners. While industry estimates of the total market size are still preliminary, it is clear that Rocket Mortgage gained meaningful market share in 2021, continuing our long-term trend of share growth. Based on the MBA's most recent estimate, Rocket increased its place in the market by 100 basis points to now account for nearly 9% market share for the full year 2021. Our gains in 2021 are particularly impressive considering the mix of refinance transactions declined as a percent on the total market during 2021. We increased our share of both purchase and refi transactions, demonstrating the flexibility of our centralized platform. Turning to fourth quarter results. Rocket Companies generated $2.4 billion of adjusted revenue in Q4, a 33% increase from Q4 2019. We had $883 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter, up 19% from Q4 2019, representing a 36% adjusted EBITDA margin. We delivered adjusted net income of $637 million, exceeding Q4 of 2019 by 23%. For the fourth quarter, we generated closed loan volume of $75.9 billion, which was in line with our expectations and exceeded Q4 2019 levels by 49%. Our all-in gain on sale margins came in at 280 basis points in Q4, in line with expectations. Our net rate lock volume for the fourth quarter was $68.4 billion, coming in slightly below our expectations. The variance relative to our expectations was largely due to unforeseen disruptions from the COVID-19 Omicron variant, which impacted client engagement, our workforce and our broker partners. Rate lock volume was more impacted than closed volume as the timing of rate lock occurs prior to the closing of a loan. We continue to maintain a superior net client retention rate and as of December 31, 2021 this metric stood at 91%. These high levels of retention, in addition to the new clients we continue to drive to our platform every quarter, has substantially increased the size and value of our servicing portfolio over the past year. As of December 31, 2021, we now have 2.6 million clients with $552 billion in unpaid principal balance, increases of 25% and 35%, respectively, as compared to December 31, 2020. The servicing book provides a natural hedge to our originations as its value increases when interest rates rise. As of December 31, 2021, our MSR portfolio represented a $5.4 billion asset on our balance sheet, up 88% from December 31, 2020. If we were to close the books today, the value of our MSR asset would be in excess of $6 billion due to the increase in interest rates since year-end. Recurring cash revenues from our servicing book hit an annualized run rate of over $1.4 billion during the fourth quarter. As a reminder, the balance sheet value of our MSR asset only includes the discounted cash flows associated to servicing strip as the GAAP accounting rules do not allow us to include the retention value of future origination revenue. When considering that we have consistently maintained a net client retention rate north of 90%, we believe the GAAP accounting rules understate the true intrinsic value of our MSR assets. Looking ahead to Q1, despite a rise in mortgage rates at the beginning of 2022, we continue to see a robust mortgage market by historical standards. The median U.S. home value has increased 25% over the last two years, equating directly to larger loan sizes. In addition, demand from homebuyers remains strong, demonstrated by the record levels of verified approval letters we are providing at Rocket Mortgage, up 50% year-over-year in January. And lastly, today, American homeowners are sitting on record levels of home equity. As Jay mentioned, third-party sources estimate total American home equity at $25 trillion. For the first quarter, we currently expect to closed loan volume in the range of $52 million to $57 billion and rate lock volume between $50 billion and $57 billion. We expect first quarter gain on sale margin to be in the range of 280 to 310 basis points. Regarding operating expenses, we expect Q1 expenses to be in line with Q4 levels excluding one-time items that occurred in Q4. Our GAAP expenses in the fourth quarter included a one-time extinguishment of debt expense of $87 million and a $19 million true-up to the tax liability under our tax receivable agreement. Excluding these items, our Q4 expenses were $1.63 billion. We expect this to be a good run rate for Q1 expenses. This takes into account reductions in productions in production related expenses, offset by seasonally higher expenses in Q1 for marketing and compensation related expenses. Q1 2022 will also reflect full quarter consolidation of Truebill for the first time. Excluding the addition of Truebill, we expect our Q1 expenses to be down over $100 million year-over-year compared to Q1 of 2021. The acquisition of Truebill contributes incremental annualized recurring revenue of more than $100 million on top of the $1.4 billion of annualized cash revenue generated by our servicing portfolio. Truebill's growth has been impressive. And as we work together to unlock the synergies across our platform, we see even more opportunities to grow. Turning to our balance sheet, liquidity and capital allocation, we exited 2021 with $2.1 billion of cash on the balance sheet and additional $3.5 billion of corporate cash used to self-fund loan originations for total available cash and self-funding of $5.6 billion. Total liquidity stood at $9.1 billion as of December 31, including available cash plus undrawn lines of credit and undrawn MSR lines. Our $5.6 billion of available cash and self-funding, combined with $5.4 billion of mortgage servicing rights, represents a total of $11 billion of asset value on our balance sheet as of December 31. This equates to $5.58 per share. The earnings power of Rocket Companies over the last two years has been remarkable. In strong markets, the scale of our profitability rivals the best fintech companies in the world. To put this in perspective, our adjusted net income of $12.8 billion over the last two years combined, was larger than PayPal and nearly as large as MasterCard. We have demonstrated discipline allocating the capital generated by our business. Inclusive of last year's special dividend of $1.11 per share, the special dividend of $1.01 per share announced today and the more than $300 million of share repurchases that we have made since our IPO, we have distributed a total of $4.5 billion to all classes of shareholders since we went public less than two years ago. This ranks Rocket among the best-in-class for capital return. As Jay stated earlier, relative to our current market capitalization, Rocket ranks in the top 10% of all S&P 500 companies and companies that have listed since 2020. We have also deployed capital to grow our platform with the acquisition of Truebill for $1.3 billion in December. We will continue to deploy our capital in a strategic and disciplined manner to generate long-term shareholder value. With that, we're ready to turn it back to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Doug Harter from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nDoug Harter: Thanks. Jay, since we spoke last, that the markets have been quite volatile with rates and mortgage spreads moving quite a bit. Can you just talk about how \u2013 what your outlook is for the market for the overall market size in the coming year? And how you're positioning Rocket to compete in that environment?\nJay Farner: Yes. Thanks for the question. As I mentioned, in my remarks, I think this is an important topic to discuss. It's hard to know market size. Of course, any event on any given day can determine, like we're noticing here today in Europe, can determine what might happen. So what we focus on are kind of our long-term playbook to ensure that we can continue to grow like we have here for the last 36 years. In particular and why I mentioned this in my remarks is that when you see a rapid increase in interest rates, like we've experienced in the last 60 days or so, there are a few levers you can pull. For us being a centralized business model, with the brand and technology, our lever is training. Our lever is skill. Our lever is investing in our team members. We had a bit of a challenge because at the same time that this increase occurred, the Omicron outbreak here, in particular, Michigan and Ohio, caused us to send everyone home, making it a bit more challenging for training. But we've got people back in the office now. And as I referenced before, here in the last week, we've seen, I think, about roughly 90% of all of our loan volume the less interest rate-sensitive products, cash out refinance, rate and terms, purchase. So I bring all that up because the leverage you notice that we aren't pulling is the margin lever, and Julie can talk more about this. This is important. The way that we have always thought on operating our business is that the units that we generate, the mortgage, we're talking about the mortgage business needs to be a high revenue, profitable unit as you structure your business in a way where you're driving that, you do a few things. First of all, you don't teach your organization that's a solution to growing market share is cutting margin. I'm seeing numbers here. Our direct-to-consumer in Q4, I think it was north of 400 basis points, and seeing people come in at like 250 basis points. You can run those numbers, but how can you invest in marketing at 250 basis points, how can you invest in technology at 250 basis how can you keep your best LOs at 250 basis points? How can you keep your best underwriters? Like all of the entire heartbeat of your organization needs to be supported through profitability. And although you may not grab market share over 30 or 45 days, you keep your organization focused on the real things that matter, the client experience, the brand, the marketing, the tech, and in the long run, that's how you grow your company. So you've noticed, we didn't go to cut margin. We're going to focus on the training. So whether the \u2013 it's hard for me to project what the market in 2022 will be. Here's what I know. Over the course of time, this is a huge market. And if we keep investing in all of the things that we've just talked about, we will win that market share. And the last thing I'll say is that when you look at \u2013 you watch us, but if you cut margin and then you look at your profitability and you don't have any, the next thing you can as you cut your marketing. And now you don't have the lease book. And then you don't have lease book, you cut your LOs because I have nothing to give them. And that that's a death spiral. And so you'll notice that's \u2013 we're going in the opposite direction of that, continue to invest. That's what we've done. And that's why I brought up where we were a few years ago in a similar interest rate market to give a comparison of and making the right investments, then you take advantage of opportunity, you grow substantially, you reset your foundation, which is what we're doing now, and you prepare yourself for continued growth.\nDoug Harter: I appreciate that. And just to follow-up, when you're talking about cash out, refi and purchase being less rate sensitive, can you just talk about how higher rates impact that? And is there kind of a breakpoint where the higher rates start to kind of slow down overall volumes and people's appetites?\nJay Farner: This is an important topic because rate is relative to the other ways that you borrow money. And so we're fortunate that mortgage rates don't sit by themselves. They sit with other vehicles that someone might use a credit card, a personal loan, a home equity line of credit, those sorts of things. And so with the benefit of mortgages and how they're done in this country, with the benefit of tax deduction, even if we see a pickup in interest rates, it still, in most cases, is the best way for our clients to achieve their goals. And the other thing that I think is critically important here, when you're buying a home or when you're noticing that you can't find a home and say now you're going to invest in a new kitchen or putting on an addition or whatever it might be, then the client becomes less rate sensitive, whether they receive 4.5% on their 30-year or 4.625% to 4.25%, that's not really the driver. The driver is achieving that new thing that they want, that new home or the kid's college education or the new kitchen. And that's where scale, that's where brand, that's where confidence in our company comes through. And so that's why in a rising rate market like this, we have an advantage because our conversation shifts from a rate in finance where everyone is fixated on every age in rate to, hey, I want to get this done. So I have a bed in for the baby that's on the way in eight months. And so that's how we think about it. It's the real conversation is about the opportunity you're creating for the client. If we just take a step back, 4.5% or so on a 30-year fixed rate, it's still incredibly low interest rates incredibly advantageous for clients to take advantage of it.\nDoug Harter: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJames Faucette: Thank you so much. I'm wondering, and it seems it's always a topic on your calls. So I apologize maybe in advance. But can you talk about a little bit how gain on sale margins are trending? What you're seeing? What your planning assumptions are for, how those evolve over coming quarters and periods, especially in quite a volatile environment?\nJay Farner: Yes. I'll let Julie feel that. Obviously, you can see our guidance here. And so we're feeling confident about where our margins have been here in Q4 and where we head in Q1. But Julie can give you more color.\nJulie Booth: Yes. Let me just give you a little bit more insight. So sale margins during the fourth quarter did come in within our expectations at the midpoint of our guided range at 280 basis points. And just kind of as a reference point, our Q2 2021 gain on sale margin came in at 278 basis points. Q3, excluding the impact of the removal of the adverse market fee, in the third quarter was 295 basis points. So we're really seeing margin stability since the second quarter of 2021, and we're seeing that stability to continue into Q1 as our expectations are gain on sale margin to be increasing at the midpoint to between 280 and 310 basis points. So we're continuing to see strength, as Jay mentioned, especially the direct-to-consumer channel where we're seeing margins there. I've talked about historically kind of that 400 basis points range for those margins, and we're still seeing very strong margins, as Jay said. That has been a lot of others that you'll see out there as well. So we're really pleased with where we're seeing them go into Q1 here.\nJames Faucette: Got it. And Julie, maybe just to be clear, so the improvement that you're expecting, is that all mix-driven? And is that \u2013 or is there something happening in the market that's providing some additional support? And I guess as part of that, particularly the direct-to-consumer, can you talk a little bit about like how that \u2013 how you're doing in terms of hitting your objectives and growing share with consumers and especially as the market becomes more purchase-based?\nJay Farner: Yes. I'll jump in and Julie has some comments, too. But going back to the first question in, there's an initial kind of competitive situation as many lenders scramble, many cut margin. And so everyone is fighting for that business. as times move on and if rates continue to kind of stay where they're at will continue to rise, and we talked about the people cutting margin, then as I described before, now they have to come out of the market. Now they reduce their marketing spend. And actually, what happens is we now have less competition. That lead that maybe two or three other people we're talking to now is just us or it's us and only one other lender. And so that actually creates an environment where we can be even more confident in standing behind our margins. So not mix as much as it's just kind of the cycle that you go through the initial kind of playing that people do try to win through price will subside and then all of a sudden, you're left with a new playing field with fewer competitors out there talking to the same clients that you're talking to. Julie, any other comments?\nJames Faucette: Got it. And just \u2013 yes. Sorry, Julie.\nJulie Booth: Yes. I guess I'll just add to that, too. Certainly, mix is a peak not a big piece of different here. We're also seeing strength in the partner network channel relative to where we had seen margins coming in. So I think that also is really contributing here to the strength we're seeing.\nJames Faucette: That\u2019s awesome. Thanks for all the color guys.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kevin Barker from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Hi Kevin, is your line on mute? The next question comes from Ryan McKeveny from Zelman and Associates. Please go ahead.\nRyan McKeveny: Hey, good afternoon. Thank you. Jay, as you said, you'd get more questions on the topic of volume and margin. But think especially that first answer you gave hit on a lot of the [indiscernible] was wondering. So I will shift a little. I wanted to focus on the expense side. Julie, correct me if I'm wrong, I think the commentary you gave was that out of the 4Q expense level was a good run rate for 1Q. So correct me if I'm wrong there, but I'm thinking more as we move through the year, any commentary you can provide about what we should expect from the expense side of things, given obviously the revenue side is fairly uncertain. And maybe just remind us in terms of the cost base, how much is fixed versus variable? Anything that can kind of help us bridge the gap between an uncertain revenue environment relative to your expense base and ultimately profitability. Thank you.\nJulie Booth: Yes. Thanks for the question, and I'll kind of reiterate some of the things that I said in my prepared remarks. I know I said a lot there. So first of all, let me start by saying that we are very thoughtful about our costs, and I do want to be clear about that. So I'll share a couple of things relative to the fourth quarter to Q1 and reiterate some of the things I said earlier. So our total Q4 expenses were $1.74 billion, and this included two onetime items: one of which was $87 million associated with the early extinguishment of a portion of our outstanding bonds, and the other one was $19 million of expense associated with the revaluation of our tax receivable agreement liability. So if you exclude those two onetime items from Q4, our total expenses would have been $1.63 billion. So that's down $60 million from our Q3 levels. Then as we look ahead into 2022, we do expect expenses in the first quarter to be relatively consistent with Q4, as I mentioned, excluding those onetime items. And there's a few moving parts impacting Q1 that are important to understand. We do expect production-related expenses to continue to come down by more than $80 million in Q1 compared to Q4. However, these costs are being partially offset in Q1 by some seasonal items, including payroll taxes and our 401(k) match cost, which both reset at the beginning of the year and also some additional marketing expense that's going to be \u2013 that it was incurred with the Super Bowl ad that we did. And then the other thing I'll mention on less to in Q1 is that, that quarter is going to now include a full quarter of Truebill expenses as we closed on that acquisition in late December. So Truebill will also typically see higher marketing spend in the first quarter as many consumers are looking to improve their financial health as part of their New Year's resolutions and this marketing spend, we see a little bit higher and it does drive seasonal lift in the user base and revenue growth. As we look a little bit further out than that at our current volume levels, we would expect expenses to decline modestly beyond Q1 as well. So that's the trend that we're seeing.\nRyan McKeveny: Okay. Thank you very helpful.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kevin Barker from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nKevin Barker: Hi, can you hear me now?\nJay Farner: Yes.\nKevin Barker: Sorry about that earlier. So Julie, you mentioned earlier that you're seeing a lot of more opportunities to grow, particularly with the Truebill acquisition, and it seemed like it was exceeding your expectations. I don't want to put a word in mouth, but it sounded that way. Is there anything in particular that stands out to you where you're seeing significant more opportunities to grow outside of your core mortgage business through the acquisition and various other ancillary businesses?\nJay Farner: Well, maybe I'll jump in there. I think the Truebill business is exciting for us. As Julie said, they kind of had their fifth quarter in January, they consider it because there's so many people thinking about their finances. But we've got this question a lot about Truebill and the thought process behind Truebill, and so I think it's important to walk through. There are really kind of three elements that we're heading forward on with Truebill. The first is having that single time on solution. And that may not sound like much, but without that, our Rocket clients, the millions of clients we have in our servicing portfolio, the millions of clients that we'll deal with all the way through 2022, would have to create yet another account to access Truebill. And so you're adding a single sign-on solution where they can use the same account or transfer or use their Rocket account is incredibly important. Especially as we continue to market, we're talking to clients who may be seven, eight, nine months out from purchasing a home. Today, we may have to buy that lead again. As we launch single sign-on, those clients can now engage with Truebill to do their budgeting, they can engage with Truebill to more kind of credit score. They can engage with Truebill to save some money. And we keep getting signaled as they engage. Act as a ability for us to send push notifications to them, that really we don\u2019t have today. And so we keep those purchase clients engaged. Same on the refinance side. And probably equally more and more as we turn on things side, because we talked about it. We are talking to people today. [indiscernible] but they may or may not, makes sense at this moment. At the end we would probably spend marketing dollars later to bring them back in to the funnel. What Truebill can offer additional ways to start their savings plan, engage and bring that to best. So that\u2019s the important component of single sign-up. As we move to test that, as Truebill continues to see success in addition to our Rocket market network is doing, Truebill gives us another avenue to bring million plus additional premium users in, not only does it generate like Julie mentioned 100 millions of revenue and growing. But its taking another funnel for our spend interact with folks and eventually find solutions as we're studying their credit report and studying their bank statements to offer a refinance to offer a new card and those sorts of things. So it's a new \u2013 brand-new lead gen funnel for us. And then the third will be our servicing book. So we've talked about the leads that we get. We've talked about the Truebill that we get, but there's also this opportunity to engage our servicing platform. We have a 91% retention rate. There\u2019s still opportunity there to find additional ways to help our $1.6 billion and growing servicing clients. And today, we have lots of tools in our Rocket Mortgage servicing platform. But as we continue forward and offer bill negotiation, subscription management, better budgeting tools, all of that will create a more robust engagement with our client base and should give us more confidence as we think about acquiring MSRs as we think about adding MSRs. And so all of those are significant growth opportunities powered by Truebill.\nKevin Barker: So to follow up on that, is there any way to quantify the decrease in lead generation costs associated with having Truebill within the Rocket Companies? Or is there a way to say that a certain percentage of existing Truebill customers or future Truebill customers are going to become Rocket Mortgage customers that we can say they\u2019re going to generate x amount of revenue and then suddenly, they\u2019re in the ecosystem and they become 91% attrition \u2013 retention rate. So is there any way to quantify that for us?\nJay Farner: Yes. So those we\u2019re thinking about CAC or cost to acquire and how that adjusts that over time or LTV, which is probably important to us. We\u2019ve given some slides in the past about examples of what LTV could look like. Those are all the things that we are \u2013 here\u2019s what I can say, those are things that our data team is on every minute of every day. Our finance team is studying goals and KPIs are being set, and we are driving towards those, but those aren\u2019t numbers that we are disclosing at this point in time. But just know that the operation of this business focuses on all of those critical things and you\u2019re drilling down exactly why we did this acquisition because we have a strong belief that this has not been done in the mortgage space before. And so this is something that can really continue to add to the reducing CAC and increasing the LTV of our client base.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you, Jay.\nOperator: The next question comes from Arren Cyganovich from Citi. Please go ahead.\nArren Cyganovich: I was hoping you could address the funding and capital usage that you have, recently issuing a decent amount of new unsecured debt, which is attractive pricing. But just curious, the thought process there ahead of doing another relatively large special dividend in share repurchases and balancing those items.\nJulie Booth: Yes. So if you\u2019re asking about the issuance of the bond, and that was something that was really strategic for us to be able to lower our cost of funding. So that was fairly significant for us in terms of the overall cost funding. It was 60 basis points of lower cost there. So that was something that allowed us to issue some debt and as I mentioned [indiscernible] and pay off actually some of our debt. So that was an opportunistic time for us to be able to build capital at a time when we executed at pricing that was really unseen before for a company like us. So we were very proud of that execution.\nArren Cyganovich: And then just in terms of the choice of special dividends, and I don\u2019t know, it just seems like you didn\u2019t really need the cash, you raised cash and then you\u2019re doing special dividends, just been trying to understand the thought process there.\nJulie Booth: Yes. It was at a time in the market when it really was advantageous for us to go to market to raise that additional capital, and we are always looking at the capital. The earnings that we\u2019ve had since that time coming into the business as well gave us an opportunity. I\u2019ll just kind of maybe reiterate how we think about capital. First of all, we think about capitalizing the business properly, investing in our platform. We have the acquisition of Truebill as well for $1.3 billion. So another thing that we invested in. We have been acquiring mortgage servicing rights as well. During 2021, we acquired about $200 million worth of mortgage servicing rights. So all of that factored in then as we look at returning capital to shareholders, we\u2019re thinking about all the time. And we\u2019ve now returned, as I said, $4.5 billion to our shareholders since going public. So...\nJay Farner: And I think it\u2019s \u2013 look, it was the right time to do it because it was very advantageous. We did extinguish some existing debt at a higher interest rate. But when we think about the dividend, we\u2019re looking at the profitability of the company and funding at least funding that cash is \u2013 funding that with the profitability of the company.\nArren Cyganovich: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Richard Shane from JPM. Please go ahead.\nRichard Shane: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question this afternoon. In all of the chaos of getting ready for earnings and everything else is happening in the world today, FHFA announced that they are reconsidering eligibility requirements for single-family seller servicers. I\u2019m kind of curious how you look at this as a large player in that space, the advantages and disadvantages for you? And what you think it might \u2013 how it might impact the competitive landscape?\nJay Farner: You guys there?\nRichard Shane: Can you guys hear me?\nOperator: Yes, I can hear you. Hold on. Speakers, is your line muted?\nJay Farner: Yes. Sorry, guys. We were talking and we \u2013 apparently, you weren\u2019t listening. Bob, so you can probably comment it on. But I think we just reviewed those. I think there are some capital requirements that they have increased. And based on the last question on the dividend, we\u2019re in great shape in terms of having enough capital. But Bob, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve got additional comments?\nBob Walters: No, I mean there\u2019s is nobody is in a stronger position financially from a liquidity standpoint, all the things from a capitalization standpoint than we are. So we\u2019re totally fine with that. In fact, I think over time, it becomes an advantage because you have some pretty thinly capitalize folks out there that it will become a considerable challenge for them. So we don\u2019t look to the regulator for competitive advantage, but in this case, we will get it.\nJay Farner: Yes. The only thing that I would say also that kind of typically goes with that is that as we think about the broader platform, we touched on this before, and we\u2019ve acquired MSRs. We\u2019re always strategically looking to acquire MSRs. And so if there\u2019s fewer people out there thinking about making that acquisition, probably in the long haul, it makes it even \u2013 it could be easier for us to make those acquisitions with our LTV, we\u2019re probably in a better position to do that than others.\nBob Walters: I think we heard it from recent earnings calls, there are some folks that are selling, servicing now to gain liquidity. And so that creates a pretty significant opportunity for us as well.\nRichard Shane: Great. Thank you guys.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brock Vandervliet from UBS. Please go ahead.\nBrock Vandervliet: Good afternoon. Thanks for the questions. Jay, I appreciated your comments earlier about marketing. Just if we could go maybe one layer deeper on that. How do you think about the return on marketing spend as we transition from, call it, a $4 trillion to $2.5 trillion or so market, your return on investment around those marketing dollars, I would think, would decline simply because the markets that much smaller? How should we think about that?\nJay Farner: Yes. It\u2019s probably three important components here. And again, that\u2019s why it\u2019s important to let things play out over a few months. Although initially you might see people scrambling to market performance marketing in particular. Over time, as companies reduce their margin, they then typically reduce their marketing cost as well. So there could be an increased amount of competition for some period, but then actually opportunity to go in and own spaces as people back away. So what you have to do from a marketing budget perspective is you have to shift more of your dollars. So as we were running performance marketing and what we consider kind of performance brand marketing, you\u2019ll see us shift increasing the performance side of the house, right? And so you\u2019ll notice there\u2019ll be more on digital. There will be more on DR. We\u2019ll get more robust in tracking those DR responses, a little bit more surgical. So watching it by state or county or city or those type of things to understand how our dollar is working. And then, of course, flaring our attribution models on top to make sure that, that brand spend we\u2019re doing is also supporting that. So there\u2019s not a big change to how we think about the return on the marketing dollars. It\u2019s just \u2013 this is like a reset that gives you an opportunity to maybe find areas that six months ago, a year ago, we\u2019re being \u2013 a lot of people are trying to make \u2013 to buy in those areas. Now they\u2019re backing away, you can come in, you can buy. And then that\u2019s \u2013 the last thing I\u2019ll say is that is why the Truebill conversation, the value of the MSR going up, all of that matters because you\u2019re rethinking your models based on the data coming in, the lifetime value of the client, the increase in the value of the MSR that you\u2019re acquiring, that matters. So we\u2019re always resetting the reports that we do to ensure that we\u2019re spending properly. But that\u2019s it. It\u2019s just a mathematical decisions behind the scenes and shifting more to performance.\nBrock Vandervliet: Okay. And just as a follow-up, I think this was Julie\u2019s comment that expenses should decline modestly beyond of Q1. What\u2019s the geography of that decline? Is that \u2013 where is that coming from basically?\nJulie Booth: Yes. We\u2019re just giving guidance really on Q1 at this point. So as we look ahead, we would that over time. If you think about our costs, there\u2019s some variable costs that adjust immediately with production, and there\u2019s some that do take a little bit more time to work into overtime. So as we think about those declining that\u2019s why I say that because some of those are going to take a bit more time.\nJay Farner: Yes. I\u2019m going to jump in here, though, too. I think this is important. So we touched on this all the time. We\u2019ve invested and we\u2019ll continue to invest in marketing in our brand. We continue to invest in technology. We\u2019ve got thousands of technologists here, writing software that make our systems better, make our mortgages more efficient, make our conversion rates better. We\u2019ve got the most skilled operations people from the United States of America who know how to work and process, underwrite and close loans. We\u2019ve got the best mortgage banking force in this country, nearly 6,000 or so of those folks. That\u2019s the heartbeat of our organization, right? Everything we have is due to the success of those individuals. And so we\u2019re not going to have a conference call where all of a sudden, we let a group of them now, they\u2019re not going to be working here any longer. That\u2019s just not how we do this. These \u2013 that profitability is important, but the investment in our team members is the most important thing that leads to the future growth of this organization.\nJulie Booth: Yes. So we\u2019ve seen this time and time again as we go through these cycles. We have been through the opportunity that it creates holding a bit more of that excess capacity really does pay dividends in the end. So you may see us do that.\nBrock Vandervliet: Got it. Understood. Thanks for the color guys.\nJay Farner: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark DeVries from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMark DeVries: Yes, thank you. Sorry if I missed this, but could you just comment on how your efforts to gain share in the purchase market have been trending these last couple of months as refi really starts to fade?\nJay Farner: Yes. So again, as we think about it, we really think less or noninterest rate-sensitive products because there\u2019s $25 trillion of home equity out there. So whether someone \u2013 and with inventory levels the way they\u2019re at, whether someone purchases a new home or invest in their existing home, both are huge opportunities for us. Now we\u2019re very pleased to exceed. I think we\u2019ve set a goal for purchase and talk about it, exceed our 2021 purchase goal, really proud of the team for achieving that. And so we\u2019re \u2013 as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we had good momentum. We continue to have good momentum in purchase those verified approval letters I think the pipeline is the biggest it\u2019s ever been as we walked into January of 2022. And then the training around cash out, the training around a term change that we implemented in the first quarter of this year, as I mentioned, I think we\u2019re down near 90% of our production today is falling into that less interest rate-sensitive bucket. So all in all, going very well and touching on another question that we had, once you make that switch, then your mortgage banking force is talking to individuals where rate is not the most important thing. Achieving the goal is the most important thing. And that allows for marketing growth but also allows for conversion increase. And I didn\u2019t even touch on, again, the 2.5 million, 2.6 million service clients that we\u2019ve got, as that value of the MSRs increases, it doesn\u2019t mean that we won\u2019t see opportunity to assist those clients as well in the retention. So all of the levers that we \u2013 like I said earlier, different than others, but the levers that we choose to pull in a rising rate market are going very well.\nMark DeVries: Okay. Great. And then just a follow-up question on kind of the efforts to tap into borrower equity. Does a move in mortgage rates this meaningful kind of require you to switch a little bit more from trying to market a cash-out refi to doing more of like a home equity line of credit or just a second lien?\nJay Farner: We haven\u2019t experienced that. Again, as I said before, typically as rates rise, all rates rise. So it\u2019s just about the comparison of another way to achieve the goal versus mortgage. And so certainly, your mortgage payment is going to be a bit higher if you\u2019re getting 4.5% on a 30 year than 3.5%. But in the grand scheme of life, and most of our clients have seen this, that\u2019s still an incredibly low interest rate, a fixed interest rate that they can count on over time. And so we\u2019ve not \u2013 in terms of objections that you might hear people telling us that there\u2019s a better source to achieve those goals, has not been one that\u2019s been surfacing.\nMark DeVries: Okay. That\u2019s interesting. All right. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bose George from KBW. Please go ahead.\nBose George: Hey everyone. Good afternoon. I just wanted to follow up on the cash out. So you guys noted 90% of the originations are not rate sensitive. I was curious, how do you treat refis for a borrower extracts equity, but also has a rate incentive to refi, so sort of an opportunistic cash out refi? Are there many borrowers kind of in that category?\nJay Farner: Well, I\u2019m sure there are certain borrowers in that category. But again, when we think about the purpose and the borrower usually or the client, as we call them, we\u2019ll usually tell us what it is. That may be an ancillary benefit, but the strong desire for the call or the lead or the outreach is because they\u2019re trying to achieve some sort of cash out we get, whether it\u2019s home improvement or covering the college education or unfortunately going through a divorce or whatever the case may be, that\u2019s the driver behind it, not the additional possibility of a reduction in rate in most cases.\nBose George: Okay. Great. Thanks. And then actually, just going back to the gain on sale discussion, you might have addressed this, but the guidance, does the channel mix play a role in the guidance at all? Or is that assuming kind of the similar channel mix to what you had this quarter?\nJulie Booth: The channel mix has the minimal impact on that. Really, what we\u2019re seeing is improvement in the partner network margins as well. So while there is some impact to that, holding steady on that direct-to-consumer gain on sale margin, as I mentioned, in that 400 basis point range, as I said, historically, kind of where we\u2019re at and then that improvement in partner network.\nBose George: Okay. Great. Thanks.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Jay Farner for any closing remarks.\nJay Farner: Yes. Thanks everybody for the questions today. We appreciate and most importantly, thank you for our team members as they have done an amazing job here the last few months of dealing with all of the kind of curve balls of COVID and returning to the office and the shifting and changing in the market and the acquisition of Truebill, I mean we just \u2013 we\u2019ve got a lot of things going on, and to see the entire team rally together has been \u2013 it\u2019s just incredible in the 26 years I\u2019ve been here. So...\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Julie Booth",
            "content": "Thank you, Jay, and good afternoon everyone. Rocket delivered outstanding results in 2021 as we continue to drive growth in our less rate-sensitive products, build out our platform through continued organic investment as well as through the recent acquisition of Truebill and return substantial levels of capital to our shareholders. As Jay mentioned, 2021 was a record year for us as we delivered $351 billion in closed loan volume, 10% above the prior record set in 2020. This growth in volume was driven by our best year ever in purchase, along with record levels of cash out refinance volume. We saw purchase growth across both the direct-to-consumer and partner network channels with particularly strong growth year-over-year from our partner network, which includes both TPO and premier enterprise partners. While industry estimates of the total market size are still preliminary, it is clear that Rocket Mortgage gained meaningful market share in 2021, continuing our long-term trend of share growth. Based on the MBA's most recent estimate, Rocket increased its place in the market by 100 basis points to now account for nearly 9% market share for the full year 2021. Our gains in 2021 are particularly impressive considering the mix of refinance transactions declined as a percent on the total market during 2021. We increased our share of both purchase and refi transactions, demonstrating the flexibility of our centralized platform. Turning to fourth quarter results. Rocket Companies generated $2.4 billion of adjusted revenue in Q4, a 33% increase from Q4 2019. We had $883 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter, up 19% from Q4 2019, representing a 36% adjusted EBITDA margin. We delivered adjusted net income of $637 million, exceeding Q4 of 2019 by 23%. For the fourth quarter, we generated closed loan volume of $75.9 billion, which was in line with our expectations and exceeded Q4 2019 levels by 49%. Our all-in gain on sale margins came in at 280 basis points in Q4, in line with expectations. Our net rate lock volume for the fourth quarter was $68.4 billion, coming in slightly below our expectations. The variance relative to our expectations was largely due to unforeseen disruptions from the COVID-19 Omicron variant, which impacted client engagement, our workforce and our broker partners. Rate lock volume was more impacted than closed volume as the timing of rate lock occurs prior to the closing of a loan. We continue to maintain a superior net client retention rate and as of December 31, 2021 this metric stood at 91%. These high levels of retention, in addition to the new clients we continue to drive to our platform every quarter, has substantially increased the size and value of our servicing portfolio over the past year. As of December 31, 2021, we now have 2.6 million clients with $552 billion in unpaid principal balance, increases of 25% and 35%, respectively, as compared to December 31, 2020. The servicing book provides a natural hedge to our originations as its value increases when interest rates rise. As of December 31, 2021, our MSR portfolio represented a $5.4 billion asset on our balance sheet, up 88% from December 31, 2020. If we were to close the books today, the value of our MSR asset would be in excess of $6 billion due to the increase in interest rates since year-end. Recurring cash revenues from our servicing book hit an annualized run rate of over $1.4 billion during the fourth quarter. As a reminder, the balance sheet value of our MSR asset only includes the discounted cash flows associated to servicing strip as the GAAP accounting rules do not allow us to include the retention value of future origination revenue. When considering that we have consistently maintained a net client retention rate north of 90%, we believe the GAAP accounting rules understate the true intrinsic value of our MSR assets. Looking ahead to Q1, despite a rise in mortgage rates at the beginning of 2022, we continue to see a robust mortgage market by historical standards. The median U.S. home value has increased 25% over the last two years, equating directly to larger loan sizes. In addition, demand from homebuyers remains strong, demonstrated by the record levels of verified approval letters we are providing at Rocket Mortgage, up 50% year-over-year in January. And lastly, today, American homeowners are sitting on record levels of home equity. As Jay mentioned, third-party sources estimate total American home equity at $25 trillion. For the first quarter, we currently expect to closed loan volume in the range of $52 million to $57 billion and rate lock volume between $50 billion and $57 billion. We expect first quarter gain on sale margin to be in the range of 280 to 310 basis points. Regarding operating expenses, we expect Q1 expenses to be in line with Q4 levels excluding one-time items that occurred in Q4. Our GAAP expenses in the fourth quarter included a one-time extinguishment of debt expense of $87 million and a $19 million true-up to the tax liability under our tax receivable agreement. Excluding these items, our Q4 expenses were $1.63 billion. We expect this to be a good run rate for Q1 expenses. This takes into account reductions in productions in production related expenses, offset by seasonally higher expenses in Q1 for marketing and compensation related expenses. Q1 2022 will also reflect full quarter consolidation of Truebill for the first time. Excluding the addition of Truebill, we expect our Q1 expenses to be down over $100 million year-over-year compared to Q1 of 2021. The acquisition of Truebill contributes incremental annualized recurring revenue of more than $100 million on top of the $1.4 billion of annualized cash revenue generated by our servicing portfolio. Truebill's growth has been impressive. And as we work together to unlock the synergies across our platform, we see even more opportunities to grow. Turning to our balance sheet, liquidity and capital allocation, we exited 2021 with $2.1 billion of cash on the balance sheet and additional $3.5 billion of corporate cash used to self-fund loan originations for total available cash and self-funding of $5.6 billion. Total liquidity stood at $9.1 billion as of December 31, including available cash plus undrawn lines of credit and undrawn MSR lines. Our $5.6 billion of available cash and self-funding, combined with $5.4 billion of mortgage servicing rights, represents a total of $11 billion of asset value on our balance sheet as of December 31. This equates to $5.58 per share. The earnings power of Rocket Companies over the last two years has been remarkable. In strong markets, the scale of our profitability rivals the best fintech companies in the world. To put this in perspective, our adjusted net income of $12.8 billion over the last two years combined, was larger than PayPal and nearly as large as MasterCard. We have demonstrated discipline allocating the capital generated by our business. Inclusive of last year's special dividend of $1.11 per share, the special dividend of $1.01 per share announced today and the more than $300 million of share repurchases that we have made since our IPO, we have distributed a total of $4.5 billion to all classes of shareholders since we went public less than two years ago. This ranks Rocket among the best-in-class for capital return. As Jay stated earlier, relative to our current market capitalization, Rocket ranks in the top 10% of all S&P 500 companies and companies that have listed since 2020. We have also deployed capital to grow our platform with the acquisition of Truebill for $1.3 billion in December. We will continue to deploy our capital in a strategic and disciplined manner to generate long-term shareholder value. With that, we're ready to turn it back to the operator for questions. Yes. Let me just give you a little bit more insight. So sale margins during the fourth quarter did come in within our expectations at the midpoint of our guided range at 280 basis points. And just kind of as a reference point, our Q2 2021 gain on sale margin came in at 278 basis points. Q3, excluding the impact of the removal of the adverse market fee, in the third quarter was 295 basis points. So we're really seeing margin stability since the second quarter of 2021, and we're seeing that stability to continue into Q1 as our expectations are gain on sale margin to be increasing at the midpoint to between 280 and 310 basis points. So we're continuing to see strength, as Jay mentioned, especially the direct-to-consumer channel where we're seeing margins there. I've talked about historically kind of that 400 basis points range for those margins, and we're still seeing very strong margins, as Jay said. That has been a lot of others that you'll see out there as well. So we're really pleased with where we're seeing them go into Q1 here. Yes. I guess I'll just add to that, too. Certainly, mix is a peak not a big piece of different here. We're also seeing strength in the partner network channel relative to where we had seen margins coming in. So I think that also is really contributing here to the strength we're seeing. Yes. Thanks for the question, and I'll kind of reiterate some of the things that I said in my prepared remarks. I know I said a lot there. So first of all, let me start by saying that we are very thoughtful about our costs, and I do want to be clear about that. So I'll share a couple of things relative to the fourth quarter to Q1 and reiterate some of the things I said earlier. So our total Q4 expenses were $1.74 billion, and this included two onetime items: one of which was $87 million associated with the early extinguishment of a portion of our outstanding bonds, and the other one was $19 million of expense associated with the revaluation of our tax receivable agreement liability. So if you exclude those two onetime items from Q4, our total expenses would have been $1.63 billion. So that's down $60 million from our Q3 levels. Then as we look ahead into 2022, we do expect expenses in the first quarter to be relatively consistent with Q4, as I mentioned, excluding those onetime items. And there's a few moving parts impacting Q1 that are important to understand. We do expect production-related expenses to continue to come down by more than $80 million in Q1 compared to Q4. However, these costs are being partially offset in Q1 by some seasonal items, including payroll taxes and our 401(k) match cost, which both reset at the beginning of the year and also some additional marketing expense that's going to be \u2013 that it was incurred with the Super Bowl ad that we did. And then the other thing I'll mention on less to in Q1 is that, that quarter is going to now include a full quarter of Truebill expenses as we closed on that acquisition in late December. So Truebill will also typically see higher marketing spend in the first quarter as many consumers are looking to improve their financial health as part of their New Year's resolutions and this marketing spend, we see a little bit higher and it does drive seasonal lift in the user base and revenue growth. As we look a little bit further out than that at our current volume levels, we would expect expenses to decline modestly beyond Q1 as well. So that's the trend that we're seeing. Yes. So if you're asking about the issuance of the bond, and that was something that was really strategic for us to be able to lower our cost of funding. So that was fairly significant for us in terms of the overall cost funding. It was 60 basis points of lower cost there. So that was something that allowed us to issue some debt and as I mentioned [indiscernible] and pay off actually some of our debt. So that was an opportunistic time for us to be able to build capital at a time when we executed at pricing that was really unseen before for a company like us. So we were very proud of that execution. Yes. It was at a time in the market when it really was advantageous for us to go to market to raise that additional capital, and we are always looking at the capital. The earnings that we've had since that time coming into the business as well gave us an opportunity. I'll just kind of maybe reiterate how we think about capital. First of all, we think about capitalizing the business properly, investing in our platform. We have the acquisition of Truebill as well for $1.3 billion. So another thing that we invested in. We have been acquiring mortgage servicing rights as well. During 2021, we acquired about $200 million worth of mortgage servicing rights. So all of that factored in then as we look at returning capital to shareholders, we're thinking about all the time. And we've now returned, as I said, $4.5 billion to our shareholders since going public. So... Yes. We're just giving guidance really on Q1 at this point. So as we look ahead, we would that over time. If you think about our costs, there's some variable costs that adjust immediately with production, and there's some that do take a little bit more time to work into overtime. So as we think about those declining that's why I say that because some of those are going to take a bit more time. Yes. So we've seen this time and time again as we go through these cycles. We have been through the opportunity that it creates holding a bit more of that excess capacity really does pay dividends in the end. So you may see us do that. The channel mix has the minimal impact on that. Really, what we're seeing is improvement in the partner network margins as well. So while there is some impact to that, holding steady on that direct-to-consumer gain on sale margin, as I mentioned, in that 400 basis point range, as I said, historically, kind of where we're at and then that improvement in partner network."

            "name": "Jay Farner",
            "content": "Thank you, Sharon. Good afternoon, and welcome to the Rocket Companies' earnings call for the fourth quarter and full year of 2021. On today's call, I'll recap our achievements from the past year, including our success driving growth in purchased loans and cash out refinance, continuing to build on the strength of the Rocket Platform through the addition of Truebill, and I'll cover the best-in-class capital returns we have provided to our shareholders since our IPO in August of 2020. Last year was an incredibly successful year for Rocket Companies as we continue to break records. In 2021, Rocket Mortgage reached a company best of $351 billion of originations, which represented a nearly 10% increase from the previous record of $320 billion set in 2020. On a full year basis, Rocket generated $12.4 billion of adjusted revenue, $6.2 billion of adjusted EBITDA and $4.5 billion of adjusted net income. It's worth taking a step back to look at what we've accomplished over the last two years. Comparing closed loan volume and adjusted revenue in 2021, it was more than double our 2019 levels. Our adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income more than tripled in that same period. Also, we have organically grown our service client base by more than 40% since 2019, which today generates recurring cash revenue at an annual run rate exceeding $1.4 billion. The company has grown and strengthened all while generating profitability at scale, returning substantial capital to our shareholders. In the last two years, we have earned a cumulative adjusted net income of more than $12 billion. With today's announcement of our second $2 billion special dividend and the more than $300 million of stock repurchases, we've now returned $4.5 billion of capital to shareholders since our IPO in August of 2020. That represents roughly 20% of our market value based on today's trading price. We're also investing to grow our platform with strategic acquisitions like Truebill. This continued investment in our platform strengthens our core offerings to our consumers who know like and trust our brand, driving increased lifetime value. Looking at our guidance of $52 billion to $57 billion of closed loan volume in the first quarter of 2022, you see, we project to nearly triple our 2018 quarterly run rate of $20 billion, growing significantly faster than other market participants over the last three years. Our first quarter guidance reflects the impact of the Omicron outbreak, which disrupted our business and required us to again send team members home for their safety. Our 36-year history has taught us that our centralized model is a significant advantage in rising rate environments. The ability to train and coach in real time is critical to our success. I'm happy to report that as of February 14, we have returned to the office, and we're already seeing the benefits in the last few weeks. As rates rapidly increase, our strategy has always been to protect our margin and our profitability. During time periods like this, many lenders will significantly reduce their margin in an effort to sustain production. We have found that this is not a sound strategy for profitability, sustainability and maintaining a disciplined approach towards supporting our business long term. I'm certain that this question will come up again in the Q&A, and I'm excited to talk about our strategy to address rising interest rates and continue to grow our business. In fact, we have grown our Mortgage business substantially since the last market cycle by doing the right things, delivering the best client experience in the market, investing in a flexible, scalable multichannel platform that's always ready to quickly capture opportunity, and we've also driven significant mortgage volume growth from less rate-sensitive products, including purchase and cash out refinance. If we look at the last week, since we brought our team members back to the office, our non-rate sensitive products make up nearly 90% of our mortgage production. Last May, we announced our plans to become the number one retail purchase lender, excluding correspondent in the nation by 2023. I'm happy to report that 2021 represented the largest purchase mortgage volume in our company's history, and we are seeing continued momentum here in the early part of 2022. We are well on our way to reaching our stated goal. Additionally, the fourth quarter was our best ever for cash out refinance volume as we leverage our vast data lake, our client insights and, of course, our highly trained Rocket Cloud Force to help our clients take advantage of rising home values. Home equity continues to be at record levels with $25 trillion of equity available to homeowners. Along with the strong growth in the Mortgage segment, we made significant strides last year growing our platform to help Americans with life's most complex moments. We've expanded beyond our core Mortgage business to enable an end-to-end seamless home-buying ecosystem with Amrock, our title and settlement services company, which hit 1.1 million closings in 2021 and is the largest of its kind in the country. At Rocket Homes, we saw a strong growth with the company facilitating more than 30,000 transactions, representing over $8 billion in transaction value. And at Rocket Auto, we more than doubled our GMV in 2021. The talented team at Truebill also joined our family in the fourth quarter. Truebill is a strong addition to our platform as it brings millions of existing clients who have affinity for the brand and are actively working to improve their finances in anticipation of future large purchases like home or auto. Truebill's offerings expand our relationship with our clients by managing subscriptions, improving credit scores and tracking spending, all of which strengthens clients' financial health and enables Rocket to nurture clients in between large, less frequent purchases. Truebill is one of the fastest-growing FinTech businesses in America and was recently named the number one consumer Tech Company by the news publication, The Information. Truebill's growth has been impressive. The company's premium membership base increased by more than 115% in 2021 and has continued to outperform after our acquisition. This is all before we've even begun introducing and incubating the millions of clients in the Rocket ecosystem to Truebill. Rocket and Truebill are aligned in one mission to remove friction from life's complex moments. And the relationship has come together quickly. In fact, our combined teams are currently working together to create a single sign-on solution that will bring the entire Rocket ecosystem together through one unified login. We expect this new experience to launch in the next 30 to 45 days. Another strategic part of our platform that enables us to maintain ongoing relationships is mortgage servicing. With our 2.6 million service clients, our servicing book has grown substantially, providing a natural hedge to our origination business. We are now the fifth largest servicer in the country, with servicing rights representing a $5.4 billion asset as of year-end, while maintaining an industry-best retention rate of 91%. Consider this, our business has created recurring cash flows of more than $1.4 billion annualized through servicing, plus an additional $100 million to the rapidly growing Truebill business, all supporting an incredibly capital-light business. Heading into 2022, we see tremendous opportunity with robust purchase and cash out refinance demand. We view the challenging market conditions like a rising rate environment as an opportunity to shine. This is the time when we see our investments in our platform truly pay off. We don't believe any other company has invested in technology, in brand, and people and partnerships like we have. The partnerships we have with companies like Salesforce, E*TRADE, Charles Schwab, State Farm and many others are built on a proprietary platform that cannot be easily replicated by other lenders or other fintech companies. To ensure consumers are aware of our unique position in the market, we recently aired a number one rated Super Bowl commercial, our second straight year of achieving this honor. The ad time of the benefits of leveraging the combined experience of Rocket Homes and Rocket Mortgage to find and finance a home. This spot garnered billions of media impressions and is currently being reinforced through our brand and direct response advertising campaigns. This marketing is essential in reminding consumers that in a housing market that has remained highly competitive and inventory constrained, we provide the insight and the tools that help our clients into the closing table faster. These include our industry-leading home search platforms and programs like Overnight Underwrite and Rocket Pro Insight, and consumers are taking notice. In January of 2022, verified approval letters were up 50% compared to 2021, representing the most reapprovals we've had to start a year in our company's history. Finally, 2021 also marked our first full year as a public company. We have shown a track record of generating profitability and scale and returning significant capital to our shareholders. Cumulatively, we have returned $4.5 billion to shareholders since our IPO, putting Rocket in the top 10% of all S&P 500 companies and companies that have listed since 2020, ranked by capital return. Our team members are excited to continue executing on our strategy and to capture the enormous opportunity in front of us. We've already seen our industry begin to consolidate and we are well positioned to gain share and offer more value to our clients across the entire Rocket ecosystem. With that, I'll turn things over to Julie to go deeper into the numbers. Julie? Yes. Thanks for the question. As I mentioned, in my remarks, I think this is an important topic to discuss. It's hard to know market size. Of course, any event on any given day can determine, like we're noticing here today in Europe, can determine what might happen. So what we focus on are kind of our long-term playbook to ensure that we can continue to grow like we have here for the last 36 years. In particular and why I mentioned this in my remarks is that when you see a rapid increase in interest rates, like we've experienced in the last 60 days or so, there are a few levers you can pull. For us being a centralized business model, with the brand and technology, our lever is training. Our lever is skill. Our lever is investing in our team members. We had a bit of a challenge because at the same time that this increase occurred, the Omicron outbreak here, in particular, Michigan and Ohio, caused us to send everyone home, making it a bit more challenging for training. But we've got people back in the office now. And as I referenced before, here in the last week, we've seen, I think, about roughly 90% of all of our loan volume the less interest rate-sensitive products, cash out refinance, rate and terms, purchase. So I bring all that up because the leverage you notice that we aren't pulling is the margin lever, and Julie can talk more about this. This is important. The way that we have always thought on operating our business is that the units that we generate, the mortgage, we're talking about the mortgage business needs to be a high revenue, profitable unit as you structure your business in a way where you're driving that, you do a few things. First of all, you don't teach your organization that's a solution to growing market share is cutting margin. I'm seeing numbers here. Our direct-to-consumer in Q4, I think it was north of 400 basis points, and seeing people come in at like 250 basis points. You can run those numbers, but how can you invest in marketing at 250 basis points, how can you invest in technology at 250 basis how can you keep your best LOs at 250 basis points? How can you keep your best underwriters? Like all of the entire heartbeat of your organization needs to be supported through profitability. And although you may not grab market share over 30 or 45 days, you keep your organization focused on the real things that matter, the client experience, the brand, the marketing, the tech, and in the long run, that's how you grow your company. So you've noticed, we didn't go to cut margin. We're going to focus on the training. So whether the \u2013 it's hard for me to project what the market in 2022 will be. Here's what I know. Over the course of time, this is a huge market. And if we keep investing in all of the things that we've just talked about, we will win that market share. And the last thing I'll say is that when you look at \u2013 you watch us, but if you cut margin and then you look at your profitability and you don't have any, the next thing you can as you cut your marketing. And now you don't have the lease book. And then you don't have lease book, you cut your LOs because I have nothing to give them. And that that's a death spiral. And so you'll notice that's \u2013 we're going in the opposite direction of that, continue to invest. That's what we've done. And that's why I brought up where we were a few years ago in a similar interest rate market to give a comparison of and making the right investments, then you take advantage of opportunity, you grow substantially, you reset your foundation, which is what we're doing now, and you prepare yourself for continued growth. This is an important topic because rate is relative to the other ways that you borrow money. And so we're fortunate that mortgage rates don't sit by themselves. They sit with other vehicles that someone might use a credit card, a personal loan, a home equity line of credit, those sorts of things. And so with the benefit of mortgages and how they're done in this country, with the benefit of tax deduction, even if we see a pickup in interest rates, it still, in most cases, is the best way for our clients to achieve their goals. And the other thing that I think is critically important here, when you're buying a home or when you're noticing that you can't find a home and say now you're going to invest in a new kitchen or putting on an addition or whatever it might be, then the client becomes less rate sensitive, whether they receive 4.5% on their 30-year or 4.625% to 4.25%, that's not really the driver. The driver is achieving that new thing that they want, that new home or the kid's college education or the new kitchen. And that's where scale, that's where brand, that's where confidence in our company comes through. And so that's why in a rising rate market like this, we have an advantage because our conversation shifts from a rate in finance where everyone is fixated on every age in rate to, hey, I want to get this done. So I have a bed in for the baby that's on the way in eight months. And so that's how we think about it. It's the real conversation is about the opportunity you're creating for the client. If we just take a step back, 4.5% or so on a 30-year fixed rate, it's still incredibly low interest rates incredibly advantageous for clients to take advantage of it. Yes. I'll let Julie feel that. Obviously, you can see our guidance here. And so we're feeling confident about where our margins have been here in Q4 and where we head in Q1. But Julie can give you more color. Yes. I'll jump in and Julie has some comments, too. But going back to the first question in, there's an initial kind of competitive situation as many lenders scramble, many cut margin. And so everyone is fighting for that business. as times move on and if rates continue to kind of stay where they're at will continue to rise, and we talked about the people cutting margin, then as I described before, now they have to come out of the market. Now they reduce their marketing spend. And actually, what happens is we now have less competition. That lead that maybe two or three other people we're talking to now is just us or it's us and only one other lender. And so that actually creates an environment where we can be even more confident in standing behind our margins. So not mix as much as it's just kind of the cycle that you go through the initial kind of playing that people do try to win through price will subside and then all of a sudden, you're left with a new playing field with fewer competitors out there talking to the same clients that you're talking to. Julie, any other comments? Yes. Well, maybe I'll jump in there. I think the Truebill business is exciting for us. As Julie said, they kind of had their fifth quarter in January, they consider it because there's so many people thinking about their finances. But we've got this question a lot about Truebill and the thought process behind Truebill, and so I think it's important to walk through. There are really kind of three elements that we're heading forward on with Truebill. The first is having that single time on solution. And that may not sound like much, but without that, our Rocket clients, the millions of clients we have in our servicing portfolio, the millions of clients that we'll deal with all the way through 2022, would have to create yet another account to access Truebill. And so you're adding a single sign-on solution where they can use the same account or transfer or use their Rocket account is incredibly important. Especially as we continue to market, we're talking to clients who may be seven, eight, nine months out from purchasing a home. Today, we may have to buy that lead again. As we launch single sign-on, those clients can now engage with Truebill to do their budgeting, they can engage with Truebill to more kind of credit score. They can engage with Truebill to save some money. And we keep getting signaled as they engage. Act as a ability for us to send push notifications to them, that really we don't have today. And so we keep those purchase clients engaged. Same on the refinance side. And probably equally more and more as we turn on things side, because we talked about it. We are talking to people today. [indiscernible] but they may or may not, makes sense at this moment. At the end we would probably spend marketing dollars later to bring them back in to the funnel. What Truebill can offer additional ways to start their savings plan, engage and bring that to best. So that's the important component of single sign-up. As we move to test that, as Truebill continues to see success in addition to our Rocket market network is doing, Truebill gives us another avenue to bring million plus additional premium users in, not only does it generate like Julie mentioned 100 millions of revenue and growing. But its taking another funnel for our spend interact with folks and eventually find solutions as we're studying their credit report and studying their bank statements to offer a refinance to offer a new card and those sorts of things. So it's a new \u2013 brand-new lead gen funnel for us. And then the third will be our servicing book. So we've talked about the leads that we get. We've talked about the Truebill that we get, but there's also this opportunity to engage our servicing platform. We have a 91% retention rate. There's still opportunity there to find additional ways to help our $1.6 billion and growing servicing clients. And today, we have lots of tools in our Rocket Mortgage servicing platform. But as we continue forward and offer bill negotiation, subscription management, better budgeting tools, all of that will create a more robust engagement with our client base and should give us more confidence as we think about acquiring MSRs as we think about adding MSRs. And so all of those are significant growth opportunities powered by Truebill. Yes. So those we're thinking about CAC or cost to acquire and how that adjusts that over time or LTV, which is probably important to us. We've given some slides in the past about examples of what LTV could look like. Those are all the things that we are \u2013 here's what I can say, those are things that our data team is on every minute of every day. Our finance team is studying goals and KPIs are being set, and we are driving towards those, but those aren't numbers that we are disclosing at this point in time. But just know that the operation of this business focuses on all of those critical things and you're drilling down exactly why we did this acquisition because we have a strong belief that this has not been done in the mortgage space before. And so this is something that can really continue to add to the reducing CAC and increasing the LTV of our client base. And I think it's \u2013 look, it was the right time to do it because it was very advantageous. We did extinguish some existing debt at a higher interest rate. But when we think about the dividend, we're looking at the profitability of the company and funding at least funding that cash is \u2013 funding that with the profitability of the company. You guys there? Yes. Sorry, guys. We were talking and we \u2013 apparently, you weren't listening. Bob, so you can probably comment it on. But I think we just reviewed those. I think there are some capital requirements that they have increased. And based on the last question on the dividend, we're in great shape in terms of having enough capital. But Bob, I don't know if you've got additional comments? Yes. The only thing that I would say also that kind of typically goes with that is that as we think about the broader platform, we touched on this before, and we've acquired MSRs. We're always strategically looking to acquire MSRs. And so if there's fewer people out there thinking about making that acquisition, probably in the long haul, it makes it even \u2013 it could be easier for us to make those acquisitions with our LTV, we're probably in a better position to do that than others. Yes. It's probably three important components here. And again, that's why it's important to let things play out over a few months. Although initially you might see people scrambling to market performance marketing in particular. Over time, as companies reduce their margin, they then typically reduce their marketing cost as well. So there could be an increased amount of competition for some period, but then actually opportunity to go in and own spaces as people back away. So what you have to do from a marketing budget perspective is you have to shift more of your dollars. So as we were running performance marketing and what we consider kind of performance brand marketing, you'll see us shift increasing the performance side of the house, right? And so you'll notice there'll be more on digital. There will be more on DR. We'll get more robust in tracking those DR responses, a little bit more surgical. So watching it by state or county or city or those type of things to understand how our dollar is working. And then, of course, flaring our attribution models on top to make sure that, that brand spend we're doing is also supporting that. So there's not a big change to how we think about the return on the marketing dollars. It's just \u2013 this is like a reset that gives you an opportunity to maybe find areas that six months ago, a year ago, we're being \u2013 a lot of people are trying to make \u2013 to buy in those areas. Now they're backing away, you can come in, you can buy. And then that's \u2013 the last thing I'll say is that is why the Truebill conversation, the value of the MSR going up, all of that matters because you're rethinking your models based on the data coming in, the lifetime value of the client, the increase in the value of the MSR that you're acquiring, that matters. So we're always resetting the reports that we do to ensure that we're spending properly. But that's it. It's just a mathematical decisions behind the scenes and shifting more to performance. Yes. I'm going to jump in here, though, too. I think this is important. So we touched on this all the time. We've invested and we'll continue to invest in marketing in our brand. We continue to invest in technology. We've got thousands of technologists here, writing software that make our systems better, make our mortgages more efficient, make our conversion rates better. We've got the most skilled operations people from the United States of America who know how to work and process, underwrite and close loans. We've got the best mortgage banking force in this country, nearly 6,000 or so of those folks. That's the heartbeat of our organization, right? Everything we have is due to the success of those individuals. And so we're not going to have a conference call where all of a sudden, we let a group of them now, they're not going to be working here any longer. That's just not how we do this. These \u2013 that profitability is important, but the investment in our team members is the most important thing that leads to the future growth of this organization. Yes. Yes. So again, as we think about it, we really think less or noninterest rate-sensitive products because there's $25 trillion of home equity out there. So whether someone \u2013 and with inventory levels the way they're at, whether someone purchases a new home or invest in their existing home, both are huge opportunities for us. Now we're very pleased to exceed. I think we've set a goal for purchase and talk about it, exceed our 2021 purchase goal, really proud of the team for achieving that. And so we're \u2013 as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we had good momentum. We continue to have good momentum in purchase those verified approval letters I think the pipeline is the biggest it's ever been as we walked into January of 2022. And then the training around cash out, the training around a term change that we implemented in the first quarter of this year, as I mentioned, I think we're down near 90% of our production today is falling into that less interest rate-sensitive bucket. So all in all, going very well and touching on another question that we had, once you make that switch, then your mortgage banking force is talking to individuals where rate is not the most important thing. Achieving the goal is the most important thing. And that allows for marketing growth but also allows for conversion increase. And I didn't even touch on, again, the 2.5 million, 2.6 million service clients that we've got, as that value of the MSRs increases, it doesn't mean that we won't see opportunity to assist those clients as well in the retention. So all of the levers that we \u2013 like I said earlier, different than others, but the levers that we choose to pull in a rising rate market are going very well. We haven't experienced that. Again, as I said before, typically as rates rise, all rates rise. So it's just about the comparison of another way to achieve the goal versus mortgage. And so certainly, your mortgage payment is going to be a bit higher if you're getting 4.5% on a 30 year than 3.5%. But in the grand scheme of life, and most of our clients have seen this, that's still an incredibly low interest rate, a fixed interest rate that they can count on over time. And so we've not \u2013 in terms of objections that you might hear people telling us that there's a better source to achieve those goals, has not been one that's been surfacing. Well, I'm sure there are certain borrowers in that category. But again, when we think about the purpose and the borrower usually or the client, as we call them, we'll usually tell us what it is. That may be an ancillary benefit, but the strong desire for the call or the lead or the outreach is because they're trying to achieve some sort of cash out we get, whether it's home improvement or covering the college education or unfortunately going through a divorce or whatever the case may be, that's the driver behind it, not the additional possibility of a reduction in rate in most cases. Yes. Thanks everybody for the questions today. We appreciate and most importantly, thank you for our team members as they have done an amazing job here the last few months of dealing with all of the kind of curve balls of COVID and returning to the office and the shifting and changing in the market and the acquisition of Truebill, I mean we just \u2013 we've got a lot of things going on, and to see the entire team rally together has been \u2013 it's just incredible in the 26 years I've been here. So..."

So we're totally fine with that. In fact, I think over time, it becomes an advantage because you have some pretty thinly capitalize folks out there that it will become a considerable challenge for them. So we don't look to the regulator for competitive advantage, but in this case, we will get it. I think we heard it from recent earnings calls, there are some folks that are selling, servicing now to gain liquidity. And so that creates a pretty significant opportunity for us as well."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Sharon Ng, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nSharon Ng: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Rocket Companies' earnings call covering the third quarter of 2021. With us this afternoon are Rocket Companies' CEO, Jay Farner, our CFO, Julie Booth; and our President and COO, Bob Walters. Before I turn things over to Jay, let me quickly go over our disclaimer. On today's call, we provide you with information regarding our third quarter 2021 performance as well as our financial outlook. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations and the assumptions we mentioned today. We encourage you to consider the risk factors contained in our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or further events, except as required by law. This call is being broadcast online and is accessible on our IR website. A recording of the call will be available later today. Our commentary today will also include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP metrics for our reported results can also be found on our earnings release issued earlier today as well as our filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll turn things over to Jay Farner to get us started. Jay?\nJay Farner: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Rocket Companies' earnings call for the third quarter of 2021. Before we dive in, I want to take a moment to thank our Rocket Companies team members, all 26,000 dedicated professionals whose passion drives the client service, innovation and entrepreneurial spirit that our company is known for. Thanks to them, we have become a platform that removes friction from life's most complex moments. Our platform continues to execute at scale and grow across our businesses. Rocket Mortgage is the largest mortgage lender in America with industry-leading profitability. Our title and settlement services business, Amrock, is also the largest of its kind in the country. Our emerging businesses also set new records in the quarter. Rocket Homes reached $2.3 billion in real estate transaction value, and its current annualized run rate would place the company among the top 20 brokerages in the country. Rocket Auto also reached a record $530 million in gross merchandise value in the quarter. The number of vehicle sales facilitated by Rocket Auto in the last 12 months would put the company in the top 10 of all used car dealers nationwide. On today's call, I will highlight the flexibility of the Rocket platform to capture the growth ahead, including our strategy to revolutionize the home buying experience. I'm also excited to touch on the new Mortgage as a Service opportunity we're launching in partnership with Salesforce. Last quarter, we had excellent results. with closed loan volume and gain on sale margin exceeding the top end of our guidance range. Rocket Mortgage delivered $88 billion in closed loan volume, and Rocket Companies generated $3.2 billion in adjusted revenue and $1.6 billion in adjusted EBITDA. On an adjusted EBITDA basis, we doubled the size of our business compared to 2019, again, demonstrating the sheer power and scalability of the Rocket platform. We hit new records in both purchase and cash out refi volume in Q3. We've also just recently announced a major partnership with Salesforce. Up to this point in time, we have used Rocket technology to process our own mortgage volume through both our direct-to-consumer and partner network channels. The Salesforce partnership will now open our mortgage technology and process to third-party financial institutions through the Salesforce Financial Services Cloud. This new Mortgage as a Service model is a game changer for the industry and for Rocket. More than simply leveraging our technologies, these banks and credit unions will have Rocket integrated into their centralized workflow, making the process seamless and simple. The opportunity is massive. In 2020, the approximately 10,000 banks and credit unions originated over $1 trillion in mortgages. That represents nearly 1/3 of the total market in the U.S. We believe Mortgage as a Service represents a new model for financial institutions to partner with Rocket, paving the way for an even larger opportunity to provide consumer lending as a service, including mortgages, auto loans and personal loans. Expect to hear more about this partnership in the first half of 2022. With multiple channels all operating at scale over a broad range of products, we have many levers to drive growth while optimizing gain on sale margins even in shifting markets. Our ability to pivot and scale is Rocket's key differentiator. In fact, in the third quarter, we saw strong growth in our direct-to-consumer channel, where our purchase initiatives continue to gain traction. We will be allocating additional resources to further support this growth. More broadly, we've seen strength in products that aren't as interest rate sensitive. In the third quarter, both purchase and cash-out refinancing hit new company records, rising approximately 70% year-over-year. This growth is a direct result of Rocket's commitment to providing speed, certainty and choice to our clients, all of which are crucial in the ongoing inventory constrained, highly competitive housing market. Not only did we set a record for purchase volume in the third quarter with both our direct-to-consumer and partner channels achieving all-time highs, but by the end of September, we had already originated more purchase volume than any full year prior. This rapid growth in the purchase segment puts us well on our way to reaching our goal of becoming the #1 retail purchase lender by 2023. Helping drive our continued growth in the purchase category is our seamless end-to-end home buying ecosystem in partnership with Rocket Homes. Through our integrated platform, clients can find their next house on Rocket Homes' 50 state home listing search platform, secure an agent from the company's agent network, get financing through Rocket Mortgage, have Amrock conduct the title work and appraisal for them and then after closing, have their mortgage serviced by Rocket Mortgage, all from one centralized platform. Other key drivers helping us win in today's purchase market are industry-leading products like our overnight underwrite and a broad range of home buying and selling services. For instance, Rocket Homes offers the choice to sell your home through its own staff agents, its 50-state network of real estate professionals or through its for sale by owner [ph] platform. Additionally, we recently rolled out our Breaking Barriers program for our Rocket Pro TPO partners. These technology enhancements paired with programming to better connect real estate professionals and mortgage brokers are designed to give our partners the tools that they need to win today and well into the future. As we look ahead to the next year, we expect our Rocket Mortgage business to achieve continued market share growth, exceeding 10% share in a purchase-heavy market. This is consistent with our track record of being opportunistic to grow share. For instance, in 2019, our company's mortgage originations accounted for roughly 6.5% of the market. In 2020, that grew to nearly 8.5%. With the fourth quarter guidance released earlier today, which Julie will walk through in more detail, we are well on pace to break 2020's strong origination record of $320 billion and end the year with 9.5% market share. As we look towards 2022, we will continue to invest in the rapid growth of our platform. delivering a unified client experience across mortgage, real estate, auto, personal loans and solar. In our emerging businesses, we expect continued growth from Rocket Auto and Rocket Homes in 2022, on top of the records reached in 2021. We will also formally launch our solar program and continue to target new product categories to add to the Rocket platform, either organically or through acquisition. Our platform has been built to capitalize on the vast data proprietary ecology, trusted brand and cloud force here at Rocket Companies. We find over decades these pillars of our platform are the foundation of our growth ahead. With that, I'll turn things over to Julie to go deeper into the numbers. Julie?\nJulie Booth: Thank you, Jay, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report another quarter of strong financial results for Rocket Companies as we continue to leverage our flexible platform, grow our business at scale and drive substantial profitability. On today's call, I will reference some longer-term comparisons, particularly looking at our 2021 performance on a 2-year basis relative to 2019 levels, given the unusual circumstances that shaped 2020. Now we'll get into the numbers. During the third quarter of 2021, Rocket Companies generated $3.2 billion of adjusted revenue, which is a 76% increase from Q3 2019. We had $1.6 billion of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter, more than doubling the results of Q3 2019, representing a 48% adjusted EBITDA margin. We delivered net income of $1.4 billion, up 181% from Q3 2019 and adjusted net income of $1.1 billion, exceeding Q3 of 2019 by more than two times. Over that same period, our adjusted net income margin was 36% and adjusted earnings per share was $0.57 for the quarter. Rocket Mortgage generated $88 billion of closed loan origination volume during the quarter, up nearly 120% from $40 billion in Q3 2019. Focusing on home purchase, our momentum has continued with Q3 purchase volume up more than 70% year-over-year, marking a new company record set in just the first 9 months of the year. In fact, both our direct-to-consumer and partner network segment generated all-time highs for purchase volume during the quarter with our higher-margin direct-to-consumer business having the strongest gain. For the quarter, our rate lock-in on sale margin was 305 basis points, which was above the high end of our guidance range and substantially higher than multi-channel mortgage originators. Gain on sale margins improved quarter-over-quarter in both our direct-to-consumer and Partner Network segment. Our emerging businesses continued to reach new record. At Rocket Homes, we generated record real estate transaction value of $2.3 billion during the quarter, closing more than 9,000 transactions. Our rockethomes.com website continues to increase high intent traffic and was up nearly five times year-over-year with 2.4 million monthly average users during Q3. On a year-to-date basis, Rocket Auto's gross merchandise value, or GMV, and has grown nearly 2.5times year-over-year as momentum for this business continues to grow as we expand inventory partners and with the launch of rocketauto.com. We are leveraging our platform and strong base of 2.5 million servicing clients as of the end of October to grow and ramp these emerging businesses. The Rocket Companies flywheel is based on leveraging our profitability advantages to constantly reinvest in our business, driving continued growth and strengthening our competitive position. We see tremendous potential to drive sustainable and profitable market share gains in our core mortgage business. We are also investing to grow beyond mortgage and leverage our platform to scale our newer real estate, auto, personal loans and solar businesses. This growth will come from continued investment in the pillars of our platform, particularly technology. Fueled by our vast data lake aggregated through millions of client interactions, our technology drives speed and certainty to improve client experience, higher efficiency for our businesses and opens the door to new market opportunities. For example, Amrock completed its 1 millionth digital closing in September, cementing its leadership position in the eClosing market. marks digital experience makes the closing process easier, faster and more accessible translating to a better client experience overall. Cumulatively, our technology investments are driving meaningful change in our business. We expanded the rollout of Rocket Logic, which can now be used by substantially all of our Rocket Cloud Core. On a year-over-year basis, our turn times improved by more than 33% this quarter, extending the gap between us and others in the industry. This was achieved while generating a similar level of business with a substantially higher mix of purchase transactions, which historically take longer to close. We're also leveraging our technology platform beyond our own 4 walls. As Jay mentioned, our recently announced Mortgage as a Service offering with Salesforce opens up a new opportunity for Rocket Mortgage to partner with median and large-sized financial institutions that make up approximately 1/3 of the mortgage market. Mortgage as a Service represents a large incremental opportunity for Rocket Mortgage to continue growing market share in the years ahead. Increasing the lifetime value of our clients is another core component to our growth strategy. Our business is profitable on the first transaction with the client. We then maintain ongoing loan servicing relationships with 2.5 million clients representing over $530 billion in outstanding loan principal as of the end of October. Mortgage servicing drives a recurring cash free for Rocket Companies of $1.3 billion on an annual basis, which covers nearly 1/4 of our annualized expenses. More importantly, with service unpaid principal balance of 30% in the past 12 months and net retention above 90%, we are positioned to continue to drive additional clients to our platform across both our direct-to-consumer and partner network channels. In addition to generating our clients organically, we acquired MSRs with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $3.6 billion during the third quarter. This is in accordance with our growth strategy as we have found that our industry-leading retention rate positions us to generate attractive returns through select MSR portfolio acquisitions. We remain aggressive in pursuing this strategy, and we'll continue to look for opportunities to deploy capital through these types of acquisitions. Looking ahead to Q4, the housing market remains active. Homeowners are sitting on the highest levels of home equity in history, and the investments we have been making are gaining traction across the platform, especially with the progress we're making in purchase. For the fourth quarter, we currently expect closed loan volume in the range of $75 billion to $80 billion, and rate lock volume between $71 billion and $78 billion. At the midpoint of our fourth quarter guided range, our full year 2021 closed loan origination volume would exceed $350 billion, exceeding the previous record of $320 billion achieved in 2020 by more than 10%. Rocket Mortgage has a long-term track record of consistent market share gains. We have grown market share from 1% in 2009 to nearly 8.5% in 2020, 9.5% in 2021 and expect to reach more than 10% in 2022. We expect fourth quarter gain on sale margin to be in the range of 265 to 295 basis points. Regarding our expenses, we believe the run rate of operating expenses for the third quarter of 2021 is a good reference for the fourth quarter. Turning to our balance sheet, liquidity and capital allocation. We exited the third quarter with $2.2 billion of cash on the balance sheet and an additional $2.9 billion of corporate cash used to self-fund loan originations for total available cash of $5.1 billion. Total liquidity stood at $8.6 billion as of September 30, including available cash plus undrawn lines of credit and undrawn MSR line. Keep in mind, even with the record level of originations we generated in 2021, we need less than $1 billion of cash on hand to properly operate our business. Our business is capital-light and our balance sheet is extremely strong. As we've said before, our capital priorities always start with proper capitalization and reinvesting in the business. With $5.1 billion of available cash, we have the opportunity to consider acquisitions, repurchase shares and return capital to shareholders via dividends as we've done in the past. For acquisitions, we look for bolt-on targets that would be additive to our platform by bringing new clients into our ecosystem, enhancing operational efficiencies or enhancing our product offering. During the third quarter, we increased the level at which we have bought back shares. Through the end of October, we have deployed $94 million to repurchase approximately 5.7 million shares. This is in addition to the special dividend of $1.11 per Class A common share, funded by an equity distribution of $2.2 billion that was paid in March. In total, we have returned $2.3 billion to all classes of shareholders during the year. We will deploy our capital in a strategic and disciplined manner to generate long-term shareholder value. Before we turn the call back to the operator, I wanted to make you aware that we will be posting an investor presentation to the Events and Presentations section of our Investor Relations site by the end of the day. The investor presentation provides a general corporate overview of Rocket that we hope the investment community will find informative. Also one small housekeeping item. Previously, we used the terms funded loan volume and funded loan gain on sale margin. Since loans are considered sold when they are purchased by investors on the secondary market, we felt the terms sold loan volume and sold loan gain on sale margin align more closely with the definition and are the terms that we will use going forward. There's no change to the metrics we are reporting, only a change in the terminology. So with that, we are ready to turn it back to the operator for questions. Question & Answer\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ryan Nash from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nRyan Nash: Hey, good evening, everyone. I just wanted to make sure I could hear you. Sorry about that. So you mentioned in the release, this was the strongest purchase loan quarter for closings ever. Jay, you set out a goal to be the number one retail purchase originator by 2023. And I believe at that time, you said something like $60 billion was the largest in 2020. So can you maybe just talk about how the initiative is progressing? And of that goal to be greater than 10% of originations for the industry next year, how much of this can be in market share gains can come from purchase? And then just second, can you maybe just expand on the comment that you'll be allocating additional resources for this? Would that be in the form of biomarketing? Or is that on the personnel side? And I have a follow-up.\nJay Farner: Okay. Well, good question here. Yes, as I think both Julie and I referenced, Q3 was a record in both direct-to-consumer and our partner networks for purchase. And so it was a strong purchase quarter in general, but for us to see those records is a great indicator of our growth in that area. We're excited about 2022 because if we kind of look at where industry experts are projecting, they're talking about the continued growth. I'm seeing forecasts [8-plus] percent. We're seeing median home prices estimated to be north of $435,000. And as home prices grow, of course, mortgage amounts grow, and you understand how our business works that is great for the unit economics of our business, more revenue generated on the same units that we're putting through the system. So just in general, the industry looks very strong. Now speaking specifically to us, our full purchase ecosystem continues to grow. Our Rocket Homes platform, the home search experience, the number of visitors reaching that site is growing. Our agent network base is growing. Our centralized agent system is growing. The way that we're integrating home financing, the Rocket Mortgage component into all these experiences is strengthening, the way that we're integrating title and settlement services. So we've been leading in all of these categories to make sure that not only do we provide an incredible experience, we're able to make sure we're monetizing that experience as well. In particular with real estate agents, we've rolled out our single point-of-contact process in the life of the loans, which is really important to them. We've given real estate agents tracking for appraisal and title work, which is very important to them. I think we're north of 55,000 agents now that are in our network. And so all of these components are working. And then if you watch some of the advertising that we do, you'll notice that there's been a shift there driving purchase as well as cash out refinance. So all of the levers, and we've talked about this for call after call now, we're very fortunate that we've got so many distribution levers to pull. But in all those categories, we've just been leaning in to drive the purchase messaging, and that's giving us that growth. And then of course, add on top of it, the strength that we're seeing in TPO and then this partnership that we're launching with Salesforce to reach nearly 10,000 banks or credit unions, that will give us additional reach into the purchase market. So I just think Q3 is a great indicator of all the efforts that we're putting forward that we expect to continue moving forward.\nRyan Nash: Got it. And Jay, you mentioned again the partnership with Salesforce. Can you maybe just expand on this Mortgage as a Service? How is it going to work? What will the economics look like relative to the more traditional mortgage business? And I think you mentioned these companies originated $1 trillion of mortgage. What would be a successful penetration rate for Rocket and over what time frame as you penetrate this partnership?\nJay Farner: Yes, this is a great addition to our partnership network. So as you know, we've got these premier enterprise partners that we've been adding to our base. We started with Schwab that represents $1 billions of closed loans for us on a yearly basis. We've got our API integrations with Mint in that platform, Credit Karma. But this is a new way for us to broaden that reach and that's really, as you talked about, Mortgage as a Service to banks and credit unions. And if you look at these financial institutions, many of which are already using the Salesforce Financial Services Cloud, we're adding a Rocket technology to the CRM 360 View technology that they're already using. And it's hard for these financial institutions on their own to make the level of investment required to really be great at mortgage. And so they've got the relationships. They want to retain the relationships. They want to protect all of the other ways that they interact with these clients, and we know mortgage is a critical way to do this. Now we're giving them access to our brand, our tech, and that allows them to bring a great experience and allows us to gain that client that maybe otherwise would have worked with the bank or the credit union. As you referenced, that's $1 trillion or so worth of mortgage volume, and the home price increases continue as they're scheduled to that will be growing. When it comes to the economics, and how we're going to really kind of penetrate this market, again, we're very fortunate because we're going to be working with Salesforce. And as a Salesforce client for many years, I can tell you that their sales force is incredible. And so they have great relationships with these financial institutions. They will be out as banks and credit unions think about either renewing contracts or adding Salesforce Financial Services Cloud to their platform, and we will be there in partnership with them now explaining this new feature that makes the cloud platform even stronger. And so it's really two great sales forces, no pun intended, teaming up to reach these banks and credit unions. So on our own, I'm pretty confident in our business development team, but now combining with the Salesforce business development group, I think, is very, very exciting. And then we are able to share the economics on the gain on sale with the banks and credit unions. And it's very similar to some of the other economics we've talked about in the past with these premier enterprise partners that we've already got on the platform. So really good economics for us.\nRyan Nash: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Harter from Credit Suisse.\nDoug Harter: I was hoping you could touch a little bit more about on your liquidity. Obviously, quite strong and well above the $1 billion you said you needed. I guess can you just talk about how you think about the timing of potentially additional dividends or other returns of capital beyond the share repurchase you've done?\nJay Farner: Yes. I'll let Julie field that one.\nJulie Booth: Yes, absolutely. As we continue to evaluate the amount of capital we have in the business, we do have quite a lot of capital, as you mentioned. We did a distribution earlier this year, and we'll continue to think about that from time to time. So it may be something that we evaluate the capital levels that we've got and believe that we've got more than we need to continue to invest in the business, consider additional acquisition opportunities and all the things that we think are there for us to invest our capital in, and from time to time, we may do that. The share repurchase program is something else that we have been active in as well, and we'll continue to consider as well, but it's really going to kind of depend on how we assess the level of capital as we go forward into next year.\nJay Farner: Maybe just to add on to that a bit. We've touched on this being strategic about the acquisitions that we might look at. As the market is shifting and changing, I think that presents increased opportunity for us there to be thoughtful but more aggressive in our approach. And I'd also say that, as Julie referenced, if we look at where the stock has been here recently, you've noticed our buybacks have increased and we're -- we think the stock is a smart for us to do buybacks when we see the stock at that level.\nDoug Harter: And then you mentioned that cash-out refinances have been quite strong and record levels for you. I guess, how do you think about the opportunity in home equity loans or home equity interests or other ways to kind of help your customers kind of tap into that home equity as an opportunity?\nJay Farner: Yes. Great question. I think if we look back about 24 months, there is somewhere just north of about $19 trillion of home equity in the country. Recently, that number that we've seen, I think, at the end of the second quarter was $24 trillion. So a huge increase in home equity. We referenced the home equity increases inside of our own servicing book. Of course, our retention rates there are excellent. And so the first approach with interest rates the way that they're at is to make sure that we are messaging with marketing and branding and digital advertising, performance marketing to continue to see increase in cash-out transactions. It makes a lot of sense for our client base, to be vigilant when we look at ways we can assist our servicing book to help those clients with cash out. Many of those clients will reach out to us thinking about purchasing, but with, I think, about 2, 2.5 maybe months worth of inventory out there. In many cases, that conversation changes from buying a new home to renovating their existing home, another opportunity for us to assist them with cash out. And then of course, we've got Rocket Loans. And we talked a lot recently about Rocket Loans and how we're leveraging that technology as we expand solar. But the primary purpose of initially rolling out Rocket Loans was to deliver a $24 to $40 experience for our client base to tap into available money that's not a home equity line product today. But it just speaks to how we're able to leverage that technology in the future, pivoted it to use the same technology for solar, and we have the opportunity to take that same technology speed and certainty that we could bring to the table for home equity lines or those sorts of things in the future if we think that, that's advantageous. Right now, a cash-out refinance really is the product that makes the most sense for our client base.\nDoug Harter: Great. Thank you. Jay.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Arren Cyganovich from Citi. Please go ahead. \nArren Cyganovich: Thanks. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the competitive dynamics you're seeing in your TPO or broker segment. The gain on sale declined to a fairly low level there. Just talk about the dynamics that are happening there.\nJay Farner: Yes. When we look at our TPO business, if you can go back about 4 or 5 months, we had about 36% wallet share. So of the partners that we were working with, we were getting just north of 1 out of every 3 loans that they originated. If we now look where we were in the third quarter, that's north of 50%. So we're really excited about how those partners are committing to working with Rocket. In addition, when we look at just overall market share, we're up 2 or 3 percentage points from where we were here just a few months back or a few quarters back, I should say. So our growth in that market continues. We just recently announced our most recent offering to our partner base here. We've launched our new client portal, many enhancements that they've been asking for. We launched our Broker Connect program. So we're introducing our broker partners to our real estate partners, so they can continue to develop business together across the United States of America. We rolled out Rocket Connect to all of our brokers, a streamlined way for them to communicate directly with our operations folks guaranteeing a 2-hour or less turn time, which we think is leading in the industry. So as you can tell, we are fully committed to making sure that we're the premier provider of these services to our TPO partners. And that's really, again, if we go back to the platform, and we talked in our prepared remarks about how we're leaning into direct-to-consumer because we have that ability to market the cash-out refinance market to purchase and grow there. But I think we're also uniquely positioned to continue to invest in the TPO business because of how well diversified our entire business is. And so I really look at that as an opportunity as it becomes more challenging for our model line mortgage businesses to do that, an opportunity for us to continue to invest, win over the broker community, increase wallet share and set ourselves up for even more profitable business here in the future. So we're full steam ahead in that business. Very happy with the partners we've got and how that -- how the business is performing. And again, we always take a long view as we build these things and nothing different with our TPO partners here.\nArren Cyganovich: Great. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJames Faucette: Thanks. I want to follow up quickly on specifically the gain on sale aspect, is it this quarter in -- or that is the September quarter was better than it had been in the June quarter and certainly better than had been modeled. But your outlook seems to imply that it should come back in the December quarter. Can you talk a little bit about kind of the -- specifically the dynamics that you see moving that around? And maybe more importantly, where do you see that kind of stabilizing if and when as we go into 2022? Thanks.\nJulie Booth: Yes, sure. I can take that question. And as we look at our gain on sale margin in the third quarter, it was 305 basis points, which was up 27 basis points from the Q2 margin of 278 basis points. As you mentioned, our margin was also 5 basis points above the top end of our guided range. And the largest driver of that outperformance in the third quarter was due to the FHFA's removal of the 50 basis point average market fee on refinanced loan. So that had about a 10 basis point impact on the margin. And that is part of the reason when we look at margins heading into Q4, we're seeing them lower than Q3. There's always going to be variances in margin from quarter-to-quarter, and we saw just a bit of compression in primary secondary spread in October compared to last quarter. But based on what we're seeing today and taking into account everything we know so far this quarter, we're seeing margins a bit lower than Q3 right now, but we do feel good about the range where we are guiding for this quarter, which is 265 to 295 basis points. And that guidance is fairly consistent with where we've been for the past couple of quarters as well. As Jay mentioned, we've seen records in our cash-out and purchase transactions. As the equity continues to grow that owners have, we continue to grow our market share and are looking to continue to do that into next year as well.\nJames Faucette: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brock Vandervliet from UBS. Please go ahead.\nBrock Vandervliet: Great. Thanks for the question. Just in general, Jay, I feel like investors in the space are kind of collectively holding their breath, seeing both current performance, which is very good. but also worried about what next year may bring looking at things like the MBA forecast and such. Do you -- how should we feel about next year in terms of things like Salesforce, the cash-out refi opportunity provide you real shock absorbers where the volume forecast that we see from some of these macro providers is really irrelevant because you can kind of make up the difference? Or is that something we should really be focused on because it's a big market, and you're a big player and you're going to kind of move with the broader market. How should we think about that?\nJay Farner: Yes. You're touching on our life work here at Rocket Companies. So when I started 26 years ago, I was very aware of market conditions and market changes and how that could impact our mortgage company's volume. And so we have, especially over the last 10 years, been incredibly focused on diversifying and controlling the outcome of our business. We started with building an incredibly strong brand, an incredibly strong marketing team, over 300 people now, very focused on digital and performance marketing. As you know, we invest over $1 billion a year there through our direct-to-consumer space. When you think about an increase of $5 trillion in equity, and you also think about our ability to do cash-out transactions. I think we've touched on in the past between cash out and purchase how we're well north of 50% of our overall origination volume, I think we sell in that area. So I look at that as a massive opportunity going into 2022. The growth of our purchase segment setting records in Q3, certainly in Q4 because of timing in the holidays, someone being interested in a purchase and actually closing on a home can vary a bit. But when I think longer term, going into Q1 and Q2 and all of 2022, as they're talking about continued increase in home value and demand with purchase, I feel very good about that. And so the market may shrink a bit, it may not. I think it's hard to say. But what I know is that between all of these categories, the Salesforce, the partnerships, all the things that we're investing in TPO, the direct-to-consumer, our business has the ability to pivot and shift, maximizing the capacity that we've built, bringing a great experience to our client, and that's our mission. Our mission is to continue to build out a platform where we guide the growth of the organization. So the last thing I'll say, it is market share. That's why we're projecting to go north of 10% market share. We've consistently been growing market share regardless of the size of the pie through all of these vehicles I've just discussed, and that's what we anticipate that we'll do in 2022.\nBrock Vandervliet: Okay. And as a follow-up, if you could just kind of describe the ground game now in terms of the partner network specifically, you're growing that network. How are the competitive dynamics there as you seek to add more weight?\nJay Farner: Well, when you think about the ability for our partners to tie into the digital experiences we create, the APIs that we've created, the financial institutions like a Morgan Stanley or a Charles Schwab or Mass Mutual, I really feel strongly that if a financial institution wants to partner with someone that can deliver incredible client service and has a highly respected brand, we are the choice for them, really the only choice for them. And so that partner business will continue to serve us very, very well. When you think about our broker partners, we're bringing incredible value to them. We've got our folks traveling the country now, setting up these connects, aligning the real estate agent partners we've got with the broker partners, strengthening their relationships there. We've got the technology to ensure that our brokers can perform. We've got the brand that they can leverage. We're really turning all of the assets of this organization and offering them to anyone that would like to partner, whether it be a bank, a credit union, an insurance agent, a financial planner, a mortgage broker. And so that partner channel is one of the main components of the future of our business. And so it's exciting to see its growth, and I imagine its growth will continue.\nBrock Vandervliet: Got it, okay. Thanks for the questions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ivy Zelman from Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.\nIvy Zelman: Thanks for taking my questions. And quarter. When you look at the partner business and just overall, the continued growth outside of mortgage and assuming repurchase and thinking about the cyclicality of those businesses, if you had your crystal ball, Jay, and you think about 5 years from now, taking arguably businesses that are less cyclical, can you see the majority of earnings being more likely to come from the non-mortgage-related business? Is that sort of over time? I know that's what you've been attempting to do, but is that -- is there a way to quantify that for us? And then just a follow-up is what's your basis or definition of market share? What are you using for determining your 10% that you expect to realize?\nJay Farner: Well, to think about your first question, I think it starts with servicing because I think a lot of people will view servicing as this asset and what would its value be if you were to sell it. When we think about servicing, we think about the reoccurring payments that we receive on a monthly basis as we strengthen the relationship and market to that client, and then are able to offer additional services to the client. And so mortgage for a pretty significant portion of time, I'm not going to speculate how many months or years, but it will still represent a big chunk of our revenue, of course, because there's not that many products out there that give you the opportunity to generate $6,000 or $7,000 or $8,000 per unit. But when Julie talks about the growth, I'm not aware of another real estate or auto sales organization that's growing at the rate that we're growing. And I think that speaks to the scalability of the platform. I think it speaks to the brand and how consumers, once they're with Rocket, really value the relationship. And so we'll continue to see those businesses grow. I guess any -- everyone will have to make their own determination as to what is a meaningful percentage of revenue. Is that 5% of revenue? Is that 10% of revenue? Our mission, though, is to continue to add these services and allow the lifetime value of the client and the reoccurring revenue of that client over an extended period of time to really be the measure. When I talk to the company, we don't talk any more -- of course, we're looking at units closed and volume, but what we're really talking about are the number of users on our platform, right? How many millions of people do we talk to each month? How many millions of people do we have on the servicing platform? And that's a shift, I think, from the traditional mortgage industry, but you've got to make that shift because that's really how we're thinking about it. If we have the ability to reach a 5 million, 10 million, 15 million, 20 million Americans a year and understand their finances, understand their credit, understand their property, then you start thinking of the power of that relationship and that becomes more meaningful over the long run than a closed loan. And so that's the lens that we're really starting to view our business through is how many users that we're putting on the platform. In regards to your other question about when we think about market share, and I'll turn to Julie here, but I think if we look at the overall closed loan market and divide our the closings we have into that.\nJulie Booth: Yes. Historically, we have looked at the MBA market share. But as we look forward, we're talking about whenever the market is that we're seeing in 2022, we expect to be 10% of that. So it's something that historically, that's the way that we have looked at the numbers that we've reported when we're talking about market share. but it's not specific going forward to a particular market. We don't know what that...\nJay Farner: Yes. There are many different indexes out there, and so we'll look at MBA, the old published numbers as well. And so it varies a bit, right, just putting out the number.\nJulie Booth: We know we continue to grow market share. So when we talk about that based on what we have done over the past several years here and continuing into that growth what's going to, we believe, drive that, that.\nJay Farner: Yes. Yes. I think when we talk about 10% or North, I believe we're kind of looking at where the MBA is looking for 2022 and where we'll be at.\nIvy Zelman: Got it. Thank you very much. And good luck, guys.\nJay Farner: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mark DeVries from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMark DeVries: Thanks. I had a question about expenses. Julie, if I heard you right, I think you Indicated 4Q or the 3Q run rate was a good indication of what we should expect for 4Q. I think you're guiding down though for a sequential quarter decline in your closed loan volume. Is there anything from an investment perspective or anything else worth calling out that's going to keep expenses at the 3Q level?\nJulie Booth: Yes. Thanks for that question. Good question. And we do expect that expenses in Q4 will be similar to what we saw in Q3. We do think that's a good run rate for forecasting and estimating next quarter. Our production expenses will be down a bit this quarter. That's offset by a few things. [indiscernible] increased expenses on the industry, for example, so that will offset some of those decreases. So some of the other things that happened in Q4 are 6,000 bankers that we have. We licensed them during the fourth quarter every year. So that cost is going to hit in the fourth quarter. We'll have additional bond interest expense as compared to the prior quarter because we did issue new bonds at the beginning of October this year. So that will impact Q4. We might see a slight increase in the performance marketing this quarter. Jay mentioned that. Also, the headcount that we added last quarter in Q3 will have a full quarters of expenses here in the fourth quarter as well. So that's going to contribute to a slight increase but...\nJay Farner: That's right. And Julie, this is just in because we're doing this live. To answer Ivy's question, we take Fannie, Freddie, MBA and her average those to kind of think of what the overall market is.\nJulie Booth: As we look forward...\nJay Farner: And you're right, we're talking about 10% on that average.\nMark DeVries: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mihir Bhatia from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMihir Bhatia: Hi. Thank you for taking the question, Just wanted to just go back to the Salesforce discussion for a second. Maybe just talk about that a little bit more. Really, what I'm trying to understand is who are you competing with there? What is it -- like it sounds like you're going to be sharing the gain on paying revenue. So it sounds like more like what you have in your partner network currently? Is that the right way of thinking of it? You're effectively white labeling your technology for those people through the Salesforce cloud? Just trying to understand a little bit more on this.\nJay Farner: Yes. Well, so good question here. Some of these financial institutions currently have their own small mortgage origination capabilities. Some don't participate in mortgage at all right now. But we're really plugging directly into the Salesforce Financial Services Cloud. So if you think about an originator at a bank or credit union, and they're using that to understand their client base, work with their client base. The data about that client is in that CRM system. They'll now have access to tap in directly to a rocket. It won't be white label. We're using our brand. Again, we've invested billions and millions of dollars and create an incredible experience so people want that brand. They want to be able to say to their consumer, \"Hey, look, you're actually able to get a rocket mortgage with my help.\" In some cases, the bank may continue to have a licensed originator who is performing some of those duties. In other cases, we may provide some assistance there and also have a license retainer in our end support theirs. So we're able to pivot a bit based on how much the bank wants to be doing and then, of course, our technology, our services, all of those things will process underwrite and close the loan. And when I talk about partnership, and Julie talked about this in the past, I would really think of this similar to like a Charles Schwab or some of the other, what we call premier partners, that we've got [indiscernible] And I know Julie's referenced, these are more similar to our retail margins from that perspective.\nMihir Bhatia: Understood. If I could just have a quick follow-up on the New York legislation on CRA requirements, applying to online. Would that have any impact on your business? Maybe just talk about that. Thank you. \nJay Farner: Well, I'll turn it over to Bob Walters, who happens to be here with us, who's our Chief Operating Officer, and also an expert in capital markets\nBob Walters: Yes. I think the answer to that is no. I don't think that that's going to have any substantial impact on our business.\nMihir Bhatia: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kevin Barker from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nKevin Barker: Thanks for taking my questions. Just a follow-up on some of the Salesforce comments. Can you give us an idea of what your target institution would utilize this type of product, whether it's the size of the bank or the credit union? And then do you see the potential for some of this offering to potentially maybe call some incremental cannibalization but ultimately maybe further growth over time? Just trying to understand the dynamics between having -- offering your service to institutions that already provide origination capacity to their customer base.\nJay Farner: Yes. Well, that situation, obviously, we'll be gaining clients that currently don't work with us. There's always a little bit of segment overlap. But as we study the market, the consumer that comes to us directly online is a different consumer than the person who chooses to work with a local mortgage broker who's typically a different consumer who chooses to work with their bank or credit union. So this gives us access to a consumer that we may not be reaching day in and day out. So it's really additive from that respect. I also think it's important, we're starting with mortgage here. But as we think about building out our platform, there are other services that financial institutions have already signaled that they may have additional interest in. Very really, when you go to your bank or credit union and learned that they're thinking about helping their clients green their home with solar. And so this is a way for us to help them strengthen their relationship with their client base, but also a starting place for us that could possibly expand into other products and services here in the future.\nKevin Barker: Okay. Great. And then just a follow-up. Is this purely fee revenue that will be generated or will you be utilizing your balance sheet at all in providing these services.\nJay Farner: Go ahead, Julie.\nJulie Booth: Yes. We will look to do this in the same way that we originate with our partners today. So it will be financed with our own cash or line as we do the rest of our business and sold into the secondary market..\nOperator: The next question comes from Ryan Carr from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nRyan Carr: Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the great results this quarter. You've done a great of leveraging the broad platform and ecosystem to enhance the flywheel effect and expand your purchase capabilities, particularly on Rocket Homes and your iBuying program, I'm curious to hear about how this combined with your other service offerings has helped to bolster your leadership and purchase, particularly this quarter. And then given the recent incidents of Zillow, how do you plan to continue to take advantage of the dislocation?\nJay Farner: Yes. Very good question. So our mission here with Rocket Homes and with for sale by owner com and with our centralized realtor group our network of real estate agents is really to make sure that we have an offering for anyone who's thinking about buying or selling a home. That approach really gives us the ability to help all of the clients that may be reaching out to us One of the components that we've added here recently, as we touched on, I think, on our last earnings call, we were just starting to do some testing is iBuyer. And for us, the iBuyer program, in particular, will allow a client who may otherwise have a contingency on their approval, meaning they have to sell their existing home before they buy their next to remove that contingency. And that's important in a competitive marketplace because if you're going up against somebody who doesn't have a mortgage -- a call contingency or is paying cash, then you need that flexibility. Our decision, as you know, with iBuying was to partner with other -- with actual iBuyers. So as Joe talked about all the time, we have a very capital-light structure here, which means that we're not in the business of purchasing real estate. And so the model that we have built is to start bringing on multiple iBuyers who seem to have expertise in certain areas across the country. provide that as a service, one of many to our clients if that will help them buy their new home and then allow that third party to actually be there if they do require in. In many cases, actually, what we're finding is that someone uses that as a backup plan, but quite honestly, list their home through one of the many ways that I've just described on Rocket Homes and actually sells the home before needing to close on the other homes. So it's a nice thing to have as a backstop, but in today's real estate market is not something that's required much of the time.\nRyan Carr: Got it. And as a follow-up, the Rocket Auto is now online. How has the rollout been so far? And what are the early signs of potential cross-sell opportunities you've identified with the rollout in place?\nJay Farner: Well, I think we probably touched on this here on a few different calls. As we continue to help our clients understand their finances, help them save money. We're having discussions about their largest bills. And of course, the auto comes up. And so the vast data lake that we've got here, along with a servicing platform that allows us to communicate with the clients on a monthly basis, really gives us the opportunity to start creating a very high-quality auto lead that we can then use to support Rocket Auto a bit different than maybe the type of road you could think of that would be generated from an AutoTrader.com or Cars.com or something of that nature. We've already got the relationship with the client. We've also got a significant amount of data -- and as we see and won't figure out if it's the second part of 2022 or as we get into 2023, it's hard to say. But eventually, there will be more inventory that is out there. And as there's more inventory on dealer lots, I think we'll see even increased desire from our dealer partners to have us assist in driving sales. And so Julie touched on the growth that we've seen from Rocket Auto this year. And what I would argue might be the one of the most challenging years this business because it's very rare that you would go to a dealer today and ask them for having trouble selling cars, yet they're calling us and wanting to jump on our platform in a more normalized market where they can use that additional support, we get even more excited about the opportunity for that business to continue to grow.\nRyan Carr: Thanks very much. And congrats again on a great quarter.\nJay Farner: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jay Farner for any closing remarks.\nJay Farner: Well, thank you, everyone, for joining the call here today. As I started out the call, I couldn't be prouder of our entire team and the incredible work that they have done through the first three quarters of this year, and we're excited about finishing up 2021 and heading on to 2022, where we will work hard to go 10% or north of market share and keep going up our entire platform. And I will see on the next call. Thank you.\nOperator: This conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Julie Booth",
            "content": "Thank you, Jay, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report another quarter of strong financial results for Rocket Companies as we continue to leverage our flexible platform, grow our business at scale and drive substantial profitability. On today's call, I will reference some longer-term comparisons, particularly looking at our 2021 performance on a 2-year basis relative to 2019 levels, given the unusual circumstances that shaped 2020. Now we'll get into the numbers. During the third quarter of 2021, Rocket Companies generated $3.2 billion of adjusted revenue, which is a 76% increase from Q3 2019. We had $1.6 billion of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter, more than doubling the results of Q3 2019, representing a 48% adjusted EBITDA margin. We delivered net income of $1.4 billion, up 181% from Q3 2019 and adjusted net income of $1.1 billion, exceeding Q3 of 2019 by more than two times. Over that same period, our adjusted net income margin was 36% and adjusted earnings per share was $0.57 for the quarter. Rocket Mortgage generated $88 billion of closed loan origination volume during the quarter, up nearly 120% from $40 billion in Q3 2019. Focusing on home purchase, our momentum has continued with Q3 purchase volume up more than 70% year-over-year, marking a new company record set in just the first 9 months of the year. In fact, both our direct-to-consumer and partner network segment generated all-time highs for purchase volume during the quarter with our higher-margin direct-to-consumer business having the strongest gain. For the quarter, our rate lock-in on sale margin was 305 basis points, which was above the high end of our guidance range and substantially higher than multi-channel mortgage originators. Gain on sale margins improved quarter-over-quarter in both our direct-to-consumer and Partner Network segment. Our emerging businesses continued to reach new record. At Rocket Homes, we generated record real estate transaction value of $2.3 billion during the quarter, closing more than 9,000 transactions. Our rockethomes.com website continues to increase high intent traffic and was up nearly five times year-over-year with 2.4 million monthly average users during Q3. On a year-to-date basis, Rocket Auto's gross merchandise value, or GMV, and has grown nearly 2.5times year-over-year as momentum for this business continues to grow as we expand inventory partners and with the launch of rocketauto.com. We are leveraging our platform and strong base of 2.5 million servicing clients as of the end of October to grow and ramp these emerging businesses. The Rocket Companies flywheel is based on leveraging our profitability advantages to constantly reinvest in our business, driving continued growth and strengthening our competitive position. We see tremendous potential to drive sustainable and profitable market share gains in our core mortgage business. We are also investing to grow beyond mortgage and leverage our platform to scale our newer real estate, auto, personal loans and solar businesses. This growth will come from continued investment in the pillars of our platform, particularly technology. Fueled by our vast data lake aggregated through millions of client interactions, our technology drives speed and certainty to improve client experience, higher efficiency for our businesses and opens the door to new market opportunities. For example, Amrock completed its 1 millionth digital closing in September, cementing its leadership position in the eClosing market. marks digital experience makes the closing process easier, faster and more accessible translating to a better client experience overall. Cumulatively, our technology investments are driving meaningful change in our business. We expanded the rollout of Rocket Logic, which can now be used by substantially all of our Rocket Cloud Core. On a year-over-year basis, our turn times improved by more than 33% this quarter, extending the gap between us and others in the industry. This was achieved while generating a similar level of business with a substantially higher mix of purchase transactions, which historically take longer to close. We're also leveraging our technology platform beyond our own 4 walls. As Jay mentioned, our recently announced Mortgage as a Service offering with Salesforce opens up a new opportunity for Rocket Mortgage to partner with median and large-sized financial institutions that make up approximately 1/3 of the mortgage market. Mortgage as a Service represents a large incremental opportunity for Rocket Mortgage to continue growing market share in the years ahead. Increasing the lifetime value of our clients is another core component to our growth strategy. Our business is profitable on the first transaction with the client. We then maintain ongoing loan servicing relationships with 2.5 million clients representing over $530 billion in outstanding loan principal as of the end of October. Mortgage servicing drives a recurring cash free for Rocket Companies of $1.3 billion on an annual basis, which covers nearly 1/4 of our annualized expenses. More importantly, with service unpaid principal balance of 30% in the past 12 months and net retention above 90%, we are positioned to continue to drive additional clients to our platform across both our direct-to-consumer and partner network channels. In addition to generating our clients organically, we acquired MSRs with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $3.6 billion during the third quarter. This is in accordance with our growth strategy as we have found that our industry-leading retention rate positions us to generate attractive returns through select MSR portfolio acquisitions. We remain aggressive in pursuing this strategy, and we'll continue to look for opportunities to deploy capital through these types of acquisitions. Looking ahead to Q4, the housing market remains active. Homeowners are sitting on the highest levels of home equity in history, and the investments we have been making are gaining traction across the platform, especially with the progress we're making in purchase. For the fourth quarter, we currently expect closed loan volume in the range of $75 billion to $80 billion, and rate lock volume between $71 billion and $78 billion. At the midpoint of our fourth quarter guided range, our full year 2021 closed loan origination volume would exceed $350 billion, exceeding the previous record of $320 billion achieved in 2020 by more than 10%. Rocket Mortgage has a long-term track record of consistent market share gains. We have grown market share from 1% in 2009 to nearly 8.5% in 2020, 9.5% in 2021 and expect to reach more than 10% in 2022. We expect fourth quarter gain on sale margin to be in the range of 265 to 295 basis points. Regarding our expenses, we believe the run rate of operating expenses for the third quarter of 2021 is a good reference for the fourth quarter. Turning to our balance sheet, liquidity and capital allocation. We exited the third quarter with $2.2 billion of cash on the balance sheet and an additional $2.9 billion of corporate cash used to self-fund loan originations for total available cash of $5.1 billion. Total liquidity stood at $8.6 billion as of September 30, including available cash plus undrawn lines of credit and undrawn MSR line. Keep in mind, even with the record level of originations we generated in 2021, we need less than $1 billion of cash on hand to properly operate our business. Our business is capital-light and our balance sheet is extremely strong. As we've said before, our capital priorities always start with proper capitalization and reinvesting in the business. With $5.1 billion of available cash, we have the opportunity to consider acquisitions, repurchase shares and return capital to shareholders via dividends as we've done in the past. For acquisitions, we look for bolt-on targets that would be additive to our platform by bringing new clients into our ecosystem, enhancing operational efficiencies or enhancing our product offering. During the third quarter, we increased the level at which we have bought back shares. Through the end of October, we have deployed $94 million to repurchase approximately 5.7 million shares. This is in addition to the special dividend of $1.11 per Class A common share, funded by an equity distribution of $2.2 billion that was paid in March. In total, we have returned $2.3 billion to all classes of shareholders during the year. We will deploy our capital in a strategic and disciplined manner to generate long-term shareholder value. Before we turn the call back to the operator, I wanted to make you aware that we will be posting an investor presentation to the Events and Presentations section of our Investor Relations site by the end of the day. The investor presentation provides a general corporate overview of Rocket that we hope the investment community will find informative. Also one small housekeeping item. Previously, we used the terms funded loan volume and funded loan gain on sale margin. Since loans are considered sold when they are purchased by investors on the secondary market, we felt the terms sold loan volume and sold loan gain on sale margin align more closely with the definition and are the terms that we will use going forward. There's no change to the metrics we are reporting, only a change in the terminology. So with that, we are ready to turn it back to the operator for questions. Question & Answer Yes, absolutely. As we continue to evaluate the amount of capital we have in the business, we do have quite a lot of capital, as you mentioned. We did a distribution earlier this year, and we'll continue to think about that from time to time. So it may be something that we evaluate the capital levels that we've got and believe that we've got more than we need to continue to invest in the business, consider additional acquisition opportunities and all the things that we think are there for us to invest our capital in, and from time to time, we may do that. The share repurchase program is something else that we have been active in as well, and we'll continue to consider as well, but it's really going to kind of depend on how we assess the level of capital as we go forward into next year. Yes, sure. I can take that question. And as we look at our gain on sale margin in the third quarter, it was 305 basis points, which was up 27 basis points from the Q2 margin of 278 basis points. As you mentioned, our margin was also 5 basis points above the top end of our guided range. And the largest driver of that outperformance in the third quarter was due to the FHFA's removal of the 50 basis point average market fee on refinanced loan. So that had about a 10 basis point impact on the margin. And that is part of the reason when we look at margins heading into Q4, we're seeing them lower than Q3. There's always going to be variances in margin from quarter-to-quarter, and we saw just a bit of compression in primary secondary spread in October compared to last quarter. But based on what we're seeing today and taking into account everything we know so far this quarter, we're seeing margins a bit lower than Q3 right now, but we do feel good about the range where we are guiding for this quarter, which is 265 to 295 basis points. And that guidance is fairly consistent with where we've been for the past couple of quarters as well. As Jay mentioned, we've seen records in our cash-out and purchase transactions. As the equity continues to grow that owners have, we continue to grow our market share and are looking to continue to do that into next year as well. Yes. Historically, we have looked at the MBA market share. But as we look forward, we're talking about whenever the market is that we're seeing in 2022, we expect to be 10% of that. So it's something that historically, that's the way that we have looked at the numbers that we've reported when we're talking about market share. but it's not specific going forward to a particular market. We don't know what that... We know we continue to grow market share. So when we talk about that based on what we have done over the past several years here and continuing into that growth what's going to, we believe, drive that, that. Yes. Thanks for that question. Good question. And we do expect that expenses in Q4 will be similar to what we saw in Q3. We do think that's a good run rate for forecasting and estimating next quarter. Our production expenses will be down a bit this quarter. That's offset by a few things. [indiscernible] increased expenses on the industry, for example, so that will offset some of those decreases. So some of the other things that happened in Q4 are 6,000 bankers that we have. We licensed them during the fourth quarter every year. So that cost is going to hit in the fourth quarter. We'll have additional bond interest expense as compared to the prior quarter because we did issue new bonds at the beginning of October this year. So that will impact Q4. We might see a slight increase in the performance marketing this quarter. Jay mentioned that. Also, the headcount that we added last quarter in Q3 will have a full quarters of expenses here in the fourth quarter as well. So that's going to contribute to a slight increase but... As we look forward... Yes. We will look to do this in the same way that we originate with our partners today. So it will be financed with our own cash or line as we do the rest of our business and sold into the secondary market.."

            "name": "Jay Farner",
            "content": "Good afternoon, and welcome to the Rocket Companies' earnings call for the third quarter of 2021. Before we dive in, I want to take a moment to thank our Rocket Companies team members, all 26,000 dedicated professionals whose passion drives the client service, innovation and entrepreneurial spirit that our company is known for. Thanks to them, we have become a platform that removes friction from life's most complex moments. Our platform continues to execute at scale and grow across our businesses. Rocket Mortgage is the largest mortgage lender in America with industry-leading profitability. Our title and settlement services business, Amrock, is also the largest of its kind in the country. Our emerging businesses also set new records in the quarter. Rocket Homes reached $2.3 billion in real estate transaction value, and its current annualized run rate would place the company among the top 20 brokerages in the country. Rocket Auto also reached a record $530 million in gross merchandise value in the quarter. The number of vehicle sales facilitated by Rocket Auto in the last 12 months would put the company in the top 10 of all used car dealers nationwide. On today's call, I will highlight the flexibility of the Rocket platform to capture the growth ahead, including our strategy to revolutionize the home buying experience. I'm also excited to touch on the new Mortgage as a Service opportunity we're launching in partnership with Salesforce. Last quarter, we had excellent results. with closed loan volume and gain on sale margin exceeding the top end of our guidance range. Rocket Mortgage delivered $88 billion in closed loan volume, and Rocket Companies generated $3.2 billion in adjusted revenue and $1.6 billion in adjusted EBITDA. On an adjusted EBITDA basis, we doubled the size of our business compared to 2019, again, demonstrating the sheer power and scalability of the Rocket platform. We hit new records in both purchase and cash out refi volume in Q3. We've also just recently announced a major partnership with Salesforce. Up to this point in time, we have used Rocket technology to process our own mortgage volume through both our direct-to-consumer and partner network channels. The Salesforce partnership will now open our mortgage technology and process to third-party financial institutions through the Salesforce Financial Services Cloud. This new Mortgage as a Service model is a game changer for the industry and for Rocket. More than simply leveraging our technologies, these banks and credit unions will have Rocket integrated into their centralized workflow, making the process seamless and simple. The opportunity is massive. In 2020, the approximately 10,000 banks and credit unions originated over $1 trillion in mortgages. That represents nearly 1/3 of the total market in the U.S. We believe Mortgage as a Service represents a new model for financial institutions to partner with Rocket, paving the way for an even larger opportunity to provide consumer lending as a service, including mortgages, auto loans and personal loans. Expect to hear more about this partnership in the first half of 2022. With multiple channels all operating at scale over a broad range of products, we have many levers to drive growth while optimizing gain on sale margins even in shifting markets. Our ability to pivot and scale is Rocket's key differentiator. In fact, in the third quarter, we saw strong growth in our direct-to-consumer channel, where our purchase initiatives continue to gain traction. We will be allocating additional resources to further support this growth. More broadly, we've seen strength in products that aren't as interest rate sensitive. In the third quarter, both purchase and cash-out refinancing hit new company records, rising approximately 70% year-over-year. This growth is a direct result of Rocket's commitment to providing speed, certainty and choice to our clients, all of which are crucial in the ongoing inventory constrained, highly competitive housing market. Not only did we set a record for purchase volume in the third quarter with both our direct-to-consumer and partner channels achieving all-time highs, but by the end of September, we had already originated more purchase volume than any full year prior. This rapid growth in the purchase segment puts us well on our way to reaching our goal of becoming the #1 retail purchase lender by 2023. Helping drive our continued growth in the purchase category is our seamless end-to-end home buying ecosystem in partnership with Rocket Homes. Through our integrated platform, clients can find their next house on Rocket Homes' 50 state home listing search platform, secure an agent from the company's agent network, get financing through Rocket Mortgage, have Amrock conduct the title work and appraisal for them and then after closing, have their mortgage serviced by Rocket Mortgage, all from one centralized platform. Other key drivers helping us win in today's purchase market are industry-leading products like our overnight underwrite and a broad range of home buying and selling services. For instance, Rocket Homes offers the choice to sell your home through its own staff agents, its 50-state network of real estate professionals or through its for sale by owner [ph] platform. Additionally, we recently rolled out our Breaking Barriers program for our Rocket Pro TPO partners. These technology enhancements paired with programming to better connect real estate professionals and mortgage brokers are designed to give our partners the tools that they need to win today and well into the future. As we look ahead to the next year, we expect our Rocket Mortgage business to achieve continued market share growth, exceeding 10% share in a purchase-heavy market. This is consistent with our track record of being opportunistic to grow share. For instance, in 2019, our company's mortgage originations accounted for roughly 6.5% of the market. In 2020, that grew to nearly 8.5%. With the fourth quarter guidance released earlier today, which Julie will walk through in more detail, we are well on pace to break 2020's strong origination record of $320 billion and end the year with 9.5% market share. As we look towards 2022, we will continue to invest in the rapid growth of our platform. delivering a unified client experience across mortgage, real estate, auto, personal loans and solar. In our emerging businesses, we expect continued growth from Rocket Auto and Rocket Homes in 2022, on top of the records reached in 2021. We will also formally launch our solar program and continue to target new product categories to add to the Rocket platform, either organically or through acquisition. Our platform has been built to capitalize on the vast data proprietary ecology, trusted brand and cloud force here at Rocket Companies. We find over decades these pillars of our platform are the foundation of our growth ahead. With that, I'll turn things over to Julie to go deeper into the numbers. Julie? Okay. Well, good question here. Yes, as I think both Julie and I referenced, Q3 was a record in both direct-to-consumer and our partner networks for purchase. And so it was a strong purchase quarter in general, but for us to see those records is a great indicator of our growth in that area. We're excited about 2022 because if we kind of look at where industry experts are projecting, they're talking about the continued growth. I'm seeing forecasts [8-plus] percent. We're seeing median home prices estimated to be north of $435,000. And as home prices grow, of course, mortgage amounts grow, and you understand how our business works that is great for the unit economics of our business, more revenue generated on the same units that we're putting through the system. So just in general, the industry looks very strong. Now speaking specifically to us, our full purchase ecosystem continues to grow. Our Rocket Homes platform, the home search experience, the number of visitors reaching that site is growing. Our agent network base is growing. Our centralized agent system is growing. The way that we're integrating home financing, the Rocket Mortgage component into all these experiences is strengthening, the way that we're integrating title and settlement services. So we've been leading in all of these categories to make sure that not only do we provide an incredible experience, we're able to make sure we're monetizing that experience as well. In particular with real estate agents, we've rolled out our single point-of-contact process in the life of the loans, which is really important to them. We've given real estate agents tracking for appraisal and title work, which is very important to them. I think we're north of 55,000 agents now that are in our network. And so all of these components are working. And then if you watch some of the advertising that we do, you'll notice that there's been a shift there driving purchase as well as cash out refinance. So all of the levers, and we've talked about this for call after call now, we're very fortunate that we've got so many distribution levers to pull. But in all those categories, we've just been leaning in to drive the purchase messaging, and that's giving us that growth. And then of course, add on top of it, the strength that we're seeing in TPO and then this partnership that we're launching with Salesforce to reach nearly 10,000 banks or credit unions, that will give us additional reach into the purchase market. So I just think Q3 is a great indicator of all the efforts that we're putting forward that we expect to continue moving forward. Yes, this is a great addition to our partnership network. So as you know, we've got these premier enterprise partners that we've been adding to our base. We started with Schwab that represents $1 billions of closed loans for us on a yearly basis. We've got our API integrations with Mint in that platform, Credit Karma. But this is a new way for us to broaden that reach and that's really, as you talked about, Mortgage as a Service to banks and credit unions. And if you look at these financial institutions, many of which are already using the Salesforce Financial Services Cloud, we're adding a Rocket technology to the CRM 360 View technology that they're already using. And it's hard for these financial institutions on their own to make the level of investment required to really be great at mortgage. And so they've got the relationships. They want to retain the relationships. They want to protect all of the other ways that they interact with these clients, and we know mortgage is a critical way to do this. Now we're giving them access to our brand, our tech, and that allows them to bring a great experience and allows us to gain that client that maybe otherwise would have worked with the bank or the credit union. As you referenced, that's $1 trillion or so worth of mortgage volume, and the home price increases continue as they're scheduled to that will be growing. When it comes to the economics, and how we're going to really kind of penetrate this market, again, we're very fortunate because we're going to be working with Salesforce. And as a Salesforce client for many years, I can tell you that their sales force is incredible. And so they have great relationships with these financial institutions. They will be out as banks and credit unions think about either renewing contracts or adding Salesforce Financial Services Cloud to their platform, and we will be there in partnership with them now explaining this new feature that makes the cloud platform even stronger. And so it's really two great sales forces, no pun intended, teaming up to reach these banks and credit unions. So on our own, I'm pretty confident in our business development team, but now combining with the Salesforce business development group, I think, is very, very exciting. And then we are able to share the economics on the gain on sale with the banks and credit unions. And it's very similar to some of the other economics we've talked about in the past with these premier enterprise partners that we've already got on the platform. So really good economics for us. Yes. I'll let Julie field that one. Maybe just to add on to that a bit. We've touched on this being strategic about the acquisitions that we might look at. As the market is shifting and changing, I think that presents increased opportunity for us there to be thoughtful but more aggressive in our approach. And I'd also say that, as Julie referenced, if we look at where the stock has been here recently, you've noticed our buybacks have increased and we're -- we think the stock is a smart for us to do buybacks when we see the stock at that level. Yes. Great question. I think if we look back about 24 months, there is somewhere just north of about $19 trillion of home equity in the country. Recently, that number that we've seen, I think, at the end of the second quarter was $24 trillion. So a huge increase in home equity. We referenced the home equity increases inside of our own servicing book. Of course, our retention rates there are excellent. And so the first approach with interest rates the way that they're at is to make sure that we are messaging with marketing and branding and digital advertising, performance marketing to continue to see increase in cash-out transactions. It makes a lot of sense for our client base, to be vigilant when we look at ways we can assist our servicing book to help those clients with cash out. Many of those clients will reach out to us thinking about purchasing, but with, I think, about 2, 2.5 maybe months worth of inventory out there. In many cases, that conversation changes from buying a new home to renovating their existing home, another opportunity for us to assist them with cash out. And then of course, we've got Rocket Loans. And we talked a lot recently about Rocket Loans and how we're leveraging that technology as we expand solar. But the primary purpose of initially rolling out Rocket Loans was to deliver a $24 to $40 experience for our client base to tap into available money that's not a home equity line product today. But it just speaks to how we're able to leverage that technology in the future, pivoted it to use the same technology for solar, and we have the opportunity to take that same technology speed and certainty that we could bring to the table for home equity lines or those sorts of things in the future if we think that, that's advantageous. Right now, a cash-out refinance really is the product that makes the most sense for our client base. Yes. When we look at our TPO business, if you can go back about 4 or 5 months, we had about 36% wallet share. So of the partners that we were working with, we were getting just north of 1 out of every 3 loans that they originated. If we now look where we were in the third quarter, that's north of 50%. So we're really excited about how those partners are committing to working with Rocket. In addition, when we look at just overall market share, we're up 2 or 3 percentage points from where we were here just a few months back or a few quarters back, I should say. So our growth in that market continues. We just recently announced our most recent offering to our partner base here. We've launched our new client portal, many enhancements that they've been asking for. We launched our Broker Connect program. So we're introducing our broker partners to our real estate partners, so they can continue to develop business together across the United States of America. We rolled out Rocket Connect to all of our brokers, a streamlined way for them to communicate directly with our operations folks guaranteeing a 2-hour or less turn time, which we think is leading in the industry. So as you can tell, we are fully committed to making sure that we're the premier provider of these services to our TPO partners. And that's really, again, if we go back to the platform, and we talked in our prepared remarks about how we're leaning into direct-to-consumer because we have that ability to market the cash-out refinance market to purchase and grow there. But I think we're also uniquely positioned to continue to invest in the TPO business because of how well diversified our entire business is. And so I really look at that as an opportunity as it becomes more challenging for our model line mortgage businesses to do that, an opportunity for us to continue to invest, win over the broker community, increase wallet share and set ourselves up for even more profitable business here in the future. So we're full steam ahead in that business. Very happy with the partners we've got and how that -- how the business is performing. And again, we always take a long view as we build these things and nothing different with our TPO partners here. Yes. You're touching on our life work here at Rocket Companies. So when I started 26 years ago, I was very aware of market conditions and market changes and how that could impact our mortgage company's volume. And so we have, especially over the last 10 years, been incredibly focused on diversifying and controlling the outcome of our business. We started with building an incredibly strong brand, an incredibly strong marketing team, over 300 people now, very focused on digital and performance marketing. As you know, we invest over $1 billion a year there through our direct-to-consumer space. When you think about an increase of $5 trillion in equity, and you also think about our ability to do cash-out transactions. I think we've touched on in the past between cash out and purchase how we're well north of 50% of our overall origination volume, I think we sell in that area. So I look at that as a massive opportunity going into 2022. The growth of our purchase segment setting records in Q3, certainly in Q4 because of timing in the holidays, someone being interested in a purchase and actually closing on a home can vary a bit. But when I think longer term, going into Q1 and Q2 and all of 2022, as they're talking about continued increase in home value and demand with purchase, I feel very good about that. And so the market may shrink a bit, it may not. I think it's hard to say. But what I know is that between all of these categories, the Salesforce, the partnerships, all the things that we're investing in TPO, the direct-to-consumer, our business has the ability to pivot and shift, maximizing the capacity that we've built, bringing a great experience to our client, and that's our mission. Our mission is to continue to build out a platform where we guide the growth of the organization. So the last thing I'll say, it is market share. That's why we're projecting to go north of 10% market share. We've consistently been growing market share regardless of the size of the pie through all of these vehicles I've just discussed, and that's what we anticipate that we'll do in 2022. Well, when you think about the ability for our partners to tie into the digital experiences we create, the APIs that we've created, the financial institutions like a Morgan Stanley or a Charles Schwab or Mass Mutual, I really feel strongly that if a financial institution wants to partner with someone that can deliver incredible client service and has a highly respected brand, we are the choice for them, really the only choice for them. And so that partner business will continue to serve us very, very well. When you think about our broker partners, we're bringing incredible value to them. We've got our folks traveling the country now, setting up these connects, aligning the real estate agent partners we've got with the broker partners, strengthening their relationships there. We've got the technology to ensure that our brokers can perform. We've got the brand that they can leverage. We're really turning all of the assets of this organization and offering them to anyone that would like to partner, whether it be a bank, a credit union, an insurance agent, a financial planner, a mortgage broker. And so that partner channel is one of the main components of the future of our business. And so it's exciting to see its growth, and I imagine its growth will continue. Well, to think about your first question, I think it starts with servicing because I think a lot of people will view servicing as this asset and what would its value be if you were to sell it. When we think about servicing, we think about the reoccurring payments that we receive on a monthly basis as we strengthen the relationship and market to that client, and then are able to offer additional services to the client. And so mortgage for a pretty significant portion of time, I'm not going to speculate how many months or years, but it will still represent a big chunk of our revenue, of course, because there's not that many products out there that give you the opportunity to generate $6,000 or $7,000 or $8,000 per unit. But when Julie talks about the growth, I'm not aware of another real estate or auto sales organization that's growing at the rate that we're growing. And I think that speaks to the scalability of the platform. I think it speaks to the brand and how consumers, once they're with Rocket, really value the relationship. And so we'll continue to see those businesses grow. I guess any -- everyone will have to make their own determination as to what is a meaningful percentage of revenue. Is that 5% of revenue? Is that 10% of revenue? Our mission, though, is to continue to add these services and allow the lifetime value of the client and the reoccurring revenue of that client over an extended period of time to really be the measure. When I talk to the company, we don't talk any more -- of course, we're looking at units closed and volume, but what we're really talking about are the number of users on our platform, right? How many millions of people do we talk to each month? How many millions of people do we have on the servicing platform? And that's a shift, I think, from the traditional mortgage industry, but you've got to make that shift because that's really how we're thinking about it. If we have the ability to reach a 5 million, 10 million, 15 million, 20 million Americans a year and understand their finances, understand their credit, understand their property, then you start thinking of the power of that relationship and that becomes more meaningful over the long run than a closed loan. And so that's the lens that we're really starting to view our business through is how many users that we're putting on the platform. In regards to your other question about when we think about market share, and I'll turn to Julie here, but I think if we look at the overall closed loan market and divide our the closings we have into that. Yes. There are many different indexes out there, and so we'll look at MBA, the old published numbers as well. And so it varies a bit, right, just putting out the number. Yes. Yes. I think when we talk about 10% or North, I believe we're kind of looking at where the MBA is looking for 2022 and where we'll be at. Thank you. That's right. And Julie, this is just in because we're doing this live. To answer Ivy's question, we take Fannie, Freddie, MBA and her average those to kind of think of what the overall market is. And you're right, we're talking about 10% on that average. Yes. Well, so good question here. Some of these financial institutions currently have their own small mortgage origination capabilities. Some don't participate in mortgage at all right now. But we're really plugging directly into the Salesforce Financial Services Cloud. So if you think about an originator at a bank or credit union, and they're using that to understand their client base, work with their client base. The data about that client is in that CRM system. They'll now have access to tap in directly to a rocket. It won't be white label. We're using our brand. Again, we've invested billions and millions of dollars and create an incredible experience so people want that brand. They want to be able to say to their consumer, \"Hey, look, you're actually able to get a rocket mortgage with my help.\" In some cases, the bank may continue to have a licensed originator who is performing some of those duties. In other cases, we may provide some assistance there and also have a license retainer in our end support theirs. So we're able to pivot a bit based on how much the bank wants to be doing and then, of course, our technology, our services, all of those things will process underwrite and close the loan. And when I talk about partnership, and Julie talked about this in the past, I would really think of this similar to like a Charles Schwab or some of the other, what we call premier partners, that we've got [indiscernible] And I know Julie's referenced, these are more similar to our retail margins from that perspective. Well, I'll turn it over to Bob Walters, who happens to be here with us, who's our Chief Operating Officer, and also an expert in capital markets Yes. Well, that situation, obviously, we'll be gaining clients that currently don't work with us. There's always a little bit of segment overlap. But as we study the market, the consumer that comes to us directly online is a different consumer than the person who chooses to work with a local mortgage broker who's typically a different consumer who chooses to work with their bank or credit union. So this gives us access to a consumer that we may not be reaching day in and day out. So it's really additive from that respect. I also think it's important, we're starting with mortgage here. But as we think about building out our platform, there are other services that financial institutions have already signaled that they may have additional interest in. Very really, when you go to your bank or credit union and learned that they're thinking about helping their clients green their home with solar. And so this is a way for us to help them strengthen their relationship with their client base, but also a starting place for us that could possibly expand into other products and services here in the future. Go ahead, Julie. Yes. Very good question. So our mission here with Rocket Homes and with for sale by owner com and with our centralized realtor group our network of real estate agents is really to make sure that we have an offering for anyone who's thinking about buying or selling a home. That approach really gives us the ability to help all of the clients that may be reaching out to us One of the components that we've added here recently, as we touched on, I think, on our last earnings call, we were just starting to do some testing is iBuyer. And for us, the iBuyer program, in particular, will allow a client who may otherwise have a contingency on their approval, meaning they have to sell their existing home before they buy their next to remove that contingency. And that's important in a competitive marketplace because if you're going up against somebody who doesn't have a mortgage -- a call contingency or is paying cash, then you need that flexibility. Our decision, as you know, with iBuying was to partner with other -- with actual iBuyers. So as Joe talked about all the time, we have a very capital-light structure here, which means that we're not in the business of purchasing real estate. And so the model that we have built is to start bringing on multiple iBuyers who seem to have expertise in certain areas across the country. provide that as a service, one of many to our clients if that will help them buy their new home and then allow that third party to actually be there if they do require in. In many cases, actually, what we're finding is that someone uses that as a backup plan, but quite honestly, list their home through one of the many ways that I've just described on Rocket Homes and actually sells the home before needing to close on the other homes. So it's a nice thing to have as a backstop, but in today's real estate market is not something that's required much of the time. Well, I think we probably touched on this here on a few different calls. As we continue to help our clients understand their finances, help them save money. We're having discussions about their largest bills. And of course, the auto comes up. And so the vast data lake that we've got here, along with a servicing platform that allows us to communicate with the clients on a monthly basis, really gives us the opportunity to start creating a very high-quality auto lead that we can then use to support Rocket Auto a bit different than maybe the type of road you could think of that would be generated from an AutoTrader.com or Cars.com or something of that nature. We've already got the relationship with the client. We've also got a significant amount of data -- and as we see and won't figure out if it's the second part of 2022 or as we get into 2023, it's hard to say. But eventually, there will be more inventory that is out there. And as there's more inventory on dealer lots, I think we'll see even increased desire from our dealer partners to have us assist in driving sales. And so Julie touched on the growth that we've seen from Rocket Auto this year. And what I would argue might be the one of the most challenging years this business because it's very rare that you would go to a dealer today and ask them for having trouble selling cars, yet they're calling us and wanting to jump on our platform in a more normalized market where they can use that additional support, we get even more excited about the opportunity for that business to continue to grow. Thank you. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining the call here today. As I started out the call, I couldn't be prouder of our entire team and the incredible work that they have done through the first three quarters of this year, and we're excited about finishing up 2021 and heading on to 2022, where we will work hard to go 10% or north of market share and keep going up our entire platform. And I will see on the next call. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Sharon Ng, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nSharon Ng: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Rocket Companies earnings conference call covering the second quarter of 2021. With us this afternoon are Rocket Companies CEO, Jay Farner; our CFO, Julie Booth; and our President and COO, Bob Walters. Before I turn things over to Jay, let me quickly go over our disclaimers. On today's call, we will provide you with information regarding our second quarter 2021 performance as well as our financial outlook. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions we mentioned today. We encourage you to consider the risk factors contained in our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainty. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or further events, except as required by law. This call is being broadcast online and is accessible on our IR Website. A recording of the call will be available later today. Our commentary today will also include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP metrics for our reported results can also be found in our earnings release issued earlier today, as well as in our filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jay Farner to get us started. Jay?\nJay Farner: All right. Well, good afternoon, and welcome to the Rocket Companies earnings call for the second quarter of 2021. We had a strong second quarter as we continue to execute on our growth strategy and leverage our platform across real estate, auto and financial services. In real estate, revenue was driven in part by record purchase volume, putting us on track to reach our goal of becoming the largest retail home purchase lender in the nation by the end of 2023. Many of the accomplishments that we've achieved are results of our technology and of course our people, who bring their best to work each and every day. This tremendous combination was recently rewarded with Rocket Mortgage again being named the #1 company for client service and mortgage servicing by J.D. Power. The accolade marks the eighth consecutive time our company has earned this honor and it's our 19th J.D. Power award overall, when you include the 11 straight #1 rankings we've received for mortgage origination. Our servicing team put our clients first, helping them through the difficult and uncertain times during the pandemic. While clients at other lenders experienced several hour wait times at the onset of the pandemic, Rocket Mortgage clients were able to navigate a digital solution, complete with educational resources and easily apply for forbearance plans online. This approach resulted in Rocket's forbearance rate being 41% lower in the industry. Innovative technology-driven, client-first solutions such as these are a testament of our ability to scale and to quickly pivot to meet the demands of unpredictable markets without the need to add headcount and ultimately deliver unmatched client experiences. As we turn back to the second quarter results, 2020 accelerated the shift to an all digital experience, an opportunity that Rocket has planned to capture. The demand for digital experiences has only expanded providing true momentum for Rocket Companies across all our core markets: real estate, auto, and financial services. Consider this. When we look back at 2019, we have now more than doubled the size of our business from pre-COVID levels. Rocket Companies generated $84 billion in closed loan volume and $2.8 billion of revenue in the second quarter of 2021. Loans more than doubled the second quarter of 2019 and more volume than we did the entire year of 2018. Our Q2 EBITDA of $1.3 billion was more than triple the same period two years ago, demonstrating the sheer power and scalability of the Rocket platform. On today's call, I'll highlight the flexibility of the Rocket platform to capture the growth ahead, including our strategy to revolutionize the homebuying experience, also touch on our increasingly important relationship with B2B partners across the Rocket ecosystem. As we've shared with you in past calls, the Rocket platform is built to win. Our initiatives provide certainty in life's most complex moments. We removed the friction and pain points for major events, like buying a home, getting a personal loan, or purchasing a car, all from a scalable centralized platform. This flexibility allows us to stay nimble and go after the areas of greatest opportunity, optimizing revenue for our companies and driving value for our investors. In today's environment, consumer demand is incredibly strong in each of our markets. In fact, the markets are so hot that there are significant inventory challenges in both real estate and automotive sectors. Even under these conditions, we achieved records for home purchase volume as well as Rocket auto gross merchandise value and unit sales. Based on the strength of demand at the top of our funnel, we believe both record purchase volume and record auto results would have been even higher if not for inventory challenges. As today's mortgage market shifts for home purchase in 2021, Rocket is geared to capture more purchase volume driven by our superior technology-driven client experience, product innovation and our integrated end-to-end homebuying ecosystem. We mentioned last quarter that our company has set a goal to become the largest retail home purchase lender in the country by 2023. Continuing to transform the homebuying experience is the single biggest opportunity for Rocket Companies today. We spent years creating a complete end-to-end experience that puts the power of choice back into the hands of the consumer. From credit monitoring to home search, connections with better local agents, centralized services or comprehensive ForSaleByOwner process and our recently announced iBuying services to provide a back-up offer to sellers. We have the suite of services that allow consumers to create a bespoke process tailored to their individual needs while driving extremely strong conversion rates. When paired with the power of America's largest mortgage lender and Rocket Mortgage and one of the largest title providers and Amrock, no other company can provide the same level integrated one-stop services that Rocket delivers. Our iBuying program facilitated through third-party partner companies will be released over the next several quarters. Just last month, Rocket Homes announced an important milestone posting home listings in all 50 states. Rocket Companies is now the only residential real estate ecosystem that has mortgage licenses, real estate broker licenses, home search listings, real estate agents and real estate agent partners spanning all 50 states. With nationwide coverage, Rocket Homes is performing at scale with traffic growing six-fold year-over-year to reach nearly 2 million unique monthly visitors in the second quarter. In addition, Rocket Homes drove a record $2 billion in second quarter real estate transaction value, representing the value of homes purchased and sold through our real estate agent network. Rocket Homes is still in the early innings in a very long runway for growth. Rocket Homes also drives purchase volume for Rocket Mortgage and we expect a momentum in purchase to continue. Rocket Homes draws in-process clients into the rocket ecosystem even earlier in the funnel and then regularly engages with our pool of nearly 2.4 million servicing clients, representing $0.5 trillion in servicing value. This significantly increases our lifetime value in recurring revenue with potential and existing clients. From the beginning of year, roughly 70% of Rocket Homes' transactions involve both an agent in the Rocket Homes real estate agent network and in Rocket Mortgage, representing an attach rate among the highest in the industry. We also have a high attach rate between Rocket Mortgage and Amrock. In fact, Amrock serves as the appraisal management company for approximately 65% of appraisals order for our direct consumer mortgages, illustrating the power of our ecosystem. We are also extending our value proposition of creating simple, seamless experiences to now include residential solar. Solar energy adoption is at a growth inflection point. According to third-party research, the current solar energy market is expected to quadruple by 2030, with roughly one in eight homes adopting solar power. Our dedicated highly trained group of team members from the Rocket Cloud Force will serve as Rocket's solar advisers to our clients. The team will help clients to determine if solar panels are the best choice for their home and connect homeowners to our simple, digital financing application. Once financing is complete, the Rocket Cloud Force will facilitate the installation of a new solar solution. We will also be well positioned to help consumers who may not have started with Rocket Solar consolidate their solar loan and mortgage for significant cost savings. We launched Rocket Solar with a regulatory [ph] finance product in late July and expect to be operating at scale in 2022. Our entry in solar is yet another example of Rocket Companies maximizing the lifetime value of our clients by adding complementary services that we are uniquely positioned to deliver, thanks to the versatility and scalability of the Rocket platform. Looking at Rocket Auto the company drove record performance in the second quarter with both auto unit sales growth of 140% and gross merchandise value more than tripling year-over-year. And considering the auto inventory shortages facing the industry, we are particularly proud of these results. Rocket auto continues to add new partners who are interested in connecting their inventory with our new perspective buyers. During the quarter, one of the largest online sellers of used cars joined Rocket Auto's partnership network, giving Rocket Auto access to tens of thousands of additional used cars to sell through its constantly expanding platform and providing significant more fuel to Rocket Auto's growth story. Technology and data are the cornerstones of our platform. From the use of data science to optimize every aspect of our client marketing funnel, the use of ethical AI, to aid in client service, to sophisticated pricing models, just to name a few. Technology and data fundamentally drive our business, financing client experience through speed and personalization, increasing efficiency through streamline workflows and decisioning and improving our pull-through and lead conversion. During 2021 intelligent client targeting models were deployed to more than 80% of our client contact, ensuring that our Rocket Cloud Force is reaching out to clients at the exact moment they are most ready to engage with us. By tailoring the experience to client we have lifted conversion resulting in approximately $4 billion in incremental application volumes so far this year. The beauty of our platform is its flexibility to meet clients where they are and scale across multiple products and verticals regardless of the market environment. Our company started as the direct consumer mortgage lender, Rocket Companies is increasingly being multi-product, multichannel platform. In addition to consumers, the Rocket platform works closely with three important B2B constituents; real estate agents, mortgage brokers, and premier enterprise partners. Each of these audiences play a crucial role as trusted advisors, leveraging the patent products and tools that Rocket has developed to help deliver additional value to empower our clients and to reach their goals. Real estate agents, they play a critical role in the homebuying process and we are empowering agents in our network with new leads, products and tools to win in today's competitive environment, through innovative tools like our verified approval process which fully underwrites buyers and allows them to make offers that compete with cash buyers through our overnight underwrite, which ensures purchase loans are underwritten in mere hours, we arm real estate professionals and their clients with the tools to ensure that they win. Another Rocket Mortgage innovation that's proven popular with realtors is Rocket Pro Insight, which we unveiled last year to help real estate agents create [indiscernible] letters through our office, track the status of their client's mortgage and receive real time updates. The number of real estate agents leveraging Rocket Pro Insight more than tripled to 15,000 up from just 14,000 two quarters ago. For the thousands of mortgage brokers in our Rocket Pro TPO network we arm them with the industry knowledge and tools to work smarter and grow their business. In the second quarter we began our revamp of our builder partner portal starting with our newly enhanced pricing calculator, providing greater ease of use for our partners to run different scenarios for their clients. From the past month more than 20,000 unique mortgage professionals relied on our interactive broker tools to move mortgage applications to the finish line and their clients to closing too. Our Pathfinder tool that we created in partnership with Google, provides simple answers to even the most complicated mortgage qualification and underwriting questions and has become one of the top resources for mortgage brokers. We continue to add new premier enterprise partners to our network and we deepened our integration with our existing partners. We recently launched our new integration with Credit Karma allowing more than 110 million users to apply for a Rocket mortgage directly inside their app. We also continued to grow and expand our relationship with partners including Mint, Charles Schwab and realtor.com, just to name a few. We are excited to serve a broader range of clients through deep integrations with our partners and deliver the trusted high-quality experiences their customers expect. It is also my pleasure to announce a new relationship with MassMutual. This new relationship will allow the company's 9000 plus agents to originate home loans through Rocket Mortgage. Turning to our community, from the beginning we have operated with a more than profit philosophy, along with Rocket Community Fund, our philanthropic partner company, we have executed numerous data-driven investments and initiatives to serve and support Detroiters and revitalize Detroit, our hometown and where we are the largest employer. At the end of June we sponsored a flagship event the Rocket Mortgage Classic, PGA tournament event held in Detroit. Rocket Mortgage Classic showcases the best talent in golf while raising funds to help bridge the digital divide and bring broadband connectivity to all Detroiters. As we continue to grow Detroit, it's critical that Detroiters have an equitable opportunity to grow with us. In closing, we are entering the third quarter with tremendous momentum across our entire platform and we are poised to have a record year across our platform from Rocket Mortgage to Amrock, Rocket Homes and Rocket Auto. I'd like to think about this. Over the past several years Rocket Mortgage has grown volume and taken market share consistently. In 2018 we originated $83 billion in mortgage volume. In 2019 that grew to $145 billion and we ended 2020 with $320 billion in mortgage volume. While industry forecasters expect a smaller market in 2021, we expect to grow volume from our 2020 record levels. We are going to gain market share and achieve record origination volume this year. In addition, we expect our servicing book to grow more than 30% this year to over $600 billion, driving recurring cash revenue stream of more than $1 billion. Rocket portfolio companies reinforce our ecosystem and contribute to our best in business retention rate, expanding client lifetime value. This year we are building on momentum from 2020 and we are proud of what our team has accomplished and I'm even more excited about what's ahead. With that, I will turn things over to Julie to go deeper into the numbers. Julie?\nJulie Booth: Thank you, Jay and good afternoon everyone. I\u2019m pleased to report another quarter of strong financial results for Rocket Company. This continued success demonstrates our ability to leverage our flexible platform. I will be sharing some detail around the investments we're making to drive growth and provide insights into trends we are seeing for I will reference some longer term comparisons particularly comparing our 2021 performance on a two-year basis relative to 2019 levels. 2020 was an unusual year for the economy with a combination of historically low interest rate and constrained mortgage industry capacity. Under these market conditions, Rocket exhibited the scalability of our platform with our loan origination volumes growing 121% in 2020 year-over-year while our expenses grew only 47%. Given the unusual year 2020 represented, it is important to look at our growth and profitability relative pre-COVID results. We were successful in gaining market share in last year's environment and we continue to grow our business as we head into 2021. During the second quarter of 2021 Rocket Companies generated $2.8 billion of adjusted revenue which represents a 110% increase from 2Q 2019 and $1.3 billion of adjusted EBITDA, up more than [indiscernible] 2Q 2019 representing a 46% adjusted EBITDA margin. We generated net income of $1 billion which exceeded full year 2019 net income and we generated adjusted net income of $920 million in Q2 2021, which was more than triple Q2 of 2019 levels, representing a 33% adjusted net income margin. Our adjusted earnings per share was $0.46 for the quarter. Rocket Mortgage generated [indiscernible] volume during the quarter, up more than 160% from $32 million in Q2 2019 and in line with the midpoint of our Q2 guidance due to products which include home purchases, term reductions, and cash out refinances represented more than half our closed loan volume in the second quarter. Turning to home purchase in particular, purchase volume nearly doubled year-over-year and we set a new company record in the second quarter. We estimate that the largest retail purchase lender did $60 billion of purchase origination volume in 2020 excluding correspondent volume. With the success we have had during the first half of 2021, and the momentum we have going into the third quarter, we expect that our full year 2021 purchase volume will exceed $60 billion dollars. This growth, in combination with the recently announced Rocket Homes initiatives, are bringing us closer to our goal of becoming the number one retail purchase lender by 2023. For the quarter, our rate lock down sale margin was 278 basis points which is in line with our expectations at the midpoint of our guidance and substantially higher than most multichannel mortgage originators. Our strong results extend across the Rocket Companies platforms. Despite a relatively low level of auto inventory impacting the industry, Rocket Auto continued to accelerate its growth generating $484 million of gross merchandise value during the second quarter, up nearly 35% as compared to Q1 2021. Through the first half of 2021 we have generated $844 million of GMV and are on track to more than double 2020 levels. With on boarding of new inventory partnerships, including just recently, one of the largest online sellers of used cars, we expect to further accelerate growth in the second half of 2021. Rocket Homes faced similar inventory constraint, however was successful in generating record real estate transaction value of $2 billion, which represents the value of homes purchased and sold through our real estate agent network during the second quarter. We also saw record traffic to rockethomes.com during the second quarter or nearly 2 million monthly unique visitors expanding an important top of the marketing funnel. Rocket Companies plan here [ph] is based on leveraging our profitability advantages to constantly reinvest in our business, further strengthen our competitive position, expanding to new areas of growth and extend client lifetime value. With the opportunities we see ahead, and to fully realize the potential of our platform and unique real estate ecosystem, we will continue to invest for the long term, particularly in technology, marketing and our most valuable resource, our team members. We plan to grow our technology, product strategy, and data intelligence teams. Within Rocket, we have more than 3000 team members dedicated to building proprietary technology. Key priorities for investment are continuing to deliver great client experiences, driving operational efficiency and extending our platform to partners. Increasing the lifetime value of our clients is another core component of our growth strategy. Our business is profitable on the first transaction with the client, we then maintain ongoing loan servicing relationships with 2.4 million clients representing over $500 billion in outstanding loan principal. Mortgage servicing drives a recurring cash revenue stream for Rocket Companies that now exceeds $1 billion on an annual basis, reserved ph unpaid principal balance of 34% in the last 12 months and net retention north of 90%. Based on our strong relationships with clients, we continue to expand our platform to address more of the important transactions in their lives. Whether that's real estate, auto, personal loan or new products, like Residential Solar, incremental products on our platform position us to increase the lifetime value of our client relationships. Looking ahead to Q3 we are seeing strong fundamental tailwinds for our business. The housing market remains active. Homeowners are sitting on the highest levels of home equity in more than a decade and the investments we have been making are gaining traction across the platform. Our price point for both purchase and refinance remains robust. As Jay mentioned, we expect to set a new company record with full year 2021 closed loan origination volume on pace to exceed the previous record achieved in 2020. While the Mortgage Bankers Association and other public industry forecasts predicted overall mortgage borrowings will decrease as compared to last year, we expect to drive growth and market share gains in 2021. For the third quarter, we currently expect closed loan volumes in the range of $82 billion to $87 billion and rate loss volume between $83 billion and $90 billion. We expect third quarter gain on sale margins should be in the range of 270 to 300 basis points. Regarding our expenses, at this time we believe the run rate of operating expenses for the first and second quarters of 2021 is a good reference for the third quarter with expenses roughly flat even as we are growing mortgage origination. We exited the second quarter with $2 billion of cash on the balance sheet and an additional $2.4 billion of corporate cash used to self-fund loan originations for total available cash of $4.4 billion. Total liquidity stood at $7.8 billion as of June 30, including available cash plus undrawn lines of credit and undrawn MSR lines. Our business is capital light and our balance sheet is extremely strong. This year we expect to generate more than $320 billion in closed loan volume exceeding last year's record. Keep in mind even at these origination levels we need less than $1 billion of cash on hand to properly operate our business. With $7.8 billion in available liquidity, a $4.4 billion in total cash is largely held for investments, dividends and share buybacks. As we've said before, our capital priorities always start with proper capitalization and reinvesting in the business. We continue to look for acquisitions that would be additive to our platform by bringing new clients into our ecosystem, enhancing operational efficiencies or enhancing our product offerings. Beyond that we look to return capital to shareholders. At current price levels we believe our stock is undervalued. Over the past 24 months we have generated $16.3 billion in adjusted EBITDA, our MSR portfolio has a fair value of $4.6 billion and our balance sheet has total equity of $8.2 billion. With our current levels of capital, we have the opportunity to repurchase shares and return capital to shareholders via dividends as we've done in the past, while still being able to invest in the business and consider acquisition opportunities. We will deploy our capital in a strategic and disciplined manner to generate long-term shareholder value. With that, we are ready to turn it back to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ryan Nash from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nRyan Nash: Hey, good afternoon, everyone.\nJay Farner: Hello.\nRyan Nash: So, Jay, Julie, you noted in the release that this is the strongest purchase quarter ever and you said you expect to exceed $60 billion this year and you're on target to be the largest retail purchase lender in the nation by '23. Can you maybe just talk about what you're doing strategically to accelerate purchase originations? I know, Jay, you mentioned capturing them earlier in the funnel, and maybe can you just help us understand how is capturing purchase varying by channel, and how are you able to do this and still maintain margins that are decently in excess of the industry?\nJay Farner: Yes. As we talked about, we think purchase represents probably the biggest opportunity here at Rocket Companies. Although our purchase volume this year will exceed what was the record purchase volume, I think last year, in retail, excluding corresponded, there is still huge upside for us there. We just recently issued a press release describing our Rocket Homes platform and all that we're building there. And really, we are the only organization that has put together every component required to streamline the purchase experience for anyone in America starting with credit, reports and credit education, moving to a really robust home search website in all 50 states. Our traffic is primarily organic there, so very high-quality traffic, which of course helps with conversion. We've launched our centralized real estate services, which make a more cost-effective transaction for people selling their property. Our FSBO, ForSaleByOwner website is growing rapidly to bring in folks into this marketplace. There are many Americans who can sell their homes ForSaleByOwner. We've got a very robust real estate network in all 50 states for clients who require that level of support from real estate agents. And, of course, tying that all into Rocket Mortgage with our verified approvals are overnight underwrite that empowers real estate agents to know that their client is ready to buy the property. And then our Agent Insight, the portal that we now have, I think, north of 50,000 agents using good visibility to update offer letters - approval letters, I should say. All of those components on the retail side will allow us to bring traffic in and convert traffic at levels, that I think the industry has not seen. We talked about - I talked about our attach rate of 70%, of course, our title company, Amrock, and our appraisal services company participate that - in that as well. And then, we've got our TPO program, which is growing. Our market share growth, I think we've seen 18% growth in the last 12 months in TPO, the highest in the industry of any TPO player. As that shifts to purchase, those brokers, who are aligned with us, will also shift to purchase, deleveraging the portal that we're investing heavily in, the new Pricing Calculators that we've built, the Pathfinder tool that we built in partnership with Google to give them the answers that they need on the spot. So it's really all of these tech and marketing investments that we can create a competitive advantage and really our unique value proposition to the consumer that others are not able to provide. And I\u2019ll just have you keep in mind, all of that's been really done internally thus far. As we\u2019ve touched on in our press release, as we get into the later part of 2021 and into 2022, we will have many of those programs at scale, the iBuyer program at scale and then you\u2019ll -- we'll be able to be more visible with those programs to grow them substantially. So that's why we're so excited about our opportunity to continue to grow purchase.\nRyan Nash: Got it. Thanks for all the color. If I could squeeze in one follow-up maybe for Julie. So Julie, the 3Q guide cultural gain on sale in the 2.70% to 3% range, which at the midpoint implies a slight - a tiny uptick from where we were this quarter. Can you maybe just talk about expectations by channels? Do you think we've seen the bottom in the partner channel? And do you think you could maintain retail margins on a go-forward basis? Thanks.\nJulie Booth: Yes. Our gain on sale margin in Q2 came in at 278 kind of right in the middle of our guidance range there. And as you said, our expectations for Q3 are between 270 and 300 basis points, so a consistent and slightly improved over the last quarter. And we do expect both channels to be above where they were in the second quarter from a gain on sale margin perspective. The mix that we expect to see in Q3 is similar to what we saw in Q2 as well. So it is in both channels that we're seeing that. On the retail side of things, the direct-to-consumer, we also feel very good about our gain on sale margins in that channel and seeing those strong, as I mentioned, so feeling really good about where we are in both channels.\nRyan Nash: Thanks for the color.\nOperator: The next question comes from Doug Harter from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nTimothy Chiodo: Thank you. Actually, it is Tim Chiodo from Credit Suisse, but same team. And I wanted to talk a little bit about Rocket Homes. So you did a great job of covering a lot of those during the prepared remarks. I don't mean to rehash any of it, but I just wanted to see if we could elaborate a little bit more on not only how it drives top of funnel purchase leads, but also helps in converting what I understand is that there is not a lack of purchase leads coming into the Rocket ecosystem. It's just that sometimes they have longer lead time and there is other factors that could come into play. And maybe we could just elaborate on how Rocket Homes helps us bring all that together?\nJay Farner: Yes, it's a great question. I think it's an important and a strategic shift in thinking about the purchase lead marketplace. As you mentioned, there's not a shortage at Rocket or in the industry when it comes to purchase leads. The real question is, how do you incubate those leads over a longer time period and to the conversion levels that you need. And to make them work, you've got to have conversion level not just with mortgage, but the combination of mortgage, real estate, title, appraisal and of course, think about the lifetime value. So our viewpoint is different than others, because as we think about a purchase transaction, we also know our 90% retention rate and think about the subsequent refinance transaction. And so -- I think, that's again one of those things, we can't - we don't think about it as a standalone business, we think about it as part of the ecosystem that we've built and that allows us to not only lean in where others cannot, but also get higher conversion rates when others aren't receiving them. The Rocket Pro Insight portal having that information with our real estate partners, so they can see what's going on, there are more confident with us and the conversion rate goes up. The Rocket agents across the country are familiar with Rocket Mortgage, know how to work with us. And so that means information is flowing and the conversion rate goes up, and so all of those things give us a unique advantage. And maybe I'll turn it over to Julie, because maybe to put a little bit more color around how we think about our unit here and the economics around that unit, when we're making decisions to invest in technology or invest in marketing to drive those purchase units. Julie, so do you want to kind of go through that a bit?\nJulie Booth: Yes, an example probably helpful here in thinking about ecosystem and kind of how it all comes together. If you think about a client who is purchasing a new home say for $300,000 within our ecosystem, if you look at a gain on sale margin in our direct-to-consumer channel, let's say it's a 450 basis points gain on sale margin, we would generate $13,000 -- $15,500 of revenue for this purchase. And then if that client is using an agent in our Rocket Homes real estate network, we would generate an additional $3,000 in revenue, assuming a 1% commission fee and then in addition to that, if you add earmark appraisal closing and title services, and they provide us another opportunity there to earn an additional $1,500. So as you look at this in total and think about all of the opportunities we have, that transaction would generate $18,000. And it really doesn't stop there too. If you think about the other things in our business, we've got Rocket Auto, Solar is coming, we've got personal loans, which are all really natural extensions of that home buying experience and these businesses do have a high correlation to the real estate opportunities getting the reach to the client, the right time to serve their needs, throughout their entire home ownership journey. So these newer business areas that we're adding really help us leverage our platform strength, especially from a marketing, a technology and in clients services.\nJay Farner: So, it's putting all these things together, not only does it increase the conversion, which makes our marketing dollar more valuable to us than I think others, but it's also the viewpoint of the lifetime value of that client. And I know something we touched on that I think will be beneficial as we move into the 2022 and beyond is the iBuyer program, we're viewing it again a little differently. We've got 2.4 million folks in our servicing book and we're talking to clients every day, who want to buy a property and are thinking about, can they sell theirs. And so by having that back up offer through iBuyer, we're empowering our client base to move forward with the purchase of a new properties. So it's another exciting component of the ecosystem that we're adding that we will see I think add value and help improve its transactions as we get into 2022.\nOperator: The next question comes from Arren Cyganovich from Citi. Please go ahead.\nArren Cyganovich: Thanks. Jay, I was hoping you could tell us a little bit more about the solar financing opportunity just in terms of what your expectations are in terms of the total addressable market economics and how quickly you'll be rolling out with the product?\nJay Farner: Yes good question and there are quite a few different facets to this program. So taking a step back, I think we've more than 2 million solar installations in the U.S. in 2020. They're saying that that will quadruple by 2030. So that means, one in eight Americans will be adopting residential solar power. So remember, we're really in the saving money - helping people save money business as much as we're in the helping people buy homes business. And so, we're talking to clients each and every day, about how they can save money. In many cases that's refinancing the mortgage, but there are other opportunities and we already engaged in those discussions. And of course our discussion is about the bills people pay including their utility bills. And so it's a really natural pivot to have the discussion around what solar might do and so we'll be doing a few different things as we grow this out. Our Rocket Cloud Force will really service solar advisors to our clients. So they'll be using technology to help determine if someone is eligible solar, how it would work and roughly how much money they can save. Then we'll partner with folks who do the actual panel installation and then our Rocket Homes - Rocket Loans technology will be used to - to do the financing. So it's really two options for our clients, one is doing the financing using their mortgage, which we have programs for and the other is doing the financing that we will be providing through our Rocket Loans solution and so that's kind of the second component. And the third, of course, is that to really capture the full value, clients who have already done solar may need to consolidate their solar loan into their mortgage. We've already started that program and of course we will make that program more robust as we continue to move forward. So clients will be refinancing their solar loan, if it's appropriate back into their mortgage as well. So we can help and all three of those areas and we're uniquely positioned because we're already talking to them about their bills, we're already talking to them about their property, we're already in many cases have an appraisal, we understand the size of the property, the roof in many cases. So a lot of this data that others in this industry require or need to really bring value to the client, we already possess. And so, the market is going to grow rapidly and we'll be taking our brand and our Cloud Force and our technology to make sure that we can be a market leader.\nArren Cyganovich: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJames Faucette: Yes. Thanks a lot. I wanted to touch on -- you made the comment a couple of minutes ago, where you expect the gain on sale margin for both your channels will improve sequentially. Wondering if you can talk a little bit about, like what you would think will be the drivers there and why that is? And I guess, I would imagine you're probably already seeing evidence of that, but just want to confirm that? And then, I guess as a follow-up, what we've heard from others in the industry is, there seems like there's a lot of overcapacity at least of headcount you're seeing some of your competitors already making moves to address that, but I wanted to get kind of what your sense is and how you think this plays out for the competitors and what Rocket's response is going to be as we kind of go through this adjustment period right now?\nJay Farner: I know, Julie touched on where our expenses were in Q1 and Q2 and kind of using that as a reference point for Q3 and beyond, and that's because, although we're growing market share and volume and doing more purchase transactions, our efficiencies in our platform continue to be evident and so we're able to see that growth without having increase in expenses. We also know that continuing to have a platform that's scalable is very important to us. As Julie's always touched on, we're profitable in the first transaction. And so as we see competitors maybe think about reducing the size of their operation, this creates opportunity for us to grow our market share, which is what we believe we will see and what we said here in 2021. We think about this - the play I'll guess I'll use that, we've been running for 36 years and in particular over the last three or four years, is that we set our strategy for growth over the course of many years. A three-year plan is what we really operate off of and we stick to that strategy. And there'll be changes in interest rate of course throughout that period of time, but I think Q2 serves as a good solid proof point that we're able to achieve records. We had - we doubled our purchase size in Q2 of '21 over where we've been in 2020, regardless of interest rate movement, I think Julie's guidance towards where we'll be from a midpoint in rate lock volume also demonstrates our ability to stick to our plan regardless of whether markets are going up or going down. And then the third that I'll say and we touched on this as well, our ability not only through our multiple channels, but our multiple marketing vehicles that we use, really allows us to capture different types of mortgage volumes. Julie touched on the fact that over 50% of the volume that we did during Q2 was not rate sensitive. So, cash out, term adjustment, purchase, as we continue to lean into those things in Q3 and beyond to ensure that we stick to our three-year plan of growth. Julie, I don\u2019t know if you want to touch on any other portions of that question?\nJulie Booth: Yes, I think you hit it really well, Jay. I think on gain on sale margins, like I said, we are seeing the strength in those channels and we are now excited about where we're at and Jay, I think you covered it well.\nJay Farner: Okay, great.\nJames Faucette: Thanks guys.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mark DeVries from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMark DeVries: Yes, thanks. I had a follow-up question about the purchase originations. Can you give us a sense of where that's coming from, what percentage is coming through direct-to-consumer versus your partner channel? And to reach that goal of becoming the top purchase originator, do you need to become the largest wholesale lender or do you think a meaningful percentage of that comes from direct-to-consumer? And then finally of the 70% kind of retention you're getting from Rocket Homes on the originations, is that coming to you through direct-to-consumer or is it coming through the partner channel?\nJay Farner: Yes. So I normally don't break down the specifics between TPO and direct-to-consumer, but remember the things that we can really control from a mix perspective are more on the direct-to-consumer side. The broker will originate the loan that the broker is able to originate and we're happy to assist in any way we can. So you can kind of look at, I think probably industry mix to get a feeling of what that looks like. For us, our ability to market directly to the real estate network, the 50,000 plus that I referenced, our ability to reference directly to the consumer about the value that we can bring in purchase with Rocket Homes, with the ecosystem, that's really our lever to pull, to continue to influence our growth there. And so, although I believe purchase - the growth of purchase we'll see across all channels, we have a larger opportunity when we think about our direct-to-consumer and partner networks to achieve the purchase growth that we're looking for and that's what we've seen before. And as you asked the second question about the attach rate, although we're just now starting to really leverage the ecosystem with our broker partners in particular our Pinnacle partners, we started or have been in the past, more focused on how Rocket Homes ecosystem works with our direct-to-consumer channel.\nMark DeVries: Okay, got it. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mihir Bhatia from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMihir Bhatia: Hi and thank you for taking my question. I actually wanted to maybe talk about capital allocation for a second. You're generating a fair amount of capital even in an environment where some of our peers are may be a little challenged. But at the same time your GAAP -- the capital you're generating, you seem to be making a fair amount of other bets in terms of non-mortgage businesses if you will and growing them. Maybe talk about how you prioritize between those versus returning capital? And just that particular areas where you should be maybe making larger bets on - or focusing on? I guess the question is are you spreading is up to [indiscernible] across all these various things that you're trying to invest and grow at the same time as prioritizing the return of capital? Thank you.\nJay Farner: I'll let Julie reiterate some of the things we said about our capital allocation strategy. I'll tell you one of the benefits - I've been in the company 26 years, we've been in business for 36 years, maybe 26, maybe 25 and a significant portion of our time is spent on team member and leadership development. And so as our organization continues to grow, we have thousands of leaders in our organization. And one of the questions you have to ask yourself is, how do you retain the top talent that you develop over time, as they search for new opportunities to grow? And so we're really fortunate to be able to leverage our brand, our client base and provide other services that are tied directly into the mortgage that we started with. I'll give you an example, add to specific percentage, but the vast a significant portion of auto buying occurs within the first six months of the purchase or refinance of the home. So we have that data, we're talking to that client, we're servicing that client, we're skilled -- our Rocket Cloud Force is skilled at selling and now we've built the technology to tie those clients to inventory across the country. We just announced that we aligned with some of the largest used car operations in the country. So we're really able to develop a whole new business channel, leveraging all of the things we already possess. So it's not -- I don't view it as like an ancillary or side business because it's so tied into the core of what we do and it allows us to keep our talent. Solar is the same exact thing, which we touched on this, but it's about saving money with your home. It's exactly what we do for millions of people, have done for millions and millions of people and we're doing that at no additional cost to acquire and I am able to take a leader who has been with me for 25 years, who may without a new opportunity, say hey, Jay, now I'm thinking about looking somewhere else for the second part of my career, but instead I am looking to stay here, grow out that channel with all the best practices that that he or she has learned over the 25 years that they've been here and at an incredibly profitable product to our mix. Same with homes, we've already spent half hour talking about homes and its natural synergies with mortgage. So, no, I'm not concerned about being spread too thin because these things are value add to our consumer, highly profitable and leverage the talent that we've got inside the organization. Now Julie, I'll maybe let you talk a bit about the capital portion, but I think some of the question was there, are you dedicating enough capital in all, do we have enough capital for all these things?\nJulie Booth: Yes, I certainly will. You walked and hear about with lots of capital, yes you move up a little bit of a context around that and as you know we do operate in a capital-light business and our business model is highly cash generative. So we have consistently demonstrated a strong track record of profitability that has allowed us to maintain a very strong balance sheet. So this has given us a great flexibility to actually continue to be very opportunistic. So that's been a great outcome of our profitable business. And just to kind of reiterate how we think about capital, our framework is really very consistent with how we've been talking about it. First and foremost, we're going to look to reinvest in our business through brands, technology and investing in our team members. Then we're going to look at M&A opportunities and if that is something beyond that, we still have additional capital, we look to return that capital to shareholders through either share repurchases or through dividends and currently, we believe, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks that our stock is currently undervalued and given that when we looked at our business and the capital it takes to operate our business, the cash that it takes to operate our business that's been a $1 billion just needed to operate our business. So mining it as of June 30 as I said, we have about $4.4 billion dollars of available cash. So all in with $7.8 billion of total liquidity as we said, this puts us in a great position where we could potentially use both in terms of capital to shareholders either through repurchases or through a dividend as we've done in the past.\nMihir Bhatia: Yes.\nJay Farner: We're working through our model, but we're in a unique position to not have to choose one of the options, but have the ability to do all of the things that we would like to do.\nMihir Bhatia: And then just on that capital point, you do have a buyback in place yet already. Right? So, have you executed anything against it? And I'll get back in line, thank you.\nJulie Booth: Yes, we have executed against that during the second quarter and you will see that in the 10-Q that's coming up tomorrow.\nMihir Bhatia: Understood, thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ryan McKeveny from Zelman and Associates. Please go ahead.\nRyan McKeveny: Hey, congrats on the performance and thanks for taking my questions. I will ask one more about Rocket Homes. So just to dig in a little on the comments and the press release about on staff agents in Detroit, I guess, maybe if you could just share some thoughts around the idea of kind of centralizing agents in Detroit? Obviously on the mortgage side of the business, you've run that playbook very successfully. So when I think about kind of the real estate agent industry, obviously typically very distributed, very face-to-face interactions. So maybe just talk us through how you envision that happening from Detroit, but kind of operating across the country and curious here, how you kind of think through that in the context of how that, how that industry has typically been operated? Thank you very much.\nJay Farner: Yes, I think the best word is bespoke and that's what we've been using as we've watched in particular the last two years. And as you know with Rocket Mortgage in particular, first time homebuyers are a pretty large portion of that purchase market for us. That message has come through over-and-over again that I want it to be a streamlined process, I want it to be a digital process and I want to be in control of the process. And so, as we think about that with Rocket Homes or Rocket Homes experience, it's exactly what we've built. And that means you have to have different ways for people to sell or buy homes. And we don't think that, that -- what I think that does is grow the pie. Because there are people today that are not selling their homes because they say well, I don't want to follow the traditional process. In other cases, we've got people who started through the process by owner process and run into a roadblock and would stop, but instead because of our ecosystem, we now refer them to an agent in their local network who can assist them. So all of these things work together to open up, and what I want to tell you is open up inventory and you've heard Julie talk about this. We've got thousands and thousands of people who are verified, approved, ready to buy and the reason they're not buying is because they can't find a home. So how do we open up inventory for those clients? So the one way to do that is a centralized model. Some of our clients may not be ready do ForSaleByOwner, but they may not need be full services that are local in their neighbourhood agent can provide. And so our centralized model allows for a licensed agent here in Michigan or in one of our other web centers across the country to assist that client, to help them determine how to get their home listed and getting on the MLS, but they don't necessarily need someone there to assist at all via the complexities. Oh, by the way, if they go down that path in a few weeks later, they determine that they still need more help, we'll simply refer them to an agent in their local network. And so we've got all of these different opportunities to really ensure that any client that we talk to can be serviced in the way that they want to be serviced. And to your point about the way that we centralized with mortgage, we see the same opportunity here, but you'll notice, as we talked about before, we've got our direct-to-consumer mortgage, we've got our partners, we've got our TPO broker partners. So what we've learned is as we grow and you understand the full market, different people require different things and as opposed to being a portion of the market, our goal is to have a solution for anyone in mortgage, in real estate and beyond. And so that's exactly what you'll see us do there as we keep building out the Rocket Homes ecosystem.\nRyan McKeveny: That's great, thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kevin Barker from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nKevin Barker: Thanks for taking my questions. You mentioned a new broker pricing platform that was introduced and it's been unveiled. Could you talk about how that has an impact at your volumes, particularly in the second quarter and as we flow into the third quarter? And then how we think about retail origination, I mean, direct-to-consumer originations in the third quarter? I believe your previous comments indicated that it seems like you're definitely taking significant market share just given most industry forecasts and have a meaningful decline going into the third quarter? Thank you.\nJay Farner: Well, I think you're referencing the brand-new Pricing Calculator that we have built for our broker partners, and it's one of quite a few things that we've been rolling out this year to ensure that our mortgage broker partners really have the best technology and the best experience. We've got, I think somewhere over 20,000 mortgage professionals a month using those broker tools, whether it's the Calculator that allows them to go side-by-side do comparisons to determine the best program for their clients, our Pathfinder tool, which really gives them the answers to underwriting product question, so they can take a very effective application upfront. Those things are drawing brokers in. I think we've seen somewhere here recently over 100 new brokers that have joined our platform here in the last 90 days or so. So that demonstrates that we're drawing brokers to the Rocket Pro platform and I touched on this before, but from April to June in the second quarter, our market share as a total of the broker market, we were just below 18%, and now when we get to the end of June we are 21%. So we're seeing growth in that particular area, I think faster than anyone else and that's because of the technology, the tools that we're providing, the brand that we're providing to our broker partners. It's - I guess the last thing I'll say there and move the things for a while, but you've heard me talk about a bespoke process for homes, giving our consumers choice, it's the same as that thing we'll be giving our Broker-Partners is choice, right. We're not demanding that they use just us or one system, we're saying, hey, use the best partner out there and we believe will continue to invest in technology and other things to give them that choice and draw them in and so far the market share numbers are proving that to be the right decision.\nKevin Barker: So is that -- and then also is there something in particular that is driving retail margin -- retail originations to be particularly strong going into the third quarter, given the market is showing some decline overall?\nJay Farner: I would say it's -- that's us. That's the history that we've demonstrated, the marketing machine that we have, the data science that we have, the brand that we've invested in, the ability to reach into non-interest rate sensitive products as we probably touched on before. This is how we think about executing on our business, as others sometimes decide to pull away or reduce investment as we touched on our expenses there -- that we're giving guidance so that they remain similar to where they were in Q1 or Q2 because we're not pulling away and now you're seeing our marketing machine continue to do what it does and so that's -- I think that, as a result of that is -- is our guidance that we provided for Q3.\nKevin Barker: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jay Farner for any closing remarks.\nJay Farner: I just appreciate everyone joining the call today. As always, we appreciate the support that we're receiving from the investor community and we really look forward to talking to all of you again when we get to the end of Q3. Have a great night.\nOperator: This conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Julie Booth",
            "content": "Thank you, Jay and good afternoon everyone. I'm pleased to report another quarter of strong financial results for Rocket Company. This continued success demonstrates our ability to leverage our flexible platform. I will be sharing some detail around the investments we're making to drive growth and provide insights into trends we are seeing for I will reference some longer term comparisons particularly comparing our 2021 performance on a two-year basis relative to 2019 levels. 2020 was an unusual year for the economy with a combination of historically low interest rate and constrained mortgage industry capacity. Under these market conditions, Rocket exhibited the scalability of our platform with our loan origination volumes growing 121% in 2020 year-over-year while our expenses grew only 47%. Given the unusual year 2020 represented, it is important to look at our growth and profitability relative pre-COVID results. We were successful in gaining market share in last year's environment and we continue to grow our business as we head into 2021. During the second quarter of 2021 Rocket Companies generated $2.8 billion of adjusted revenue which represents a 110% increase from 2Q 2019 and $1.3 billion of adjusted EBITDA, up more than [indiscernible] 2Q 2019 representing a 46% adjusted EBITDA margin. We generated net income of $1 billion which exceeded full year 2019 net income and we generated adjusted net income of $920 million in Q2 2021, which was more than triple Q2 of 2019 levels, representing a 33% adjusted net income margin. Our adjusted earnings per share was $0.46 for the quarter. Rocket Mortgage generated [indiscernible] volume during the quarter, up more than 160% from $32 million in Q2 2019 and in line with the midpoint of our Q2 guidance due to products which include home purchases, term reductions, and cash out refinances represented more than half our closed loan volume in the second quarter. Turning to home purchase in particular, purchase volume nearly doubled year-over-year and we set a new company record in the second quarter. We estimate that the largest retail purchase lender did $60 billion of purchase origination volume in 2020 excluding correspondent volume. With the success we have had during the first half of 2021, and the momentum we have going into the third quarter, we expect that our full year 2021 purchase volume will exceed $60 billion dollars. This growth, in combination with the recently announced Rocket Homes initiatives, are bringing us closer to our goal of becoming the number one retail purchase lender by 2023. For the quarter, our rate lock down sale margin was 278 basis points which is in line with our expectations at the midpoint of our guidance and substantially higher than most multichannel mortgage originators. Our strong results extend across the Rocket Companies platforms. Despite a relatively low level of auto inventory impacting the industry, Rocket Auto continued to accelerate its growth generating $484 million of gross merchandise value during the second quarter, up nearly 35% as compared to Q1 2021. Through the first half of 2021 we have generated $844 million of GMV and are on track to more than double 2020 levels. With on boarding of new inventory partnerships, including just recently, one of the largest online sellers of used cars, we expect to further accelerate growth in the second half of 2021. Rocket Homes faced similar inventory constraint, however was successful in generating record real estate transaction value of $2 billion, which represents the value of homes purchased and sold through our real estate agent network during the second quarter. We also saw record traffic to rockethomes.com during the second quarter or nearly 2 million monthly unique visitors expanding an important top of the marketing funnel. Rocket Companies plan here [ph] is based on leveraging our profitability advantages to constantly reinvest in our business, further strengthen our competitive position, expanding to new areas of growth and extend client lifetime value. With the opportunities we see ahead, and to fully realize the potential of our platform and unique real estate ecosystem, we will continue to invest for the long term, particularly in technology, marketing and our most valuable resource, our team members. We plan to grow our technology, product strategy, and data intelligence teams. Within Rocket, we have more than 3000 team members dedicated to building proprietary technology. Key priorities for investment are continuing to deliver great client experiences, driving operational efficiency and extending our platform to partners. Increasing the lifetime value of our clients is another core component of our growth strategy. Our business is profitable on the first transaction with the client, we then maintain ongoing loan servicing relationships with 2.4 million clients representing over $500 billion in outstanding loan principal. Mortgage servicing drives a recurring cash revenue stream for Rocket Companies that now exceeds $1 billion on an annual basis, reserved ph unpaid principal balance of 34% in the last 12 months and net retention north of 90%. Based on our strong relationships with clients, we continue to expand our platform to address more of the important transactions in their lives. Whether that's real estate, auto, personal loan or new products, like Residential Solar, incremental products on our platform position us to increase the lifetime value of our client relationships. Looking ahead to Q3 we are seeing strong fundamental tailwinds for our business. The housing market remains active. Homeowners are sitting on the highest levels of home equity in more than a decade and the investments we have been making are gaining traction across the platform. Our price point for both purchase and refinance remains robust. As Jay mentioned, we expect to set a new company record with full year 2021 closed loan origination volume on pace to exceed the previous record achieved in 2020. While the Mortgage Bankers Association and other public industry forecasts predicted overall mortgage borrowings will decrease as compared to last year, we expect to drive growth and market share gains in 2021. For the third quarter, we currently expect closed loan volumes in the range of $82 billion to $87 billion and rate loss volume between $83 billion and $90 billion. We expect third quarter gain on sale margins should be in the range of 270 to 300 basis points. Regarding our expenses, at this time we believe the run rate of operating expenses for the first and second quarters of 2021 is a good reference for the third quarter with expenses roughly flat even as we are growing mortgage origination. We exited the second quarter with $2 billion of cash on the balance sheet and an additional $2.4 billion of corporate cash used to self-fund loan originations for total available cash of $4.4 billion. Total liquidity stood at $7.8 billion as of June 30, including available cash plus undrawn lines of credit and undrawn MSR lines. Our business is capital light and our balance sheet is extremely strong. This year we expect to generate more than $320 billion in closed loan volume exceeding last year's record. Keep in mind even at these origination levels we need less than $1 billion of cash on hand to properly operate our business. With $7.8 billion in available liquidity, a $4.4 billion in total cash is largely held for investments, dividends and share buybacks. As we've said before, our capital priorities always start with proper capitalization and reinvesting in the business. We continue to look for acquisitions that would be additive to our platform by bringing new clients into our ecosystem, enhancing operational efficiencies or enhancing our product offerings. Beyond that we look to return capital to shareholders. At current price levels we believe our stock is undervalued. Over the past 24 months we have generated $16.3 billion in adjusted EBITDA, our MSR portfolio has a fair value of $4.6 billion and our balance sheet has total equity of $8.2 billion. With our current levels of capital, we have the opportunity to repurchase shares and return capital to shareholders via dividends as we've done in the past, while still being able to invest in the business and consider acquisition opportunities. We will deploy our capital in a strategic and disciplined manner to generate long-term shareholder value. With that, we are ready to turn it back to the operator for questions. Yes. Our gain on sale margin in Q2 came in at 278 kind of right in the middle of our guidance range there. And as you said, our expectations for Q3 are between 270 and 300 basis points, so a consistent and slightly improved over the last quarter. And we do expect both channels to be above where they were in the second quarter from a gain on sale margin perspective. The mix that we expect to see in Q3 is similar to what we saw in Q2 as well. So it is in both channels that we're seeing that. On the retail side of things, the direct-to-consumer, we also feel very good about our gain on sale margins in that channel and seeing those strong, as I mentioned, so feeling really good about where we are in both channels. Yes, an example probably helpful here in thinking about ecosystem and kind of how it all comes together. If you think about a client who is purchasing a new home say for $300,000 within our ecosystem, if you look at a gain on sale margin in our direct-to-consumer channel, let's say it's a 450 basis points gain on sale margin, we would generate $13,000 -- $15,500 of revenue for this purchase. And then if that client is using an agent in our Rocket Homes real estate network, we would generate an additional $3,000 in revenue, assuming a 1% commission fee and then in addition to that, if you add earmark appraisal closing and title services, and they provide us another opportunity there to earn an additional $1,500. So as you look at this in total and think about all of the opportunities we have, that transaction would generate $18,000. And it really doesn't stop there too. If you think about the other things in our business, we've got Rocket Auto, Solar is coming, we've got personal loans, which are all really natural extensions of that home buying experience and these businesses do have a high correlation to the real estate opportunities getting the reach to the client, the right time to serve their needs, throughout their entire home ownership journey. So these newer business areas that we're adding really help us leverage our platform strength, especially from a marketing, a technology and in clients services. Yes, I think you hit it really well, Jay. I think on gain on sale margins, like I said, we are seeing the strength in those channels and we are now excited about where we're at and Jay, I think you covered it well. Yes, I certainly will. You walked and hear about with lots of capital, yes you move up a little bit of a context around that and as you know we do operate in a capital-light business and our business model is highly cash generative. So we have consistently demonstrated a strong track record of profitability that has allowed us to maintain a very strong balance sheet. So this has given us a great flexibility to actually continue to be very opportunistic. So that's been a great outcome of our profitable business. And just to kind of reiterate how we think about capital, our framework is really very consistent with how we've been talking about it. First and foremost, we're going to look to reinvest in our business through brands, technology and investing in our team members. Then we're going to look at M&A opportunities and if that is something beyond that, we still have additional capital, we look to return that capital to shareholders through either share repurchases or through dividends and currently, we believe, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks that our stock is currently undervalued and given that when we looked at our business and the capital it takes to operate our business, the cash that it takes to operate our business that's been a $1 billion just needed to operate our business. So mining it as of June 30 as I said, we have about $4.4 billion dollars of available cash. So all in with $7.8 billion of total liquidity as we said, this puts us in a great position where we could potentially use both in terms of capital to shareholders either through repurchases or through a dividend as we've done in the past. Yes, we have executed against that during the second quarter and you will see that in the 10-Q that's coming up tomorrow."

            "name": "Jay Farner",
            "content": "All right. Well, good afternoon, and welcome to the Rocket Companies earnings call for the second quarter of 2021. We had a strong second quarter as we continue to execute on our growth strategy and leverage our platform across real estate, auto and financial services. In real estate, revenue was driven in part by record purchase volume, putting us on track to reach our goal of becoming the largest retail home purchase lender in the nation by the end of 2023. Many of the accomplishments that we've achieved are results of our technology and of course our people, who bring their best to work each and every day. This tremendous combination was recently rewarded with Rocket Mortgage again being named the #1 company for client service and mortgage servicing by J.D. Power. The accolade marks the eighth consecutive time our company has earned this honor and it's our 19th J.D. Power award overall, when you include the 11 straight #1 rankings we've received for mortgage origination. Our servicing team put our clients first, helping them through the difficult and uncertain times during the pandemic. While clients at other lenders experienced several hour wait times at the onset of the pandemic, Rocket Mortgage clients were able to navigate a digital solution, complete with educational resources and easily apply for forbearance plans online. This approach resulted in Rocket's forbearance rate being 41% lower in the industry. Innovative technology-driven, client-first solutions such as these are a testament of our ability to scale and to quickly pivot to meet the demands of unpredictable markets without the need to add headcount and ultimately deliver unmatched client experiences. As we turn back to the second quarter results, 2020 accelerated the shift to an all digital experience, an opportunity that Rocket has planned to capture. The demand for digital experiences has only expanded providing true momentum for Rocket Companies across all our core markets: real estate, auto, and financial services. Consider this. When we look back at 2019, we have now more than doubled the size of our business from pre-COVID levels. Rocket Companies generated $84 billion in closed loan volume and $2.8 billion of revenue in the second quarter of 2021. Loans more than doubled the second quarter of 2019 and more volume than we did the entire year of 2018. Our Q2 EBITDA of $1.3 billion was more than triple the same period two years ago, demonstrating the sheer power and scalability of the Rocket platform. On today's call, I'll highlight the flexibility of the Rocket platform to capture the growth ahead, including our strategy to revolutionize the homebuying experience, also touch on our increasingly important relationship with B2B partners across the Rocket ecosystem. As we've shared with you in past calls, the Rocket platform is built to win. Our initiatives provide certainty in life's most complex moments. We removed the friction and pain points for major events, like buying a home, getting a personal loan, or purchasing a car, all from a scalable centralized platform. This flexibility allows us to stay nimble and go after the areas of greatest opportunity, optimizing revenue for our companies and driving value for our investors. In today's environment, consumer demand is incredibly strong in each of our markets. In fact, the markets are so hot that there are significant inventory challenges in both real estate and automotive sectors. Even under these conditions, we achieved records for home purchase volume as well as Rocket auto gross merchandise value and unit sales. Based on the strength of demand at the top of our funnel, we believe both record purchase volume and record auto results would have been even higher if not for inventory challenges. As today's mortgage market shifts for home purchase in 2021, Rocket is geared to capture more purchase volume driven by our superior technology-driven client experience, product innovation and our integrated end-to-end homebuying ecosystem. We mentioned last quarter that our company has set a goal to become the largest retail home purchase lender in the country by 2023. Continuing to transform the homebuying experience is the single biggest opportunity for Rocket Companies today. We spent years creating a complete end-to-end experience that puts the power of choice back into the hands of the consumer. From credit monitoring to home search, connections with better local agents, centralized services or comprehensive ForSaleByOwner process and our recently announced iBuying services to provide a back-up offer to sellers. We have the suite of services that allow consumers to create a bespoke process tailored to their individual needs while driving extremely strong conversion rates. When paired with the power of America's largest mortgage lender and Rocket Mortgage and one of the largest title providers and Amrock, no other company can provide the same level integrated one-stop services that Rocket delivers. Our iBuying program facilitated through third-party partner companies will be released over the next several quarters. Just last month, Rocket Homes announced an important milestone posting home listings in all 50 states. Rocket Companies is now the only residential real estate ecosystem that has mortgage licenses, real estate broker licenses, home search listings, real estate agents and real estate agent partners spanning all 50 states. With nationwide coverage, Rocket Homes is performing at scale with traffic growing six-fold year-over-year to reach nearly 2 million unique monthly visitors in the second quarter. In addition, Rocket Homes drove a record $2 billion in second quarter real estate transaction value, representing the value of homes purchased and sold through our real estate agent network. Rocket Homes is still in the early innings in a very long runway for growth. Rocket Homes also drives purchase volume for Rocket Mortgage and we expect a momentum in purchase to continue. Rocket Homes draws in-process clients into the rocket ecosystem even earlier in the funnel and then regularly engages with our pool of nearly 2.4 million servicing clients, representing $0.5 trillion in servicing value. This significantly increases our lifetime value in recurring revenue with potential and existing clients. From the beginning of year, roughly 70% of Rocket Homes' transactions involve both an agent in the Rocket Homes real estate agent network and in Rocket Mortgage, representing an attach rate among the highest in the industry. We also have a high attach rate between Rocket Mortgage and Amrock. In fact, Amrock serves as the appraisal management company for approximately 65% of appraisals order for our direct consumer mortgages, illustrating the power of our ecosystem. We are also extending our value proposition of creating simple, seamless experiences to now include residential solar. Solar energy adoption is at a growth inflection point. According to third-party research, the current solar energy market is expected to quadruple by 2030, with roughly one in eight homes adopting solar power. Our dedicated highly trained group of team members from the Rocket Cloud Force will serve as Rocket's solar advisers to our clients. The team will help clients to determine if solar panels are the best choice for their home and connect homeowners to our simple, digital financing application. Once financing is complete, the Rocket Cloud Force will facilitate the installation of a new solar solution. We will also be well positioned to help consumers who may not have started with Rocket Solar consolidate their solar loan and mortgage for significant cost savings. We launched Rocket Solar with a regulatory [ph] finance product in late July and expect to be operating at scale in 2022. Our entry in solar is yet another example of Rocket Companies maximizing the lifetime value of our clients by adding complementary services that we are uniquely positioned to deliver, thanks to the versatility and scalability of the Rocket platform. Looking at Rocket Auto the company drove record performance in the second quarter with both auto unit sales growth of 140% and gross merchandise value more than tripling year-over-year. And considering the auto inventory shortages facing the industry, we are particularly proud of these results. Rocket auto continues to add new partners who are interested in connecting their inventory with our new perspective buyers. During the quarter, one of the largest online sellers of used cars joined Rocket Auto's partnership network, giving Rocket Auto access to tens of thousands of additional used cars to sell through its constantly expanding platform and providing significant more fuel to Rocket Auto's growth story. Technology and data are the cornerstones of our platform. From the use of data science to optimize every aspect of our client marketing funnel, the use of ethical AI, to aid in client service, to sophisticated pricing models, just to name a few. Technology and data fundamentally drive our business, financing client experience through speed and personalization, increasing efficiency through streamline workflows and decisioning and improving our pull-through and lead conversion. During 2021 intelligent client targeting models were deployed to more than 80% of our client contact, ensuring that our Rocket Cloud Force is reaching out to clients at the exact moment they are most ready to engage with us. By tailoring the experience to client we have lifted conversion resulting in approximately $4 billion in incremental application volumes so far this year. The beauty of our platform is its flexibility to meet clients where they are and scale across multiple products and verticals regardless of the market environment. Our company started as the direct consumer mortgage lender, Rocket Companies is increasingly being multi-product, multichannel platform. In addition to consumers, the Rocket platform works closely with three important B2B constituents; real estate agents, mortgage brokers, and premier enterprise partners. Each of these audiences play a crucial role as trusted advisors, leveraging the patent products and tools that Rocket has developed to help deliver additional value to empower our clients and to reach their goals. Real estate agents, they play a critical role in the homebuying process and we are empowering agents in our network with new leads, products and tools to win in today's competitive environment, through innovative tools like our verified approval process which fully underwrites buyers and allows them to make offers that compete with cash buyers through our overnight underwrite, which ensures purchase loans are underwritten in mere hours, we arm real estate professionals and their clients with the tools to ensure that they win. Another Rocket Mortgage innovation that's proven popular with realtors is Rocket Pro Insight, which we unveiled last year to help real estate agents create [indiscernible] letters through our office, track the status of their client's mortgage and receive real time updates. The number of real estate agents leveraging Rocket Pro Insight more than tripled to 15,000 up from just 14,000 two quarters ago. For the thousands of mortgage brokers in our Rocket Pro TPO network we arm them with the industry knowledge and tools to work smarter and grow their business. In the second quarter we began our revamp of our builder partner portal starting with our newly enhanced pricing calculator, providing greater ease of use for our partners to run different scenarios for their clients. From the past month more than 20,000 unique mortgage professionals relied on our interactive broker tools to move mortgage applications to the finish line and their clients to closing too. Our Pathfinder tool that we created in partnership with Google, provides simple answers to even the most complicated mortgage qualification and underwriting questions and has become one of the top resources for mortgage brokers. We continue to add new premier enterprise partners to our network and we deepened our integration with our existing partners. We recently launched our new integration with Credit Karma allowing more than 110 million users to apply for a Rocket mortgage directly inside their app. We also continued to grow and expand our relationship with partners including Mint, Charles Schwab and realtor.com, just to name a few. We are excited to serve a broader range of clients through deep integrations with our partners and deliver the trusted high-quality experiences their customers expect. It is also my pleasure to announce a new relationship with MassMutual. This new relationship will allow the company's 9000 plus agents to originate home loans through Rocket Mortgage. Turning to our community, from the beginning we have operated with a more than profit philosophy, along with Rocket Community Fund, our philanthropic partner company, we have executed numerous data-driven investments and initiatives to serve and support Detroiters and revitalize Detroit, our hometown and where we are the largest employer. At the end of June we sponsored a flagship event the Rocket Mortgage Classic, PGA tournament event held in Detroit. Rocket Mortgage Classic showcases the best talent in golf while raising funds to help bridge the digital divide and bring broadband connectivity to all Detroiters. As we continue to grow Detroit, it's critical that Detroiters have an equitable opportunity to grow with us. In closing, we are entering the third quarter with tremendous momentum across our entire platform and we are poised to have a record year across our platform from Rocket Mortgage to Amrock, Rocket Homes and Rocket Auto. I'd like to think about this. Over the past several years Rocket Mortgage has grown volume and taken market share consistently. In 2018 we originated $83 billion in mortgage volume. In 2019 that grew to $145 billion and we ended 2020 with $320 billion in mortgage volume. While industry forecasters expect a smaller market in 2021, we expect to grow volume from our 2020 record levels. We are going to gain market share and achieve record origination volume this year. In addition, we expect our servicing book to grow more than 30% this year to over $600 billion, driving recurring cash revenue stream of more than $1 billion. Rocket portfolio companies reinforce our ecosystem and contribute to our best in business retention rate, expanding client lifetime value. This year we are building on momentum from 2020 and we are proud of what our team has accomplished and I'm even more excited about what's ahead. With that, I will turn things over to Julie to go deeper into the numbers. Julie? Hello. Yes. As we talked about, we think purchase represents probably the biggest opportunity here at Rocket Companies. Although our purchase volume this year will exceed what was the record purchase volume, I think last year, in retail, excluding corresponded, there is still huge upside for us there. We just recently issued a press release describing our Rocket Homes platform and all that we're building there. And really, we are the only organization that has put together every component required to streamline the purchase experience for anyone in America starting with credit, reports and credit education, moving to a really robust home search website in all 50 states. Our traffic is primarily organic there, so very high-quality traffic, which of course helps with conversion. We've launched our centralized real estate services, which make a more cost-effective transaction for people selling their property. Our FSBO, ForSaleByOwner website is growing rapidly to bring in folks into this marketplace. There are many Americans who can sell their homes ForSaleByOwner. We've got a very robust real estate network in all 50 states for clients who require that level of support from real estate agents. And, of course, tying that all into Rocket Mortgage with our verified approvals are overnight underwrite that empowers real estate agents to know that their client is ready to buy the property. And then our Agent Insight, the portal that we now have, I think, north of 50,000 agents using good visibility to update offer letters - approval letters, I should say. All of those components on the retail side will allow us to bring traffic in and convert traffic at levels, that I think the industry has not seen. We talked about - I talked about our attach rate of 70%, of course, our title company, Amrock, and our appraisal services company participate that - in that as well. And then, we've got our TPO program, which is growing. Our market share growth, I think we've seen 18% growth in the last 12 months in TPO, the highest in the industry of any TPO player. As that shifts to purchase, those brokers, who are aligned with us, will also shift to purchase, deleveraging the portal that we're investing heavily in, the new Pricing Calculators that we've built, the Pathfinder tool that we built in partnership with Google to give them the answers that they need on the spot. So it's really all of these tech and marketing investments that we can create a competitive advantage and really our unique value proposition to the consumer that others are not able to provide. And I'll just have you keep in mind, all of that's been really done internally thus far. As we've touched on in our press release, as we get into the later part of 2021 and into 2022, we will have many of those programs at scale, the iBuyer program at scale and then you'll -- we'll be able to be more visible with those programs to grow them substantially. So that's why we're so excited about our opportunity to continue to grow purchase. Yes, it's a great question. I think it's an important and a strategic shift in thinking about the purchase lead marketplace. As you mentioned, there's not a shortage at Rocket or in the industry when it comes to purchase leads. The real question is, how do you incubate those leads over a longer time period and to the conversion levels that you need. And to make them work, you've got to have conversion level not just with mortgage, but the combination of mortgage, real estate, title, appraisal and of course, think about the lifetime value. So our viewpoint is different than others, because as we think about a purchase transaction, we also know our 90% retention rate and think about the subsequent refinance transaction. And so -- I think, that's again one of those things, we can't - we don't think about it as a standalone business, we think about it as part of the ecosystem that we've built and that allows us to not only lean in where others cannot, but also get higher conversion rates when others aren't receiving them. The Rocket Pro Insight portal having that information with our real estate partners, so they can see what's going on, there are more confident with us and the conversion rate goes up. The Rocket agents across the country are familiar with Rocket Mortgage, know how to work with us. And so that means information is flowing and the conversion rate goes up, and so all of those things give us a unique advantage. And maybe I'll turn it over to Julie, because maybe to put a little bit more color around how we think about our unit here and the economics around that unit, when we're making decisions to invest in technology or invest in marketing to drive those purchase units. Julie, so do you want to kind of go through that a bit? So, it's putting all these things together, not only does it increase the conversion, which makes our marketing dollar more valuable to us than I think others, but it's also the viewpoint of the lifetime value of that client. And I know something we touched on that I think will be beneficial as we move into the 2022 and beyond is the iBuyer program, we're viewing it again a little differently. We've got 2.4 million folks in our servicing book and we're talking to clients every day, who want to buy a property and are thinking about, can they sell theirs. And so by having that back up offer through iBuyer, we're empowering our client base to move forward with the purchase of a new properties. So it's another exciting component of the ecosystem that we're adding that we will see I think add value and help improve its transactions as we get into 2022. Yes good question and there are quite a few different facets to this program. So taking a step back, I think we've more than 2 million solar installations in the U.S. in 2020. They're saying that that will quadruple by 2030. So that means, one in eight Americans will be adopting residential solar power. So remember, we're really in the saving money - helping people save money business as much as we're in the helping people buy homes business. And so, we're talking to clients each and every day, about how they can save money. In many cases that's refinancing the mortgage, but there are other opportunities and we already engaged in those discussions. And of course our discussion is about the bills people pay including their utility bills. And so it's a really natural pivot to have the discussion around what solar might do and so we'll be doing a few different things as we grow this out. Our Rocket Cloud Force will really service solar advisors to our clients. So they'll be using technology to help determine if someone is eligible solar, how it would work and roughly how much money they can save. Then we'll partner with folks who do the actual panel installation and then our Rocket Homes - Rocket Loans technology will be used to - to do the financing. So it's really two options for our clients, one is doing the financing using their mortgage, which we have programs for and the other is doing the financing that we will be providing through our Rocket Loans solution and so that's kind of the second component. And the third, of course, is that to really capture the full value, clients who have already done solar may need to consolidate their solar loan into their mortgage. We've already started that program and of course we will make that program more robust as we continue to move forward. So clients will be refinancing their solar loan, if it's appropriate back into their mortgage as well. So we can help and all three of those areas and we're uniquely positioned because we're already talking to them about their bills, we're already talking to them about their property, we're already in many cases have an appraisal, we understand the size of the property, the roof in many cases. So a lot of this data that others in this industry require or need to really bring value to the client, we already possess. And so, the market is going to grow rapidly and we'll be taking our brand and our Cloud Force and our technology to make sure that we can be a market leader. I know, Julie touched on where our expenses were in Q1 and Q2 and kind of using that as a reference point for Q3 and beyond, and that's because, although we're growing market share and volume and doing more purchase transactions, our efficiencies in our platform continue to be evident and so we're able to see that growth without having increase in expenses. We also know that continuing to have a platform that's scalable is very important to us. As Julie's always touched on, we're profitable in the first transaction. And so as we see competitors maybe think about reducing the size of their operation, this creates opportunity for us to grow our market share, which is what we believe we will see and what we said here in 2021. We think about this - the play I'll guess I'll use that, we've been running for 36 years and in particular over the last three or four years, is that we set our strategy for growth over the course of many years. A three-year plan is what we really operate off of and we stick to that strategy. And there'll be changes in interest rate of course throughout that period of time, but I think Q2 serves as a good solid proof point that we're able to achieve records. We had - we doubled our purchase size in Q2 of '21 over where we've been in 2020, regardless of interest rate movement, I think Julie's guidance towards where we'll be from a midpoint in rate lock volume also demonstrates our ability to stick to our plan regardless of whether markets are going up or going down. And then the third that I'll say and we touched on this as well, our ability not only through our multiple channels, but our multiple marketing vehicles that we use, really allows us to capture different types of mortgage volumes. Julie touched on the fact that over 50% of the volume that we did during Q2 was not rate sensitive. So, cash out, term adjustment, purchase, as we continue to lean into those things in Q3 and beyond to ensure that we stick to our three-year plan of growth. Julie, I don't know if you want to touch on any other portions of that question? Okay, great. Yes. So I normally don't break down the specifics between TPO and direct-to-consumer, but remember the things that we can really control from a mix perspective are more on the direct-to-consumer side. The broker will originate the loan that the broker is able to originate and we're happy to assist in any way we can. So you can kind of look at, I think probably industry mix to get a feeling of what that looks like. For us, our ability to market directly to the real estate network, the 50,000 plus that I referenced, our ability to reference directly to the consumer about the value that we can bring in purchase with Rocket Homes, with the ecosystem, that's really our lever to pull, to continue to influence our growth there. And so, although I believe purchase - the growth of purchase we'll see across all channels, we have a larger opportunity when we think about our direct-to-consumer and partner networks to achieve the purchase growth that we're looking for and that's what we've seen before. And as you asked the second question about the attach rate, although we're just now starting to really leverage the ecosystem with our broker partners in particular our Pinnacle partners, we started or have been in the past, more focused on how Rocket Homes ecosystem works with our direct-to-consumer channel. I'll let Julie reiterate some of the things we said about our capital allocation strategy. I'll tell you one of the benefits - I've been in the company 26 years, we've been in business for 36 years, maybe 26, maybe 25 and a significant portion of our time is spent on team member and leadership development. And so as our organization continues to grow, we have thousands of leaders in our organization. And one of the questions you have to ask yourself is, how do you retain the top talent that you develop over time, as they search for new opportunities to grow? And so we're really fortunate to be able to leverage our brand, our client base and provide other services that are tied directly into the mortgage that we started with. I'll give you an example, add to specific percentage, but the vast a significant portion of auto buying occurs within the first six months of the purchase or refinance of the home. So we have that data, we're talking to that client, we're servicing that client, we're skilled -- our Rocket Cloud Force is skilled at selling and now we've built the technology to tie those clients to inventory across the country. We just announced that we aligned with some of the largest used car operations in the country. So we're really able to develop a whole new business channel, leveraging all of the things we already possess. So it's not -- I don't view it as like an ancillary or side business because it's so tied into the core of what we do and it allows us to keep our talent. Solar is the same exact thing, which we touched on this, but it's about saving money with your home. It's exactly what we do for millions of people, have done for millions and millions of people and we're doing that at no additional cost to acquire and I am able to take a leader who has been with me for 25 years, who may without a new opportunity, say hey, Jay, now I'm thinking about looking somewhere else for the second part of my career, but instead I am looking to stay here, grow out that channel with all the best practices that that he or she has learned over the 25 years that they've been here and at an incredibly profitable product to our mix. Same with homes, we've already spent half hour talking about homes and its natural synergies with mortgage. So, no, I'm not concerned about being spread too thin because these things are value add to our consumer, highly profitable and leverage the talent that we've got inside the organization. Now Julie, I'll maybe let you talk a bit about the capital portion, but I think some of the question was there, are you dedicating enough capital in all, do we have enough capital for all these things? We're working through our model, but we're in a unique position to not have to choose one of the options, but have the ability to do all of the things that we would like to do. Yes, I think the best word is bespoke and that's what we've been using as we've watched in particular the last two years. And as you know with Rocket Mortgage in particular, first time homebuyers are a pretty large portion of that purchase market for us. That message has come through over-and-over again that I want it to be a streamlined process, I want it to be a digital process and I want to be in control of the process. And so, as we think about that with Rocket Homes or Rocket Homes experience, it's exactly what we've built. And that means you have to have different ways for people to sell or buy homes. And we don't think that, that -- what I think that does is grow the pie. Because there are people today that are not selling their homes because they say well, I don't want to follow the traditional process. In other cases, we've got people who started through the process by owner process and run into a roadblock and would stop, but instead because of our ecosystem, we now refer them to an agent in their local network who can assist them. So all of these things work together to open up, and what I want to tell you is open up inventory and you've heard Julie talk about this. We've got thousands and thousands of people who are verified, approved, ready to buy and the reason they're not buying is because they can't find a home. So how do we open up inventory for those clients? So the one way to do that is a centralized model. Some of our clients may not be ready do ForSaleByOwner, but they may not need be full services that are local in their neighbourhood agent can provide. And so our centralized model allows for a licensed agent here in Michigan or in one of our other web centers across the country to assist that client, to help them determine how to get their home listed and getting on the MLS, but they don't necessarily need someone there to assist at all via the complexities. Oh, by the way, if they go down that path in a few weeks later, they determine that they still need more help, we'll simply refer them to an agent in their local network. And so we've got all of these different opportunities to really ensure that any client that we talk to can be serviced in the way that they want to be serviced. And to your point about the way that we centralized with mortgage, we see the same opportunity here, but you'll notice, as we talked about before, we've got our direct-to-consumer mortgage, we've got our partners, we've got our TPO broker partners. So what we've learned is as we grow and you understand the full market, different people require different things and as opposed to being a portion of the market, our goal is to have a solution for anyone in mortgage, in real estate and beyond. And so that's exactly what you'll see us do there as we keep building out the Rocket Homes ecosystem. Well, I think you're referencing the brand-new Pricing Calculator that we have built for our broker partners, and it's one of quite a few things that we've been rolling out this year to ensure that our mortgage broker partners really have the best technology and the best experience. We've got, I think somewhere over 20,000 mortgage professionals a month using those broker tools, whether it's the Calculator that allows them to go side-by-side do comparisons to determine the best program for their clients, our Pathfinder tool, which really gives them the answers to underwriting product question, so they can take a very effective application upfront. Those things are drawing brokers in. I think we've seen somewhere here recently over 100 new brokers that have joined our platform here in the last 90 days or so. So that demonstrates that we're drawing brokers to the Rocket Pro platform and I touched on this before, but from April to June in the second quarter, our market share as a total of the broker market, we were just below 18%, and now when we get to the end of June we are 21%. So we're seeing growth in that particular area, I think faster than anyone else and that's because of the technology, the tools that we're providing, the brand that we're providing to our broker partners. It's - I guess the last thing I'll say there and move the things for a while, but you've heard me talk about a bespoke process for homes, giving our consumers choice, it's the same as that thing we'll be giving our Broker-Partners is choice, right. We're not demanding that they use just us or one system, we're saying, hey, use the best partner out there and we believe will continue to invest in technology and other things to give them that choice and draw them in and so far the market share numbers are proving that to be the right decision. I would say it's -- that's us. That's the history that we've demonstrated, the marketing machine that we have, the data science that we have, the brand that we've invested in, the ability to reach into non-interest rate sensitive products as we probably touched on before. This is how we think about executing on our business, as others sometimes decide to pull away or reduce investment as we touched on our expenses there -- that we're giving guidance so that they remain similar to where they were in Q1 or Q2 because we're not pulling away and now you're seeing our marketing machine continue to do what it does and so that's -- I think that, as a result of that is -- is our guidance that we provided for Q3. I just appreciate everyone joining the call today. As always, we appreciate the support that we're receiving from the investor community and we really look forward to talking to all of you again when we get to the end of Q3. Have a great night."

At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions].  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Sharon Ng. Please go ahead.\nSharon Ng: Good afternoon, everyone and thank you, for joining us for Rocket Companies earnings call covering the first quarter of 2021. I'm Sharon Ng, the new Vice President of Investor Relations here at Rocket Companies. With us this afternoon are our CEO, Jay Farner; CFO, Julie Booth; and President and COO, Bob Walters. Before I turn things over to Jay, let me quickly go over our disclaimers. On today's call, we will provide you with information regarding our first quarter 2021 performance as well as our financial outlook. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions we mentioned today.

Our commentary today will also include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP metrics for uor reported results can also be found in our earnings release issued earlier today, as well as in our filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll turn things over to Jay Farner to get us started. Jay?\nJay Farner: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Rocket Companies earnings call for the first quarter of 2021. We had an excellent start to the year. But before we dive into the details, I'd like to take a moment to recognize our team members for their efforts and results, many of whom are listening right now. Last month, Rocket Companies was named one of the five best companies to work for in America by Fortune Magazine, joining other tech companies that topped the list, including Salesforce and Cisco. This is the 18th year our company has appeared in Fortune's best workplaces list. We are also proud of another recognition we recently received. Just a couple weeks ago Forbes ranked Rocket Companies number three on its list of the 500 best employers for diversity in America. As a company, we are made better by having increased diversity in thought and experiences, and have worked very hard to ensure that we're staying true to the DE&I promise we made our team members and our communities. I want to thank our team members again, not only for their support, but also the absolutely vital role they play in making our company one of the best, most diverse places to work in the nation. Happy and engaged team members paired with world class technology and services leads to tremendous success. That's why I'm pleased to share that in the first quarter of 2021, Rocket Companies generate more than $100 billion in close loan volume, resulting in over $2 billion in EBITDA. Equally impressive this represents the sixth consecutive quarter that we have at least doubled our close loan volume. year-over-year.  On today's call, I'll provide an update on each of the pillars of the Rocket platform; technology, data, brand and the Rocket Could Force. I'll finish my remarks by diving into one of the biggest opportunities for Rocket Companies today, transforming the home buying experience. Rocket Companies\u2019 core mission is to create certainty in life's most complex moments. As we all know, getting mortgage or buying a car are historically painful experiences. At Rocket, we have spent decades focused on developing a platform that removes the friction and pain points in these complex transactions, creating transparency, certainty and competence for our clients. In the ever changing economic environment, our centralized platform has the flexibility to address diverse client needs across multiple products from accessing the equity in their home to purchasing their next car. We can also meet clients where they are either on a direct to consumer basis or through our B2B relationships with our professional partners. All executed on a scalable tech driven platform. Further differentiating our company is the ability to excel through any environment. Our platform provides us extreme flexibility to shift and meet the needs of our clients in any market. When rates are low, our platform scales to help a large number of refinance clients. When we see rates rise, we're able to flex and drive value for our clients whose needs aren't rate sensitive, like those looking to buy a home take cash out, or who are managing a life situation. In the current environment, you will see us continue to invest in marketing and our Rocket Cloud Force. While others in our space may pull away from the market, we remain focused on adding new clients to our platform with the knowledge that future transactions with the same client will drive incremental revenue with little to no marginal cost. This is all made possible because our Rocket platform provides unmatched client retention rates at 90 plus percent. As we continue to expand our platform, creating certainty for clients in categories that have historically been challenging, the opportunity for Rocket Companies is gigantic. Consider this when combined real estate, automotive sales and financial services, all markets where we're helping to lead the way account for nearly one third of the US GDP. They're all highly fragmented markets and digital transformation is still in the early innings. We continue to take market share in each one of these segments, and believe we are well positioned to win in the long run. To lead in the largest and most complex markets, it requires developing proprietary technology to deliver a seamless digital experience. Today's consumers demand speed and efficiency and the platform must be able to grow, pivot and flex at scale. We are seeing that in our business today. On our last call I mentioned Rocket Logic, our next generation workflow engine. We created Rocket Logic with the belief that through rich data and machine learning, we can significantly reduce the amount of time it takes to originate and close a mortgage. As we have continued to grow our pilot program in the first quarter, I'm proud to say that Rocket Logic is performing at scale. During the first quarter Rocket Logic processed more than one third of our loan volume. Improvements in efficiency and speed are clear. Overall turn times declined by more than 30% quarter-over-quarter in Q1. While Rocket Logic is already driving increased efficiency in our mortgage operations today, we're equally excited about the long term opportunity to extend the underlying automation to all the complex transactions across our platform. As we develop industry leading technologies that create better outcomes for our clients, we are also continuing to improve and evolve how we leverage the tremendous insights we can glean from our centralized integrated data lake. This data lake and its 220 million consumer records is a strategic moat for the Rocket platform. Leveraging this resource in the first quarter, we significantly expanded our data marketplace, an internal API platform that allows our teams to develop new applications, run marketing campaigns and even build new business lines, all using common, trusted and secure data assets. Machine learning and AI continues to play an increasingly important role in our organization as well. Every single day, our systems make nearly 8.5 million automated decisions, helping to ensure we are running the business efficiently. Our talented team of nearly 300 data engineers and data scientists is expanding in 2021, including the most recent hiring of a new senior data science leader who will be heading off our Rocket Mortgage Data Intelligence team. While we leverage data to drive client interaction, our company continues to find new and unique ways to reach clients increase engagement with our brand. As we mentioned on our last call, we had the two top rated ads this year's Superbowl. Those ads were instrumental in driving consumer interest, which led more than 60 million unique visitors to our digital properties in the first quarter, representing 72% increase year-over-year. Also to help drive the recognition of our brand, we recently announced two important sponsorships, the first is a very special one to us, as we look to uplift traditionally underrepresented communities. Rocket Pro TPO, our brand serving mortgage brokers, community banks and credit unions is proud to be sponsoring the number 16 car in this year's Indianapolis 500. What makes us unique is that the car is a woman owned, woman driven and the majority of the pit crew are also women. We are passionate about this partnership and the extensions around it to raise awareness and excitement for how women are transforming industries, both in racing and financial services. This is particularly true in the mortgage broker space, where we are seeing women enter and lead in what has traditionally been a very male dominated field. The other sponsorship is a PGA Tour superstar and 2020 Rocket Mortgage Classic Champion, Bryson DeChambeau. Anyone familiar with him knows he's a long hitter, an innovator and one of the best players on tour. Our sports partnerships do a great job of showcasing our brands to audiences who may not have seen this otherwise. Once those consumers visit our sites to learn more, our Rocket Cloud Force of more than 6,600 highly trained US based advisors step forward to ensure a seamless process. Our Rocket Cloud Force continues to be a key differentiator in our business. Our team's ability to build report with accurate and timely assistance, complementing our unmatched online experience, allows us to deliver the high touch expert experience our clients want, paired with the efficiency of our digital first process. The Rocket Cloud Force's impact extends well beyond mortgage transactions. For example, the team members who make up the Rocket Cloud Force are proving instrumental in Rocket Auto's growth. Over the last year, Rocket Auto's Cloud Force has more than doubled. The increase in trained and trusted advisers was valuable in the first quarter, enabling the company to exceed $1 billion in its annual GMV run rate for the first time. To aid in fueling Rocket Auto's explosive growth, I'm proud to announce that the company has just formed a strategic partnership with AutoFi, a leading software provider in the automotive retail industry. This new relationship, paired with Rocket Auto's own proprietary platform, will enable the company to facilitate a full automotive point of sale solution, including financing and insurance. Today, AutoFi works with more than 2,000 dealer partners. This relationship is another step in continuing to accelerate Rocket Auto's growth by connecting with dealerships across the country to increase our access to inventory, which is critical in today's high demand auto market. When all the elements, technology, data, brand and our Rocket Cloud Force combined and work together, it's a very powerful thing. I want to close my remarks by spending a few minutes talking about our biggest opportunity in the market today; transforming the home buying experience. It is clear that home purchase transactions represent the single largest growth opportunity for Rocket Companies today. We are in the hottest real estate market in more than a decade and demand is accelerating. March and April have been the strongest months of purchase application volume in our company's history. The simple fact is the home buying process is extremely complicated. It involves multiple professionals, including real estate agents, title companies and local mortgage brokers. All of this complexity has led to home buying being one of the last transactions to make the move online. It has also created an extremely fragmented market where no company has been able to grab significant national market share. We were the second largest retail purchase lender in 2020, excluding the secondary market of correspondent lending. And that was with only low single digit penetration in the purchase market. Today, I am proud to announce that Rocket Mortgage has set a goal to become the number one retail home purchase lender in America over the next 24 months. Said differently, we are poised to transform the entire home buying experience. Only Rocket Companies can combine digital home search and our powerful Rocket Cloud Force, with tens of thousands of relationships with real estate agents and Rocket Pro TPO brokers, while fully integrating mortgage, appraisal, title and digital closing. Core to this growth strategy is Rocket Homes, our home search experience and real estate agent referral network. While others in the market have figured out how to display MLS listings online, we started with the most complicated and profitable steps in the home purchase process, the financing and the title work. From there, we built a full featured, industry leading home search product at Rocket Homes. As we built nationwide coverage over the last year, traffic to Rocket Homes real estate listings platform has increased substantially, growing over 300% year-over-year in the first quarter. Once consumers find their dream home, they are staying within the Rocket Homes ecosystem and connecting with our Rocket Homes partner agent. In fact, connections to Rocket Homes agents were up 50% year-over-year in Q1. Real estate agents play a critical role in the home buying process and we are providing powerful tools to help our agent partners in today's competitive market. Late last year, we launched Rocket Pro Insight, which allows any real estate agent to gain unprecedented access to their clients\u2019 mortgage, with the clients\u2019 permission, of course. This first of its kind solution provides visibility, control and tools for real estate agents to present more competitive offers and close deals faster. The number of real estate agents who've signed up for Rocket Pro Insight has more than tripled in just three months, with more than 45,000 agents using Rocket Pro Insight, up from 14,000 at the end of the year. Another new program that is quickly becoming a favorite of real estate agents and their clients is our overnight underwrite. This program guarantees that if a client submits their paperwork for a purchase application by 7:00 p.m., they will receive a fully verified approval by morning. Local mortgage brokers are another extremely important component of our purchase strategy. We continue to invest in the broker channel and have earmarked tens of millions of dollars in technology investment in 2021. Our continued innovation in the broker space is paying off. In March alone, Rocket Pro TPO signed up hundreds of new partners, marking one of the strongest months of partner growth in our company's history. At Rocket Companies, we've built a flexible platform that can shift to the areas of greatest opportunity, including today's explosive real estate and automotive markets. These markets present an enormous opportunity for us to acquire clients, to drive substantial lifetime value. Our ability to retain clients at a rate exceeding 90% is matched only by some of the best performing subscription business models in the world. We will continue to operate this business with a focus on the long term based on the lifetime value of our clients with the knowledge that once added to our ecosystem, these clients will continue to add revenue in the months, years and decades to come. We are excited about the opportunities ahead of us in the second quarter and beyond, as our team continues to deliver on technology and great service that helps us win today and long into the future. With that, I'll turn things over to Julie. Julie?\nJulie Booth: Thank you, Jay, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report another quarter of strong financial results for Rocket Companies. In the first quarter of 2021, Rocket Companies generated $4 billion of adjusted revenue and $2.4 billion of adjusted EBITDA. In discussing our results, I'll highlight some of our key priorities, including continuing to drive volume in today's strengthening economic environment, particularly from clients purchasing homes and cars, as well as those accessing the equity in their homes. I will also share some detail on today's call around the investments we're making to transform the home buying experience, including continuing to grow our partner network. Our first quarter results demonstrate continued growth and performance at scale. We generated $103.5 billion of closed loan volume in Q1, exceeding the high end of our guidance range and marking our sixth consecutive quarter with more than 100% year-over-year closed volume growth. We experienced strong growth across the Rocket Companies platform in Q1 with record gross merchandise value at Rocket Auto, record traffic to Rocket Homes and record title and settlement transactions at Amrock. We continued to drive strong profitability in the quarter with first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $2.4 billion and adjusted net income of $1.8 billion. These results reflect our ability to drive large scale volume on our platform very efficiently with limited incremental cost. Over the last 12 months, Rocket Companies generated $12.6 billion in adjusted EBITDA, demonstrating our ability to scale up and create truly substantial profitability in strong market environments. As we enter the second quarter of 2021, we are seeing a strengthening economic environment. A key advantage of our platform business model is the ability to shift our resources to the area of greatest opportunity in any market environment. In our mortgage business, continuing to drive strong volume in 2021 will require addressing client needs that are less sensitive to interest rates. Demand for these products is driven by factors, including: clients wanting to purchase a home; take cash out of their homes; reduce the terms on their mortgages; changes in their life situations; and the demand for investment properties. Although, rate and term refinancing activity was very high in 2020's low interest rate environment, Rocket has historically had a balanced mix of originations. For example, over the last four years, including 2020, half of our cumulative volume was from these less rate sensitive products. The strength of today's real estate environment provides multiple tailwinds for our business. With strong demand and limited inventory, home values recently reached record levels and are growing at the strongest pace in 15 years. Home values have increased nationwide at a double digit year-over-year pace in recent months, according to both the National Association of Realtors and the S&P CoreLogic Case Shiller index. This trend translates directly into higher transaction values and revenue per unit for Rocket Mortgage and Rocket Homes. With home values increasing, many homeowners are also taking advantage of the equity in their homes, to consolidate debt or fund home improvements through cash-out mortgage refinancings. Freddie Mac recently reported that last year, American homeowners tapped into the most home equity in 14 years. We are also seeing strong fundamental tailwinds at Rocket Auto, our automotive retail marketplace. Rocket Auto's year-over-year growth accelerated meaningfully into Q1 to over 60%. We achieved this growth despite inventory constraints from severe weather in the South, among other factors. Rocket Auto facilitated $360 million in gross merchandise value of automotive sales in Q1, passing the $1 billion annual GMV run rate for the first time. Leveraging our new relationship with AutoFi, we expect to further accelerate growth throughout the year as we continue to expand our inventory and onboard additional automotive retail partners. This sets Rocket Auto well on its way toward our stated goal of doubling automotive GMV in 2021. Turning to the home buying opportunity specifically, as you heard from Jay, home purchase transactions represent the single largest growth opportunity for Rocket Companies today. In the first half of 2021, we are seeing strong acceleration in purchase activity at Rocket Mortgage. Q1 represented our strongest first quarter purchase volume in company history. Momentum accelerated throughout the quarter, with March setting a record for purchase application volume. And strong performance carried into the second quarter, with April exceeding March, setting a new record as the single largest month for purchase application volume in company\u2019s history. We expect continued strength into the spring home buying season and we are projecting record quarterly purchase volume in Q2. Today, we shared our objective to become the number one retail purchase lender within the next two years. I'll provide some detail on the strategic initiatives and investments that will drive us to that goal. The investments we're making are focused in two primary areas: digital product development and our B2B partner relationships. On the product development front, we are driving market leading innovation to transform the digital home buying experience. As you heard from Jay, we continue to build out the Rocket Homes digital home search experience. We are seeing the benefits today with Rocket Homes traffic doubling over the last six months and increasing more than 300% year-over-year in Q1. We see significant opportunity to further deepen the integration between Rocket Homes and Rocket Mortgage, with Rocket Homes content now being embedded throughout the home buying process. We're also delivering first to market solutions like Rocket Pro Insight, verified approval letters from Rocket Mortgage and overnight underwrite, all of which help our clients and partners compete in today's highly competitive real estate market. Our B2B relationships with professional partners form another important driver of our home purchase strategy. We've invested for several years to deepen our partnerships with real estate agents, tax professionals, mortgage brokers and insurance agents whose service trusted touch points working with our clients on a daily basis, especially during the home buying process. Partners are an important driver of our overall growth. Over the last 12 months, our partner network generated $142 billion of closed loan volume, representing growth of 7.5 times since 2018. Our partners drive incremental volume on the Rocket platform. They also help us capture more purchase transactions and contribute a higher purchase mix than overall company average. The partner network also drives incremental profit dollars for our business. Gain on sale margins in this channel reflect the partial sharing of economics with our partners. Because partner revenue is incremental to our platform and requires limited direct costs, we are comfortable investing in partner network margins when we see strategic opportunities in the marketplace, while still driving incremental profit dollars to Rocket Companies. We've made these investments successfully in the past, including when we initially ran through our partner network volume, and we see similar opportunities today. As a reminder, we are in the early stages of ramping a new partnership with Morgan Stanley and E-Trade. In addition, we are seeing a significant opportunity today within the independent mortgage broker community. We are driving particularly strong growth among brokers as we extend Rocket Pro technology and the Rocket Pro TPO brand in this market. We are investing in the mortgage broker channel and we are winning. Hundreds of broker partners joined our network during the first quarter, and our partner volume has continued to be strong into the second quarter. As Jay outlined, we plan to invest tens of millions of dollars this year in technology to support our broker partners. Our near term priority in this channel is to drive volume and incremental profits. Turning to our guidance for the second quarter. We expect strong closed loan volume of between $82.5 billion and $87.5 billion and rate lock volume between $81.5 billion and $88.5 billion. Each of these metrics represents over 100% growth relative to the same period in 2019. We are encouraged by our ability to continue driving strong volume, and we expect non rate sensitive products to exceed 40% of our total volume in the second quarter, approaching our longer term historical averages. We expect second quarter gain on sale margin between 2.65% and 2.95%. We expect second quarter gain on sale margin in our direct to consumer channel to remain above 400 basis points, consistent with our long term track record of superior margins in our direct to consumer channel. We expect partner network margins to be around 100 basis points. Margins in both channels are consistent with historical levels prior to 2020. Our combined second quarter gain on sale margin guidance of between 2.65% and 2.95% reflects changes in channel and product mix, including continued strong growth in our partner network, which drives attractive incremental profits. I would like to make one note regarding comparisons to prior periods. 2020 was a highly unusual year as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and record low interest rates. Rocket Companies delivered remarkable performance through this unprecedented period, with $12.6 billion in adjusted EBITDA over the last 12 months. As an organization, we remain extremely focused on long term growth. As a result, you will hear us reference longer term comparisons, particularly comparing our performance in 2021 to 2019 levels, which we believe demonstrates our ability to grow through the economic cycle. As Jay mentioned, increasing the lifetime value of our clients is a core component of our growth strategy. We will continue to increase the lifetime value of our clients as we expand our platform to address more and more of the important transactions in their lives. We exited the first quarter with an extremely strong balance sheet. I'd like to draw your attention to the substantial cash resources that we have in the business today, which totaled $5.6 billion as of March 31st. When considering our current ownership structure, this means we had $2.79 available cash per share at the end of Q1. Available cash includes $2.9 billion of cash on hand and an additional $2.7 billion of corporate cash used to self fund loan originations, which could be transferred to funding facilities at our option. Our total liquidity, which includes available cash plus undrawn lines of credit and undrawn MSR lines stood at $8.7 billion at quarter end. As a reminder, our quarter end liquidity is after the special dividend we paid during the first quarter of $1.11 per Class A common share, funded by an equity distribution of $2.2 billion. We remain authorized to repurchase up to $1 billion of our shares. With that, we are ready to turn it back to the operator for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We have our first question coming from the line of Arren Cyganovich with Citi.\nArren Cyganovich: The gain on sale margin guidance that you have coming down, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the trends that you're seeing both from the direct to consumer side and on the partner network as well.\nJay Farner: Julie talked about some of the gain on sale in her remarks, in particular, how strong our direct to consumer data on sale remains. As we think about Q1, one of the great things that happened for our business is we saw the 10 year treasury go from 90 basis points, I think, up to a high of 170 basis points. So what was expected to take over a year or two to occur kind of all happened in about a 90 day period of time. So adjustments have to be made, but that's where our platform really kicks in. And as Julie touched on, we're almost back to where we traditionally have been where 50% of our originations are not rate sensitive. And so the acceleration in those things so quickly was incredibly exciting. And we're watching our retention climb as well, north of 90%, now 91%. So you're going to see us be strategic around gain on sale. And we talk about this a lot, the margins, although moving back to more historical averages, are incredibly strong. But what we think about is not just that margin for the first transaction what we're thinking about is the lifetime value of every client that we acquire. And if you hear us talk about the massive growth in Rocket Homes, Rocket Auto and as we continue to add additional fulfillment businesses to our platform, the value of that acquired client will continue to grow as well. So it's much like the discussions, I think we had, Arren, back kind of during the IPO process when we were talking about setting a strategy over the course of two or three years, really arriving at what the true lifetime value of the client is and then continuing to execute on those strategies to bring those clients into our servicing book, so we can monetize them for years to come. So our big focus and I'm really proud of the growth we had in Q1 compared to Q1 of '20 and Q1 of '19, over $100 billion of closed loan volume, that's all coming into the top of the funnel, and we'll monetize that over time. I'll let Julie maybe go just a bit more specifics. But really important to at least understand how we're thinking about that, which is, of course, it's profitable right now to bring those clients into our platform. But it's even more profitable than it looks on paper because of the lifetime value that we subscribe to each one of those clients. Julie?\nJulie Booth: Yes, I think it's important to take just a minute to break down our gain on sale margin guidance a bit further. So as I have said, we are expecting overall gain on sale margins to be between 2.65% and 2.95% in the second quarter. But to break this down by channel, we expect to see our direct to consumer margins above 400 basis points, which is consistent with our long term track record of consistent margins in this core DTC channel. If you look back over time, you'll see that consistency in those margins. And then we're expecting partner network margins around 100 basis points. And these levels are also roughly consistent with historical levels prior to 2020. If we look at that quarter-over-quarter change in the gain on sale margin guidance, it's really being driven kind of roughly by three equal factors: first of all, is changes in loan pricing and particularly our investment to drive the growth in the partner network channel; the second thing is that we did see the primary secondary spread compress at the end of Q1 and into Q2; and then the third factor that I'll mention is the channel and the product mix. And we're seeing an increase in the partner network in jumbo loans as a percentage of our total originations, both of which drives attractive incremental profit for us. So in looking at our second quarter guidance overall, we feel very good about our ability to drive volume, which is more than double 2019 levels, as we've said, at gain on sale margins roughly consistent with historical levels.\nArren Cyganovich: And then I guess just secondly, on the Rocket Homes and the new initiative to be the number one purchase lender in two years. Is this an investment that will drive any additional revenue streams through Rocket Homes, or is it really just a focus on getting those customers right in the process of choosing their home?\nJay Farner: So we've been investing in this ecosystem for quite a few years now. And the reason we've set the goal here in the next 24 months because all of those important components and the millions of dollars of tech spend are really starting to pay off. I know I touched on the fact that on our Rocket Homes platform, which is an incredibly robust MLS listings platform. We now are covering 49 to 50 states and I think we'll be into Hawaii in a matter of days or weeks. That growth year-over-year is up 300%, and that matters because what do you do with that. Well, it drives mortgage volume, but it's also driving real estate volume. So our agent connections, taking those clients that are interested in finding homes and aligning them with an agent, that was up 50% year-over-year, and we're making significant investments in that process and technology to keep accelerating that. So what does that do? Well, that allows us to capture revenue on the real estate side, on the mortgage side, on the title side. And so not only are you getting those additional revenue streams you just touched on but it's also driving up conversion. And especially in a market like we're experiencing right now where inventory is so light, we've got to make those connection points where our client comes in, top of the funnel, finds a house, gets connected with an agent, gets a verified approval, in our cases now we're offering our overnight underwrite, so the agent can write an offer, 6:00 p.m. on a Tuesday, they wake up Wednesday morning, they're fully approved. So our clients can get cash buyers. So we can drive up those conversion rates and so we can grab that volume. And so that's additional volume we'll be adding to the platform as we continue to invest now in marketing all the purchase services that we've got. And I know I mentioned this to the 45,000 agents we now have on the RHI platform that we built, the Rocket Pro Insights platform that our agents use. So all of those things kind of will bring additional revenue, but also increased conversion. And then the last component I'll say to that, and Julie is talking about the E-Trade partnership, we've referenced before our Realtor.com partnership. As that conversion rises, our ability to lean in and participate in the purchase, lead and advertising markets grows. Because we can spend more than others can spend because our conversion rates are far greater than the industry average. So that's a virtuous kind of flywheel that we are building right now that will play a very important role here as we go through '21 and into '22.\nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.\nRyan Nash: So I wanted to follow-up on a question that Arren asked on gain on sale margins. Do you foresee that we're at the bottom by channel? I know others have talked about industry underpricing loans. So can you maybe just talk about that combined with the competitive dynamics what's going on in the wholesale channel that's causing these competitive pressures? And Jay, how do you think about long term customer lifetime value versus trading off with some of the near term economics?\nJay Farner: Maybe I'll start with the margin piece, and Julie can jump in here, too. But we're kind of back to some of the historical longer term margins that we've experienced, which on our platform are still very profitable, number one, in the first transaction. But again, to some of the other comments that I made, it's also the additional or the lifetime value. Now there's been some changes in particular in the broker market that I think are very interesting. Our focus here is to solve the problem of our client. If a client needs to buy a house, how can we develop technology and service to assist them. If a broker wants to grow their business, how can we provide technology, marketing, et cetera, to assist them. Others have kind of focused on solving their own problems, I think, versus the brokers problems. It's interesting what's happened because through that our partnership with the brokers that we've got in that part of our partnership channel has strengthened. So the volumes that they're setting us are increasing. And so if you think about the lifetime value, certainly in the direct to consumer channel, that's well understood. But in the broker channel, you might say to yourself, well, each time a loan comes in that broker's thinking, hey, where should I send it? But as choice gets eliminated and our partnership with that broker gets stronger, our ability to monetize and work with that broker partner in the years to come to drive more lifetime value from those relationships, increases as well. So we're excited about what we're seeing in the broker channel. We're really excited about what we're seeing in the direct to consumer channel. And so we spend our time thinking about the lifetime value more than probably the day-to-day margin that we might experience on the first loan. And I know I referenced this before, but I'm going to say it again. I think we saw growth in auto, up 60% to 65% from Q1 of last year to Q1 of this year, and that's with very tight inventory. We're in a very unique spot. I mean, there's an article every day, written about how there's no auto inventory, yet we're growing. We saw growth in the homes channel. We're seeing growth in our loans channel. So all of that has to be factored into our LTV decision. And we're going to keep doing that, because once we capture that base and we continue to add these fulfillment engines to the bottom of our funnel, we're fully building out the platform that we've been on a mission to build out for years here. So doesn't mean will -- and this is where Julie will jump in. It doesn't mean we won't be thoughtful about the margin day to day, and I think that's evidenced by where we are right now, and we're north of 400 basis points on our DTC. But it's critical that we think about the future and where we're headed and the millions of clients we're adding to our platform and how they're going to stay with us. I mean that's the long game that we're playing.\nJulie Booth: And just to add to that, if we look at our direct to consumer margins over time, as I said, they do tend to really be more consistent. And we've seen that quarter-over-quarter here as we look back, there may be some times when it is just slightly lower than that. But you'll see it certainly hold around that and opportunities like we just saw there present a great opportunity for us to take some additional margin. And then on the partner network side of things, we're really going to be strategic there. We're going to be thoughtful about growing that business long term. There may be some opportunities to take advantage of potentially leading into that margin, and we'll think about that from time to time. But we are going to be thoughtful about the near term, that like Trey said, absolutely focused on that long term value of those clients that we're acquiring.\nRyan Nash: And then I'll ask my follow ups together. So first, Jay, you referenced a couple of times that 50% of the originations are not rate sensitive. Can you maybe flesh out for us how much of that is purchase versus cash out refi and what else may be included in that, so we can understand what some of those pieces are? And then second, you talked a lot upfront about leveraging the ecosystem to drive growth in all of these new channels that you're developing. Can you maybe just talk about your vision for how you see these scaling over the coming years? What it can mean for the growth of your company and just how the investments that you're making in tech have better positioned you versus other players in the industry?\nJay Farner: So I don't think we break down the specifics here, but I'll give you some context. And then we talk about debt consolidation all the time, that really falls into two buckets, and we're watching this increase substantially as we get into 2021. I mean spending, as we all know, is very strong in a variety of areas and that's causing debt to be accumulated. Credit card debt, second mortgage debt, our home equity line debt, all things that we can consolidate, we were talking about the rise in home prices, it's created a scarcity in terms of homes available but it's also created one of the greatest increases in home equity we\u2019ve seen like 15 or 20 years. So it's a it's a really strong positive combination for us. I think we're very well positioned, and this goes back to our data science team. We have 220 million records. We talk to millions of people a month, understanding their debt load. We can model out where they were a year ago and then also model out where they will be in the future, creating all kinds of opportunity to balance out the equity in their home, with the debt that they're building, and we can consolidate that. So that's a huge piece of our business. We've been executing on that for years. And as Julie referenced, well be seeing that come back to kind of levels that it had been at in years prior. We called out purchase, because we're the second largest retail purchase lender in the country. So you can kind of use those numbers to triangulate where we're at, and we're going to number one. So it plays an important role. And I already touched on this, how are we going to get to number one? Well, we're combining all of these disparate experiences from MLS to realtors, to mortgage brokers, to title, to appraisal. All of this hard work we've been doing on this tech platform behind the scenes is really starting to come together. The other exciting part, I know I touched on this, is now taking all of that data and merging it together. So we can watch and learn every step of the process, what is happening to that client, where are the fall off points, where can we increase conversion, how do we modify our process. So that's the tech platform. And the tech platform is in the early innings compared to where it will eventually be with that data sharing across all of these different fulfillment businesses we're building. Here's our mission. At the end of the day, we should be able to look out at every American and target market or have a specific message and specific value to every single American about how we can help them either improve on their home, save money in some way, shape or form, buy a car, or help them with the real estate transaction. And when you put those things together, that's 30% of the US GDP that we're talking about here. So that's our vision. That's the platform we're building to play a major role in almost a third of the GDP here in the United States of America. And those are all the critical pieces that we've been building for years under kind of the hood. And I think this AutoFi partnership is really critical, because it's an important component. We've added to really grow that inventory and our reach into different dealerships, is that auto business that we're building is far different than almost anybody else. We're really just connecting and conducting the sale, and now we get the option to connect the financing between dealer and consumer. And so we can really be the marketplace. So I'm excited about that as well. So I am not sure I've answered all of your questions, but that's the vision of where we're headed here. And the last thing I'll say is all surrounded or wrapped in $1 billion in a multibillion dollar brand that has the highest client service ratings in the country. So we don't have to convince people what Rocket is all about. They know that it's a high quality experience. And so as we add these additional services, we believe that the conversion rates will be quite high because people are already conditioned to jump in and take advantage of those services.\nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Doug Harter with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nDoug Harter: Julie, you highlighted the strong liquidity cash position that you currently have. Can you just talk about, I guess, how you're thinking of what the level that you need to hold and how you would be thinking about future potential return of capital given future cash flow?\nJulie Booth: We do have substantial liquidity, as I mentioned in the business today. And as we think about the level in the business really we're going to be looking at first and foremost, as I know I've mentioned before, investing back in the business is going to be the first place that we're going to look to deploy that capital. So whether that comes from the investments that we're making, either in brand or whether we're making that in technology, or potentially acquisitions that maybe of interest to us as we continue to look for those things that are additive to our business, either to our tech platform, our reach, and that is something that we'll continue to look at. And then if that is not something that we see in the near term as we look out here, we will potentially look to return some capital to shareholders, either through doing a dividend like we had done here or potentially through a share buyback. So that's kind of the way we're going to keep looking at how we manage our cash as we go forward here.\nDoug Harter: And I guess if you could just -- while volumes are remaining kind of elevated, they are kind of down sequentially next quarter. Just what does that do to kind of liquidity needs to kind of run the business?\nJay Farner: I'll jump in on the volume question. I know when we are thinking about where we came out of Q1, over $100 billion the guidance we provided for Q2. Keeping in mind that we've got thousands and thousands of approved homebuyers. And so hopefully, as more inventory opens up, that will accelerate some of the purchase transactions that are kind of currently in waiting mode. But we feel very good about where we are in Q2 and looking forward into the future and seeing volumes in a very similar range. And we had a huge year last year. I expect to have a very good year this year from a volume perspective. And so you can keep that in mind as you think about our capital needs here as we get through the rest of the year. Julie?\nJulie Booth: As we continue to generate cash flow, we're going to be thinking about those same investments that we can make, and it really doesn't change the decision here as we go forward. We'll continue to manage our capital in the same way we've been thinking about it and expect to continued strong cash flow here in the second quarter.\nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman.\nDennis McGill: Exciting to hear all the different opportunities you have ahead of you on the purchase side. I just wanted to tie back to maybe the data that we're looking at for 2020 would imply that there was a little bit of share loss in the purchase channel. And I was wondering if that is a good example of last year being a year where the profitability was most attractive in the refi side. And a good example of where you can shift product mix and go after the more profitable part of the business? And then thinking about that moving forward, if purchase is a more attractive area that's where you can lean. So is that the right way to think about the fluctuation that you might see year to year versus smoothing that out over a multiple year period?\nJay Farner: I think there's probably two ways to view that. I think you're right. The flexibility of our platform really allows us to move to the most profitable loan that we'll bring in. And again, as we touched on, not only the first time around but thinking about the lifetime value of that client. And so you'll keep watching and seeing us do that. Also considering the investments that we are making long term in purchase now, as we've touched on Rocket Homes, we've touched on the listing site, we've touched on the reator network. I know in calls past, I've talked about providing other opportunities for sellers and buyers through for sale by owner and other projects that we're working on. The insights network that we're building that now has 45,000 plus real estate agents on that, the technology that we're investing there to give them the visibility, the communication, the transparency into the loan. All of those are significant investments into purchase. And so although we will keep adjusting the levers to make sure we're maximizing our opportunity, I think you'll see us keep the accelerator pedal on purchase as well, because we're making substantial investments now to continue to see that channel grow.\nDennis McGill: And then a separate question as it relates to some of the changes by the agencies on second home investment home limitation. Can you just maybe share any impact you're seeing in the market from that, and if there's any non agency channels opening up for sales of those loans?\nJay Farner: There's been a few adjustments here in the last month or so. I think we're in a great position, and Bob Walters can touch on this. I think the first big example of this was our smart jumbo that we rolled out about 30 or 45 days ago and the securitization there. And so our capital markets group is incredibly sophisticated. Their ability to execute on those securitizations has also given us this opportunity to move forward into other products, whether they be second home or vacation homes or other things where the agencies may be putting limits, we can jump in and continue to grow those channels with high quality products and deliver them in the secondary market. Bob, I don't know if you have additional comments.\nBob Walters: We've seen the changes the agency has made around investment property, second homes, disrupted a number of players in the markets, we got ahead of that. And I think to Jay's point, our ability to securitize off our own shelf gives us a lot of latitude and flexibility in that area. So that's not disrupted us from a volume standpoint. In fact, we've had some opportunities to take advantage of that.\nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays.\nMark DeVries: Historically, originators with a more centralized model have struggled to have too deep of a penetration in the purchase market. But you guys have created a pretty interesting ecosystem that may just crack the knot. The question I have is how are you managing kind of the gray area of respo risk that kind of sits between the different linkages in that ecosystem you're creating?\nJay Farner: Well, obviously, these companies are separate companies. And I can tell you they've got a team of crack attorneys, ensuring that everything that we do is at a proper arms length transaction. As you can think about it, and I'm not going to go into a RESPA educational seminar here. But our clients have choice every step of the manner, or every step of the way. Now with all the services we provide and the technology we provide, it's understandable that their choice is to work with a company that can bring all of these things together. But we feel very good about the footing that we're on in terms of understanding Respa and our ability to navigate that while growing this channel. And also to your other comment about centralized lenders and their ability to crack the nut here. If you really think about this, real estate agents want certainty. They've worked hard, they want a loan to get closed. And so I don't believe that it's about the location of the lender. I believe it's about the certainty the lender can provide. With our thousands and thousands of third party brokers out there, if the agent is best suited to have somebody who can walk right in their office, we've got that broker partner for them, we publish that broker on our Web site, we provide great technology to that broker, and we're happy to have the agent work that way. If agent prefers to work with us in our centralized Rocket Mortgage platform, that's great, too. And that's why we're making such a large investment in the communication, in the visibility, in the transparency, in the overnight underwrite, all of the things that bring certainty to those agents, so they can have confidence that we're closing those loans. And that's probably the second largest purchase lender in the country and growing. So I don't think it's centralized or decentralized. I think it's just [RU], and I go back to that comment I made. Do you understand the problem and are you solving that problem for your client, whether it's the broker or the agent or the end consumer. And that's the mission that we're on. That's why our product strategy team is now hundreds deep working these hard problems, teaching every day to make sure that we're delivering where others don't. And the last thing, I'll make a comment on that. That's exactly why we take this long term view. Rates are going to go up, rates are going to go down. Probably in December, nobody had said to themselves, I bet you the 10 year treasury is going from 90 to 100 to 170 basis points. But it did. You cannot get distracted on the day to day movements of the 10 year treasury note. You have to have your plan of how you're going to grow market share over the years by bringing real value to your consumer, whether that be the broker, the agent, the client and you've got to execute on that plan. And so that's exactly what we're doing, that's what we'll continue to do. And I think the proof has been over the course of many decades, staying that course will mean that we can honor that commitment of being the largest purchase [owned] in the country here in the next 24 months.\nMark DeVries: And do you ever see a role in M&A in terms of adding any kind of local retail presence, or do you think that through the combination of your broker partners and your centralized model that you can serve the entire market?\nJay Farner: Well, we're very active in the M&A space. We're always looking for bolt on opportunities and those types of things that can help us grow our platform. And I use the word platform in an important manner. As you probably sense from my previous comments, the real mission is what's best for the consumer, what does the consumer want, what experience can we provide them that gives them the most certainty in that transaction? Any transaction with friction, home buying is one that we're very deep into. But now we're getting into auto, personal loans, how do we remove that friction. And so if there's a if there's an acquisition that fits into our platform that solves a problem for the consumer that currently in our current model we can't solve then that would be an acquisition that we would be looking at. We're almost -- and I said this before, almost kind of origination agnostic. It's whatever is best for the consumer that's what we will do to bring them into our platform, get the lifetime value of that consumer and make sure they have a great experience.\nOperator: We have time for one more question. Last question is coming from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America.\nMihir Bhatia: First, I just wanted to check, in terms of the volume guidance for next quarter, it's down quarter-over-quarter. And I think I heard you say April was a record or application volume quarter. So I'm just trying to like help square that. Do you expect like a meaningful slowdown in May and June or maybe I misheard something in that.\nJay Farner: I think what we were referencing is that over the first quarter, we've had substantial purchase application volume. And so we have thousands of clients today that are approved and they're out looking for homes. Our guidance reflects our current application volume and some of the inventory constraints that exist in the market today. And what I also was referencing is that if you look at kind of the guidance that Julie provided, and we feel great about where that's at, not only for the second quarter but as we think about the future, that guidance kind of tees us up for what should be an outstanding year on the heels of what has been record purchase volume in the first quarter. We didn't talk about the second quarter, but in the first quarter it was the most purchase application volume that we've ever had as a company.\nMihir Bhatia: And then one other question I wanted to ask, you talked about some interesting stats on Rocket Auto, and what I wanted to understand a little bit more about that business. How much of that is this related to existing mortgage customers, is it all of it? Because I guess what I'm trying to understand a little bit more of is, this lifetime value metric that we've talked about a few times, as you have highlighted. Where can we see that in terms of like the cross sell, [Multiple Speakers] any specifics or anything you can share there?\nJay Farner: I'll directionally talk about it because it's very exciting. So as we started this business, we did not focus on our client base initially. We certainly did market research to determine our client base's propensity to purchase, understand that what we believe the conversion rates will be with our client base. But the vast majority of cars that we're selling now, which we're setting records each and every month, are not clients from the Rocket Mortgage platform. They're actually lower converting leads. And there's a reason that we've done that. We wanted to construct a business that had all of the appropriate profitability metrics before really leaning into our client base. So we've tested that enough to understand the conversion rates and what it will mean for that business as we open up our client base, but we've just started to scratch the scratch of the surface in terms of really marketing to our client base. That's why we're adding additional inventory. And we talked about the AutoFi, it's critical if we're going to open that up and generate more leads flow that we have a more robust inventory platform, so we can really provide the services that our clients deserve. So we're kind of moving from phase one to phase two, which will increase all positive things that we'll be adding here in phase two, but excellent question.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. Turning it over to the presenters for closing remarks.\nSharon Ng: All right. Well, we sure appreciate everyone joining us today, and thank you to all of our team members out there listening today. Certainly appreciate everything that you are doing. And I hope everyone has a great rest of the evening and take care.\nJay Farner: Good bye.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Julie Booth",
            "content": "Thank you, Jay, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report another quarter of strong financial results for Rocket Companies. In the first quarter of 2021, Rocket Companies generated $4 billion of adjusted revenue and $2.4 billion of adjusted EBITDA. In discussing our results, I'll highlight some of our key priorities, including continuing to drive volume in today's strengthening economic environment, particularly from clients purchasing homes and cars, as well as those accessing the equity in their homes. I will also share some detail on today's call around the investments we're making to transform the home buying experience, including continuing to grow our partner network. Our first quarter results demonstrate continued growth and performance at scale. We generated $103.5 billion of closed loan volume in Q1, exceeding the high end of our guidance range and marking our sixth consecutive quarter with more than 100% year-over-year closed volume growth. We experienced strong growth across the Rocket Companies platform in Q1 with record gross merchandise value at Rocket Auto, record traffic to Rocket Homes and record title and settlement transactions at Amrock. We continued to drive strong profitability in the quarter with first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $2.4 billion and adjusted net income of $1.8 billion. These results reflect our ability to drive large scale volume on our platform very efficiently with limited incremental cost. Over the last 12 months, Rocket Companies generated $12.6 billion in adjusted EBITDA, demonstrating our ability to scale up and create truly substantial profitability in strong market environments. As we enter the second quarter of 2021, we are seeing a strengthening economic environment. A key advantage of our platform business model is the ability to shift our resources to the area of greatest opportunity in any market environment. In our mortgage business, continuing to drive strong volume in 2021 will require addressing client needs that are less sensitive to interest rates. Demand for these products is driven by factors, including: clients wanting to purchase a home; take cash out of their homes; reduce the terms on their mortgages; changes in their life situations; and the demand for investment properties. Although, rate and term refinancing activity was very high in 2020's low interest rate environment, Rocket has historically had a balanced mix of originations. For example, over the last four years, including 2020, half of our cumulative volume was from these less rate sensitive products. The strength of today's real estate environment provides multiple tailwinds for our business. With strong demand and limited inventory, home values recently reached record levels and are growing at the strongest pace in 15 years. Home values have increased nationwide at a double digit year-over-year pace in recent months, according to both the National Association of Realtors and the S&P CoreLogic Case Shiller index. This trend translates directly into higher transaction values and revenue per unit for Rocket Mortgage and Rocket Homes. With home values increasing, many homeowners are also taking advantage of the equity in their homes, to consolidate debt or fund home improvements through cash-out mortgage refinancings. Freddie Mac recently reported that last year, American homeowners tapped into the most home equity in 14 years. We are also seeing strong fundamental tailwinds at Rocket Auto, our automotive retail marketplace. Rocket Auto's year-over-year growth accelerated meaningfully into Q1 to over 60%. We achieved this growth despite inventory constraints from severe weather in the South, among other factors. Rocket Auto facilitated $360 million in gross merchandise value of automotive sales in Q1, passing the $1 billion annual GMV run rate for the first time. Leveraging our new relationship with AutoFi, we expect to further accelerate growth throughout the year as we continue to expand our inventory and onboard additional automotive retail partners. This sets Rocket Auto well on its way toward our stated goal of doubling automotive GMV in 2021. Turning to the home buying opportunity specifically, as you heard from Jay, home purchase transactions represent the single largest growth opportunity for Rocket Companies today. In the first half of 2021, we are seeing strong acceleration in purchase activity at Rocket Mortgage. Q1 represented our strongest first quarter purchase volume in company history. Momentum accelerated throughout the quarter, with March setting a record for purchase application volume. And strong performance carried into the second quarter, with April exceeding March, setting a new record as the single largest month for purchase application volume in company's history. We expect continued strength into the spring home buying season and we are projecting record quarterly purchase volume in Q2. Today, we shared our objective to become the number one retail purchase lender within the next two years. I'll provide some detail on the strategic initiatives and investments that will drive us to that goal. The investments we're making are focused in two primary areas: digital product development and our B2B partner relationships. On the product development front, we are driving market leading innovation to transform the digital home buying experience. As you heard from Jay, we continue to build out the Rocket Homes digital home search experience. We are seeing the benefits today with Rocket Homes traffic doubling over the last six months and increasing more than 300% year-over-year in Q1. We see significant opportunity to further deepen the integration between Rocket Homes and Rocket Mortgage, with Rocket Homes content now being embedded throughout the home buying process. We're also delivering first to market solutions like Rocket Pro Insight, verified approval letters from Rocket Mortgage and overnight underwrite, all of which help our clients and partners compete in today's highly competitive real estate market. Our B2B relationships with professional partners form another important driver of our home purchase strategy. We've invested for several years to deepen our partnerships with real estate agents, tax professionals, mortgage brokers and insurance agents whose service trusted touch points working with our clients on a daily basis, especially during the home buying process. Partners are an important driver of our overall growth. Over the last 12 months, our partner network generated $142 billion of closed loan volume, representing growth of 7.5 times since 2018. Our partners drive incremental volume on the Rocket platform. They also help us capture more purchase transactions and contribute a higher purchase mix than overall company average. The partner network also drives incremental profit dollars for our business. Gain on sale margins in this channel reflect the partial sharing of economics with our partners. Because partner revenue is incremental to our platform and requires limited direct costs, we are comfortable investing in partner network margins when we see strategic opportunities in the marketplace, while still driving incremental profit dollars to Rocket Companies. We've made these investments successfully in the past, including when we initially ran through our partner network volume, and we see similar opportunities today. As a reminder, we are in the early stages of ramping a new partnership with Morgan Stanley and E-Trade. In addition, we are seeing a significant opportunity today within the independent mortgage broker community. We are driving particularly strong growth among brokers as we extend Rocket Pro technology and the Rocket Pro TPO brand in this market. We are investing in the mortgage broker channel and we are winning. Hundreds of broker partners joined our network during the first quarter, and our partner volume has continued to be strong into the second quarter. As Jay outlined, we plan to invest tens of millions of dollars this year in technology to support our broker partners. Our near term priority in this channel is to drive volume and incremental profits. Turning to our guidance for the second quarter. We expect strong closed loan volume of between $82.5 billion and $87.5 billion and rate lock volume between $81.5 billion and $88.5 billion. Each of these metrics represents over 100% growth relative to the same period in 2019. We are encouraged by our ability to continue driving strong volume, and we expect non rate sensitive products to exceed 40% of our total volume in the second quarter, approaching our longer term historical averages. We expect second quarter gain on sale margin between 2.65% and 2.95%. We expect second quarter gain on sale margin in our direct to consumer channel to remain above 400 basis points, consistent with our long term track record of superior margins in our direct to consumer channel. We expect partner network margins to be around 100 basis points. Margins in both channels are consistent with historical levels prior to 2020. Our combined second quarter gain on sale margin guidance of between 2.65% and 2.95% reflects changes in channel and product mix, including continued strong growth in our partner network, which drives attractive incremental profits. I would like to make one note regarding comparisons to prior periods. 2020 was a highly unusual year as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and record low interest rates. Rocket Companies delivered remarkable performance through this unprecedented period, with $12.6 billion in adjusted EBITDA over the last 12 months. As an organization, we remain extremely focused on long term growth. As a result, you will hear us reference longer term comparisons, particularly comparing our performance in 2021 to 2019 levels, which we believe demonstrates our ability to grow through the economic cycle. As Jay mentioned, increasing the lifetime value of our clients is a core component of our growth strategy. We will continue to increase the lifetime value of our clients as we expand our platform to address more and more of the important transactions in their lives. We exited the first quarter with an extremely strong balance sheet. I'd like to draw your attention to the substantial cash resources that we have in the business today, which totaled $5.6 billion as of March 31st. When considering our current ownership structure, this means we had $2.79 available cash per share at the end of Q1. Available cash includes $2.9 billion of cash on hand and an additional $2.7 billion of corporate cash used to self fund loan originations, which could be transferred to funding facilities at our option. Our total liquidity, which includes available cash plus undrawn lines of credit and undrawn MSR lines stood at $8.7 billion at quarter end. As a reminder, our quarter end liquidity is after the special dividend we paid during the first quarter of $1.11 per Class A common share, funded by an equity distribution of $2.2 billion. We remain authorized to repurchase up to $1 billion of our shares. With that, we are ready to turn it back to the operator for questions. Yes, I think it's important to take just a minute to break down our gain on sale margin guidance a bit further. So as I have said, we are expecting overall gain on sale margins to be between 2.65% and 2.95% in the second quarter. But to break this down by channel, we expect to see our direct to consumer margins above 400 basis points, which is consistent with our long term track record of consistent margins in this core DTC channel. If you look back over time, you'll see that consistency in those margins. And then we're expecting partner network margins around 100 basis points. And these levels are also roughly consistent with historical levels prior to 2020. If we look at that quarter-over-quarter change in the gain on sale margin guidance, it's really being driven kind of roughly by three equal factors: first of all, is changes in loan pricing and particularly our investment to drive the growth in the partner network channel; the second thing is that we did see the primary secondary spread compress at the end of Q1 and into Q2; and then the third factor that I'll mention is the channel and the product mix. And we're seeing an increase in the partner network in jumbo loans as a percentage of our total originations, both of which drives attractive incremental profit for us. So in looking at our second quarter guidance overall, we feel very good about our ability to drive volume, which is more than double 2019 levels, as we've said, at gain on sale margins roughly consistent with historical levels. And just to add to that, if we look at our direct to consumer margins over time, as I said, they do tend to really be more consistent. And we've seen that quarter-over-quarter here as we look back, there may be some times when it is just slightly lower than that. But you'll see it certainly hold around that and opportunities like we just saw there present a great opportunity for us to take some additional margin. And then on the partner network side of things, we're really going to be strategic there. We're going to be thoughtful about growing that business long term. There may be some opportunities to take advantage of potentially leading into that margin, and we'll think about that from time to time. But we are going to be thoughtful about the near term, that like Trey said, absolutely focused on that long term value of those clients that we're acquiring. We do have substantial liquidity, as I mentioned in the business today. And as we think about the level in the business really we're going to be looking at first and foremost, as I know I've mentioned before, investing back in the business is going to be the first place that we're going to look to deploy that capital. So whether that comes from the investments that we're making, either in brand or whether we're making that in technology, or potentially acquisitions that maybe of interest to us as we continue to look for those things that are additive to our business, either to our tech platform, our reach, and that is something that we'll continue to look at. And then if that is not something that we see in the near term as we look out here, we will potentially look to return some capital to shareholders, either through doing a dividend like we had done here or potentially through a share buyback. So that's kind of the way we're going to keep looking at how we manage our cash as we go forward here. As we continue to generate cash flow, we're going to be thinking about those same investments that we can make, and it really doesn't change the decision here as we go forward. We'll continue to manage our capital in the same way we've been thinking about it and expect to continued strong cash flow here in the second quarter."

            "name": "Jay Farner",
            "content": "Good afternoon, and welcome to the Rocket Companies earnings call for the first quarter of 2021. We had an excellent start to the year. But before we dive into the details, I'd like to take a moment to recognize our team members for their efforts and results, many of whom are listening right now. Last month, Rocket Companies was named one of the five best companies to work for in America by Fortune Magazine, joining other tech companies that topped the list, including Salesforce and Cisco. This is the 18th year our company has appeared in Fortune's best workplaces list. We are also proud of another recognition we recently received. Just a couple weeks ago Forbes ranked Rocket Companies number three on its list of the 500 best employers for diversity in America. As a company, we are made better by having increased diversity in thought and experiences, and have worked very hard to ensure that we're staying true to the DE&I promise we made our team members and our communities. I want to thank our team members again, not only for their support, but also the absolutely vital role they play in making our company one of the best, most diverse places to work in the nation. Happy and engaged team members paired with world class technology and services leads to tremendous success. That's why I'm pleased to share that in the first quarter of 2021, Rocket Companies generate more than $100 billion in close loan volume, resulting in over $2 billion in EBITDA. Equally impressive this represents the sixth consecutive quarter that we have at least doubled our close loan volume. year-over-year.  On today's call, I'll provide an update on each of the pillars of the Rocket platform; technology, data, brand and the Rocket Could Force. I'll finish my remarks by diving into one of the biggest opportunities for Rocket Companies today, transforming the home buying experience. Rocket Companies' core mission is to create certainty in life's most complex moments. As we all know, getting mortgage or buying a car are historically painful experiences. At Rocket, we have spent decades focused on developing a platform that removes the friction and pain points in these complex transactions, creating transparency, certainty and competence for our clients. In the ever changing economic environment, our centralized platform has the flexibility to address diverse client needs across multiple products from accessing the equity in their home to purchasing their next car. We can also meet clients where they are either on a direct to consumer basis or through our B2B relationships with our professional partners. All executed on a scalable tech driven platform. Further differentiating our company is the ability to excel through any environment. Our platform provides us extreme flexibility to shift and meet the needs of our clients in any market. When rates are low, our platform scales to help a large number of refinance clients. When we see rates rise, we're able to flex and drive value for our clients whose needs aren't rate sensitive, like those looking to buy a home take cash out, or who are managing a life situation. In the current environment, you will see us continue to invest in marketing and our Rocket Cloud Force. While others in our space may pull away from the market, we remain focused on adding new clients to our platform with the knowledge that future transactions with the same client will drive incremental revenue with little to no marginal cost. This is all made possible because our Rocket platform provides unmatched client retention rates at 90 plus percent. As we continue to expand our platform, creating certainty for clients in categories that have historically been challenging, the opportunity for Rocket Companies is gigantic. Consider this when combined real estate, automotive sales and financial services, all markets where we're helping to lead the way account for nearly one third of the US GDP. They're all highly fragmented markets and digital transformation is still in the early innings. We continue to take market share in each one of these segments, and believe we are well positioned to win in the long run. To lead in the largest and most complex markets, it requires developing proprietary technology to deliver a seamless digital experience. Today's consumers demand speed and efficiency and the platform must be able to grow, pivot and flex at scale. We are seeing that in our business today. On our last call I mentioned Rocket Logic, our next generation workflow engine. We created Rocket Logic with the belief that through rich data and machine learning, we can significantly reduce the amount of time it takes to originate and close a mortgage. As we have continued to grow our pilot program in the first quarter, I'm proud to say that Rocket Logic is performing at scale. During the first quarter Rocket Logic processed more than one third of our loan volume. Improvements in efficiency and speed are clear. Overall turn times declined by more than 30% quarter-over-quarter in Q1. While Rocket Logic is already driving increased efficiency in our mortgage operations today, we're equally excited about the long term opportunity to extend the underlying automation to all the complex transactions across our platform. As we develop industry leading technologies that create better outcomes for our clients, we are also continuing to improve and evolve how we leverage the tremendous insights we can glean from our centralized integrated data lake. This data lake and its 220 million consumer records is a strategic moat for the Rocket platform. Leveraging this resource in the first quarter, we significantly expanded our data marketplace, an internal API platform that allows our teams to develop new applications, run marketing campaigns and even build new business lines, all using common, trusted and secure data assets. Machine learning and AI continues to play an increasingly important role in our organization as well. Every single day, our systems make nearly 8.5 million automated decisions, helping to ensure we are running the business efficiently. Our talented team of nearly 300 data engineers and data scientists is expanding in 2021, including the most recent hiring of a new senior data science leader who will be heading off our Rocket Mortgage Data Intelligence team. While we leverage data to drive client interaction, our company continues to find new and unique ways to reach clients increase engagement with our brand. As we mentioned on our last call, we had the two top rated ads this year's Superbowl. Those ads were instrumental in driving consumer interest, which led more than 60 million unique visitors to our digital properties in the first quarter, representing 72% increase year-over-year. Also to help drive the recognition of our brand, we recently announced two important sponsorships, the first is a very special one to us, as we look to uplift traditionally underrepresented communities. Rocket Pro TPO, our brand serving mortgage brokers, community banks and credit unions is proud to be sponsoring the number 16 car in this year's Indianapolis 500. What makes us unique is that the car is a woman owned, woman driven and the majority of the pit crew are also women. We are passionate about this partnership and the extensions around it to raise awareness and excitement for how women are transforming industries, both in racing and financial services. This is particularly true in the mortgage broker space, where we are seeing women enter and lead in what has traditionally been a very male dominated field. The other sponsorship is a PGA Tour superstar and 2020 Rocket Mortgage Classic Champion, Bryson DeChambeau. Anyone familiar with him knows he's a long hitter, an innovator and one of the best players on tour. Our sports partnerships do a great job of showcasing our brands to audiences who may not have seen this otherwise. Once those consumers visit our sites to learn more, our Rocket Cloud Force of more than 6,600 highly trained US based advisors step forward to ensure a seamless process. Our Rocket Cloud Force continues to be a key differentiator in our business. Our team's ability to build report with accurate and timely assistance, complementing our unmatched online experience, allows us to deliver the high touch expert experience our clients want, paired with the efficiency of our digital first process. The Rocket Cloud Force's impact extends well beyond mortgage transactions. For example, the team members who make up the Rocket Cloud Force are proving instrumental in Rocket Auto's growth. Over the last year, Rocket Auto's Cloud Force has more than doubled. The increase in trained and trusted advisers was valuable in the first quarter, enabling the company to exceed $1 billion in its annual GMV run rate for the first time. To aid in fueling Rocket Auto's explosive growth, I'm proud to announce that the company has just formed a strategic partnership with AutoFi, a leading software provider in the automotive retail industry. This new relationship, paired with Rocket Auto's own proprietary platform, will enable the company to facilitate a full automotive point of sale solution, including financing and insurance. Today, AutoFi works with more than 2,000 dealer partners. This relationship is another step in continuing to accelerate Rocket Auto's growth by connecting with dealerships across the country to increase our access to inventory, which is critical in today's high demand auto market. When all the elements, technology, data, brand and our Rocket Cloud Force combined and work together, it's a very powerful thing. I want to close my remarks by spending a few minutes talking about our biggest opportunity in the market today; transforming the home buying experience. It is clear that home purchase transactions represent the single largest growth opportunity for Rocket Companies today. We are in the hottest real estate market in more than a decade and demand is accelerating. March and April have been the strongest months of purchase application volume in our company's history. The simple fact is the home buying process is extremely complicated. It involves multiple professionals, including real estate agents, title companies and local mortgage brokers. All of this complexity has led to home buying being one of the last transactions to make the move online. It has also created an extremely fragmented market where no company has been able to grab significant national market share. We were the second largest retail purchase lender in 2020, excluding the secondary market of correspondent lending. And that was with only low single digit penetration in the purchase market. Today, I am proud to announce that Rocket Mortgage has set a goal to become the number one retail home purchase lender in America over the next 24 months. Said differently, we are poised to transform the entire home buying experience. Only Rocket Companies can combine digital home search and our powerful Rocket Cloud Force, with tens of thousands of relationships with real estate agents and Rocket Pro TPO brokers, while fully integrating mortgage, appraisal, title and digital closing. Core to this growth strategy is Rocket Homes, our home search experience and real estate agent referral network. While others in the market have figured out how to display MLS listings online, we started with the most complicated and profitable steps in the home purchase process, the financing and the title work. From there, we built a full featured, industry leading home search product at Rocket Homes. As we built nationwide coverage over the last year, traffic to Rocket Homes real estate listings platform has increased substantially, growing over 300% year-over-year in the first quarter. Once consumers find their dream home, they are staying within the Rocket Homes ecosystem and connecting with our Rocket Homes partner agent. In fact, connections to Rocket Homes agents were up 50% year-over-year in Q1. Real estate agents play a critical role in the home buying process and we are providing powerful tools to help our agent partners in today's competitive market. Late last year, we launched Rocket Pro Insight, which allows any real estate agent to gain unprecedented access to their clients' mortgage, with the clients' permission, of course. This first of its kind solution provides visibility, control and tools for real estate agents to present more competitive offers and close deals faster. The number of real estate agents who've signed up for Rocket Pro Insight has more than tripled in just three months, with more than 45,000 agents using Rocket Pro Insight, up from 14,000 at the end of the year. Another new program that is quickly becoming a favorite of real estate agents and their clients is our overnight underwrite. This program guarantees that if a client submits their paperwork for a purchase application by 7:00 p.m., they will receive a fully verified approval by morning. Local mortgage brokers are another extremely important component of our purchase strategy. We continue to invest in the broker channel and have earmarked tens of millions of dollars in technology investment in 2021. Our continued innovation in the broker space is paying off. In March alone, Rocket Pro TPO signed up hundreds of new partners, marking one of the strongest months of partner growth in our company's history. At Rocket Companies, we've built a flexible platform that can shift to the areas of greatest opportunity, including today's explosive real estate and automotive markets. These markets present an enormous opportunity for us to acquire clients, to drive substantial lifetime value. Our ability to retain clients at a rate exceeding 90% is matched only by some of the best performing subscription business models in the world. We will continue to operate this business with a focus on the long term based on the lifetime value of our clients with the knowledge that once added to our ecosystem, these clients will continue to add revenue in the months, years and decades to come. We are excited about the opportunities ahead of us in the second quarter and beyond, as our team continues to deliver on technology and great service that helps us win today and long into the future. With that, I'll turn things over to Julie. Julie? Julie talked about some of the gain on sale in her remarks, in particular, how strong our direct to consumer data on sale remains. As we think about Q1, one of the great things that happened for our business is we saw the 10 year treasury go from 90 basis points, I think, up to a high of 170 basis points. So what was expected to take over a year or two to occur kind of all happened in about a 90 day period of time. So adjustments have to be made, but that's where our platform really kicks in. And as Julie touched on, we're almost back to where we traditionally have been where 50% of our originations are not rate sensitive. And so the acceleration in those things so quickly was incredibly exciting. And we're watching our retention climb as well, north of 90%, now 91%. So you're going to see us be strategic around gain on sale. And we talk about this a lot, the margins, although moving back to more historical averages, are incredibly strong. But what we think about is not just that margin for the first transaction what we're thinking about is the lifetime value of every client that we acquire. And if you hear us talk about the massive growth in Rocket Homes, Rocket Auto and as we continue to add additional fulfillment businesses to our platform, the value of that acquired client will continue to grow as well. So it's much like the discussions, I think we had, Arren, back kind of during the IPO process when we were talking about setting a strategy over the course of two or three years, really arriving at what the true lifetime value of the client is and then continuing to execute on those strategies to bring those clients into our servicing book, so we can monetize them for years to come. So our big focus and I'm really proud of the growth we had in Q1 compared to Q1 of '20 and Q1 of '19, over $100 billion of closed loan volume, that's all coming into the top of the funnel, and we'll monetize that over time. I'll let Julie maybe go just a bit more specifics. But really important to at least understand how we're thinking about that, which is, of course, it's profitable right now to bring those clients into our platform. But it's even more profitable than it looks on paper because of the lifetime value that we subscribe to each one of those clients. Julie? So we've been investing in this ecosystem for quite a few years now. And the reason we've set the goal here in the next 24 months because all of those important components and the millions of dollars of tech spend are really starting to pay off. I know I touched on the fact that on our Rocket Homes platform, which is an incredibly robust MLS listings platform. We now are covering 49 to 50 states and I think we'll be into Hawaii in a matter of days or weeks. That growth year-over-year is up 300%, and that matters because what do you do with that. Well, it drives mortgage volume, but it's also driving real estate volume. So our agent connections, taking those clients that are interested in finding homes and aligning them with an agent, that was up 50% year-over-year, and we're making significant investments in that process and technology to keep accelerating that. So what does that do? Well, that allows us to capture revenue on the real estate side, on the mortgage side, on the title side. And so not only are you getting those additional revenue streams you just touched on but it's also driving up conversion. And especially in a market like we're experiencing right now where inventory is so light, we've got to make those connection points where our client comes in, top of the funnel, finds a house, gets connected with an agent, gets a verified approval, in our cases now we're offering our overnight underwrite, so the agent can write an offer, 6:00 p.m. on a Tuesday, they wake up Wednesday morning, they're fully approved. So our clients can get cash buyers. So we can drive up those conversion rates and so we can grab that volume. And so that's additional volume we'll be adding to the platform as we continue to invest now in marketing all the purchase services that we've got. And I know I mentioned this to the 45,000 agents we now have on the RHI platform that we built, the Rocket Pro Insights platform that our agents use. So all of those things kind of will bring additional revenue, but also increased conversion. And then the last component I'll say to that, and Julie is talking about the E-Trade partnership, we've referenced before our Realtor.com partnership. As that conversion rises, our ability to lean in and participate in the purchase, lead and advertising markets grows. Because we can spend more than others can spend because our conversion rates are far greater than the industry average. So that's a virtuous kind of flywheel that we are building right now that will play a very important role here as we go through '21 and into '22. Maybe I'll start with the margin piece, and Julie can jump in here, too. But we're kind of back to some of the historical longer term margins that we've experienced, which on our platform are still very profitable, number one, in the first transaction. But again, to some of the other comments that I made, it's also the additional or the lifetime value. Now there's been some changes in particular in the broker market that I think are very interesting. Our focus here is to solve the problem of our client. If a client needs to buy a house, how can we develop technology and service to assist them. If a broker wants to grow their business, how can we provide technology, marketing, et cetera, to assist them. Others have kind of focused on solving their own problems, I think, versus the brokers problems. It's interesting what's happened because through that our partnership with the brokers that we've got in that part of our partnership channel has strengthened. So the volumes that they're setting us are increasing. And so if you think about the lifetime value, certainly in the direct to consumer channel, that's well understood. But in the broker channel, you might say to yourself, well, each time a loan comes in that broker's thinking, hey, where should I send it? But as choice gets eliminated and our partnership with that broker gets stronger, our ability to monetize and work with that broker partner in the years to come to drive more lifetime value from those relationships, increases as well. So we're excited about what we're seeing in the broker channel. We're really excited about what we're seeing in the direct to consumer channel. And so we spend our time thinking about the lifetime value more than probably the day-to-day margin that we might experience on the first loan. And I know I referenced this before, but I'm going to say it again. I think we saw growth in auto, up 60% to 65% from Q1 of last year to Q1 of this year, and that's with very tight inventory. We're in a very unique spot. I mean, there's an article every day, written about how there's no auto inventory, yet we're growing. We saw growth in the homes channel. We're seeing growth in our loans channel. So all of that has to be factored into our LTV decision. And we're going to keep doing that, because once we capture that base and we continue to add these fulfillment engines to the bottom of our funnel, we're fully building out the platform that we've been on a mission to build out for years here. So doesn't mean will -- and this is where Julie will jump in. It doesn't mean we won't be thoughtful about the margin day to day, and I think that's evidenced by where we are right now, and we're north of 400 basis points on our DTC. But it's critical that we think about the future and where we're headed and the millions of clients we're adding to our platform and how they're going to stay with us. I mean that's the long game that we're playing. So I don't think we break down the specifics here, but I'll give you some context. And then we talk about debt consolidation all the time, that really falls into two buckets, and we're watching this increase substantially as we get into 2021. I mean spending, as we all know, is very strong in a variety of areas and that's causing debt to be accumulated. Credit card debt, second mortgage debt, our home equity line debt, all things that we can consolidate, we were talking about the rise in home prices, it's created a scarcity in terms of homes available but it's also created one of the greatest increases in home equity we've seen like 15 or 20 years. So it's a it's a really strong positive combination for us. I think we're very well positioned, and this goes back to our data science team. We have 220 million records. We talk to millions of people a month, understanding their debt load. We can model out where they were a year ago and then also model out where they will be in the future, creating all kinds of opportunity to balance out the equity in their home, with the debt that they're building, and we can consolidate that. So that's a huge piece of our business. We've been executing on that for years. And as Julie referenced, well be seeing that come back to kind of levels that it had been at in years prior. We called out purchase, because we're the second largest retail purchase lender in the country. So you can kind of use those numbers to triangulate where we're at, and we're going to number one. So it plays an important role. And I already touched on this, how are we going to get to number one? Well, we're combining all of these disparate experiences from MLS to realtors, to mortgage brokers, to title, to appraisal. All of this hard work we've been doing on this tech platform behind the scenes is really starting to come together. The other exciting part, I know I touched on this, is now taking all of that data and merging it together. So we can watch and learn every step of the process, what is happening to that client, where are the fall off points, where can we increase conversion, how do we modify our process. So that's the tech platform. And the tech platform is in the early innings compared to where it will eventually be with that data sharing across all of these different fulfillment businesses we're building. Here's our mission. At the end of the day, we should be able to look out at every American and target market or have a specific message and specific value to every single American about how we can help them either improve on their home, save money in some way, shape or form, buy a car, or help them with the real estate transaction. And when you put those things together, that's 30% of the US GDP that we're talking about here. So that's our vision. That's the platform we're building to play a major role in almost a third of the GDP here in the United States of America. And those are all the critical pieces that we've been building for years under kind of the hood. And I think this AutoFi partnership is really critical, because it's an important component. We've added to really grow that inventory and our reach into different dealerships, is that auto business that we're building is far different than almost anybody else. We're really just connecting and conducting the sale, and now we get the option to connect the financing between dealer and consumer. And so we can really be the marketplace. So I'm excited about that as well. So I am not sure I've answered all of your questions, but that's the vision of where we're headed here. And the last thing I'll say is all surrounded or wrapped in $1 billion in a multibillion dollar brand that has the highest client service ratings in the country. So we don't have to convince people what Rocket is all about. They know that it's a high quality experience. And so as we add these additional services, we believe that the conversion rates will be quite high because people are already conditioned to jump in and take advantage of those services. I'll jump in on the volume question. I know when we are thinking about where we came out of Q1, over $100 billion the guidance we provided for Q2. Keeping in mind that we've got thousands and thousands of approved homebuyers. And so hopefully, as more inventory opens up, that will accelerate some of the purchase transactions that are kind of currently in waiting mode. But we feel very good about where we are in Q2 and looking forward into the future and seeing volumes in a very similar range. And we had a huge year last year. I expect to have a very good year this year from a volume perspective. And so you can keep that in mind as you think about our capital needs here as we get through the rest of the year. Julie? I think there's probably two ways to view that. I think you're right. The flexibility of our platform really allows us to move to the most profitable loan that we'll bring in. And again, as we touched on, not only the first time around but thinking about the lifetime value of that client. And so you'll keep watching and seeing us do that. Also considering the investments that we are making long term in purchase now, as we've touched on Rocket Homes, we've touched on the listing site, we've touched on the reator network. I know in calls past, I've talked about providing other opportunities for sellers and buyers through for sale by owner and other projects that we're working on. The insights network that we're building that now has 45,000 plus real estate agents on that, the technology that we're investing there to give them the visibility, the communication, the transparency into the loan. All of those are significant investments into purchase. And so although we will keep adjusting the levers to make sure we're maximizing our opportunity, I think you'll see us keep the accelerator pedal on purchase as well, because we're making substantial investments now to continue to see that channel grow. There's been a few adjustments here in the last month or so. I think we're in a great position, and Bob Walters can touch on this. I think the first big example of this was our smart jumbo that we rolled out about 30 or 45 days ago and the securitization there. And so our capital markets group is incredibly sophisticated. Their ability to execute on those securitizations has also given us this opportunity to move forward into other products, whether they be second home or vacation homes or other things where the agencies may be putting limits, we can jump in and continue to grow those channels with high quality products and deliver them in the secondary market. Bob, I don't know if you have additional comments. Well, obviously, these companies are separate companies. And I can tell you they've got a team of crack attorneys, ensuring that everything that we do is at a proper arms length transaction. As you can think about it, and I'm not going to go into a RESPA educational seminar here. But our clients have choice every step of the manner, or every step of the way. Now with all the services we provide and the technology we provide, it's understandable that their choice is to work with a company that can bring all of these things together. But we feel very good about the footing that we're on in terms of understanding Respa and our ability to navigate that while growing this channel. And also to your other comment about centralized lenders and their ability to crack the nut here. If you really think about this, real estate agents want certainty. They've worked hard, they want a loan to get closed. And so I don't believe that it's about the location of the lender. I believe it's about the certainty the lender can provide. With our thousands and thousands of third party brokers out there, if the agent is best suited to have somebody who can walk right in their office, we've got that broker partner for them, we publish that broker on our Web site, we provide great technology to that broker, and we're happy to have the agent work that way. If agent prefers to work with us in our centralized Rocket Mortgage platform, that's great, too. And that's why we're making such a large investment in the communication, in the visibility, in the transparency, in the overnight underwrite, all of the things that bring certainty to those agents, so they can have confidence that we're closing those loans. And that's probably the second largest purchase lender in the country and growing. So I don't think it's centralized or decentralized. I think it's just [RU], and I go back to that comment I made. Do you understand the problem and are you solving that problem for your client, whether it's the broker or the agent or the end consumer. And that's the mission that we're on. That's why our product strategy team is now hundreds deep working these hard problems, teaching every day to make sure that we're delivering where others don't. And the last thing, I'll make a comment on that. That's exactly why we take this long term view. Rates are going to go up, rates are going to go down. Probably in December, nobody had said to themselves, I bet you the 10 year treasury is going from 90 to 100 to 170 basis points. But it did. You cannot get distracted on the day to day movements of the 10 year treasury note. You have to have your plan of how you're going to grow market share over the years by bringing real value to your consumer, whether that be the broker, the agent, the client and you've got to execute on that plan. And so that's exactly what we're doing, that's what we'll continue to do. And I think the proof has been over the course of many decades, staying that course will mean that we can honor that commitment of being the largest purchase [owned] in the country here in the next 24 months. Well, we're very active in the M&A space. We're always looking for bolt on opportunities and those types of things that can help us grow our platform. And I use the word platform in an important manner. As you probably sense from my previous comments, the real mission is what's best for the consumer, what does the consumer want, what experience can we provide them that gives them the most certainty in that transaction? Any transaction with friction, home buying is one that we're very deep into. But now we're getting into auto, personal loans, how do we remove that friction. And so if there's a if there's an acquisition that fits into our platform that solves a problem for the consumer that currently in our current model we can't solve then that would be an acquisition that we would be looking at. We're almost -- and I said this before, almost kind of origination agnostic. It's whatever is best for the consumer that's what we will do to bring them into our platform, get the lifetime value of that consumer and make sure they have a great experience. I think what we were referencing is that over the first quarter, we've had substantial purchase application volume. And so we have thousands of clients today that are approved and they're out looking for homes. Our guidance reflects our current application volume and some of the inventory constraints that exist in the market today. And what I also was referencing is that if you look at kind of the guidance that Julie provided, and we feel great about where that's at, not only for the second quarter but as we think about the future, that guidance kind of tees us up for what should be an outstanding year on the heels of what has been record purchase volume in the first quarter. We didn't talk about the second quarter, but in the first quarter it was the most purchase application volume that we've ever had as a company. I'll directionally talk about it because it's very exciting. So as we started this business, we did not focus on our client base initially. We certainly did market research to determine our client base's propensity to purchase, understand that what we believe the conversion rates will be with our client base. But the vast majority of cars that we're selling now, which we're setting records each and every month, are not clients from the Rocket Mortgage platform. They're actually lower converting leads. And there's a reason that we've done that. We wanted to construct a business that had all of the appropriate profitability metrics before really leaning into our client base. So we've tested that enough to understand the conversion rates and what it will mean for that business as we open up our client base, but we've just started to scratch the scratch of the surface in terms of really marketing to our client base. That's why we're adding additional inventory. And we talked about the AutoFi, it's critical if we're going to open that up and generate more leads flow that we have a more robust inventory platform, so we can really provide the services that our clients deserve. So we're kind of moving from phase one to phase two, which will increase all positive things that we'll be adding here in phase two, but excellent question. Good bye."

And I think to Jay's point, our ability to securitize off our own shelf gives us a lot of latitude and flexibility in that area. So that's not disrupted us from a volume standpoint. In fact, we've had some opportunities to take advantage of that."

And with that, I'll turn things over to Jay Farner to get us started. Jay?\nJay Farner: Thanks Sharon. Good afternoon and welcome to the Rocket Companies earnings call for the fourth quarter in full year of 2022. Today we're going to recap last year's achievements and highlight how we continue to innovate to enhance the Rocket client experience. We'll also discuss how we've put key pieces of our client engagement program in place with the goal of lifting conversion and lowering our cost to acquire clients and ultimately expanding our purchase market share and extending client lifetime value. But first, I want to take a moment to talk about the leadership transition we announced a few weeks ago. As you know, on June 1st, I will be retiring from my role as CEO. The last 27 years of Rocket and in particular the last six as CEO, have been among the most rewarding experiences of my life. We've accomplished so much together as a team, and I've made many lifelong friends. With all the excellent work accomplished in 2022 and into 2023, I believe now is the right time to step aside, so I can spend more time with my family while the company continues on its journey executing on these transformational strategies. I have to thank Dan Gilbert specifically. His mentorship and friendship for nearly three decades is something I'll always appreciate. One thing is for certain I have tremendous confidence in this team's ability to continue to execute the company's strategy. We have the brightest minds in the business and the depth and breadth of our leadership team has set the bar for the industry. My confidence also stems from the fact that Bill Emerson is taking the reins as Interim CEO upon my departure. Many of you know Bill, as he served as a CEO of Rocket Mortgage for 15 years. We've remained close and he's continued to lend his advice and his counsel. He has a true passion for Rocket Companies and we will work closely together to ensure a seamless transition.  Bill, would you like to share any thoughts?\nBill Emerson: Thanks Jay. It's great to be here with everybody today. As Jay noted, I've been with Rocket for three decades, including as Chief Executive Officer of Rocket Mortgage from 2002 to 2017. I've remained engaged in the business since that time through my position as Vice Chairman of Rock Holdings, which is the majority shareholder of Rocket Companies. I'm excited to roll up my sleeves and dig in with Jay and the rest of the company's phenomenal leadership team to build on our strong foundation and continue executing at a high level while the Board conducts a search for a permanent successor. On a personal note, Jay has been a great colleague and friend, and I want to take a moment to thank him for his tremendous impact on this organization. His vision for Rocket future has created a pathway for success and positioned Rocket very well. With that, I'll hand it back to Jay.\nJay Farner: Thanks Bill. Now turning to our results. 2022 was a challenging year for the housing and mortgage industry, and one defined by rapid change. Over the past 12 months, eight increases in the Fed funds rate intended to reign in high inflation led to a sharp rise in mortgage rates. The 30-year fixed rate mortgage spiked from roughly 3% in January to more than 7% by the end of October. This represents the largest and steepest rise in roughly four decades. With the volatility and increased cost of financing, demand for rate and term refinance transactions shrink significantly while housing affordability and consumer concerns about looming recession weighed heavily on the home purchase market. Despite this backdrop, we continue to invest in innovative technology and programs to serve our clients better and to capture the immense opportunity. The mortgage industry is fragmented. The direct to consumer channel, Rocket's bread and butter from the beginning, represents the vast majority of the mortgage market. Our company has a long track record of disrupting mortgage refinance in this space and growing market share, and we believe we are well-positioned to do the same in the home purchase market, with products and ecosystem and client engagement programs that we've put in place. We believe we can grow our purchase share by delivering an engaging and differentiated client experience with the additional programs we've launched over the last 12 months, particularly to the millennial and first time home buyers who drive the industry. In fact, we've launched several significant achievements in 2022. We successfully integrated Rocket Money into the Rocket family and launched Rocket Rewards our innovative loyalty program. We unified our business under one Rocket brand and delivered a seamless Rocket accounts single sign on experience to our clients. And we will soon be expanding our credit card program include our awards card tied to home ownership. We also brought to market a broad suite of purchase focused mortgage products designed to give our clients the confidence to transact in a tough environment. Inflation Buster, which reduces a home buyer's monthly mortgage payment by one percentage point in the first year of their loan and addresses today's home affordability challenges has resonated very strongly with our clients. We then paired Inflation Buster with our Rate Drop Advantage program, which covers many of the costs to refinance in the years ahead of rates fall. I'm also proud of our initiatives to expand access to home ownership to underserved communities. In November, we introduced a conventional loan option for Americans who are interested in purchasing or refinancing a manufactured home. We also unveiled a special purpose credit program that offers credits for first time home buyers to use toward their mortgage costs available in specific census tracks in Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, Memphis, and Philadelphia. With home equity levels at record highs, we're helping existing homeowners achieve their financial goals with cash out refinance options, as well as our closed in second home equity loan product for those who are looking to tap the current equity available in their house without sacrificing the favorable interest rate on their first mortgage. Turning to the fourth quarter. We grew the number of Rocket accounts to 25.4 million as of December 31st. Rocket accounts, a key north star metric represents clients who have taken the action to create an account with us and with whom we may have the visibility on credit worthiness, spending behavior, finances, and home buying intent and more. We believe that these clients are more likely to engage and that we can craft bespoke experiences for them delivering the right offer to the right client at the right time. Rocket Money drove a significant amount of growth in Rocket accounts and had its biggest month of premium member growth in its eight year operating history in January. In addition, on January 2nd, Rocket Money took the top spot for daily downloads in the iOS app store finance category, and also reached top 10 in the overall iOS app store. In a few short months since our launch of Rocket Rewards in October, we are seeing strong client adoption and engagement. Rocket Rewards has enrolled more than 1 million clients and approximately $600,000 in point value have been redeemed, helping clients lower closing costs. This proprietary loyalty program gives our clients points for taking certain actions such as downloading a 1098 tax form, completing learning activities, and submitting mortgage applications, ultimately helping to drive engagement across the Rocket ecosystem. While it's early, we are particularly encouraged to see that the lead to close conversion rate for Rocket Rewards clients is more than double that of clients who did not use Rocket Rewards in our control population. We are expanding the rewards program based on this success, and we are excited to announce that just last month, we introduced Rocket Rewards to our 2.5 million servicing clients. Last quarter we also launched our Home Buying Plan to a select group of clients, and broader rollout is currently underway. Home Buying Plan is a guided digital experience that helps our clients prepare for home ownership and stay informed throughout their home buying journey. Clients can set home buying milestones, engage with personalized financial tools and credit building resources. They can search for their dream home and receive advice on how to stay on track to be more confident home buyers. Home Buying Plan enables us to engage with clients, providing them with help and guidance as they prepare for their next transaction. We will be launching even more Rocket exclusive initiatives to make the client purchase experience smoother and easier leading into the spring buying season. In aggregate, all of these client engagement programs help us elevate the Rocket client experience and keep our clients engaged until they're ready to purchase their dream home or refinance with Rocket. As I said before, we are uniquely positioned to help our clients through every step of the home ownership journey from the financial planning and education process well before they apply for a mortgage to searching for and the financing of their new home, as well as title and closing. It's all within the Rocket ecosystem. Let me take a moment to illustrate the Rocket client experience with this example. Our client might begin their relationship with Rocket by using Rocket Money's financial planning tools and creating a Rocket account. We identify their desire to become a homeowner and introduce the digital Rocket dashboard with Home Buying Plan. The client can bank loyalty points by joining the Rocket Rewards program, consuming content on the purchase process, as well as obtaining a verified approval letter. This is just the beginning. Rocket Homes tools put the Power of Homes search into our client's hands, making personalized recommendations on properties that meet their targeted neighborhoods, price range, and amenities. Additionally, local Rocket Homes real estate agents are available to provide personalized services when needed. Utilizing data we already have through the Rocket account, we can streamline the mortgage application process and help the client purchase and close on their first home. With our industry-leading servicing and 90%-plus retention rates, we can recapture the client through a refinance transaction when rates drop. With the full suite of Rocket products and our commitment to client service, we hope to nurture and retain the client over the course of their journey as homeowners and so they're ready for their next transaction. We believe we have an excellent opportunity to deliver a more personalized experience to each of our 25.4 million Rocket accounts. Through our client engagement programs, we believe we can lift conversion, lower our cost to acquire clients, and extend client lifetime value. Over time we believe this will translate into substantial and sustainable market share growth, particularly in purchase and growth in revenue and profitability. In 2020 and 2021 we demonstrated the ability to scale our business and deliver best-in-class client service during the refinance heavy market. As we entered 2023 with key pieces of our client engagement program now in place, we can tap our sizable and growing Rocket account space to succeed in a purchase heavy market. Our assets are unmatched in the industry, our robust capitalization, our fortress balance sheet, and our platform and ecosystem just to name a few. Most importantly, I'm grateful to our leadership team and our team member's dedication to always putting our clients first. We are executing on our strategy, and we remain focused on fulfilling our mission to be the best at creating certainty in life's most complex moments so that our clients can live their dreams. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\nBrian Brown: Thank you, Jay and good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, I'll cover our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2022. I'll talk about the actions we're taking to improve the cost structure and the investments we're making in our platform. I'll conclude by sharing our outlook for the first quarter of 2023 and discuss what we're seeing in the current environment. As you heard from Jay, the mortgage industry faced an extremely difficult environment in 2022. Rapidly rising interest rates, declining consumer confidence and challenging affordability, impacted demand for purchase in refinance mortgage products throughout the year. To put the demand headwinds in perspective, the MBA's mortgage application index drop nearly 70% in 2022, the largest inter-year drop in the history of the data set going back to 1990. At the same time demand was falling, the mortgage industry faced excess capacity. We've seen players across the industry struggle to adjust to the volatile environment facing liquidity issues, retrenching or exiting the industry altogether. Against this backdrop, Rocket Companies continued to invest and innovate. We also took significant action to adapt to the changing market. From Q4, 2021 to Q4, 2022, we reduced our expenses by $3 billion or 40% on an annualized basis, while protecting our platform investments in focusing on client lifetime value in a purchase heavy mortgage market. For the full year 2022, Rocket delivered positive GAAP net income and adjusted EBITDA. As always, we're focused on driving operational efficiency and financial profitability while investing to position the company for sustainable long-term growth. Diving a bit further into the full year results, we delivered $133 billion in closed loan volume and $4.6 billion in adjusted revenue in 2022. Our GAAP net income for the year was $700 million or $0.28 per share. We reported $59 million in adjusted EBITDA. On an adjusted net income basis, we reported a loss of $137 million or $0.07 per share. Our GAAP results include the $1.2 billion mark-to-market appreciation of our mortgage servicing right asset during 2022, which is countercyclical in a rising rate environment. Moving onto fourth quarter results. Despite challenging market conditions, Rocket's fourth quarter adjusted revenue came in at $683 million, which was above the midpoint of our guided range. As we shared last quarter, we believe the switch to revenue guidance provides the best representation of Rocket's businesses, and most closely aligns with how we manage the company. In the fourth quarter, we generated closed loan volume of $19 billion, net rate locks of $15 billion, and our gain on sale margin was 217 basis points. Inflation Buster, our promotional purchase product running through the fall and winter resonated strongly with our clients and demand for the product exceeded expectations. This higher than expected demand for Inflation Buster negatively impacted gain on sale margins in the fourth quarter. It's worth noting that since the start of the first quarter through today, we have seen gain on sale margins improve by more than 20 basis points compared to fourth quarter levels, primarily due to a shift in promotional products. As a reminder, these levels are what we have observed year-to-date and may not provide forward-looking indication into the quarter. On an adjusted net income basis, we reported a loss of $197 million or $0.10 per share. Turning to expenses. We continue to execute a discipline and prudent approach to cost management. On our last earnings call, we committed to a further reduction in total expenses from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of $50 million to $100 million, and we far exceeded that estimate, reducing expenses by $202 million during the quarter. As we shared with you on the previous call, we have taken significant action to reduce our overall cost structure, and the fourth quarter was no different. In fact, if we look at the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 on an annualized basis, we have reduced our expense base by almost $3 billion or more than 40% of total costs. While monitoring our expenses closely, we're also focused on making the right investments in our platform to grow purchase market share, and extend client lifetime value. As Jay mentioned, we had several significant accomplishments in 2022 as we put foundational pieces of our client engagement program in place. We believe we have an excellent opportunity to deliver more personalized experiences to the high value clients within our 25.4 million Rocket accounts. Rocket Money is a critical piece of our platform strategy. Growth has accelerated at Rocket Money since our initial acquisition of Truebill in December, 2021 in rebranding last year. In fact, January, 2023 was the best month ever for Rocket Money premium member growth. As I mentioned last quarter, Rocket Money provides us with a distinct competitive advantage by acquiring clients for less than a hundred dollars per client. In contrast, the mortgage industry acquires a closed client for thousands of dollars. We see tremendous opportunity to lower our client acquisition costs by acquiring clients through Rocket Money. Clients acquired through Rocket Money are focused on their finances, intend to be much earlier in their home ownership journey. We are also encouraged to see early signs of success from Rocket Rewards, which as Jay highlighted, includes enrollment that has surpassed 1 million clients in the first few months. Client point redemptions in excess of $600,000 in very promising early lead to close conversion improvements. Our goal is to engage with a large and growing basic clients, particularly potential home buyers at a lower cost of acquisition with better conversion levels, using our industry-leading net retention rates to drive higher client lifetime value, ultimately positioning us to succeed in a purchase driven mortgage market. Overall, we believe the ability to provide these clients with a fully integrated experience early in their homeownership journey and throughout their lifetime as homeowners will be a game changer in our industry. Turning to our balance sheet. Rocket's financial strength is a major strategic advantage for us. We ended the fourth quarter with $3.3 billion of available cash and $6.9 billion of mortgage servicing rights. Together these assets represent a total of $10.2 billion of value on our balance sheet. Our $3.3 billion of available cash consists of $722 million of cash on the balance sheet and an additional $2.6 billion of corporate cash used to self-fund loan originations. Total liquidity stood at approximately $8.1 billion as of December 31st, including available cash plus undrawn lines of credit and or undrawn MSR lines. As of December 31st, our mortgage servicing portfolio included 2.5 million clients with $535 billion in unpaid principle. We also drive considerable recurring revenue from mortgage servicing. During the fourth quarter, we generated $371 million of cash revenue from our servicing book, which represents approximately $1.5 billion on an annualized basis. Net client retention remained over 90% in the fourth quarter, well above the industry average. Looking at the trends we're seeing in the first quarter, consumers remain concerned about a potential recession and rates continue to be volatile and sensitive to economic indicators. Despite this, for the first quarter, we expect adjusted revenue to be in the range of $700 million to $850 million, driven by an increase in production and improved margins compared to the fourth quarter. Regarding operating expenses, we expect Q1 to be relatively consistent with Q4, with a slight increase on an absolute basis, primarily as a result of seasonal items such as payroll taxes, and 401(k) resetting and higher variable expenses associated with increased production in revenue. It is worth noting that the expense total for Q1, 2023 is expected to be roughly 30% less than the Q1, 2022 figure. Looking ahead, we will continue to be diligent in managing expenses as we continue to monitor the macro environment with an eye towards profitability. As always, our forward looking guidance is based on our current outlook invisibility. Despite a challenging environment in 2022, we are proud of what we achieved as an organization and advanced our ability to serve our clients better in 2023 with key pieces of our platform in place to gain share in the purchase market and extend client lifetime value. With that, we're ready to turn it back over to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Kevin Barker with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nKevin Barker: Thank you for taking my questions. I just wanted to follow up on, you obviously have been impacted by the refi market and rates and everything associated with it has been really, really tough across the industry as well. I mean, what are you doing that is going to really accelerate the diversification of revenue, particularly in the next six to 12 months, given we've seen gain on sale in mortgage volumes come under quite a bit of pressure just given the rate environment.\nJay Farner: Yeah. Thanks Kevin. It's Jay. Certainly that's something that we think about each and every day and we have been thinking about it, especially the last 12 months. And I think if I'll point back to a lot of our prepared remarks, we have been focused on strengthening our ability to cut through what is a very challenging marketing and acquisition model in mortgage. So, you might say, well, diversify even more into other products, but actually what we're seeing right now is because so many others are coming out of the space, we can go through Wells Fargo, JP Morgan, Chase, USAA, Blend, Compass, Mr. Cooper, Flagstar, I mean mortgage company and bank after bank has pulled back from the mortgage space. So, there is an opportunity to actually grow market share in the mortgage space and purchase in particular, but you've got to bring down the cost to acquire the client, you've got to incur -- increase conversion rate. And so, as we went through the prepared remarks, the work with our Home Buying Plan, the work with the Inflation Buster, I think I referenced that there are other very unique products that will be launched here shortly, will launch or the mention I made of a credit card that will help homeowners in particular with rewards, the strong growth of our rewards program. Over a million clients already signed up early tests showing that we're doubling the conversion rate there. All of that will allow us to grow market share in the purchase category as others come away. And when we prioritize where our tech resources, our sales resources, and our marketing resources should be, we feel very strongly that grabbing that purchase market share is our best place to focus. Because as we know, with a 90% retention rate, as rates move around, tick up, tick down, people take cash out, will recapture that client again and maximize lifetime value. So, doesn't mean we're not focused on Rocket Loans, doing great stuff with Rocket Loans when it comes to personal loans, solar financing, auto financing, but we see a very big opportunity right now, as the mortgage market seems even more fragmented than it's been in the past to lean in and grab that market share.\nKevin Barker: Yeah. It seems like a quite a bit of opportunity just given the headwinds across the industry. I mean, do you feel -- I mean, some of the things that you're putting in place obviously take time to develop as you start to build out and deploy into your customer base and others. But do you feel like there's an opportunity to accelerate some of that diversification via M&A or some other type of strategic initiative?\nJay Farner: Well, as you mentioned, I think some of the teams do take time, and that's why we have prioritized the work to be so focused, and I'm so proud of the team and how much they've rolled out in the last six months. And that was the decision. Do you go into other non-mortgage products or do we redirect our tech resources into these areas that can help accelerate mortgage? And that's a decision that we've made. So that will reduce the timeframe for us in particular. But you're right. Purchase, we could be doing a lot of great work right now with purchase clients at the top of the funnel building rewards. And it may take four or five, six months for those clients to actually work their way through the funnel to buy a home. But we can see that progress, we can track that progress. And the more they bank those rewards, the more that we know they are going to be a client that will close with us. And so, I think as we get into the spring, we'll probably be able to provide even more visibility as we watch clients kind of work their way through that funnel.\nKevin Barker: Thank you, Jay.\nJay Farner: And M&A, we're very active there. We're always looking, but we always want to make sure we're making the right investments that provide a unique opportunity to grow market share, not just kind of buy something that, that we already have, quite honestly, under our own umbrella.\nKevin Barker: Yeah. Thank you Jay, and I wish you the best of luck in retirement. Thank you.\nJay Farner: Thanks. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Next we'll go to James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Blake Netter [ph] on the line for James. Thanks for taking my questions. So, one thing we're interested in drilling down, and two is, how do you size the benefits of some of the investments you've been making to the platform to drive client engagement such as Rocket Money and Rocket Rewards? So far, are you seeing any tangible improvements in customer retention and new customer acquisition rates?\nJay Farner: Yeah. I think we touched on before some of the improvements we've made to Rocket Money, in particular, I think Brian mentioned this, our cost to acquire a client has now dropped to our $100 far different than where most people sit to acquire a mortgage client. And so, tying that client into the Home Buying Plan, the rewards plan will help bring them through the funnel. We touched on the fact that here in January, Rocket Money was rated the number one app in the iOS system, something they've been focused on achieving for quite some time, but it's the heavy focus on making that product special, making it great that allowed us to achieve that. I actually got top 10 overall for app downloads in January. So, we're seeing the top of the funnel widen. And then we're starting to see the more kind of middle of that funnel, we referenced the rewards program or the early test we've now done show a doubling of conversion. And as I mentioned before, there will be additional programs we're rolling out here in the spring and probably in the next call, we'll be able to share more information around how we're seeing those conversion rates increase. All of that will allow us to rethink the cost to acquire a client, in particular, a purchase client. And I think one other exciting thing that we're watching is the pairing up of our Rocket Homes preferred agents with our Rocket Mortgage program and how that's assisting in conversion rate increase, and we'll probably be touching on that more here in the future as well.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Great. And then just a quick follow-up from me. How much success have you guys had in adding new partners to the TPO network, given some of the competitive pricing dynamics we've seen in the wholesale space and some of the irrational pricing behavior we've seen from competitors?\nJay Farner: Yeah. That's a very interesting space. As you know, Mike Fawaz and the team have done a wonderful job, really proud of his work the last few months. It's resonating with brokers and it's a very fluid space. We track how many partners are coming in. We've tracked for many partners are leaving others. And as you really articulated, those brokers are very price sensitive. And so, you'll watch kind of partners move from partner-to-partner. We've talked about this. Bob Walters, the President or the CEO of the Mortgage business has talked about this a lot. That's the superpower of a mortgage broker, the ability to pick and choose who they work with to give themselves an advantage. And as you know, we stand firmly behind providing that superpower. So, we're onboarding new TPO partners all the time and we think that's the right way to approach that market.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. \nRyan Nash: Hi. Good evening everyone. Maybe to start off Jay or Brian, so I would say despite outstanding expense performance, it seems the business is still losing a few hundred million a quarter. And Brian, based on the revenue guide and the color you provided on expenses, it sounds like that's likely to continue. So, maybe if you could just talk about the strategy in place to return to profitability, when do you foresee this happening? And Jay, maybe just talk a little bit about how you think about the trade-off on continuing to lose money and continuing to make investments in the business versus further rationalization in terms of improving the profitability of the company? And I have a follow-up.\nJay Farner: Yeah. Look, I think the team has done an incredible job this year of reducing expenses. It's easy to sit on these calls and talk about expense reduction. The real work is the hundreds and hundreds of leaders inside the organization have to go through that process. And when Brian talks about taking billions and billions of expenses out we've accomplished that in nine months. And so my hat's off to him and to the entire team in achieving that. I think if we go back, at least the 27 years I've been here, and especially when I took over as CMO and then CEO, our focus was the direct to consumer channel. And our focus was doing something different that no one had done before being excellent in every category from marketing to outreach to conversion, our banker force being the best of the best, and that worked. And we scaled refinance in particular to levels that no one has ever seen. When you hear us talking about the rewards program and the home buying program and the Rocket Dashboard and the servicing and the Rocket Money and Rocket Homes, these are a lot of moving parts, far more complicated than refinance. Absolutely. On one side, it's taking us longer to achieve it because it's far more complicated. On the other side, the barrier to entry for anyone else to do this type of work, I don't see it happening. And that work, it's those inches. It's one tenth of the conversion rate increase over here and one twentieth of a conversion increase over there, but they all add up to allow us to have the same success in purchase direct to consumer that we had in refinance. And so yes, we've invested some money these last six, seven months in particular to achieve that. But I have all the confidence that, that will result in our ability to scale, purchase the same way that we've scaled refinance and will lead to a very profitable and successful organization. So that's where our focus is, and we're just -- we're taking the same scientific approach that we took to refinance, and we're applying it now to purchase more complicated, taking longer. But I think it's a proven thing that can work and Brian, you may jump in.\nBrian Brown: Yeah. Thanks Ryan. I think to Jay's point, profitability is a priority. And you can see it in the expense numbers, but we're not here to sacrifice long-term results. As you know, you've been with us a long time. We've been a private company long before we were a public company and we're not interested in sacrificing to hit a short-term number. 40% of the expenses came out last year. If you need any more proof that we're focused on it, we more than doubled what we said we'd do in the fourth quarter, we accelerated some of our expense items. So, it's definitely something the management team is focused on. But as we sit here in the first quarter with the guide that you mentioned, and we're on the forefront of the home buying season, we feel really good what we've done in terms of the cost structure.\nRyan Nash: Got it. I appreciate the color. And then maybe just as a follow-up, I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks that you expect volumes are improving in the first quarter. Maybe just talk about what is driving that. And then more broadly, can you maybe just talk about Jay, you've touched on purchased a couple of different ways. Can you maybe just talk about the actual strategies in place that you think are going to inevitably drive purchase volume? And how do you think about some of these newer products, whether it's Inflation Buster, home equity and some of the others that -- when do we start to see these things having a meaningful impact on the volumes of -- in the actual mortgage business? Thanks.\nJay Farner: Yeah. Well, it's an interesting market that we're in. And you've watched a lot of folks trying a variety of things, especially in the second half of 2022. When I think about the purchase market, and I've touched on this a few times already, I think about the entire funnel. If you were to walk into my office, you see on a whiteboard a giant funnel, I'm always kind of adjusting and rethinking, it starts with all of the marketing partnerships we've got, but also our opportunity to market directly to consumers. It works through our Rocket Homes network of agents, which is incredibly strong and getting stronger. The reason that's happening is because when purchases were so strong in 2021 and 2022, the beginning of 2022, most agents had enough business to kind of deal with. Now agents are hungry for verified clients, we are the provider of those verified clients. So, the dynamic between the mortgage business and agents is changing, which will, I think, benefit us greatly. And then you'll kind of watch the different solutions we can offer to allow people to get prepared to buy. One of the complexities of a purchase lead that's different than a refinance lead is that it's hard to help someone find a perfect house. And so, we can be there. We can be engaging with the client, but we've got to be there on that Saturday afternoon when they see that house. And if you look back over time, usually who they're there with is their agent. And so their agent may have a mortgage company that they like to work with. So with this network of agents that our team, Doug Seabolt, [indiscernible] have been growing out and solidified in these last six months and in the rewards program. So now our clients look and say, wait a second, I've already built $850 towards my closing fees with Rocket. I've got a verified approval. And I'm working with a preferred Rocket agent, they're sitting there on a Saturday. Now the only call or text or e-mail comes directly to us, not to another mortgage company. And so, I imagine as we get into the spring, in summer, we're going to see the continued increase in conversion and all of that ties back both in Rocket Homes ability to market, but also Rocket Mortgage's ability to market. The last thing I'll say, and I can only touch on a little bit. Now imagine a credit card, where every day you're spending in doing things, and that spending allows you to build rewards to help you buy your next home. All of these factors working together really gives us a strategic advantage. I know you want to know, hey, Jay, tell me in what month you -- all I'm saying is all of these things working together we feel very confident will allow us to apply the same marketing spend, the same creativity to drive this engagement and really grow purchase market share significantly.\nRyan Nash: Appreciate all the color and best luck of your retirement, Jay.\nJay Farner: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go to Mark DeVries with Barclays. Your line is open.\nMark DeVries: Yeah. Thanks. I had a follow-up question from Ryan's line of question around expenses. Look, I mean, I'm trying to get a better sense of how your thinking is evolving and may continue to evolve for the environment here. I mean, you clearly did even more than you guided to on expense take-outs this quarter, but it's also a very deeply cyclical business, so I appreciate, not necessarily managing to getting to breakeven or profitable at what might be the trough of the cycle for fear that you cut so much that you don't participate on as much as you would like on the upside. So, how should we think about if mortgage rates remain really high and volumes persistently muted what else you can do? Or should we expect you to continue at this level of activity to lose money and not take out more expenses?\nBrian Brown: Yeah. I guess, Mark, the way I think about that is revenue and the production of the business are going to be the North Star. And we try to structure the cost basis around that. But in any particular quarter, that's not necessarily what we're focused on. We're focused on setting up the business for success over the long-term. As we think about capacity, we feel like we're in a good spot right now. We feel like we're ready for the home buying season. If that doesn't cooperate or if the macroeconomic backdrop doesn't do what we expect it to do, there are other levers that we can pull. But the way we think about it internally and the way we spend our time focused on it is we plan for multiple scenarios. And the acceleration of that expense take-out in Q4 was really because the revenue in the backdrop wasn't cooperating like we had hoped. So, we'll continue to revisit that on a quarterly and monthly basis, but the decisions we make will be for the long-term.\nJay Farner: Yeah. And I'm going to add something to that. I think it's important, Bill sitting here to my left. But Bill and I have worked together for over a quarter of a century and for a long period of time as CEO and President of the company, and we did a nice job of kind of dividing and conquering around innovation, creativity, marketing and execution. And so, Brian is doing a wonderful job of thinking about the expenses. But it all comes with this backdrop of we have now -- our thousands of people have been building and building these programs that are so important to us to capture purchase market share. And you can run the numbers a few percentage point increases and we really like where the company is at. And Bill Emerson specializes in execution. We have [indiscernible] innovation is rewarded, but execution is worshiped. And so my confidence level of Bill stepping in, rallying the team and executing on these final components of what we've spent so much time investing in, it's exciting. I just -- I've seen them do it for 27 years, and I just know what he's capable of. And we've laid these great kind of -- all the tracks have been laid to achieve this now. So, I appreciate the concern around the expenses. Those are all good questions, and Brian's doing do a wonderful job of managing them. But I'm more excited about the opportunity for revenue growth because of the hard work that the team has been doing here. Now it's one thing to get distracted by a very tough market, nothing to put your hand [technical difficulty].\nSharon Ng: Operator, you can take the next question.\nOperator: Okay. We'll take our next question from Kyle Joseph with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nKyle Joseph: Good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to focus on margins and the outlook for 2023. Obviously, it sounds like 4Q was pressured by Inflation Buster. But as we think about kind of the supply and demand dynamics in the industry, kind of the mix shift towards purchase as well. And I would guess that there's still ongoing demand for Inflation Buster. But just how you're thinking about margins in 2023 from a high level basis, maybe versus the fourth quarter of 2022 and then the full year of 2022.\nBrian Brown: Yeah. So, margins at 217 in Q4, to your point there was really two things going on. One was -- it's important to note that the 10-year peaked I think in October. So, affordability was clearly a concern. So, there's no doubt that when rates are moving and whipsawing back and forth, that impacts the consumer sentiment that impacts consumer confidence. And in some cases, that's the right thing to do at that point is to get that client in the loan in the budget that they can afford. So that impacts gain on sale margin. And then the second thing, which is related is the promotional product Inflation Buster, and it's a great product for this market. And the good news, Inflation Buster performed better than we had expected, which added to some of that pressure. But as we look forward to Q2, we're seeing margins through the first, call it, two-thirds of the quarter, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, 20 basis points, more than 20 basis points better. Some of that's due to the shift in mix, some of that's due to Inflation Buster continuing to perform well. But as Jay has talked a lot about, we launched rewards. We're seeing clients redeem rewards. We're seeing more diversification in purchased products. We have some things on the horizon that we're excited to talk about. And we've seen some relief from a price competitive standpoint too. Jay mentioned all the people that have exited mortgage recently, and we're starting to see that flow through and gain on sale margins. I'm not going to comment much beyond the first quarter here, but all of that is considered in the guide. And when we guided up in revenue that was largely because of an improvement in margins and an improvement in production.\nKyle Joseph: That's helpful. Thank you. And then a follow-up, just on Rocket Money and kind of the acceleration of growth you're seeing there. Would you attribute that to -- is that a function of the rebranding? Or is that a function of kind of more macro pressures and kind of the consumer looking to get their budget in order?\nJay Farner: Yeah. I think there's a variety of things. I certainly think that there's a renewed focus from the consumer and thinking about their budget and Rocket money is probably -- not probably is the best app as far as I'm concerned for consumers to use to achieve those goals. I also think we have an incredible team over at Rocket Money. Their ability to understand where the consumer is going, add product features that really resonate with the consumer the marketing group there, the performance marketing group is excellent, just top shelf across the board. And so that group is executing right now. And as they start thinking about tying in their work to the Home Buying Plan, where Rocket Money is attracting someone who is just starting to think about getting their finances in the right spot to buy things like cars and homes, so it dovetails perfectly into our Rocket -- or our Home Buying Plan, our rewards program, credit card and down to mortgage. I mean all of these components are coming together to allow that to happen. So that's -- those are a lot of reasons for the growth over there, but all good for our business.\nKyle Joseph: Got it. Thanks very much for answering my questions.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Doug Harter with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nDoug Harter: Thanks. Given your current liquidity picture, I guess how are you thinking about return of capital versus investment into the business?\nBrian Brown: Yeah. Thanks Doug. So, no change in terms of how we think about the capital structure and returning money to shareholders. First and foremost, it's capitalizing the business. This is a great time to clearly identify the differences between us and other companies in the space in terms of the robust capitalization that we have. Reinvesting in the business is, of course, the second prong of that capital waterfall and these platform strategies like rewards, the Home Buying Plan and the things that we've launched recently are great examples of that. To Jay's point, we're always opportunistic on the M&A front, and that's something we'll continue to be. And then finally, after that it will be returning capital to shareholders through either share buybacks, which, of course, we've done a lot of and then special dividends.\nDoug Harter: I guess, along that, how are you thinking about ways to potentially add more current coupon mortgages to the servicing book to potentially fuel future refinance opportunities?\nJay Farner: Well, we just touched on a lot of that, which is we've got to continue to grow purchase market share. I mean, that's the best way to get a current coupon, as you called it, mortgage on the book and then make sure that we capture its value later. And as we think about returning capital, a unique thing that we've got, when we think about an overall purchase transaction, you've got the mortgage revenue, we participate at Rocket Companies in the Rocket Homes real estate revenue. If we do things right, there's an opportunity to participate in title revenue and appraisal revenue. And so, as we move forward, you'll probably see us talk about the full package, which can create a better experience for the consumer, but also have greater revenue opportunities for us which is different than most of our competitors, allowing us to bring more of those purchase plans on board at a higher interest rate and then giving them the Rocket Dashboard, the Rocket -- a proposed credit card, a rewards program that keep them in our servicing funnel. Our refinance retention is excellent. Our purchase retention is good. But when we talk about all these additional touch points, we can drive that retention rate up as well. So that's a lot of great work is being done to ensure that, that happens.\nDoug Harter: Great. Thank you.\nJay Farner: Yeah.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Arren Cyganovich with Citi. Your line is open.\nArren Cyganovich: Thanks. I was wondering if you could talk about just high level what you think about the mortgage industry outlook, given the underlying dynamics are pretty challenging, folks that have very low mortgages are not likely to -- going to want to move to a larger home, they'll just stay in their home and obviously, with the rates here, the refi market is pretty tough. What are you thinking about from an outlook perspective on the origination side?\nJay Farner: Yeah. I know that I have maybe tossed out the last call or two calls ago, something like a $1.8-ish trillion market. I think some of the Fannie and Freddie and others are kind of triangulating more around that number as well. Brian talked about it earlier. When we strategize, we kind of think about two or three scenarios, and ensure that we like the direction of the organization even in a more challenged scenario. And so that's all the investment that we've been making this -- the end of 2022 and into this year has really been how do we capture market share in a more challenging scenario, certainly below $2 trillion in mortgages. And we're starting to see the continued reduction of originators. We're seeing the folks come out of the market. I know we touched on quite a few already. I think Wells Fargo said they were exiting correspondent. Flagstar has gotten out of retail, Loan Depot exited wholesale, AMERISAFE exited wholesale. So that's happening and will continue to happen because if we look at the last 25 or so minutes of this call, and we were to talk to a lot of these competitors, they don't have the strategic opportunities to grow market share the way that we do. So, even in a more challenging 2023, which -- and Brian can chime in here, I believe we will see that. We don't anticipate any sharp rate decreases coming this year. We've set ourselves up to see growth and then whether we see rates move around a bit in 2024, 2025, we can take an opportunity to refinance folks and increase the lifetime value. And the only other thing I'll comment on, and teams working on this, cash out is always surprising to me. Regardless of interest rate, mortgage in particular still is one of the best ways for people to borrow money. And so consumer spending has remained strong. People are continuing to invest in their home. They're adding on, they're making improvements. And our team has done a great job maximizing cash out. I don't think we'll see that change in 2023. I think the cash out market will still be pretty robust. Brian don't know if you have any thoughts.\nBrian Brown: Yeah. The only thing I'd add -- I guess, two things. One is we still see great engagement from first time homebuyers. And they're not exchanging a 3% note rate for a prevailing point. So, when we look at it, and as you guys know, we are one of the best in the first time homebuyer space. When we look at it, we're focused on two things. One is the consumer sentiment and the level of consumer confidence and two is the affordability. We're not having any problems qualifying consumers for mortgages these days. That's not the issue. What is the issue is when there's volatility in rates. And it impacts refinance, of course, maybe for the obvious reasons. But when the purchase lifecycle and the time to transact can take a while with inventory levels, and your monthly payment can change based on a weekly basis in today's market, that's what puts the consumer on their heels. Higher rates that are stable, we still get great engagement from homebuyers.\nJay Farner: I'm glad you brought that up because that spin, as you've noticed for us, that's been where we're leaning. We certainly can help someone who needs to sell their home and buy a new one, and we've got programs coming that will even make that better. But for us, our focus through Rocket Money, in particular, is to get to the person who is the first time home buyer. They've already said they want to do the transaction with Rocket. They want to do it online. They want to do it on their phone. And so, we're not battling some of those concerns about, can I afford the next house? Am I really moving up? It's a different conversation. And to Brian's point, we just got to -- we've got to be there. You've got to -- you saw -- so you got to hang around the hoop, we've got to be present with that consumer as they go through the three to four to five months to find the right home. And all of the programs that we've built allow us to hang around the hoop helping that client until they're ready to buy. And that's really an important -- I'm glad you brought that up, Brian. So, a very important thing to understand about us and the audience that we're reaching.\nBrian Brown: Give them the reason to engage with us throughout the process.\nArren Cyganovich: Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll take our final question from Kevin Kaczmarek with Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.\nKevin Kaczmarek: Thanks. This is Kevin on for Ryan McKeveny. From an industry-wide underwriting capacity perspective, where do you estimate the industry is in removing capacity? Are we still in the early innings? Or perhaps has the heavy lifting been done? And if we're still early, what are your expectations regarding the timing and cadence of capacity reductions and/or company closings. For instance, could it accelerate in the near-term? And lastly, related to this, is there perhaps a longer lag the cycle since so many companies generated outsized profitability in 2020 and 2021.\nJay Farner: Well, yeah, I think you did see a longer lag. Some of the work that we thought would have been done in mid to fall of 2022 dragged down and it's still happening today. There is two phases. The first phase is trying to figure out what your capacity should be as a company in mortgage, in particular. But even at that, the next question is, how can you generate lead flow you, only cut so much and then you have to have a plan to generate, to spend marketing dollar, to generate revenue to bring out -- or bring in a lead flow. And again, that's probably why you hear us spend so much of our time talking about those plans because it can only capacity cut so much. I can't speculate on where others are. My focus is more on what are others doing to invest to allow themselves to retrench, originate again and grow market share. And if not, then I think that cutting has to keep going for them. Brian, I don't know if you have any other thoughts.\nBrian Brown: Yeah. I agree. I mean, in some cases, from what we can see, the most profitable loan for some of these companies is no long. And it's up to them in terms of how they want to handle that. There's only so much cutting that can happen. But just taking it back to all the comments that we made, we're excited about these investments. We believe it positions us well to grow purchase in particular in the direct to consumer channel.\nJay Farner: Thanks for the questions.\nKevin Kaczmarek: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. That\u2019s all I had.\nJay Farner: Thank you.\nOperator: And that concludes the question-and-answer, go ahead.\nJay Farner: Go ahead, operator. Sorry.\nOperator: I'll just turn it back over to you, Jay.\nEnd of Q&A:\nJay Farner: All right. Well, I just want to thank everybody for joining us. I appreciate Bill being here. Glad to see him getting engaged, like I mentioned before, very excited to watch him help us execute on all of these great things that the team members have been working on. I appreciate everybody's hard work to get us to this point, and we've got to keep going and growing in 2023. Talk to you soon.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

            "content": "Thank you, Jay and good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, I'll cover our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2022. I'll talk about the actions we're taking to improve the cost structure and the investments we're making in our platform. I'll conclude by sharing our outlook for the first quarter of 2023 and discuss what we're seeing in the current environment. As you heard from Jay, the mortgage industry faced an extremely difficult environment in 2022. Rapidly rising interest rates, declining consumer confidence and challenging affordability, impacted demand for purchase in refinance mortgage products throughout the year. To put the demand headwinds in perspective, the MBA's mortgage application index drop nearly 70% in 2022, the largest inter-year drop in the history of the data set going back to 1990. At the same time demand was falling, the mortgage industry faced excess capacity. We've seen players across the industry struggle to adjust to the volatile environment facing liquidity issues, retrenching or exiting the industry altogether. Against this backdrop, Rocket Companies continued to invest and innovate. We also took significant action to adapt to the changing market. From Q4, 2021 to Q4, 2022, we reduced our expenses by $3 billion or 40% on an annualized basis, while protecting our platform investments in focusing on client lifetime value in a purchase heavy mortgage market. For the full year 2022, Rocket delivered positive GAAP net income and adjusted EBITDA. As always, we're focused on driving operational efficiency and financial profitability while investing to position the company for sustainable long-term growth. Diving a bit further into the full year results, we delivered $133 billion in closed loan volume and $4.6 billion in adjusted revenue in 2022. Our GAAP net income for the year was $700 million or $0.28 per share. We reported $59 million in adjusted EBITDA. On an adjusted net income basis, we reported a loss of $137 million or $0.07 per share. Our GAAP results include the $1.2 billion mark-to-market appreciation of our mortgage servicing right asset during 2022, which is countercyclical in a rising rate environment. Moving onto fourth quarter results. Despite challenging market conditions, Rocket's fourth quarter adjusted revenue came in at $683 million, which was above the midpoint of our guided range. As we shared last quarter, we believe the switch to revenue guidance provides the best representation of Rocket's businesses, and most closely aligns with how we manage the company. In the fourth quarter, we generated closed loan volume of $19 billion, net rate locks of $15 billion, and our gain on sale margin was 217 basis points. Inflation Buster, our promotional purchase product running through the fall and winter resonated strongly with our clients and demand for the product exceeded expectations. This higher than expected demand for Inflation Buster negatively impacted gain on sale margins in the fourth quarter. It's worth noting that since the start of the first quarter through today, we have seen gain on sale margins improve by more than 20 basis points compared to fourth quarter levels, primarily due to a shift in promotional products. As a reminder, these levels are what we have observed year-to-date and may not provide forward-looking indication into the quarter. On an adjusted net income basis, we reported a loss of $197 million or $0.10 per share. Turning to expenses. We continue to execute a discipline and prudent approach to cost management. On our last earnings call, we committed to a further reduction in total expenses from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of $50 million to $100 million, and we far exceeded that estimate, reducing expenses by $202 million during the quarter. As we shared with you on the previous call, we have taken significant action to reduce our overall cost structure, and the fourth quarter was no different. In fact, if we look at the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 on an annualized basis, we have reduced our expense base by almost $3 billion or more than 40% of total costs. While monitoring our expenses closely, we're also focused on making the right investments in our platform to grow purchase market share, and extend client lifetime value. As Jay mentioned, we had several significant accomplishments in 2022 as we put foundational pieces of our client engagement program in place. We believe we have an excellent opportunity to deliver more personalized experiences to the high value clients within our 25.4 million Rocket accounts. Rocket Money is a critical piece of our platform strategy. Growth has accelerated at Rocket Money since our initial acquisition of Truebill in December, 2021 in rebranding last year. In fact, January, 2023 was the best month ever for Rocket Money premium member growth. As I mentioned last quarter, Rocket Money provides us with a distinct competitive advantage by acquiring clients for less than a hundred dollars per client. In contrast, the mortgage industry acquires a closed client for thousands of dollars. We see tremendous opportunity to lower our client acquisition costs by acquiring clients through Rocket Money. Clients acquired through Rocket Money are focused on their finances, intend to be much earlier in their home ownership journey. We are also encouraged to see early signs of success from Rocket Rewards, which as Jay highlighted, includes enrollment that has surpassed 1 million clients in the first few months. Client point redemptions in excess of $600,000 in very promising early lead to close conversion improvements. Our goal is to engage with a large and growing basic clients, particularly potential home buyers at a lower cost of acquisition with better conversion levels, using our industry-leading net retention rates to drive higher client lifetime value, ultimately positioning us to succeed in a purchase driven mortgage market. Overall, we believe the ability to provide these clients with a fully integrated experience early in their homeownership journey and throughout their lifetime as homeowners will be a game changer in our industry. Turning to our balance sheet. Rocket's financial strength is a major strategic advantage for us. We ended the fourth quarter with $3.3 billion of available cash and $6.9 billion of mortgage servicing rights. Together these assets represent a total of $10.2 billion of value on our balance sheet. Our $3.3 billion of available cash consists of $722 million of cash on the balance sheet and an additional $2.6 billion of corporate cash used to self-fund loan originations. Total liquidity stood at approximately $8.1 billion as of December 31st, including available cash plus undrawn lines of credit and or undrawn MSR lines. As of December 31st, our mortgage servicing portfolio included 2.5 million clients with $535 billion in unpaid principle. We also drive considerable recurring revenue from mortgage servicing. During the fourth quarter, we generated $371 million of cash revenue from our servicing book, which represents approximately $1.5 billion on an annualized basis. Net client retention remained over 90% in the fourth quarter, well above the industry average. Looking at the trends we're seeing in the first quarter, consumers remain concerned about a potential recession and rates continue to be volatile and sensitive to economic indicators. Despite this, for the first quarter, we expect adjusted revenue to be in the range of $700 million to $850 million, driven by an increase in production and improved margins compared to the fourth quarter. Regarding operating expenses, we expect Q1 to be relatively consistent with Q4, with a slight increase on an absolute basis, primarily as a result of seasonal items such as payroll taxes, and 401(k) resetting and higher variable expenses associated with increased production in revenue. It is worth noting that the expense total for Q1, 2023 is expected to be roughly 30% less than the Q1, 2022 figure. Looking ahead, we will continue to be diligent in managing expenses as we continue to monitor the macro environment with an eye towards profitability. As always, our forward looking guidance is based on our current outlook invisibility. Despite a challenging environment in 2022, we are proud of what we achieved as an organization and advanced our ability to serve our clients better in 2023 with key pieces of our platform in place to gain share in the purchase market and extend client lifetime value. With that, we're ready to turn it back over to the operator for questions. Yeah. Thanks Ryan. I think to Jay's point, profitability is a priority. And you can see it in the expense numbers, but we're not here to sacrifice long-term results. As you know, you've been with us a long time. We've been a private company long before we were a public company and we're not interested in sacrificing to hit a short-term number. 40% of the expenses came out last year. If you need any more proof that we're focused on it, we more than doubled what we said we'd do in the fourth quarter, we accelerated some of our expense items. So, it's definitely something the management team is focused on. But as we sit here in the first quarter with the guide that you mentioned, and we're on the forefront of the home buying season, we feel really good what we've done in terms of the cost structure. Yeah. I guess, Mark, the way I think about that is revenue and the production of the business are going to be the North Star. And we try to structure the cost basis around that. But in any particular quarter, that's not necessarily what we're focused on. We're focused on setting up the business for success over the long-term. As we think about capacity, we feel like we're in a good spot right now. We feel like we're ready for the home buying season. If that doesn't cooperate or if the macroeconomic backdrop doesn't do what we expect it to do, there are other levers that we can pull. But the way we think about it internally and the way we spend our time focused on it is we plan for multiple scenarios. And the acceleration of that expense take-out in Q4 was really because the revenue in the backdrop wasn't cooperating like we had hoped. So, we'll continue to revisit that on a quarterly and monthly basis, but the decisions we make will be for the long-term. Yeah. So, margins at 217 in Q4, to your point there was really two things going on. One was -- it's important to note that the 10-year peaked I think in October. So, affordability was clearly a concern. So, there's no doubt that when rates are moving and whipsawing back and forth, that impacts the consumer sentiment that impacts consumer confidence. And in some cases, that's the right thing to do at that point is to get that client in the loan in the budget that they can afford. So that impacts gain on sale margin. And then the second thing, which is related is the promotional product Inflation Buster, and it's a great product for this market. And the good news, Inflation Buster performed better than we had expected, which added to some of that pressure. But as we look forward to Q2, we're seeing margins through the first, call it, two-thirds of the quarter, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, 20 basis points, more than 20 basis points better. Some of that's due to the shift in mix, some of that's due to Inflation Buster continuing to perform well. But as Jay has talked a lot about, we launched rewards. We're seeing clients redeem rewards. We're seeing more diversification in purchased products. We have some things on the horizon that we're excited to talk about. And we've seen some relief from a price competitive standpoint too. Jay mentioned all the people that have exited mortgage recently, and we're starting to see that flow through and gain on sale margins. I'm not going to comment much beyond the first quarter here, but all of that is considered in the guide. And when we guided up in revenue that was largely because of an improvement in margins and an improvement in production. Yeah. Thanks Doug. So, no change in terms of how we think about the capital structure and returning money to shareholders. First and foremost, it's capitalizing the business. This is a great time to clearly identify the differences between us and other companies in the space in terms of the robust capitalization that we have. Reinvesting in the business is, of course, the second prong of that capital waterfall and these platform strategies like rewards, the Home Buying Plan and the things that we've launched recently are great examples of that. To Jay's point, we're always opportunistic on the M&A front, and that's something we'll continue to be. And then finally, after that it will be returning capital to shareholders through either share buybacks, which, of course, we've done a lot of and then special dividends. Yeah. The only thing I'd add -- I guess, two things. One is we still see great engagement from first time homebuyers. And they're not exchanging a 3% note rate for a prevailing point. So, when we look at it, and as you guys know, we are one of the best in the first time homebuyer space. When we look at it, we're focused on two things. One is the consumer sentiment and the level of consumer confidence and two is the affordability. We're not having any problems qualifying consumers for mortgages these days. That's not the issue. What is the issue is when there's volatility in rates. And it impacts refinance, of course, maybe for the obvious reasons. But when the purchase lifecycle and the time to transact can take a while with inventory levels, and your monthly payment can change based on a weekly basis in today's market, that's what puts the consumer on their heels. Higher rates that are stable, we still get great engagement from homebuyers. Give them the reason to engage with us throughout the process. Yeah. I agree. I mean, in some cases, from what we can see, the most profitable loan for some of these companies is no long. And it's up to them in terms of how they want to handle that. There's only so much cutting that can happen. But just taking it back to all the comments that we made, we're excited about these investments. We believe it positions us well to grow purchase in particular in the direct to consumer channel."

            "name": "Jay Farner",
            "content": "Thanks Sharon. Good afternoon and welcome to the Rocket Companies earnings call for the fourth quarter in full year of 2022. Today we're going to recap last year's achievements and highlight how we continue to innovate to enhance the Rocket client experience. We'll also discuss how we've put key pieces of our client engagement program in place with the goal of lifting conversion and lowering our cost to acquire clients and ultimately expanding our purchase market share and extending client lifetime value. But first, I want to take a moment to talk about the leadership transition we announced a few weeks ago. As you know, on June 1st, I will be retiring from my role as CEO. The last 27 years of Rocket and in particular the last six as CEO, have been among the most rewarding experiences of my life. We've accomplished so much together as a team, and I've made many lifelong friends. With all the excellent work accomplished in 2022 and into 2023, I believe now is the right time to step aside, so I can spend more time with my family while the company continues on its journey executing on these transformational strategies. I have to thank Dan Gilbert specifically. His mentorship and friendship for nearly three decades is something I'll always appreciate. One thing is for certain I have tremendous confidence in this team's ability to continue to execute the company's strategy. We have the brightest minds in the business and the depth and breadth of our leadership team has set the bar for the industry. My confidence also stems from the fact that Bill Emerson is taking the reins as Interim CEO upon my departure. Many of you know Bill, as he served as a CEO of Rocket Mortgage for 15 years. We've remained close and he's continued to lend his advice and his counsel. He has a true passion for Rocket Companies and we will work closely together to ensure a seamless transition.  Bill, would you like to share any thoughts? Thanks Bill. Now turning to our results. 2022 was a challenging year for the housing and mortgage industry, and one defined by rapid change. Over the past 12 months, eight increases in the Fed funds rate intended to reign in high inflation led to a sharp rise in mortgage rates. The 30-year fixed rate mortgage spiked from roughly 3% in January to more than 7% by the end of October. This represents the largest and steepest rise in roughly four decades. With the volatility and increased cost of financing, demand for rate and term refinance transactions shrink significantly while housing affordability and consumer concerns about looming recession weighed heavily on the home purchase market. Despite this backdrop, we continue to invest in innovative technology and programs to serve our clients better and to capture the immense opportunity. The mortgage industry is fragmented. The direct to consumer channel, Rocket's bread and butter from the beginning, represents the vast majority of the mortgage market. Our company has a long track record of disrupting mortgage refinance in this space and growing market share, and we believe we are well-positioned to do the same in the home purchase market, with products and ecosystem and client engagement programs that we've put in place. We believe we can grow our purchase share by delivering an engaging and differentiated client experience with the additional programs we've launched over the last 12 months, particularly to the millennial and first time home buyers who drive the industry. In fact, we've launched several significant achievements in 2022. We successfully integrated Rocket Money into the Rocket family and launched Rocket Rewards our innovative loyalty program. We unified our business under one Rocket brand and delivered a seamless Rocket accounts single sign on experience to our clients. And we will soon be expanding our credit card program include our awards card tied to home ownership. We also brought to market a broad suite of purchase focused mortgage products designed to give our clients the confidence to transact in a tough environment. Inflation Buster, which reduces a home buyer's monthly mortgage payment by one percentage point in the first year of their loan and addresses today's home affordability challenges has resonated very strongly with our clients. We then paired Inflation Buster with our Rate Drop Advantage program, which covers many of the costs to refinance in the years ahead of rates fall. I'm also proud of our initiatives to expand access to home ownership to underserved communities. In November, we introduced a conventional loan option for Americans who are interested in purchasing or refinancing a manufactured home. We also unveiled a special purpose credit program that offers credits for first time home buyers to use toward their mortgage costs available in specific census tracks in Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, Memphis, and Philadelphia. With home equity levels at record highs, we're helping existing homeowners achieve their financial goals with cash out refinance options, as well as our closed in second home equity loan product for those who are looking to tap the current equity available in their house without sacrificing the favorable interest rate on their first mortgage. Turning to the fourth quarter. We grew the number of Rocket accounts to 25.4 million as of December 31st. Rocket accounts, a key north star metric represents clients who have taken the action to create an account with us and with whom we may have the visibility on credit worthiness, spending behavior, finances, and home buying intent and more. We believe that these clients are more likely to engage and that we can craft bespoke experiences for them delivering the right offer to the right client at the right time. Rocket Money drove a significant amount of growth in Rocket accounts and had its biggest month of premium member growth in its eight year operating history in January. In addition, on January 2nd, Rocket Money took the top spot for daily downloads in the iOS app store finance category, and also reached top 10 in the overall iOS app store. In a few short months since our launch of Rocket Rewards in October, we are seeing strong client adoption and engagement. Rocket Rewards has enrolled more than 1 million clients and approximately $600,000 in point value have been redeemed, helping clients lower closing costs. This proprietary loyalty program gives our clients points for taking certain actions such as downloading a 1098 tax form, completing learning activities, and submitting mortgage applications, ultimately helping to drive engagement across the Rocket ecosystem. While it's early, we are particularly encouraged to see that the lead to close conversion rate for Rocket Rewards clients is more than double that of clients who did not use Rocket Rewards in our control population. We are expanding the rewards program based on this success, and we are excited to announce that just last month, we introduced Rocket Rewards to our 2.5 million servicing clients. Last quarter we also launched our Home Buying Plan to a select group of clients, and broader rollout is currently underway. Home Buying Plan is a guided digital experience that helps our clients prepare for home ownership and stay informed throughout their home buying journey. Clients can set home buying milestones, engage with personalized financial tools and credit building resources. They can search for their dream home and receive advice on how to stay on track to be more confident home buyers. Home Buying Plan enables us to engage with clients, providing them with help and guidance as they prepare for their next transaction. We will be launching even more Rocket exclusive initiatives to make the client purchase experience smoother and easier leading into the spring buying season. In aggregate, all of these client engagement programs help us elevate the Rocket client experience and keep our clients engaged until they're ready to purchase their dream home or refinance with Rocket. As I said before, we are uniquely positioned to help our clients through every step of the home ownership journey from the financial planning and education process well before they apply for a mortgage to searching for and the financing of their new home, as well as title and closing. It's all within the Rocket ecosystem. Let me take a moment to illustrate the Rocket client experience with this example. Our client might begin their relationship with Rocket by using Rocket Money's financial planning tools and creating a Rocket account. We identify their desire to become a homeowner and introduce the digital Rocket dashboard with Home Buying Plan. The client can bank loyalty points by joining the Rocket Rewards program, consuming content on the purchase process, as well as obtaining a verified approval letter. This is just the beginning. Rocket Homes tools put the Power of Homes search into our client's hands, making personalized recommendations on properties that meet their targeted neighborhoods, price range, and amenities. Additionally, local Rocket Homes real estate agents are available to provide personalized services when needed. Utilizing data we already have through the Rocket account, we can streamline the mortgage application process and help the client purchase and close on their first home. With our industry-leading servicing and 90%-plus retention rates, we can recapture the client through a refinance transaction when rates drop. With the full suite of Rocket products and our commitment to client service, we hope to nurture and retain the client over the course of their journey as homeowners and so they're ready for their next transaction. We believe we have an excellent opportunity to deliver a more personalized experience to each of our 25.4 million Rocket accounts. Through our client engagement programs, we believe we can lift conversion, lower our cost to acquire clients, and extend client lifetime value. Over time we believe this will translate into substantial and sustainable market share growth, particularly in purchase and growth in revenue and profitability. In 2020 and 2021 we demonstrated the ability to scale our business and deliver best-in-class client service during the refinance heavy market. As we entered 2023 with key pieces of our client engagement program now in place, we can tap our sizable and growing Rocket account space to succeed in a purchase heavy market. Our assets are unmatched in the industry, our robust capitalization, our fortress balance sheet, and our platform and ecosystem just to name a few. Most importantly, I'm grateful to our leadership team and our team member's dedication to always putting our clients first. We are executing on our strategy, and we remain focused on fulfilling our mission to be the best at creating certainty in life's most complex moments so that our clients can live their dreams. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian. Yeah. Thanks Kevin. It's Jay. Certainly that's something that we think about each and every day and we have been thinking about it, especially the last 12 months. And I think if I'll point back to a lot of our prepared remarks, we have been focused on strengthening our ability to cut through what is a very challenging marketing and acquisition model in mortgage. So, you might say, well, diversify even more into other products, but actually what we're seeing right now is because so many others are coming out of the space, we can go through Wells Fargo, JP Morgan, Chase, USAA, Blend, Compass, Mr. Cooper, Flagstar, I mean mortgage company and bank after bank has pulled back from the mortgage space. So, there is an opportunity to actually grow market share in the mortgage space and purchase in particular, but you've got to bring down the cost to acquire the client, you've got to incur -- increase conversion rate. And so, as we went through the prepared remarks, the work with our Home Buying Plan, the work with the Inflation Buster, I think I referenced that there are other very unique products that will be launched here shortly, will launch or the mention I made of a credit card that will help homeowners in particular with rewards, the strong growth of our rewards program. Over a million clients already signed up early tests showing that we're doubling the conversion rate there. All of that will allow us to grow market share in the purchase category as others come away. And when we prioritize where our tech resources, our sales resources, and our marketing resources should be, we feel very strongly that grabbing that purchase market share is our best place to focus. Because as we know, with a 90% retention rate, as rates move around, tick up, tick down, people take cash out, will recapture that client again and maximize lifetime value. So, doesn't mean we're not focused on Rocket Loans, doing great stuff with Rocket Loans when it comes to personal loans, solar financing, auto financing, but we see a very big opportunity right now, as the mortgage market seems even more fragmented than it's been in the past to lean in and grab that market share. Well, as you mentioned, I think some of the teams do take time, and that's why we have prioritized the work to be so focused, and I'm so proud of the team and how much they've rolled out in the last six months. And that was the decision. Do you go into other non-mortgage products or do we redirect our tech resources into these areas that can help accelerate mortgage? And that's a decision that we've made. So that will reduce the timeframe for us in particular. But you're right. Purchase, we could be doing a lot of great work right now with purchase clients at the top of the funnel building rewards. And it may take four or five, six months for those clients to actually work their way through the funnel to buy a home. But we can see that progress, we can track that progress. And the more they bank those rewards, the more that we know they are going to be a client that will close with us. And so, I think as we get into the spring, we'll probably be able to provide even more visibility as we watch clients kind of work their way through that funnel. And M&A, we're very active there. We're always looking, but we always want to make sure we're making the right investments that provide a unique opportunity to grow market share, not just kind of buy something that, that we already have, quite honestly, under our own umbrella. Thanks. Thanks so much. Yeah. I think we touched on before some of the improvements we've made to Rocket Money, in particular, I think Brian mentioned this, our cost to acquire a client has now dropped to our $100 far different than where most people sit to acquire a mortgage client. And so, tying that client into the Home Buying Plan, the rewards plan will help bring them through the funnel. We touched on the fact that here in January, Rocket Money was rated the number one app in the iOS system, something they've been focused on achieving for quite some time, but it's the heavy focus on making that product special, making it great that allowed us to achieve that. I actually got top 10 overall for app downloads in January. So, we're seeing the top of the funnel widen. And then we're starting to see the more kind of middle of that funnel, we referenced the rewards program or the early test we've now done show a doubling of conversion. And as I mentioned before, there will be additional programs we're rolling out here in the spring and probably in the next call, we'll be able to share more information around how we're seeing those conversion rates increase. All of that will allow us to rethink the cost to acquire a client, in particular, a purchase client. And I think one other exciting thing that we're watching is the pairing up of our Rocket Homes preferred agents with our Rocket Mortgage program and how that's assisting in conversion rate increase, and we'll probably be touching on that more here in the future as well. Yeah. That's a very interesting space. As you know, Mike Fawaz and the team have done a wonderful job, really proud of his work the last few months. It's resonating with brokers and it's a very fluid space. We track how many partners are coming in. We've tracked for many partners are leaving others. And as you really articulated, those brokers are very price sensitive. And so, you'll watch kind of partners move from partner-to-partner. We've talked about this. Bob Walters, the President or the CEO of the Mortgage business has talked about this a lot. That's the superpower of a mortgage broker, the ability to pick and choose who they work with to give themselves an advantage. And as you know, we stand firmly behind providing that superpower. So, we're onboarding new TPO partners all the time and we think that's the right way to approach that market. Yeah. Look, I think the team has done an incredible job this year of reducing expenses. It's easy to sit on these calls and talk about expense reduction. The real work is the hundreds and hundreds of leaders inside the organization have to go through that process. And when Brian talks about taking billions and billions of expenses out we've accomplished that in nine months. And so my hat's off to him and to the entire team in achieving that. I think if we go back, at least the 27 years I've been here, and especially when I took over as CMO and then CEO, our focus was the direct to consumer channel. And our focus was doing something different that no one had done before being excellent in every category from marketing to outreach to conversion, our banker force being the best of the best, and that worked. And we scaled refinance in particular to levels that no one has ever seen. When you hear us talking about the rewards program and the home buying program and the Rocket Dashboard and the servicing and the Rocket Money and Rocket Homes, these are a lot of moving parts, far more complicated than refinance. Absolutely. On one side, it's taking us longer to achieve it because it's far more complicated. On the other side, the barrier to entry for anyone else to do this type of work, I don't see it happening. And that work, it's those inches. It's one tenth of the conversion rate increase over here and one twentieth of a conversion increase over there, but they all add up to allow us to have the same success in purchase direct to consumer that we had in refinance. And so yes, we've invested some money these last six, seven months in particular to achieve that. But I have all the confidence that, that will result in our ability to scale, purchase the same way that we've scaled refinance and will lead to a very profitable and successful organization. So that's where our focus is, and we're just -- we're taking the same scientific approach that we took to refinance, and we're applying it now to purchase more complicated, taking longer. But I think it's a proven thing that can work and Brian, you may jump in. Yeah. Well, it's an interesting market that we're in. And you've watched a lot of folks trying a variety of things, especially in the second half of 2022. When I think about the purchase market, and I've touched on this a few times already, I think about the entire funnel. If you were to walk into my office, you see on a whiteboard a giant funnel, I'm always kind of adjusting and rethinking, it starts with all of the marketing partnerships we've got, but also our opportunity to market directly to consumers. It works through our Rocket Homes network of agents, which is incredibly strong and getting stronger. The reason that's happening is because when purchases were so strong in 2021 and 2022, the beginning of 2022, most agents had enough business to kind of deal with. Now agents are hungry for verified clients, we are the provider of those verified clients. So, the dynamic between the mortgage business and agents is changing, which will, I think, benefit us greatly. And then you'll kind of watch the different solutions we can offer to allow people to get prepared to buy. One of the complexities of a purchase lead that's different than a refinance lead is that it's hard to help someone find a perfect house. And so, we can be there. We can be engaging with the client, but we've got to be there on that Saturday afternoon when they see that house. And if you look back over time, usually who they're there with is their agent. And so their agent may have a mortgage company that they like to work with. So with this network of agents that our team, Doug Seabolt, [indiscernible] have been growing out and solidified in these last six months and in the rewards program. So now our clients look and say, wait a second, I've already built $850 towards my closing fees with Rocket. I've got a verified approval. And I'm working with a preferred Rocket agent, they're sitting there on a Saturday. Now the only call or text or e-mail comes directly to us, not to another mortgage company. And so, I imagine as we get into the spring, in summer, we're going to see the continued increase in conversion and all of that ties back both in Rocket Homes ability to market, but also Rocket Mortgage's ability to market. The last thing I'll say, and I can only touch on a little bit. Now imagine a credit card, where every day you're spending in doing things, and that spending allows you to build rewards to help you buy your next home. All of these factors working together really gives us a strategic advantage. I know you want to know, hey, Jay, tell me in what month you -- all I'm saying is all of these things working together we feel very confident will allow us to apply the same marketing spend, the same creativity to drive this engagement and really grow purchase market share significantly. Thank you. Yeah. And I'm going to add something to that. I think it's important, Bill sitting here to my left. But Bill and I have worked together for over a quarter of a century and for a long period of time as CEO and President of the company, and we did a nice job of kind of dividing and conquering around innovation, creativity, marketing and execution. And so, Brian is doing a wonderful job of thinking about the expenses. But it all comes with this backdrop of we have now -- our thousands of people have been building and building these programs that are so important to us to capture purchase market share. And you can run the numbers a few percentage point increases and we really like where the company is at. And Bill Emerson specializes in execution. We have [indiscernible] innovation is rewarded, but execution is worshiped. And so my confidence level of Bill stepping in, rallying the team and executing on these final components of what we've spent so much time investing in, it's exciting. I just -- I've seen them do it for 27 years, and I just know what he's capable of. And we've laid these great kind of -- all the tracks have been laid to achieve this now. So, I appreciate the concern around the expenses. Those are all good questions, and Brian's doing do a wonderful job of managing them. But I'm more excited about the opportunity for revenue growth because of the hard work that the team has been doing here. Now it's one thing to get distracted by a very tough market, nothing to put your hand [technical difficulty]. Yeah. I think there's a variety of things. I certainly think that there's a renewed focus from the consumer and thinking about their budget and Rocket money is probably -- not probably is the best app as far as I'm concerned for consumers to use to achieve those goals. I also think we have an incredible team over at Rocket Money. Their ability to understand where the consumer is going, add product features that really resonate with the consumer the marketing group there, the performance marketing group is excellent, just top shelf across the board. And so that group is executing right now. And as they start thinking about tying in their work to the Home Buying Plan, where Rocket Money is attracting someone who is just starting to think about getting their finances in the right spot to buy things like cars and homes, so it dovetails perfectly into our Rocket -- or our Home Buying Plan, our rewards program, credit card and down to mortgage. I mean all of these components are coming together to allow that to happen. So that's -- those are a lot of reasons for the growth over there, but all good for our business. Well, we just touched on a lot of that, which is we've got to continue to grow purchase market share. I mean, that's the best way to get a current coupon, as you called it, mortgage on the book and then make sure that we capture its value later. And as we think about returning capital, a unique thing that we've got, when we think about an overall purchase transaction, you've got the mortgage revenue, we participate at Rocket Companies in the Rocket Homes real estate revenue. If we do things right, there's an opportunity to participate in title revenue and appraisal revenue. And so, as we move forward, you'll probably see us talk about the full package, which can create a better experience for the consumer, but also have greater revenue opportunities for us which is different than most of our competitors, allowing us to bring more of those purchase plans on board at a higher interest rate and then giving them the Rocket Dashboard, the Rocket -- a proposed credit card, a rewards program that keep them in our servicing funnel. Our refinance retention is excellent. Our purchase retention is good. But when we talk about all these additional touch points, we can drive that retention rate up as well. So that's a lot of great work is being done to ensure that, that happens. Yeah. Yeah. I know that I have maybe tossed out the last call or two calls ago, something like a $1.8-ish trillion market. I think some of the Fannie and Freddie and others are kind of triangulating more around that number as well. Brian talked about it earlier. When we strategize, we kind of think about two or three scenarios, and ensure that we like the direction of the organization even in a more challenged scenario. And so that's all the investment that we've been making this -- the end of 2022 and into this year has really been how do we capture market share in a more challenging scenario, certainly below $2 trillion in mortgages. And we're starting to see the continued reduction of originators. We're seeing the folks come out of the market. I know we touched on quite a few already. I think Wells Fargo said they were exiting correspondent. Flagstar has gotten out of retail, Loan Depot exited wholesale, AMERISAFE exited wholesale. So that's happening and will continue to happen because if we look at the last 25 or so minutes of this call, and we were to talk to a lot of these competitors, they don't have the strategic opportunities to grow market share the way that we do. So, even in a more challenging 2023, which -- and Brian can chime in here, I believe we will see that. We don't anticipate any sharp rate decreases coming this year. We've set ourselves up to see growth and then whether we see rates move around a bit in 2024, 2025, we can take an opportunity to refinance folks and increase the lifetime value. And the only other thing I'll comment on, and teams working on this, cash out is always surprising to me. Regardless of interest rate, mortgage in particular still is one of the best ways for people to borrow money. And so consumer spending has remained strong. People are continuing to invest in their home. They're adding on, they're making improvements. And our team has done a great job maximizing cash out. I don't think we'll see that change in 2023. I think the cash out market will still be pretty robust. Brian don't know if you have any thoughts. I'm glad you brought that up because that spin, as you've noticed for us, that's been where we're leaning. We certainly can help someone who needs to sell their home and buy a new one, and we've got programs coming that will even make that better. But for us, our focus through Rocket Money, in particular, is to get to the person who is the first time home buyer. They've already said they want to do the transaction with Rocket. They want to do it online. They want to do it on their phone. And so, we're not battling some of those concerns about, can I afford the next house? Am I really moving up? It's a different conversation. And to Brian's point, we just got to -- we've got to be there. You've got to -- you saw -- so you got to hang around the hoop, we've got to be present with that consumer as they go through the three to four to five months to find the right home. And all of the programs that we've built allow us to hang around the hoop helping that client until they're ready to buy. And that's really an important -- I'm glad you brought that up, Brian. So, a very important thing to understand about us and the audience that we're reaching. Well, yeah, I think you did see a longer lag. Some of the work that we thought would have been done in mid to fall of 2022 dragged down and it's still happening today. There is two phases. The first phase is trying to figure out what your capacity should be as a company in mortgage, in particular. But even at that, the next question is, how can you generate lead flow you, only cut so much and then you have to have a plan to generate, to spend marketing dollar, to generate revenue to bring out -- or bring in a lead flow. And again, that's probably why you hear us spend so much of our time talking about those plans because it can only capacity cut so much. I can't speculate on where others are. My focus is more on what are others doing to invest to allow themselves to retrench, originate again and grow market share. And if not, then I think that cutting has to keep going for them. Brian, I don't know if you have any other thoughts. Thanks for the questions. Thank you. Go ahead, operator. Sorry."

And with that, I'll turn things over to Jay Farner to get us started. Jay?\nJay Farner: Thank you, Sharon. And good afternoon. Welcome to the Rocket Companies earnings call for the third quarter of 2022. On today's call, I'll share how Rocket is executing on our strategy as we navigate these challenging market conditions and how we continue to invest in our future. We'll discuss how we're innovating to better serve our clients and partners. And I'll provide an update on the progress of the Rocket platform.  Before we begin, I'd like to discuss the executive leadership changes that we announced last month. I want to thank our CFO, Julie Booth, who has been a tremendous leader during her 19 years with our organization, helping to guide the company through significant growth and expansion. I'm happy to say that Julie will continue to be with us as a strategic advisor.  I'd also like to recognize Angelo Vitale, who has recently transitioned from his role as general counsel and secretary. Angelo has worn many hats during his 25 year tenure at the company. In addition to being our general counsel, Angelo has also served as CEO launching Rocket Central and as longtime executive vice president. Despite all of that, Angelo is best known as someone our leadership team can go to for trusted advice and sound counsel.  On today's call, I'm also introducing Brian Brown, our current Chief Accounting Officer and incoming CFO and Treasurer starting November 15. Brian joined Rocket in 2014 and currently leads the accounting, finance, treasury and procurement teams. Brian is deeply knowledgeable about our business and has worked as a member of our leadership team for many years. Brian led our operational efficiency efforts this year, helping to reduce our expenses by more than $2 billion on an annualized basis. Brian also played an instrumental role in our IPO and has done an excellent job with our ongoing engagement with the investment community. I'm looking forward to working with Brian in his new role as Chief Financial Officer to execute on our strategy and help lead Rocket into the future.  I'm also excited to welcome Tina John to her new role as General Counsel. Tina joined us in 2020 following our IPO and brings extensive legal experience in securities, capital markets, corporate governance, and public company guidance to the leadership team.  With that, I'd like to start by having a direct talk about the current state of the market. The mortgage industry continues to face challenging times. 30-year fixed mortgage rates have eclipsed 7%, the highest in decades. The 300 plus basis point increase this year has been the largest and fastest since 1982. Housing affordability is at a 30-year low and weakening consumer sentiment is leading to a rapidly deteriorating home purchase market.  While we typically see lower demand for purchase transactions in the fourth quarter, the sequential decline the industry is experiencing has been even more pronounced due to overall market weakness. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, total mortgage applications are at the lowest levels since the mid-1990s, even lower than the 2008 financial crisis.  Over the next several quarters, we expect to see significant separation between the well capitalized players in the mortgage space, those who have clearly defined long-term strategic plans from those who don't. As we are seeing significant capacity will continue to come out of the system, further industry consolidation will take place, and those who aren't well capitalized will struggle with liquidity. In the end, only the strong will be left standing.  These cycles are nothing new for Rocket. The company has experienced and successfully navigated through several significantly challenging time periods throughout the 37-year history. Each time we've been nimble, pivoting and operating with flexibility and thoughtfulness that allow us to capitalize with every market shift. And each time, we've also invested heavily in strategies that provide us with a deep competitive advantage when the market corrects.  As we continue through the current challenging cycle and when we ultimately emerge, we expect our robust capitalization and superior positions in brand, technology, data insights, client experience, and client engagement, paired with the sheer scale of our existing client interactions, to allow Rocket to further expand its market leadership.  Housing will always be critical to the American economy. It's nearly 20% of US GDP. And we believe there's a huge long-term opportunity for the winner in this industry. The investments we're making today will fundamentally disrupt and transform the way mortgages are done \u2013 from client acquisition to conversion to loan production.  We will continue to lead and innovate and further widen the gap between Rocket and other mortgage lenders. In just 2022 alone, more than 2.4 million Americans have transacted with us on the Rocket platform, representing unique clients across homes, loans, Rocket Money and other businesses, showing the true depth and breadth of our reach.  The home purchase market, which remains highly fragmented and inefficient, represents a significant opportunity for Rocket. A National Association of REALTORS report showed that for intent homebuyers are now Millennials. 75% of the clients who apply using Rocket's online platform or app are first time homebuyers and/or millennials.  Rocket Money's clients also share similar demographics and we continue to nurture and place another path to being future first time homebuyers and Rocket Mortgage clients.  In the past few quarters, we've responded quickly to our clients' needs in these challenging times of high inflation and volatile rates, by bringing to market a slate of new innovative mortgage products.  The fast rollout, relaunch of these products was made possible through the power of our platform, and the collaborative efforts of our capital markets, product strategy, technology, and marketing teams.  In September, we introduced our Inflation Buster program, which reduces a homebuyer's monthly mortgage payment by 1 percentage point in the first year of their loan. Inflation Buster gives homebuyers a reprieve when they need it most in their first year, when they have the highest housing related expenses, such as moving costs and furnishing a home. Inflation Buster has resonated with homebuyers and pairs well with our Rate Drop Advantage Program, which covers many of the cost to refinance in the years ahead if rates fall.  Last quarter, we place renewed emphasis on our rate shield program, which gives our purchase clients confidence in a rising rate environment by locking in rates for 90 days while they search for a new home.  Our home equity loan product has proven very popular for existing homeowners who are looking to tap the equity currently available in their house without sacrificing the favorable interest rates they have on their first mortgage.  We are also innovating to better serve our enterprise partners. Last quarter, we announced a new partnership with Santander, which went live in under 60 days. Mortgage volume through this partnership is ramping up quickly with client applications outpacing initial projections. Over the next several quarters, we will extend our partnership to include full digital capabilities and additional client segments.  Turning to our platform, the Rocket platform and its engagement tools are the engine that will expand the top of our funnel, lift conversion and lower our cost to acquire new clients, thereby driving growth in revenue and profitability over the long term. These tools allow us to keep our clients connected to and active within our brand until the moment they're ready to transact. This helps us eliminate the need to reacquire previous leads or compete directly for new leads, reducing our cost to acquire clients. Rocket can leverage the valuable insights we gain from our platform to make more personalized recommendations.  Rocket Money, a key component of our platform, continues its impressive growth, nearly doubling paid premium members year-over-year.  To put the size of the opportunity into perspective, today we have more than 24 million Rocket accounts \u2013 a single sign-on solution for the entire Rocket ecosystem. With these accounts, we have deeper insights into our clients, allowing us to provide a much richer experience through our platform.  Last week, we announced our new Rocket Rewards loyalty program, a key component of our platform. Rocket Rewards gives our clients points for taking certain actions, such as applying for a prequalified approval letter, utilizing mortgage affordability calculators, or reading informational articles about the home purchase process, ultimately helping to drive education and brand loyalty across the Rocket ecosystem. Early signs are very encouraging. Within the first 72 hours, over 70 million points were awarded to both new and existing Rocket clients for completing over 17,000 activities.  While you may have seen membership or loyalty programs in other consumer industries such as hotels, restaurants, travel and ecommerce, this is an industry first and we believe a game changer for Rocket. When we surveyed our clients, a resounding 88% told us they value a Rocket affiliate rewards program in a way that would encourage a long term relationship with our brand. Rocket Rewards will continue to create real value for first time homebuyers where affordability is the biggest challenge to achieving their goals.  With these 24 million rocket accounts and robust engagement tools such as Rocket Rewards and Rocket Money, we are building ongoing relationships with our clients, engaging with them, reducing our cost to acquire and extending lifetime value.  Our robust capitalization, our fortress balance sheet, and most importantly, our team members' incredible passion for building these experiences will allow us to not only weather the storm, but grow in today's environment and through the market recovery. The investments we're making today will create shareholder value as we capture opportunities in the financial services space, the mortgage market and beyond.  In these turbulent times, we remain focused on fulfilling our mission to be the best at creating certainty in life's most complex moments, so that our clients can live their dreams.  With that, I'll turn it over to Brian to go deeper into the numbers.\nBrian Brown: Thank you, Jay. And good afternoon, everyone. Before we begin, I'd like to echo Jay's remarks regarding Julie and Angelo. I value my partnership with each of them, and I wish them both the best in their new roles.  As you heard from Jay, the mortgage industry is facing significant headwinds in the second half of the year. Rocket is operating in this difficult environment from a position of financial strength and with clear competitive advantages.  On today's call, I'll cover the actions we're taking to improve our efficiency, including reducing our cost structure by more than $2 billion on an annualized basis. I'll also walk through the investments we're making in the Rocket platform to continue to grow our business over the long term.  It's important to begin by putting 2022 into perspective. Rapid increases in interest rates and declining housing affordability are impacting demand for home purchases and refinancing at the same time. As of mid-October, the industry refinance applications were down 86% year-over-year and home purchase applications were down 37%.  While volume is clearly under pressure, there continues to be substantial excess capacity in the mortgage industry, increasing the competition for every loan. The industry is flooded with loan officers who are struggling to produce. In fact, our estimate suggests that industry volume per loan officer is near an all-time low at less than one loan per loan officer per month. The economics are simply not sustainable, and capacity in the industry will continue to come out.  Against this challenging backdrop, Rocket's third quarter results landed within our guided range for closed loan volume, net rate locks and gain on sale margin. We generated closed loan volume of $25.6 billion, net rate locks of nearly $24 billion and our gain on sale margin was 269 basis points, which was above the midpoint of our guided range.  Rocket Companies generated $888 million of adjusted revenue in the third quarter. We delivered GAAP net income of $96 million, resulting in GAAP EPS of $0.04 per diluted share. On an adjusted EPS basis, we reported a loss of $0.08 per share.  Turning to our balance sheet, Rocket's financial strength is a major strategic advantage for us as we weather the current market environment. We ended the third quarter with $4 billion of available cash and $7.3 billion of mortgage servicing rights. Together, these two assets represent a total of $11.3 billion of value on our balance sheet, equating to more than $5.50 per share.  Our $4 billion of available cash consists of $826 million of cash on the balance sheet, and an additional $3.2 billion of corporate cash used to self-fund loan originations.  Total liquidity stood at $8.8 billion as of September 30, including available cash plus undrawn lines of credit and undrawn MSR lines, which includes a new $1.5 billion MSR facility put in place during the quarter.  As of September 30, our mortgage servicing portfolio included 2.5 million clients with $531 billion in unpaid principal balance. At the end of the third quarter, the value of our mortgage servicing rights was $7.3 billion. This reflects an increase of $1.9 billion year-to-date. During the quarter, the value of the MSR asset increased by $600 million, including a $400 million positive mark-to-market adjustment.  We also drive considerable recurring revenue from mortgage servicing. During the third quarter, we generated $360 million of cash revenue from our servicing book, which represents more than $1.4 billion of cash revenue on an annualized basis. Net client retention remained over 90% in the third quarter, well above the industry average.  Regarding our expenses, we continue to execute a disciplined and prudent approach to cost management. On our last earnings call, we committed to a further reduction in total expenses from the second quarter to the third quarter of $50 million to $150 million. And we did just that, reducing expenses by more than $100 million during the quarter. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we anticipate a further reduction in total expenses of $50 million to $100 million compared to the third quarter.  Over the past 12 months, we have taken significant action to reduce our overall cost structure. In fact, if we look at the third quarter this year compared to the third quarter of last year, on an annualized basis, we have reduced our expenses by more than $2 billion, or approximately one-third of our total costs.  As we navigate and adjust to the current environment, we're continuing our long-term strategy of investing in our platform with an eye toward the future. Rocket leads with competitive advantages in brand, technology, data insights, client experience and client engagement. These competitive advantages are difficult to replicate and help us drive superior unit economics and increased client lifetime value. We are constantly looking to leverage these advantages to reinvest in our business and drive long term growth.  The investments that we're making our platform will expand the top of the funnel and bring more clients into our ecosystem. In the past, we've had considerable success retaining our mortgage servicing portfolio, which today represents 2.5 million clients.  During the record profitability years, 2020 and 2021, nearly half of our mortgage volume came from existing clients already on our platform, all at a nominal client acquisition cost resulting in highly profitable unit economics.  The broader Rocket platform, including Rocket Money, and the recently announced Rocket Rewards program, helps expand our reach and increase conversion across the broader universe of 24 million Rocket accounts. This is crucial because our platform helps keep our clients connected and active, and also helps provide the valuable data and insights needed to make personalized recommendations. So at a size of 24 million accounts and growing, we believe we have a tremendous opportunity in front of us.  The platform can also improve our already industry-leading unit economics. One of the biggest challenges in the mortgage industry is the cost to acquire a client, which typically runs in the thousands of dollars. In contrast, Rocket Money can acquire a new client for less than $100, which is a significant difference.  By bringing clients into our funnel at a lower cost of acquisition and engaging in nurturing them in our ecosystem and building loyalty earlier in their lifecycle, we believe this will be a game changer for Rocket. With a larger top of the funnel and a lower client acquisition costs, higher conversions, deeper client insights and personalized offerings and client retention with increased lifetime value, Rocket has a significant advantage over others in the space.  I would like to emphasize that we are investing with discipline and we are laser focused on tracking our progress and success. This is a process I personally led with our operating leaders and will continue to monitor closely as a CFO Turning to our outlook, we will be transitioning to a revenue-based guidance approach going forward. We believe revenue is a better representation of the totality of Rocket's businesses and more closely aligns with how we manage the company.  Starting in the fourth quarter, we plan to provide one quarter forward-looking guidance on an adjusted revenue basis. This quarter will be the last time that we provide forward-looking guidance on net rate lock volume and gain on sale margin. Rate locks and gain on sale margin will continue to be disclosed in our financial statements.  For the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted revenue to be in the range of $600 million to $750 million, closed loan volume to be in the range of $17 billion to $22 billion and net rate lock volume to be in the range of $15 billion to $21 billion. We anticipate gain on sale margin to be in the range of 230 basis points to 260 basis points, as we expect the impact from promotional products such as Inflation Buster to contribute to a quarter-over-quarter decline in margin.  However, these products are still incrementally profitable to Rocket. The need for innovative products like inflation Buster speaks to the affordability challenges that homebuyers are facing today.  Our guidance assumes that the core mortgage business will continue to face headwinds given the challenging economic environment and that seasonality will also play a role as the fourth quarter is traditionally a seasonally low quarter, especially for homebuying activity.  As always, our forward-looking guidance is based on our current outlook and visibility into the fourth quarter. Despite broader industry and economic headwinds and a challenging market, we are well positioned in the current environment and will continue to invest in the business to drive long-term shareholder value.  With that, we're ready to turn it back to the operator for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.\nJames Faucette: Great. Thank you so much. I want to go back to one of the things that you said at the outset, and should be self-evident, but you guys have had amazing staying power through multiple mortgage cycles in Rocket's history and, as you pointed out, that's really a hard thing to do because they can be so volatile. In terms of your upcoming execution and the, like, where do you think this experience is going to prove to be most valuable? How is it driving your decision-making in core business areas? And I guess as part of that, you've done obviously a good job reducing your expense base. But at the same time, you've always talked about trying to take advantage of these periods to gain share. So just wondering how you're balancing those out right now.\nJay Farner: Yes. Thanks, James. I'll start and then Brian can jump in as well. And I think we're seeing all of the lessons that we have learned, at least in the 27 years I've been here, come to play at this point in time. Certainly, the first thing that we've touched on before is just getting close to your business. And so, as Brian and the team have done an amazing job of taking expenses out of the business, but it's critical that those expenses don't slow us down when it comes to the long-term vision of what we're creating.  And so, the only way to achieve that is to be very close to your business, so you can continue to execute on long-term strategies, not get caught up in the day-to-day and chase loans maybe that aren't profitable or make decisions that could harm you 6 months, 12 months later, but stick to that strategy.  So the second piece of that is actually have a strategy. And you heard me today spend a lot of time talking about that. Regardless of what interest rates do, we at Rocket have to continue to grow the platform to allow for our growth, right? We cannot be thinking about when interest rates may come down. We've got to be thinking about how we increase our conversion rates, engage our client base, drive the lifetime value of loans, and that puts us in a position to win in a great market. And so, that's exactly what you're seeing us do. And that's exactly what we've been talking about on today's call.  Probably the Rocket Rewards comments are the most relevant. So, if you think about the marketing dollars that we're spending today to drive people in who are thinking about purchasing or refinancing their loan, as we know, many people aren't going to purchase right now. Homes have become more expensive, and there may not be an opportunity to pull cash out or save money on a monthly mortgage payment. So how do we keep those clients on their mission to achieve their goal? Certainly, you can have emails and you can have text message, you can have a brand, but that on its own won't reach the cost to acquire numbers of lifetime value that we need to separate ourselves from our competition.  So this rewards program allows our clients, and we saw that in the first few hours \u2013 or I should say, days of the program, 70 million points distributed, 17,000 actions taken, that starts to prove out what we've heard from our client base that a program like this that allows them to participate, engage, drive down cost, and we'll continue to expand the program and the value it has to our platform, that's a critical piece of the puzzle that we've been building.  So would we be able to roll out Inflation Buster, would we be able to roll out the rewards program, would we be able to rebrand Rocket Money? If we did not have these long-term strategies where we're deploying our tech and product strategy resources, we wouldn't. You'd get distracted in the day-to-day movement of the market. So that's probably the biggest lesson for me and I think for our leadership team. We cannot control what the 10-year treasury will do on any given day. What we can control is investment in our capital, in the long-term value to differentiate our brand and our platform from everybody else. And so \u2013 and that's exactly what you're hearing us talk about each and every call because that's what we're doing.  Brian, I'll let you chime in.\nBrian Brown: The only thing I would add is that to be able to do those things isn't an accident either. It's because of the financial strength of the company. And when you look at over $8 billion of equity, over $8 billion of liquidity, and $4 billion of cash on the balance sheet, this is a luxury that others in this space don't have. So this is an enactment that we ended up here. We all knew rates would rise. None of us knew exactly how fast it is, but we're well positioned for this market because of that financial policy and that financial strength.\nJay Farner: That's exactly right.\nOperator: The next question is from Kevin Barker with Piper Sandler.\nKevin Barker: I just wanted to follow up on some of the cost-cutting efforts that you're making. Obviously, you've been very aggressive through these first three quarters, which is typically not like Rocket, and you gave the guidance of $50 million to $100 million. Would you be willing to cut expenses further going into early 2023, if we continue to have these pretty aggressive or at least really tough origination market?  And then when you think about the cost cuts that you've made here, how much more profitable do you think you'd be on the long run if we were to return to like a normal market where we start to see maybe $2.5 trillion of origination.\nJay Farner: I'll let Brian speak to some of the other ways that we're thinking about cost cutting, but maybe taking \u2013 lifting up about to 50,000 feet and tying into the investments that we're making today, both on the marketing side, the lead generation side, the tech side, the decision-making, of course, is not based on the profitability of a day, a week, or a month. The decision-making is based on the metrics that will tell us that the investments we're making are going to pay off in the long run. I think Brian touched on the fact that in 2020 and 2021, nearly 50% of the mortgages that we did were clients that were in our servicing book. So, there's virtually no cost to acquire. So if you think about and one of the driving forces for this platform tech build that we've been doing for years now is to think, well, how can we have 5 million clients in our database, how can we have 7 million clients in our database, how can we engage those 24 million people that have already created a Rocket account, so as we see rates shift and adjust, if there's an opportunity to help folks, we're not marketing to a $2.5 million client base, we're marketing to a $10 million client base, and that's the vision of what we're creating.  And then you can take what we've done in the past and think about what that would mean to the profitability of the organization. So, as we're making investments today, the first priority is to have that confidence to say, okay, what we're doing now will lead to that long-term vision, which we know is highly profitable for our organization in the long run. I talked earlier about \u2013 at the time, three or four days into the process, we had done 70 million of rewards points. I think we're now up to 170 million. So we're watching the growth of this each and every day, clients in, engaging, reading, giving us data, and all of that is what we will use to determine \u2013 and Brian touched on this \u2013 are the investments, are the marketing dollars leading to the engagement that we know in the future will lead to loan origination because when that turns, the profitability we receive is order of magnitude greater than what we might invest today that will not be highly profitable right now because we're focused on what it will be in the future.  Brian, I know you touched on this in your remarks as well.\nBrian Brown: I think, Kevin, the way I think about it is these cost reductions and these expense cuts protect those investments that we're making. And just to reiterate, if we look at Q3 to Q3 of last year, it's $2 billion of costs taken out of the system. That's about a third of our cost structure. In Q2, we said we take out $200 million and we took out $300 million. In Q3, we said we do $50 million to $150 million, and we did over $100 million. And then to your point, Kevin, we've said another $50 million to $100 million this quarter. If we achieve that, that's $2.5 billion over a year or almost 40% of the cost structure. So it's not insignificant and it's important work, and we'll continue doing it. But by doing that, it protects the things that are important for us and those are the growth strategies that Jay talked about.\nKevin Barker: So given those comments, it seems like you're constantly looking to improve efficiency to fund a lot of these other projects that will enhance the value of the franchise longer term. Is that right?\nJay Farner: I think we're seeing today, when we go through and we think about the right ways to make the cost \u2013 and again, Brian can touch on this \u2013 it needs to be tied to tech advancements. Bob, for many of our calls talked about Rocket Logic, which is a powerful origination tool that we spent years building. What does it do? It makes banking and operations more efficient. So these are the type of things that allow us to be thoughtful about the cost reductions because we're leveraging the tech build that we've got. So we get the reductions without sacrificing the investments in the long-term growth that we know will benefit the company.  And again, that's not \u2013 this goes back to James' question. This is not the first time we've kind of thought through this. In the 27 years I've been here, we've always taken these moments where the market is contracting and said, 'okay, where do we put the dollars?' Where do we put the team members' time and energy and effort that will allow us to have significant market share growth in the future and that's the same exact strategy that we're employing today.\nOperator: The next question is from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.\nRyan Nash: Jay, maybe to ask Kevin's question in a little bit of a different way, but if you look at the way the Fed has tightened financial conditions in the housing market, and it sounds like we're going to be in this restrictive territory for an extended period of time. So, as you said, none of us are rate economists, it's pretty clear that rates are going to be elevated for an extended period of time. So I'm just curious, like, can you give us sort of a blueprint of how you plan to manage in terms of your willingness to lose money for an extended period of time before taking an even more close look at the organization?\nJay Farner: Yes. I think what we're thinking about more is how do we drive efficiency and control the entire funnel. So if you go back to where we were in 2008, we originated mortgages. We did not have a large marketing apparatus. We did not have a lead generation apparatus. We do not have servicing. And so, that allowed us to only pull a few levers.  If you look at what we've been building in the last four or five years, from top to bottom, we control the entire funnel. And now we're adding the glue that engages clients from the very top through our lower my bills strategies, through our Rocket Money engagement, the rewards that hold those things together leads us into origination, but then also the servicing component of this. And so, Brian has touched on the fact that we'll continue to look and determine where we might be able to continue to remove costs that aren't leading us down a profitable path, either short run, but more importantly, what we're focused on is the long run. But I think the vast majority or energies of this organization are thinking whether the market is a $1.2 trillion market for a year, a $1.5 trillion market for a year, the pressure that that will put most originators under, the amount of capacity that will come out \u2013would be curious to see how many loan officers re-up their licenses here this fall. Most processing activity is done here in November and December. So we know that we are north of I think 500,000 LOs or right around that number coming in. I'll be curious to see how many come out into 2023.  So as that contraction occurs, and Brian talked about the capitalization that we've got, this allows us to keep investing, to increase the cost to \u2013 or reduce the cost to acquire. And so even if the market remains smaller for a year or two years, that puts us on a path to grow marketing, to grow market share because we've got all these elements that other originators don't have. And I've got to point this out, you're seeing it right now with purchase. Certainly, when rates were incredibly low and everyone was looking to buy a home, you can go out there, you can find somebody who is days or a week away from signing a purchase agreement. In a market like today's market, you're going to have to engage with clients who are 6 months, 12 months, 18 months away from finding their home.  So the question is how do you achieve that? And those are the solutions that we have been working on, bringing them into the top of the funnel with our MLS listings at Rocket Homes. We'll roll out additional technology products here in the coming quarters that allow those clients to be engaged, have them join rewards, and drive down their closing costs, all while participating more and learning more about Rocket, it gives us a strategic advantage to win those purchase clients and have confidence that our marketing dollars today will pay off in the future, meaning we can continue to spend them.  And I don't see anyone else in our industry doing this. And that's why I mentioned in my remarks, that's why I think over the course of the next quarter or two, the separation between our organization and others that are well capitalized that can invest in these long-term strategies to grow their business versus others who are forced to do have one option, cut, cut, that's it. I think that separation is really going to be pronounced as we get into the next quarter or two.\nRyan Nash: I guess, Jay, maybe as one follow-up, you referenced in your prepared remarks that, as you just articulated, people are going to have to cut, cut, cut. And also, we could start to see consolidations across the industry. We're already seeing people exiting businesses and sell part of the businesses. And I guess, how are you planning, thinking about using your relative strength, whether to pick up things or potentially be an acquirer on the cheap? And maybe just talk about what your priorities are from a capital allocation perspective.\nJay Farner: Yes. I'll touch on that, Brian can as well. We're always being strategic and Scott Elkins, who leads those efforts, is always reminding us that we've got to be thoughtful because everything you've just mentioned is playing out.  For us, if you think about the Rocket Rewards program we just rolled out, our servicing efforts that we've got, some other products that we'll be announcing here in the coming months, it will allow us to have a different effect on top of the funnel lead flow than other originators. And so, we'll be thinking about those learnings and then how does that set our strategy for the type of businesses we may want to acquire.  Does it mean we won't also look at unique originators that bring something very special to the table, maybe a niche market that we're not able to participate in or not able to participate at the level we want? We just rolled out our manufactured housing lending here in the last 48 hours, a very robust program. We'll be curious to see where that goes, could there be something that surfaces there, but it would have to be something strategic for us.  The general originators in the marketplace don't really bring something of value to the table that we can't create on our own. So that's how I think about it, either a unique company that plugs into all this platform engagement work that we're doing or a niche originator that brings us some market share that we currently don't have reach into.\nBrian Brown: Differentiated assets, right? It has to be a different audience, different product or differentiating assets. But, Ryan, one thing I just wanted to go back to in your earlier comments that I think is worth mentioning, to your point, I'm not trying to be an amateur economist to predict 2023, but what I can talk about is what we're experiencing right now in the fourth quarter. And if you think about the fourth quarter, it's also a seasonally low quarter to begin with. And then, when you go back and you look over time and you look at fourth quarter compared to third quarter where home buying and home purchasing represents the majority of the market, it's down even more traditionally from Q3 to Q4.  And also, Jay made some comments about just the sheer number of loan officers, which is one good way to measure capacity, and we're at a record high in terms of loan officers and we're at a record low \u2013 if you do the division and say how many loans per month per loan officer. So, those two things make us think that the fourth quarter is not also the new normal. We don't know what 2023 will hold necessarily, we're not making predictions there, but it's not fair to base your whole business strategy off a seasonally low quarter either.\nJay Farner: With that excess capacity \u2013 I think it's a great point, Brian. I think we're at, whatever, 7 or 8x with the typical LO the industry is doing right now based on our systems, which give us some efficiency. But this is an interesting quarter with the way that home affordability was really hit, some of the lack of price adjusting that is occurring in the seller's market, the steep rise in interest rates which have driven down refis or driven down the origination refi so quickly and this capacity of LOs, who are still trying to figure out whether they're going to stay in this business or even find a new career. So we've got to work our way through this period of time, this 90-day period or so. We'll really know more as we get into Q1.\nOperator: The next question is from Doug Harter with Credit Suisse.\nDoug Harter: Thanks. Clearly, you have a strong liquidity position. Can you just talk about how you might think about capital return in addition to continuing to invest in the business?\nBrian Brown: I'll start, Doug, and I'm sure Jay will have thoughts, too. But it kind of goes back to the previous [indiscernible]. If you think about what we've said in the capital waterfall, the best dollar we spent is reinvesting in the business. We'll continue to be thoughtful around acquisitions, and then we'll return capital, and we're doing essentially exactly what we said we're doing by reinvesting capital into the business right now. And as we talked about, we're not here because of luck, we're here because of planning. We knew and have been thinking a lot about these platform investments over the past couple of years and we planned for it and we saved the liquidity and capital to do it and we plan to continue to do it while we're being thoughtful on the expense side of the house and looking at things that are not key to the operations of this business.\nJay Farner: And the only other thing I'll add is translating that directly to loan volume \u2013 to go out and acquire a loan today, especially if you're basically buying the loan, if you don't have any brand, if you don't have any follow-up mechanisms, if you don't have any engagement, you're going to buy the loan, put it on your platform, you've got to think about it as that one-time value. And if you look at pricing in the industry, without the sale of the MSR, almost immediately with cash, it is a negative cash transaction for a lender. So, we're really trying to think about it completely in a completely different lens, which is, we're acquiring a client that engages on our platform. That's how we're talking about the 24 million Rocket account users that we've got and this robust content rewards program that we're going to engage them with because when you have confidence, kind of like an Amazon, I sign somebody up, maybe they buy a book today, but I know once I get that book, it won't be but a few months and now it will be the tie pods and it will be the dog food, and that buying continues to grow. And so, you start projecting the long-term value of the clients that you've acquired because of the robust experience you can provide them. That's how we're thinking about where we would deploy our capital, particularly to the acquisition of a client versus simply \u2013 not that we don't think about buying \u2013 or marketing and generating a closed loan, but we're not out just trying to buy closed loan volume or drive a closing that doesn't have any long-term value for us. We've got to think about the lifetime value of that client that maybe that we can do marketing today to drive people into Rocket Money and it may be three years before they make their first home purchase. That's okay. We've got line of sight on that. There may be a situation where we can buy MSRs that others aren't buying because we know we're going to engage them in our platform using rewards and have a higher capture rate on their next purchase, but it's this full ecosystem that's working together to give us the insight we need to make these decisions.\nOperator: The next question is from Mark DeVries with Barclays.\nMark DeVries: Could you discuss the competitive dynamics you've been observing in the wholesale channel? And in an environment like this, given all the market challenges, is it easier or more challenging to sign new partners?\nJay Farner: I could be off a number or two here, but I think we've seen 50% of the top 10 wholesale lenders kind of come out of the market in the last 12 months. They've either been pushed out by something called the ultimatum or they've decided not \u2013 no longer participate in wholesale. Wholesale on its own is a very challenging business right now because, as I just touched on, without the sale of that MSR, every loan you're originating is losing you cash. And so, from a broker's perspective, what they've seen is a loss of choice. And I don't know, 50% of the brokers out there, give or take, probably have one or two lenders they can rely on now. So that means that they are not as price competitive, which will bode well for our retail system as they continue to lose choice.  For us, signing up a partner is becoming easier because of the thing I've just mentioned. If you're fighting to save your business and you're in a situation where your choices continue to get eliminated, then you're looking for a new partner, someone who probably is more open to a free market system. And so, we're seeing our new partners or partners flipping back there. But that business on its own is a very challenged business right now. I think the average broker in America is doing, I know, less than one unit a month. I think it's close to 0.6 or 0.7 units a month. And so, regardless of what you're earning per loan, that's going to make it tough. So as Brian and I mentioned, we'll probably see quite a few licensed originators leave the market as we get into 2023, which will be healthy because it will take out a lot of the capacity because they're struggling because of lack of choice that's been now kind of forced upon them.\nOperator: The next question is from Derek Sommers with Jefferies.\nDerek Sommers: Could you provide some commentary on the trends you're seeing in the cash-out refi product and other trends across the product mix spectrum?\nJay Farner: Well, we're doing quite a bit of cash-out. We're doing both first mortgage and second mortgage. It's an interesting situation because as people continue to see their other debt increase, right? So it's always a comparison for clients in general. Is the cost of the mortgage payment going up higher or faster than the cost of credit cards, student loans, other debt instruments that they've got. And as we watch savings drop and people will spend more on their credit cards, they're under more pressure. And so, although it's not always, of course, the right decision for our client to take cash out of their first mortgage, that's why we have the home equity line loan product that we've rolled out. That's why we have our Rocket Loan product that we've rolled out. I think we touched on the fact we've got a beta card in market and other financial products that we'll be rolling out.  So, as we do marketing, and we're bringing clients in and they're joining our rewards program, and then they're thinking about how they're going to save money in a rising rate market, they have access to all those different strategies to benefit their financial situation, not just a cash out on their first mortgage. But today, if I had to take a guess, I would say that we're north of 90% in the industry in terms of people pulling some form of cash out when they do a refinance.\nOperator: The next question is from Ryan McKeveny with Zelman & Associates.\nKevin Kaczmarek: This is Kevin Kaczmarek on for Ryan. I realize it's only been maybe a month and a half, but how is the Inflation Buster program influencing near-term purchase market share and the associated gain on sale margin?\nJay Farner: Well, I think it's been very warmly received. We've noticed some competitors copying the program with a different name. So that always tells me that it's getting attention. From our perspective, people visiting the Inflation Buster website, which we have a direct landing page for that, phone calls, all those things are up. So it's much more of a direct response-based advertising model, stuff that we've done for years and years in the past, and you can see us \u2013 you'll see us continue to lean into that moving into 2023 with great marketing, but more importantly, a great program.  If you're a client today buying a home and your payment has gone up, $300, $400, $500 from where it had been six, seven months ago, that initial savings is very, very helpful as you move in and pay your moving expenses and sign up to your utilities and by furniture, etc. So I think somewhere close to 20% of all of the purchase transactions we're doing today are choosing to use that program. And remember, we've only been marketing it now for a few weeks. So that's an exciting one and it's a great place to start, and you'll continue to see us launch additional programs that allow our clients to still buy a home even in a rising rate market.\nKevin Kaczmarek: Could you talk about the expansion into the correspondent channel? For instance, looking out a few years into the future, how does it tie in with your broader strategic initiatives? How might we think about growth in volumes and/or market share? And what types of economics or margins should we be modeling in?\nJay Farner: Well, our focus here and the technology that our team did an incredible job of rolling out this year is really kind of assisted correspondent. So it's not just kind of buying fully closed loans and not participating in any of the processing of that loan. This is a program that gives brokers another opportunity to take \u2013 have a little bit more flexibility in how they're pricing loans, but it's a similar market. Think of the wholesale broker market and the correspondent or assisted correspondent as a piece that, I'm going to guess, maybe 10% or 12% of the broker market is currently using today. And so, having this program allows us to make sure that we can reach any broker that wants to utilize it, if they want to do assisted correspondent, wonderful, we've got that technology. If they want to stay with the traditional TPO program, we've got that for them as well. But it's yet another tool for us to go out and win market share in the broker community. So that's how I think about it inside of the total broker market share.  Now where that's going? We touched on some of the challenges, I think, that space will face, but we'll be there with the products for all of the brokers who want to take advantage of these great products that we're rolling forward.\nKevin Kaczmarek: Is it possible that you guys could venture into the delegated underwriting space at some point?\nJay Farner: When we think about, and this goes back to our capital allocation, when we think about all of the opportunities that we've got here on the table and our retail brand, the millions of clients that know Rocket, that have already created an accountant at Rocket, all the services top to bottom funnel that we're building out and have executed or not and now we're just kind of hemming together, for us, we balance that against buying a correspondent loan. It's kind of apples and oranges. We'd rather help that client through the system and then, more importantly, retain that client in our servicing book and help them through the lifetime of their loans. So you'll probably see us spend most of our energies either helping our existing broker base or anyone who wants to join that broker base and in our retail clients.\nOperator: Our final question today is from Arren Cyganovich with Citi.\nArren Cyganovich: I just wanted to ask about the strategy that you had previously talking about originating loans that were essentially profitable and not wanting to chase rate essentially to win business. Is that still your strategy? You said a certain level of fixed costs. So I would assume that having additional volume in this environment might be a net plus, but I'm just curious that tied with kind of taking away the forward guidance on originations and gain on sale margin, if that was tied to that at all.\nJay Farner: Yes, it's a very good question. It's a great question to end on here. This is exactly why we've been talking about the platform and the engagement tools that we have for our servicing clients, our lead flow that isn't ready to transact yet because \u2013 now through our lens, as opposed to thinking, is this a profitable loan today, yes or no? Which again, you see many lenders out there saying, 'I know I'm only going to do this once, I have no mechanism to retain that client long term, but I just need to layer it on my system, and so I'll do it even if I'm going to lose money to do so. We have the ability to say, let's understand what our retention rate will be with that client over the long term, with purchase, with refinance, with capturing real estate fees when they purchase a new home through our Rocket Homes company, with a personal loan that they may do through Rocket Loans with other additional products now that we've built out that technology to be loan agnostic and gives us the ability to add other loan programs for our client base. So we can filter that through and think about the marketing dollar we're spending today and have much greater confidence on the long-term or the lifetime value of that client, so you may see us do a loan and someone would look and say, on that particular transaction, that loan cost the company $500. I'm making this up, Brian, you can jump in. But we know, based on everything else, they've signed up for the rewards program. They've signed up, let's say, in the future for a credit card or whatever it might be. We know what the retention rate will be and we can apply that future revenue to still make that marketing decision today.  And so, that's exactly why, when I referenced in my remarks, the excitement around the 300-plus technology people that in four months built out the rewards program for us, so critical, because it's that kind of final glue we needed to watch our client base move from website to website, landing page to landing page, product to product, watch that engagement and then allow us to plug that into our marketing decisions, to spend the right marketing dollar for the lifetime value of the client.\nBrian Brown: Yes, that's exactly right. And to be clear, when we are talking about acquiring clients, we're talking about in a number of ways, through a lifetime value lens and also through a contribution margin lens. And even at these margins that we're talking about here, we're guiding through to Q4, these are positive loan products on a contribution margin basis, defined as revenue minus direct and variable expenses. You mentioned the fixed cost base, and we've talked a lot about that here. But if you think about what makes a platform business a special business, it's superior unit economics, which we have, and we have investments to make them even better, and the scalability, which clearly we've proven a number of times, including in 2020 and 2021.\nOperator: That concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn it over to Jay Farner for any closing comments.\nJay Farner: Yes. Just thanks, everybody, for the great questions. Really excited about the incredible work our team has done this year. As we touched on in the early part of these questions, when times get challenging, the ability for an organization to determine what matters, stay focused, and hold to those priorities is really what separates, I think, successful companies from companies that will struggle. And so, that's been our team and our tech product strategy, our mortgage bankers, operations, everyone here staying focused on the long-term strategies that will lead to the growth \u2013 continued growth of the organization.  So I appreciate everyone who's listening because all of this hard work will pay off for us in 2023 and beyond. We'll see you all at the next call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jay Farner",
            "content": "Thank you, Sharon. And good afternoon. Welcome to the Rocket Companies earnings call for the third quarter of 2022. On today's call, I'll share how Rocket is executing on our strategy as we navigate these challenging market conditions and how we continue to invest in our future. We'll discuss how we're innovating to better serve our clients and partners. And I'll provide an update on the progress of the Rocket platform.  Before we begin, I'd like to discuss the executive leadership changes that we announced last month. I want to thank our CFO, Julie Booth, who has been a tremendous leader during her 19 years with our organization, helping to guide the company through significant growth and expansion. I'm happy to say that Julie will continue to be with us as a strategic advisor.  I'd also like to recognize Angelo Vitale, who has recently transitioned from his role as general counsel and secretary. Angelo has worn many hats during his 25 year tenure at the company. In addition to being our general counsel, Angelo has also served as CEO launching Rocket Central and as longtime executive vice president. Despite all of that, Angelo is best known as someone our leadership team can go to for trusted advice and sound counsel.  On today's call, I'm also introducing Brian Brown, our current Chief Accounting Officer and incoming CFO and Treasurer starting November 15. Brian joined Rocket in 2014 and currently leads the accounting, finance, treasury and procurement teams. Brian is deeply knowledgeable about our business and has worked as a member of our leadership team for many years. Brian led our operational efficiency efforts this year, helping to reduce our expenses by more than $2 billion on an annualized basis. Brian also played an instrumental role in our IPO and has done an excellent job with our ongoing engagement with the investment community. I'm looking forward to working with Brian in his new role as Chief Financial Officer to execute on our strategy and help lead Rocket into the future.  I'm also excited to welcome Tina John to her new role as General Counsel. Tina joined us in 2020 following our IPO and brings extensive legal experience in securities, capital markets, corporate governance, and public company guidance to the leadership team.  With that, I'd like to start by having a direct talk about the current state of the market. The mortgage industry continues to face challenging times. 30-year fixed mortgage rates have eclipsed 7%, the highest in decades. The 300 plus basis point increase this year has been the largest and fastest since 1982. Housing affordability is at a 30-year low and weakening consumer sentiment is leading to a rapidly deteriorating home purchase market.  While we typically see lower demand for purchase transactions in the fourth quarter, the sequential decline the industry is experiencing has been even more pronounced due to overall market weakness. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, total mortgage applications are at the lowest levels since the mid-1990s, even lower than the 2008 financial crisis.  Over the next several quarters, we expect to see significant separation between the well capitalized players in the mortgage space, those who have clearly defined long-term strategic plans from those who don't. As we are seeing significant capacity will continue to come out of the system, further industry consolidation will take place, and those who aren't well capitalized will struggle with liquidity. In the end, only the strong will be left standing.  These cycles are nothing new for Rocket. The company has experienced and successfully navigated through several significantly challenging time periods throughout the 37-year history. Each time we've been nimble, pivoting and operating with flexibility and thoughtfulness that allow us to capitalize with every market shift. And each time, we've also invested heavily in strategies that provide us with a deep competitive advantage when the market corrects.  As we continue through the current challenging cycle and when we ultimately emerge, we expect our robust capitalization and superior positions in brand, technology, data insights, client experience, and client engagement, paired with the sheer scale of our existing client interactions, to allow Rocket to further expand its market leadership.  Housing will always be critical to the American economy. It's nearly 20% of US GDP. And we believe there's a huge long-term opportunity for the winner in this industry. The investments we're making today will fundamentally disrupt and transform the way mortgages are done \u2013 from client acquisition to conversion to loan production.  We will continue to lead and innovate and further widen the gap between Rocket and other mortgage lenders. In just 2022 alone, more than 2.4 million Americans have transacted with us on the Rocket platform, representing unique clients across homes, loans, Rocket Money and other businesses, showing the true depth and breadth of our reach.  The home purchase market, which remains highly fragmented and inefficient, represents a significant opportunity for Rocket. A National Association of REALTORS report showed that for intent homebuyers are now Millennials. 75% of the clients who apply using Rocket's online platform or app are first time homebuyers and/or millennials.  Rocket Money's clients also share similar demographics and we continue to nurture and place another path to being future first time homebuyers and Rocket Mortgage clients.  In the past few quarters, we've responded quickly to our clients' needs in these challenging times of high inflation and volatile rates, by bringing to market a slate of new innovative mortgage products.  The fast rollout, relaunch of these products was made possible through the power of our platform, and the collaborative efforts of our capital markets, product strategy, technology, and marketing teams.  In September, we introduced our Inflation Buster program, which reduces a homebuyer's monthly mortgage payment by 1 percentage point in the first year of their loan. Inflation Buster gives homebuyers a reprieve when they need it most in their first year, when they have the highest housing related expenses, such as moving costs and furnishing a home. Inflation Buster has resonated with homebuyers and pairs well with our Rate Drop Advantage Program, which covers many of the cost to refinance in the years ahead if rates fall.  Last quarter, we place renewed emphasis on our rate shield program, which gives our purchase clients confidence in a rising rate environment by locking in rates for 90 days while they search for a new home.  Our home equity loan product has proven very popular for existing homeowners who are looking to tap the equity currently available in their house without sacrificing the favorable interest rates they have on their first mortgage.  We are also innovating to better serve our enterprise partners. Last quarter, we announced a new partnership with Santander, which went live in under 60 days. Mortgage volume through this partnership is ramping up quickly with client applications outpacing initial projections. Over the next several quarters, we will extend our partnership to include full digital capabilities and additional client segments.  Turning to our platform, the Rocket platform and its engagement tools are the engine that will expand the top of our funnel, lift conversion and lower our cost to acquire new clients, thereby driving growth in revenue and profitability over the long term. These tools allow us to keep our clients connected to and active within our brand until the moment they're ready to transact. This helps us eliminate the need to reacquire previous leads or compete directly for new leads, reducing our cost to acquire clients. Rocket can leverage the valuable insights we gain from our platform to make more personalized recommendations.  Rocket Money, a key component of our platform, continues its impressive growth, nearly doubling paid premium members year-over-year.  To put the size of the opportunity into perspective, today we have more than 24 million Rocket accounts \u2013 a single sign-on solution for the entire Rocket ecosystem. With these accounts, we have deeper insights into our clients, allowing us to provide a much richer experience through our platform.  Last week, we announced our new Rocket Rewards loyalty program, a key component of our platform. Rocket Rewards gives our clients points for taking certain actions, such as applying for a prequalified approval letter, utilizing mortgage affordability calculators, or reading informational articles about the home purchase process, ultimately helping to drive education and brand loyalty across the Rocket ecosystem. Early signs are very encouraging. Within the first 72 hours, over 70 million points were awarded to both new and existing Rocket clients for completing over 17,000 activities.  While you may have seen membership or loyalty programs in other consumer industries such as hotels, restaurants, travel and ecommerce, this is an industry first and we believe a game changer for Rocket. When we surveyed our clients, a resounding 88% told us they value a Rocket affiliate rewards program in a way that would encourage a long term relationship with our brand. Rocket Rewards will continue to create real value for first time homebuyers where affordability is the biggest challenge to achieving their goals.  With these 24 million rocket accounts and robust engagement tools such as Rocket Rewards and Rocket Money, we are building ongoing relationships with our clients, engaging with them, reducing our cost to acquire and extending lifetime value.  Our robust capitalization, our fortress balance sheet, and most importantly, our team members' incredible passion for building these experiences will allow us to not only weather the storm, but grow in today's environment and through the market recovery. The investments we're making today will create shareholder value as we capture opportunities in the financial services space, the mortgage market and beyond.  In these turbulent times, we remain focused on fulfilling our mission to be the best at creating certainty in life's most complex moments, so that our clients can live their dreams.  With that, I'll turn it over to Brian to go deeper into the numbers. Yes. Thanks, James. I'll start and then Brian can jump in as well. And I think we're seeing all of the lessons that we have learned, at least in the 27 years I've been here, come to play at this point in time. Certainly, the first thing that we've touched on before is just getting close to your business. And so, as Brian and the team have done an amazing job of taking expenses out of the business, but it's critical that those expenses don't slow us down when it comes to the long-term vision of what we're creating.  And so, the only way to achieve that is to be very close to your business, so you can continue to execute on long-term strategies, not get caught up in the day-to-day and chase loans maybe that aren't profitable or make decisions that could harm you 6 months, 12 months later, but stick to that strategy.  So the second piece of that is actually have a strategy. And you heard me today spend a lot of time talking about that. Regardless of what interest rates do, we at Rocket have to continue to grow the platform to allow for our growth, right? We cannot be thinking about when interest rates may come down. We've got to be thinking about how we increase our conversion rates, engage our client base, drive the lifetime value of loans, and that puts us in a position to win in a great market. And so, that's exactly what you're seeing us do. And that's exactly what we've been talking about on today's call.  Probably the Rocket Rewards comments are the most relevant. So, if you think about the marketing dollars that we're spending today to drive people in who are thinking about purchasing or refinancing their loan, as we know, many people aren't going to purchase right now. Homes have become more expensive, and there may not be an opportunity to pull cash out or save money on a monthly mortgage payment. So how do we keep those clients on their mission to achieve their goal? Certainly, you can have emails and you can have text message, you can have a brand, but that on its own won't reach the cost to acquire numbers of lifetime value that we need to separate ourselves from our competition.  So this rewards program allows our clients, and we saw that in the first few hours \u2013 or I should say, days of the program, 70 million points distributed, 17,000 actions taken, that starts to prove out what we've heard from our client base that a program like this that allows them to participate, engage, drive down cost, and we'll continue to expand the program and the value it has to our platform, that's a critical piece of the puzzle that we've been building.  So would we be able to roll out Inflation Buster, would we be able to roll out the rewards program, would we be able to rebrand Rocket Money? If we did not have these long-term strategies where we're deploying our tech and product strategy resources, we wouldn't. You'd get distracted in the day-to-day movement of the market. So that's probably the biggest lesson for me and I think for our leadership team. We cannot control what the 10-year treasury will do on any given day. What we can control is investment in our capital, in the long-term value to differentiate our brand and our platform from everybody else. And so \u2013 and that's exactly what you're hearing us talk about each and every call because that's what we're doing.  Brian, I'll let you chime in. That's exactly right. I'll let Brian speak to some of the other ways that we're thinking about cost cutting, but maybe taking \u2013 lifting up about to 50,000 feet and tying into the investments that we're making today, both on the marketing side, the lead generation side, the tech side, the decision-making, of course, is not based on the profitability of a day, a week, or a month. The decision-making is based on the metrics that will tell us that the investments we're making are going to pay off in the long run. I think Brian touched on the fact that in 2020 and 2021, nearly 50% of the mortgages that we did were clients that were in our servicing book. So, there's virtually no cost to acquire. So if you think about and one of the driving forces for this platform tech build that we've been doing for years now is to think, well, how can we have 5 million clients in our database, how can we have 7 million clients in our database, how can we engage those 24 million people that have already created a Rocket account, so as we see rates shift and adjust, if there's an opportunity to help folks, we're not marketing to a $2.5 million client base, we're marketing to a $10 million client base, and that's the vision of what we're creating.  And then you can take what we've done in the past and think about what that would mean to the profitability of the organization. So, as we're making investments today, the first priority is to have that confidence to say, okay, what we're doing now will lead to that long-term vision, which we know is highly profitable for our organization in the long run. I talked earlier about \u2013 at the time, three or four days into the process, we had done 70 million of rewards points. I think we're now up to 170 million. So we're watching the growth of this each and every day, clients in, engaging, reading, giving us data, and all of that is what we will use to determine \u2013 and Brian touched on this \u2013 are the investments, are the marketing dollars leading to the engagement that we know in the future will lead to loan origination because when that turns, the profitability we receive is order of magnitude greater than what we might invest today that will not be highly profitable right now because we're focused on what it will be in the future.  Brian, I know you touched on this in your remarks as well. I think we're seeing today, when we go through and we think about the right ways to make the cost \u2013 and again, Brian can touch on this \u2013 it needs to be tied to tech advancements. Bob, for many of our calls talked about Rocket Logic, which is a powerful origination tool that we spent years building. What does it do? It makes banking and operations more efficient. So these are the type of things that allow us to be thoughtful about the cost reductions because we're leveraging the tech build that we've got. So we get the reductions without sacrificing the investments in the long-term growth that we know will benefit the company.  And again, that's not \u2013 this goes back to James' question. This is not the first time we've kind of thought through this. In the 27 years I've been here, we've always taken these moments where the market is contracting and said, 'okay, where do we put the dollars?' Where do we put the team members' time and energy and effort that will allow us to have significant market share growth in the future and that's the same exact strategy that we're employing today. Yes. I think what we're thinking about more is how do we drive efficiency and control the entire funnel. So if you go back to where we were in 2008, we originated mortgages. We did not have a large marketing apparatus. We did not have a lead generation apparatus. We do not have servicing. And so, that allowed us to only pull a few levers.  If you look at what we've been building in the last four or five years, from top to bottom, we control the entire funnel. And now we're adding the glue that engages clients from the very top through our lower my bills strategies, through our Rocket Money engagement, the rewards that hold those things together leads us into origination, but then also the servicing component of this. And so, Brian has touched on the fact that we'll continue to look and determine where we might be able to continue to remove costs that aren't leading us down a profitable path, either short run, but more importantly, what we're focused on is the long run. But I think the vast majority or energies of this organization are thinking whether the market is a $1.2 trillion market for a year, a $1.5 trillion market for a year, the pressure that that will put most originators under, the amount of capacity that will come out \u2013would be curious to see how many loan officers re-up their licenses here this fall. Most processing activity is done here in November and December. So we know that we are north of I think 500,000 LOs or right around that number coming in. I'll be curious to see how many come out into 2023.  So as that contraction occurs, and Brian talked about the capitalization that we've got, this allows us to keep investing, to increase the cost to \u2013 or reduce the cost to acquire. And so even if the market remains smaller for a year or two years, that puts us on a path to grow marketing, to grow market share because we've got all these elements that other originators don't have. And I've got to point this out, you're seeing it right now with purchase. Certainly, when rates were incredibly low and everyone was looking to buy a home, you can go out there, you can find somebody who is days or a week away from signing a purchase agreement. In a market like today's market, you're going to have to engage with clients who are 6 months, 12 months, 18 months away from finding their home.  So the question is how do you achieve that? And those are the solutions that we have been working on, bringing them into the top of the funnel with our MLS listings at Rocket Homes. We'll roll out additional technology products here in the coming quarters that allow those clients to be engaged, have them join rewards, and drive down their closing costs, all while participating more and learning more about Rocket, it gives us a strategic advantage to win those purchase clients and have confidence that our marketing dollars today will pay off in the future, meaning we can continue to spend them.  And I don't see anyone else in our industry doing this. And that's why I mentioned in my remarks, that's why I think over the course of the next quarter or two, the separation between our organization and others that are well capitalized that can invest in these long-term strategies to grow their business versus others who are forced to do have one option, cut, cut, that's it. I think that separation is really going to be pronounced as we get into the next quarter or two. Yes. I'll touch on that, Brian can as well. We're always being strategic and Scott Elkins, who leads those efforts, is always reminding us that we've got to be thoughtful because everything you've just mentioned is playing out.  For us, if you think about the Rocket Rewards program we just rolled out, our servicing efforts that we've got, some other products that we'll be announcing here in the coming months, it will allow us to have a different effect on top of the funnel lead flow than other originators. And so, we'll be thinking about those learnings and then how does that set our strategy for the type of businesses we may want to acquire.  Does it mean we won't also look at unique originators that bring something very special to the table, maybe a niche market that we're not able to participate in or not able to participate at the level we want? We just rolled out our manufactured housing lending here in the last 48 hours, a very robust program. We'll be curious to see where that goes, could there be something that surfaces there, but it would have to be something strategic for us.  The general originators in the marketplace don't really bring something of value to the table that we can't create on our own. So that's how I think about it, either a unique company that plugs into all this platform engagement work that we're doing or a niche originator that brings us some market share that we currently don't have reach into. With that excess capacity \u2013 I think it's a great point, Brian. I think we're at, whatever, 7 or 8x with the typical LO the industry is doing right now based on our systems, which give us some efficiency. But this is an interesting quarter with the way that home affordability was really hit, some of the lack of price adjusting that is occurring in the seller's market, the steep rise in interest rates which have driven down refis or driven down the origination refi so quickly and this capacity of LOs, who are still trying to figure out whether they're going to stay in this business or even find a new career. So we've got to work our way through this period of time, this 90-day period or so. We'll really know more as we get into Q1. And the only other thing I'll add is translating that directly to loan volume \u2013 to go out and acquire a loan today, especially if you're basically buying the loan, if you don't have any brand, if you don't have any follow-up mechanisms, if you don't have any engagement, you're going to buy the loan, put it on your platform, you've got to think about it as that one-time value. And if you look at pricing in the industry, without the sale of the MSR, almost immediately with cash, it is a negative cash transaction for a lender. So, we're really trying to think about it completely in a completely different lens, which is, we're acquiring a client that engages on our platform. That's how we're talking about the 24 million Rocket account users that we've got and this robust content rewards program that we're going to engage them with because when you have confidence, kind of like an Amazon, I sign somebody up, maybe they buy a book today, but I know once I get that book, it won't be but a few months and now it will be the tie pods and it will be the dog food, and that buying continues to grow. And so, you start projecting the long-term value of the clients that you've acquired because of the robust experience you can provide them. That's how we're thinking about where we would deploy our capital, particularly to the acquisition of a client versus simply \u2013 not that we don't think about buying \u2013 or marketing and generating a closed loan, but we're not out just trying to buy closed loan volume or drive a closing that doesn't have any long-term value for us. We've got to think about the lifetime value of that client that maybe that we can do marketing today to drive people into Rocket Money and it may be three years before they make their first home purchase. That's okay. We've got line of sight on that. There may be a situation where we can buy MSRs that others aren't buying because we know we're going to engage them in our platform using rewards and have a higher capture rate on their next purchase, but it's this full ecosystem that's working together to give us the insight we need to make these decisions. I could be off a number or two here, but I think we've seen 50% of the top 10 wholesale lenders kind of come out of the market in the last 12 months. They've either been pushed out by something called the ultimatum or they've decided not \u2013 no longer participate in wholesale. Wholesale on its own is a very challenging business right now because, as I just touched on, without the sale of that MSR, every loan you're originating is losing you cash. And so, from a broker's perspective, what they've seen is a loss of choice. And I don't know, 50% of the brokers out there, give or take, probably have one or two lenders they can rely on now. So that means that they are not as price competitive, which will bode well for our retail system as they continue to lose choice.  For us, signing up a partner is becoming easier because of the thing I've just mentioned. If you're fighting to save your business and you're in a situation where your choices continue to get eliminated, then you're looking for a new partner, someone who probably is more open to a free market system. And so, we're seeing our new partners or partners flipping back there. But that business on its own is a very challenged business right now. I think the average broker in America is doing, I know, less than one unit a month. I think it's close to 0.6 or 0.7 units a month. And so, regardless of what you're earning per loan, that's going to make it tough. So as Brian and I mentioned, we'll probably see quite a few licensed originators leave the market as we get into 2023, which will be healthy because it will take out a lot of the capacity because they're struggling because of lack of choice that's been now kind of forced upon them. Well, we're doing quite a bit of cash-out. We're doing both first mortgage and second mortgage. It's an interesting situation because as people continue to see their other debt increase, right? So it's always a comparison for clients in general. Is the cost of the mortgage payment going up higher or faster than the cost of credit cards, student loans, other debt instruments that they've got. And as we watch savings drop and people will spend more on their credit cards, they're under more pressure. And so, although it's not always, of course, the right decision for our client to take cash out of their first mortgage, that's why we have the home equity line loan product that we've rolled out. That's why we have our Rocket Loan product that we've rolled out. I think we touched on the fact we've got a beta card in market and other financial products that we'll be rolling out.  So, as we do marketing, and we're bringing clients in and they're joining our rewards program, and then they're thinking about how they're going to save money in a rising rate market, they have access to all those different strategies to benefit their financial situation, not just a cash out on their first mortgage. But today, if I had to take a guess, I would say that we're north of 90% in the industry in terms of people pulling some form of cash out when they do a refinance. Well, I think it's been very warmly received. We've noticed some competitors copying the program with a different name. So that always tells me that it's getting attention. From our perspective, people visiting the Inflation Buster website, which we have a direct landing page for that, phone calls, all those things are up. So it's much more of a direct response-based advertising model, stuff that we've done for years and years in the past, and you can see us \u2013 you'll see us continue to lean into that moving into 2023 with great marketing, but more importantly, a great program.  If you're a client today buying a home and your payment has gone up, $300, $400, $500 from where it had been six, seven months ago, that initial savings is very, very helpful as you move in and pay your moving expenses and sign up to your utilities and by furniture, etc. So I think somewhere close to 20% of all of the purchase transactions we're doing today are choosing to use that program. And remember, we've only been marketing it now for a few weeks. So that's an exciting one and it's a great place to start, and you'll continue to see us launch additional programs that allow our clients to still buy a home even in a rising rate market. Well, our focus here and the technology that our team did an incredible job of rolling out this year is really kind of assisted correspondent. So it's not just kind of buying fully closed loans and not participating in any of the processing of that loan. This is a program that gives brokers another opportunity to take \u2013 have a little bit more flexibility in how they're pricing loans, but it's a similar market. Think of the wholesale broker market and the correspondent or assisted correspondent as a piece that, I'm going to guess, maybe 10% or 12% of the broker market is currently using today. And so, having this program allows us to make sure that we can reach any broker that wants to utilize it, if they want to do assisted correspondent, wonderful, we've got that technology. If they want to stay with the traditional TPO program, we've got that for them as well. But it's yet another tool for us to go out and win market share in the broker community. So that's how I think about it inside of the total broker market share.  Now where that's going? We touched on some of the challenges, I think, that space will face, but we'll be there with the products for all of the brokers who want to take advantage of these great products that we're rolling forward. When we think about, and this goes back to our capital allocation, when we think about all of the opportunities that we've got here on the table and our retail brand, the millions of clients that know Rocket, that have already created an accountant at Rocket, all the services top to bottom funnel that we're building out and have executed or not and now we're just kind of hemming together, for us, we balance that against buying a correspondent loan. It's kind of apples and oranges. We'd rather help that client through the system and then, more importantly, retain that client in our servicing book and help them through the lifetime of their loans. So you'll probably see us spend most of our energies either helping our existing broker base or anyone who wants to join that broker base and in our retail clients. Yes, it's a very good question. It's a great question to end on here. This is exactly why we've been talking about the platform and the engagement tools that we have for our servicing clients, our lead flow that isn't ready to transact yet because \u2013 now through our lens, as opposed to thinking, is this a profitable loan today, yes or no? Which again, you see many lenders out there saying, 'I know I'm only going to do this once, I have no mechanism to retain that client long term, but I just need to layer it on my system, and so I'll do it even if I'm going to lose money to do so. We have the ability to say, let's understand what our retention rate will be with that client over the long term, with purchase, with refinance, with capturing real estate fees when they purchase a new home through our Rocket Homes company, with a personal loan that they may do through Rocket Loans with other additional products now that we've built out that technology to be loan agnostic and gives us the ability to add other loan programs for our client base. So we can filter that through and think about the marketing dollar we're spending today and have much greater confidence on the long-term or the lifetime value of that client, so you may see us do a loan and someone would look and say, on that particular transaction, that loan cost the company $500. I'm making this up, Brian, you can jump in. But we know, based on everything else, they've signed up for the rewards program. They've signed up, let's say, in the future for a credit card or whatever it might be. We know what the retention rate will be and we can apply that future revenue to still make that marketing decision today.  And so, that's exactly why, when I referenced in my remarks, the excitement around the 300-plus technology people that in four months built out the rewards program for us, so critical, because it's that kind of final glue we needed to watch our client base move from website to website, landing page to landing page, product to product, watch that engagement and then allow us to plug that into our marketing decisions, to spend the right marketing dollar for the lifetime value of the client. Yes. Just thanks, everybody, for the great questions. Really excited about the incredible work our team has done this year. As we touched on in the early part of these questions, when times get challenging, the ability for an organization to determine what matters, stay focused, and hold to those priorities is really what separates, I think, successful companies from companies that will struggle. And so, that's been our team and our tech product strategy, our mortgage bankers, operations, everyone here staying focused on the long-term strategies that will lead to the growth \u2013 continued growth of the organization.  So I appreciate everyone who's listening because all of this hard work will pay off for us in 2023 and beyond. We'll see you all at the next call."

            "name": "Brian Brown",
            "content": "Thank you, Jay. And good afternoon, everyone. Before we begin, I'd like to echo Jay's remarks regarding Julie and Angelo. I value my partnership with each of them, and I wish them both the best in their new roles.  As you heard from Jay, the mortgage industry is facing significant headwinds in the second half of the year. Rocket is operating in this difficult environment from a position of financial strength and with clear competitive advantages.  On today's call, I'll cover the actions we're taking to improve our efficiency, including reducing our cost structure by more than $2 billion on an annualized basis. I'll also walk through the investments we're making in the Rocket platform to continue to grow our business over the long term.  It's important to begin by putting 2022 into perspective. Rapid increases in interest rates and declining housing affordability are impacting demand for home purchases and refinancing at the same time. As of mid-October, the industry refinance applications were down 86% year-over-year and home purchase applications were down 37%.  While volume is clearly under pressure, there continues to be substantial excess capacity in the mortgage industry, increasing the competition for every loan. The industry is flooded with loan officers who are struggling to produce. In fact, our estimate suggests that industry volume per loan officer is near an all-time low at less than one loan per loan officer per month. The economics are simply not sustainable, and capacity in the industry will continue to come out.  Against this challenging backdrop, Rocket's third quarter results landed within our guided range for closed loan volume, net rate locks and gain on sale margin. We generated closed loan volume of $25.6 billion, net rate locks of nearly $24 billion and our gain on sale margin was 269 basis points, which was above the midpoint of our guided range.  Rocket Companies generated $888 million of adjusted revenue in the third quarter. We delivered GAAP net income of $96 million, resulting in GAAP EPS of $0.04 per diluted share. On an adjusted EPS basis, we reported a loss of $0.08 per share.  Turning to our balance sheet, Rocket's financial strength is a major strategic advantage for us as we weather the current market environment. We ended the third quarter with $4 billion of available cash and $7.3 billion of mortgage servicing rights. Together, these two assets represent a total of $11.3 billion of value on our balance sheet, equating to more than $5.50 per share.  Our $4 billion of available cash consists of $826 million of cash on the balance sheet, and an additional $3.2 billion of corporate cash used to self-fund loan originations.  Total liquidity stood at $8.8 billion as of September 30, including available cash plus undrawn lines of credit and undrawn MSR lines, which includes a new $1.5 billion MSR facility put in place during the quarter.  As of September 30, our mortgage servicing portfolio included 2.5 million clients with $531 billion in unpaid principal balance. At the end of the third quarter, the value of our mortgage servicing rights was $7.3 billion. This reflects an increase of $1.9 billion year-to-date. During the quarter, the value of the MSR asset increased by $600 million, including a $400 million positive mark-to-market adjustment.  We also drive considerable recurring revenue from mortgage servicing. During the third quarter, we generated $360 million of cash revenue from our servicing book, which represents more than $1.4 billion of cash revenue on an annualized basis. Net client retention remained over 90% in the third quarter, well above the industry average.  Regarding our expenses, we continue to execute a disciplined and prudent approach to cost management. On our last earnings call, we committed to a further reduction in total expenses from the second quarter to the third quarter of $50 million to $150 million. And we did just that, reducing expenses by more than $100 million during the quarter. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we anticipate a further reduction in total expenses of $50 million to $100 million compared to the third quarter.  Over the past 12 months, we have taken significant action to reduce our overall cost structure. In fact, if we look at the third quarter this year compared to the third quarter of last year, on an annualized basis, we have reduced our expenses by more than $2 billion, or approximately one-third of our total costs.  As we navigate and adjust to the current environment, we're continuing our long-term strategy of investing in our platform with an eye toward the future. Rocket leads with competitive advantages in brand, technology, data insights, client experience and client engagement. These competitive advantages are difficult to replicate and help us drive superior unit economics and increased client lifetime value. We are constantly looking to leverage these advantages to reinvest in our business and drive long term growth.  The investments that we're making our platform will expand the top of the funnel and bring more clients into our ecosystem. In the past, we've had considerable success retaining our mortgage servicing portfolio, which today represents 2.5 million clients.  During the record profitability years, 2020 and 2021, nearly half of our mortgage volume came from existing clients already on our platform, all at a nominal client acquisition cost resulting in highly profitable unit economics.  The broader Rocket platform, including Rocket Money, and the recently announced Rocket Rewards program, helps expand our reach and increase conversion across the broader universe of 24 million Rocket accounts. This is crucial because our platform helps keep our clients connected and active, and also helps provide the valuable data and insights needed to make personalized recommendations. So at a size of 24 million accounts and growing, we believe we have a tremendous opportunity in front of us.  The platform can also improve our already industry-leading unit economics. One of the biggest challenges in the mortgage industry is the cost to acquire a client, which typically runs in the thousands of dollars. In contrast, Rocket Money can acquire a new client for less than $100, which is a significant difference.  By bringing clients into our funnel at a lower cost of acquisition and engaging in nurturing them in our ecosystem and building loyalty earlier in their lifecycle, we believe this will be a game changer for Rocket. With a larger top of the funnel and a lower client acquisition costs, higher conversions, deeper client insights and personalized offerings and client retention with increased lifetime value, Rocket has a significant advantage over others in the space.  I would like to emphasize that we are investing with discipline and we are laser focused on tracking our progress and success. This is a process I personally led with our operating leaders and will continue to monitor closely as a CFO Turning to our outlook, we will be transitioning to a revenue-based guidance approach going forward. We believe revenue is a better representation of the totality of Rocket's businesses and more closely aligns with how we manage the company.  Starting in the fourth quarter, we plan to provide one quarter forward-looking guidance on an adjusted revenue basis. This quarter will be the last time that we provide forward-looking guidance on net rate lock volume and gain on sale margin. Rate locks and gain on sale margin will continue to be disclosed in our financial statements.  For the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted revenue to be in the range of $600 million to $750 million, closed loan volume to be in the range of $17 billion to $22 billion and net rate lock volume to be in the range of $15 billion to $21 billion. We anticipate gain on sale margin to be in the range of 230 basis points to 260 basis points, as we expect the impact from promotional products such as Inflation Buster to contribute to a quarter-over-quarter decline in margin.  However, these products are still incrementally profitable to Rocket. The need for innovative products like inflation Buster speaks to the affordability challenges that homebuyers are facing today.  Our guidance assumes that the core mortgage business will continue to face headwinds given the challenging economic environment and that seasonality will also play a role as the fourth quarter is traditionally a seasonally low quarter, especially for homebuying activity.  As always, our forward-looking guidance is based on our current outlook and visibility into the fourth quarter. Despite broader industry and economic headwinds and a challenging market, we are well positioned in the current environment and will continue to invest in the business to drive long-term shareholder value.  With that, we're ready to turn it back to the operator for questions. The only thing I would add is that to be able to do those things isn't an accident either. It's because of the financial strength of the company. And when you look at over $8 billion of equity, over $8 billion of liquidity, and $4 billion of cash on the balance sheet, this is a luxury that others in this space don't have. So this is an enactment that we ended up here. We all knew rates would rise. None of us knew exactly how fast it is, but we're well positioned for this market because of that financial policy and that financial strength. I think, Kevin, the way I think about it is these cost reductions and these expense cuts protect those investments that we're making. And just to reiterate, if we look at Q3 to Q3 of last year, it's $2 billion of costs taken out of the system. That's about a third of our cost structure. In Q2, we said we take out $200 million and we took out $300 million. In Q3, we said we do $50 million to $150 million, and we did over $100 million. And then to your point, Kevin, we've said another $50 million to $100 million this quarter. If we achieve that, that's $2.5 billion over a year or almost 40% of the cost structure. So it's not insignificant and it's important work, and we'll continue doing it. But by doing that, it protects the things that are important for us and those are the growth strategies that Jay talked about. Differentiated assets, right? It has to be a different audience, different product or differentiating assets. But, Ryan, one thing I just wanted to go back to in your earlier comments that I think is worth mentioning, to your point, I'm not trying to be an amateur economist to predict 2023, but what I can talk about is what we're experiencing right now in the fourth quarter. And if you think about the fourth quarter, it's also a seasonally low quarter to begin with. And then, when you go back and you look over time and you look at fourth quarter compared to third quarter where home buying and home purchasing represents the majority of the market, it's down even more traditionally from Q3 to Q4.  And also, Jay made some comments about just the sheer number of loan officers, which is one good way to measure capacity, and we're at a record high in terms of loan officers and we're at a record low \u2013 if you do the division and say how many loans per month per loan officer. So, those two things make us think that the fourth quarter is not also the new normal. We don't know what 2023 will hold necessarily, we're not making predictions there, but it's not fair to base your whole business strategy off a seasonally low quarter either. I'll start, Doug, and I'm sure Jay will have thoughts, too. But it kind of goes back to the previous [indiscernible]. If you think about what we've said in the capital waterfall, the best dollar we spent is reinvesting in the business. We'll continue to be thoughtful around acquisitions, and then we'll return capital, and we're doing essentially exactly what we said we're doing by reinvesting capital into the business right now. And as we talked about, we're not here because of luck, we're here because of planning. We knew and have been thinking a lot about these platform investments over the past couple of years and we planned for it and we saved the liquidity and capital to do it and we plan to continue to do it while we're being thoughtful on the expense side of the house and looking at things that are not key to the operations of this business. Yes, that's exactly right. And to be clear, when we are talking about acquiring clients, we're talking about in a number of ways, through a lifetime value lens and also through a contribution margin lens. And even at these margins that we're talking about here, we're guiding through to Q4, these are positive loan products on a contribution margin basis, defined as revenue minus direct and variable expenses. You mentioned the fixed cost base, and we've talked a lot about that here. But if you think about what makes a platform business a special business, it's superior unit economics, which we have, and we have investments to make them even better, and the scalability, which clearly we've proven a number of times, including in 2020 and 2021."

At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Rocket Companies' Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Sharon Ng, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\nSharon Ng: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Rocket Companies' earnings call covering the second quarter of 2022. With us this afternoon are Rocket Companies' CEO, Jay Farner; our CFO, Julie Booth; and our President and COO, Bob Walters. Before I turn things over to Jay, let me quickly go over our disclaimers. On today's call, we will provide you with the information regarding our second quarter 2022 performance as well as our financial outlook. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations and the assumptions we mentioned today. We encourage you to consider the risk factors contained in our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or further events, except as required by law. This call is being broadcast online and is accessible on our IR website. A recording of the call will be available later today. Our commentary today will also include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP metrics for our reported results can also be found in our earnings release issued earlier today as well as in our filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll turn things over to Jay Farner to get us started. Jay?\nJay Farner: Thank you, Sharon. Good afternoon and welcome to the Rocket Companies' earnings call for the second quarter of 2022. On today's call, I'll share how Rocket is leading during this time of rapid change in the mortgage market and how we're investing in Rocket's future. I'll discuss the transformation of our Rocket services and engagement platform and strengthening of our offerings in both purchase and cash out refinance mortgage products. The mortgage industry has shifted rapidly and is facing challenging times. Volatility and interest rates and declining consumer sentiment have contributed to overall uncertainty about the economy. In this time of flux, we have taken proactive steps to optimize our core mortgage operations by improving lead capture and allocation, launching new products, signing new partnerships and aligning our resources internally. Our senior most leaders, season industry veterans, who have navigated numerous cycles in the 26 years here at Rocket are as close to the business as they've ever been. We are adapting our mortgage operations to the current market environment and we remain focused on managing the business with discipline. Julie will walk through our cost management efforts in more detail a bit later. This is an energizing time for us. Our ability to constantly innovate to serve our clients better through our platform, particularly during these challenging times, will further differentiate us from our competition and will allow us to capture market share over the long-term. Once again, we are revolutionizing the Rocket platform, setting the foundation for our next stage of growth through the use of centralized data across all Rocket businesses, which creates additional touch points to drive revenue. We've always taken a long-term view of our businesses. Through every cycle in our 37 year history, we've adapted, invested and emerged stronger. Our track record has proven that investment into our own business is always the best one that we can make. In fact, we have more than 2,000 team members, including technology, product strategy, data and marketing functions working to expand our client engagement platform. And consequently, the Rocket flywheel is poised to spin faster than ever as we enter 2023. We recently unified the entire Rocket ecosystem by launching Single Sign-On across each of our businesses. In July, we unified more of our businesses under the Rocket umbrella with Truebill, soon to be operated as Rocket Money and Edison Financial, our Canadian digital mortgage brokerage, transitioning to Rocket Mortgage, Canada. These two rebranding initiatives leverage our continued investments in the trusted Rocket brand and draw our businesses closer together. With the Rocket Money rebrand, clients serviced by Rocket Mortgage will enjoy a free Rocket Money premium membership providing access to unlimited budget management tools, our network dashboard, subscription cancellation concierge service, full credit reporting and more. We've been very pleased with our acquisition of Truebill, now known as Rocket Money. And the business is quickly becoming the core of the Rocket engagement platform. Rocket Money has continued to grow rapidly with paying premium members surpassing 2 million in July 2022, more than doubling year-over-year. To put this in perspective, it took Rocket Mortgage nearly 30 years to originate 2 million mortgages. It was only a few years ago that our servicing book surpassed 2 million clients making the growth of Rocket Money even more impressive. Rocket Money has launched its credit card in beta offering unique features like smart pay that help members take control of their credit. The early response is very positive. As I mentioned, Rocket Money provides valuable insights and helps keep clients actively engaged in our ecosystem. For consumers managing their financial lives, especially during times of high inflation, the services Rocket Money provides become even more valuable to its members. The company's members link their financial and credit accounts providing insight into our client's lives, which our industry leading marketing engine can then leverage to help craft bespoke experiences, delivering the right offer to the right client at the right time. Rocket Homes, our home search platform and real estate agent referral network grew overall real estate transactions by 25% from Q2 of 2021 to Q2 of 2022, which is even more impressive considering the overall housing industry declined over that same period. Rocket Homes also notched two record months in the quarter for closed units. The web traffic grew by nearly 60% over that same time period reaching nearly 3 million unique visitors per month. Rocket Solar continues its national expansion in June and is now available in 42 metropolitan areas covering a meaningful portion of the U.S. population, including Arizona, Florida and South Carolina. In addition, as of this week, we are proud to highlight another example of our flywheel in action. As Rocket Solar is now working directly with Rocket Loans to provide solar financing options to our clients. This partnership has made possible by the incredibly flexible AI powered loan decisioning engine and product agnostic platform developed by Rocket Loans over the last few quarters. This is just one of the many examples of our investment in technology continuing to pay off for our company. We look forward to continually growing our solar footprint and expanding the use of the Rocket Loans lending engine through the remainder of 2022 and beyond. As we continue to focus on our future, we're also keeping our sites firmly set on maximizing the opportunities before us. Homeowners are sitting on a record $28 trillion of home equity. The cash out refinance opportunity remains very healthy. We see our clients using cash out refinance to consolidate debt or remodel their existing home. We've also launched a home equity loan product just a few days ago that will provide even more optionality to clients, who may not want to refinance their first mortgage due to favorable terms, but they still want to tap into the equity currently available in their home. To illustrate an example of the power of our platform, we were able to develop and go to market with our new home equity product in just under 60 days by leveraging our flexible technology platform and internal resources. With client insights from Rocket Money, we can offer our home equity loan and other products to come to the right clients at the right times. This client pool represents tremendous future opportunity once they're part of our ecosystem. They may roll their first and second mortgage together when the market is once again right for refinancing or take advantage of other Rocket offerings down the road. The purchase market was more muted than we expected in the second quarter with home buying activity impacted by affordability, inventory and consumer competence. We are prepared and ready to help our clients during these uncertain times and when the macro environment improves. This is exactly why our engagement platform is so crucial. It allows us to keep our clients engaged and active with our brand until the moment they're ready to transact, eliminating the need to market broadly, thus reducing our cost to acquire clients. Over the past few weeks, our capital markets and marketing teams collaborated to launch new products to address our clients' immediate concerns over rate uncertainty. We have placed renewed emphasis on our RateShield program, which gives our purchase clients confidence in a rising rate environment by locking in rates for 90 days while they search for a new home. We also launched our Rate Drop Advantage at the end of July, which provides home buyers with a one-time credit on typical closing costs to refinance their mortgage if rates drop within three years of their purchase, something made possible and profitable by our efficient origination process. We are also very happy to share that we signed two significant premier enterprise relationships. We've entered into a new agreement with global financial leader, Santander, to originate mortgages for the bank. You may remember earlier this year, Santander exited the U.S. mortgage market in light of challenging conditions. We also signed a new partnership with Q2, a banking platform leader, who provides digital banking applications to over 500 financial institutions. We'll work with Q2 to embed the digital Rocket mortgage experience directly into the online banking apps used by their clients. Through the Q2 banking platform partnership, Rocket Mortgage will enable the financial institutions to offer mortgages without the need to manage their own mortgage operations. Consumers will enjoy a comprehensive seamless experience through one app to apply for mortgage, make mortgage payments, deposit checks and build their savings. We're having initial conversations with banks and credit unions now and expect to make this technology available to them in the fall. These challenging markets spurred financial institutions to scale down or exit the mortgage business, creating a compelling case to partner with the industry leader Rocket. More and more financial institutions are seeking out Rocket to help offer mortgage products and in particular purchase mortgage products to their clients without having to make the investment to originate on their own and compete with our strong brand. This is a tailwind for our enterprise partnerships channel and presents an opportunity unique to Rocket to grow our client base and market share. As we look forward, we will invest through the cycle and further prove Rocket's track record of execution. Rocket is incredibly well positioned to seize the opportunities in the financial services space, the mortgage market and beyond by continue to build out our platform and comprehensive end to end home buying and financial services ecosystem. We're excited to continue to move forward in fulfilling our mission to be the best at creating certainty in life's most complex moments, so that our clients can live their dreams. With that I'll turn things over to Julie to go deeper into the numbers.\nJulie Booth: Thank you, Jay, and good afternoon everyone. As we navigate through these challenging and rapidly changing market conditions, Rocket remains focused on serving our clients, executing on our vision and investing in the key areas of our business. I will be sharing some detail on our cost management program, as well as the actions we're taking to drive short-term results while continuing to invest in our long-term growth. Year-to-date we have seen a seismic shift to a smaller mortgage market. The average weekly 30 year fixed rate mortgage jumped from 3.2% at the beginning of the year to nearly 6% at the end of June, the steepest and fastest rise in over 50 years. The rise in rates had a significant impact on rate and term refinance demand. More recently purchase demand has also been affected as consumer sentiment has declined at a rapid pace, the levels not seen in more than a decade and looming apprehension over the economy has driven fears of a potential recession. Consequently consumer behavior has changed significantly and in particular potential home buyers are staying on the sidelines. In Q2, Rocket Companies generated $1.1 billion of adjusted revenue. We delivered GAAP net income of $60 million resulting in GAAP EPS of $0.02 per diluted share. On an adjusted basis, we reported a loss of $0.03 per adjusted share. In the second quarter, gain on sale margin continued to show strength coming in at 292 basis points, which was above the high end of our guided range and largely consistent with recent quarters. As a reminder, Q1 gain on sale margin was 286 basis points after excluding the 15 basis point lift from the one-time benefits associated with the rapid move in bond markets in Q1. We generated closed loan volume of $34.5 billion and net rate locks of $29.4 billion, both coming in around the low end of our guided range. Both net rate lock and closed loan volume were lower than anticipated, largely due to muted demanding purchase attributable to declining consumer sentiment and recession fears. Regarding our expenses, we continued to execute a disciplined and prudent approach to cost management. We communicated on our last earnings call that we would undertake significant cost reduction measures during the second quarter. At that time, we forecasted a roughly $200 million reduction in total expenses from Q1 to Q2. However, as we closely monitored the challenging macro environment during the quarter, we made a concerted effort to accelerate expense reductions. We took additional cost savings measures beyond the career transition plan, including but not limited to marketing, production and other vendor-related costs, which resulted in a reduction in cost of $300 million as compared to the first quarter. Our total expenses in the second quarter were $1.3 billion, down from $1.6 billion in the first quarter, including a partial quarter of savings from our career transition program, which will result in a cost reduction of approximately $50 million on a four-quarter run rate basis. Looking ahead to Q3, we expect our core mortgage business to continue to face headwinds. For the third quarter, we expect closed loan volume in the range of $23 billion to $28 billion and net rate loss volume between $23 billion and $30 billion. We expect third quarter gain on sale margin to be in the range of 250 basis points to 280 basis points. Our guidance assumes that concerns of recession and subdued consumer sentiment will persist throughout the third quarter. As always, our forward-looking guidance is based on our current outlook and visibility into the third quarter. For Q3, we anticipate a further reduction in total expenses of between $50 million and $150 million from Q2 driven by production and marketing-related expenses and the full quarter savings associated with the career transition plans put into affect in Q2. We will continue to be diligent about managing our costs, balancing the current macro environment as well as our long-term objectives. Today's environment accentuates how important it is for us to continue to invest in the Rocket engagement services platforms. The Rocket engagement platform increases the number of clients that we interact with, improves conversion, and lowers our client acquisition costs. Together with the services platform, this enables us to capture market share and grow profitably. Turning to servicing. As we've talked about on prior earnings calls, our servicing book is a strategic asset for Rocket. As of June 30, our servicing portfolio included 2.5 million clients with $538 billion in unpaid principal balance. At the end of Q2, the value of our mortgage servicing rights was $6.7 billion, including newly created MSRs and the mark-to-market adjustment. This reflects an increase of $1.3 billion year-to-date, including a $1.1 billion mark-to-market adjustment due to changes in assumptions. While the mark-to-market change in the MSR portfolio values excluded from our adjusted net income metrics, it's worth noting that the positive market adjustment on the portfolio is countercyclical in a rising rate environment. As a reminder, the mark-to-market increase in value of the servicing portfolio is a result of the assumption that with higher interest rates, prepayment speed slow, which extends servicing cash flows, and therefore our recurring cash generation from this asset will be greater. We also drive a considerable amount of annualized recurring revenue from servicing our clients' mortgages. During the second quarter, annualized recurring cash revenue from our servicing book was over $1.4 billion. When considering the cash flows from our servicing portfolio and Rocket Money formerly known as Truebill, we generate over $1.5 billion of annualized recurring cash revenue as of June 30. As we have shared with you before, the first priority within our capital allocation waterfall is reinvesting in our business even during challenging times. And that's exactly what we're doing today. Jay mentioned in his remarks that our investments over the years have enhanced our ability to emerge stronger from challenging environment. In 2004, we invested in our core operations process, making it vastly more scalable and efficient, which allowed us to grow production by 70% and double our market share in the next three years. In 2008 and 2009 during the financial crisis, we began investing in our brand and held some excess operations capacity, which allowed us to triple our market share over the next few years. For our continued brand investment, Rocket has become the number one most differentiated brand in mortgage. We have made continuous investments in technology over time building our next generation FinTech lending platform, the foundation for Rocket Mortgage, which we launched in 2015. In 2018, as interest rates began to rise, we continued to focus our energy on investing in technology and growing our TPO business. These investments in technology allowed us to more than quadruple our mortgage origination volume from 2018 to 2021. And today our TPO business is the second largest in the space. These examples demonstrate how our continued investment in the business throughout the cycle gives us a competitive advantage and the time to make that investment is upon us once again. We will also maintain a well capitalized balance sheet with substantial liquidity, capable of navigating different market conditions. Our strong balance sheet is one of our many competitive moats. We exited the second quarter with $915 million of cash on the balance sheet and an additional $3.1 billion of corporate cash used to self-fund loan originations for total available cash and self-funding of $4 billion. Total liquidity stood at $7.3 billion as of June 30, including available cash plus undrawn lines of credit and our undrawn MSR line. Since June 30, our total liquidity has increased. As subsequent to the quarter end, we put in place a new $1 billion MSR facility. On a pro forma basis including this new MSR facility, our total liquidity as of June 30 would have been $8.3 billion. Our $4 billion of available cash in self-funding combined with $6.7 billion of mortgage servicing rights represents a total of $10.7 billion of asset value on our balance sheet as of June 30. This equates to $5.42 per share. Despite broader industry headwinds and a challenging market, we remain focused on serving our clients and taking care of our team members. And we are committed to investing in the expansions of our engagement services platforms to position Rocket well to deliver short-term results and drive long-term growth. We will continue to deploy our capital in a strategic and disciplined manner to generate long-term shareholder value. Before we turn the call over to the operator, I wanted to make you aware that our inaugural ESG report for 2021 can be found on the Social Impact tab on our IR website. This first ESG report highlights Rocket\u2019s for more than profit philosophy and approach and the positive impact Rocket has made on our community and our environment. With that, we are ready to turn it back to the operator for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ryan Nash. [Goldman Sachs] Your line is open.\nRyan Nash: Hey, good afternoon, everyone.\nJay Farner: Hey, Ryan.\nRyan Nash: Jay, maybe to kick it off, I know in the remark \u2013 in your opening remarks, you mentioned that you're going to continue to execute on a prudent cost management approach. I think you even said another $50 million to $150 million of cost reduction next quarter. Can you maybe just talk a little bit more about what's driving some of the cost declines? And if we're going to be in a mortgage market, sub 2 trillion, I guess how much more cost leverage is there beyond? What you've identified and where do you think you can maybe take the run rate too in this kind of environment?\nJay Farner: Yes, I'll let Julie make some comments on how we think about the cost moving past Q3. But I think just to frame up how we think about this, we've got our core mortgage business, right? And so, although I look across all of RKT, I think about the operations, underwriting core mortgage technology, and how that is functioning on different mortgage volumes. And we strive to have that as a profitable part of our business. We then have our platform and we talked a lot about that in my prepared remarks, because if you think about a mortgage market, whether it's 1.7 trillion, 1.8 trillion, 2 trillion, and no one's sure, but you've got to find a way to bring down the cost to acquire. And what you're watching right now in the industry is there's still too much capacity and people are fighting very hard for every particular loan that may be out there. And so strategically win in the long run. We've got to make sure that our engagement rates with our clients are up. Our lead flow is still very, very strong, but not every client is ready to transact right now. In particular, we reference this, the purchase market has slowed a bit because people are concerned about the increase in their monthly payment. So how do we stay engaged with that client? How do we increase conversion of those leads over time, driving down our cost to acquire and increasing the lifetime value of the client. We've done a lot of work on the services side of our platform. So offering homes, offering auto, offering solar, which is growing rapidly. But the acquisition of Truebill, now Rocket Money, that's our engagement side of the platform with the budgeting, with the managing of assets in the balance sheet, with the managing of credit, with the subscription canceling. And we will, as we move forward into the second half of this year, we'll make further announcements about how we're going to engage with that client base daily, weekly, monthly, those efforts and now nearly 2,000 or over 2,000 people are focused on that here. And that's the strategic advantage really referenced that. Every so often we've got to put a lot of effort into something outside of core mortgage to grow the overall platform and grow mortgage. And so back to your question, that's what you're watching us do right now. We're taking those resources, those salaries, and we're accelerating that engagement component of our platform. So as we get into 2023 and what we expect to still be a fairly challenging mortgage market, that lead flow that we're generating will be staying in our ecosystem, staying in contact with us, and we will drive down the cost to acquire, thereby allowing us to actually spend more on marketing and drive more mortgage value and take market share. So we can continue to work on expense reduction. And again, Julie will touch on that, but really the focus is taking the assets that we have, our team members and accelerating our ability to drive revenue growth. And that's what you're seeing us do in Q2. That's what you're seeing us do in Q3. And the expense reduction is coming more from the career transition plan that we did. Our team is doing an amazing job of working through all of our vendors and contract costs. And we're just getting smarter about that. But we've got to keep putting money into the tech, the product strategy, the data science, because that's how we're going to grow market share in a more challenging mortgage market in 2023. Julie, I'll let you add comments.\nJulie Booth: Sure. I'll make a few comments on expenses here just to add to that. So looking at the second quarter here, we've reduced expenses by $300 million over the first quarter and exceeded our target of $200 million by $100 million. So we've really taken a lot of moves to reduce our cost into the quarter here. And as we look ahead into the third quarter, we have opportunity of about another $100 million. So if you add all that up $400 million, that's an annual run rate of $1.6 billion of savings. So significant cost reduction has already taken place. As we look ahead, there's more opportunity. We do believe, as Jay mentioned on the vendor cost side of things. Some of these things take a little bit longer to work into as our contracts mature, as we look at how these are going to be coming for renegotiation. We will still see some of these cost savings happening going forward as well. So there's opportunity there. The actual attrition we believe there will be some of that. We will continue to fall throughout the year [indiscernible].\nRyan Nash: Got it. That was very helpful color and context regarding the entire platform and how do you think about it. So maybe if I could just squeeze in one follow up, Julie or Jay, so rates have obviously come in a bit and I'm just wondering, do you think this at all helps the trajectory of volumes, particularly on the refinance side? And do you think 3Q represents the trough for volumes just based on the market conditions and if so or not, what do you see as the drivers of originations from here if market sentiment doesn't improve as Jay you highlighted, you expect 2023 to be challenging to, what do you see as the drivers of originations as we look forward given the uncertainty in the economic backdrop?\nJay Farner: Yes. I think that in a moment where you\u2019ve got to transform your business, and how you\u2019re thinking about it. The current environment that we\u2019re in is causing like I said, a lot of kind of scrambling, and scraping and so forth, more capacity has to come out. We\u2019re very fortunate in our ability to continue to invest. And I touched on this, it\u2019s not investing in, although we have a little excess capacity that excess capacity for us is staying around because as we implement all these things, we\u2019re working on with our engagement platform for the rest of this year. And that drives market share game we\u2019ll need that capacity as we move into 2023, as we grow our market share again. So it would make a lot of sense for us to go through a significant capacity reduction only to turn around and have to hire again, four or five months later. But I don\u2019t see a lot of people in the mortgage space making the millions and millions and millions of dollars of monthly investment that we\u2019re making in an engagement platform like that. I don\u2019t see folks signing up, partners like Santander, like we are. And so I think we\u2019re going to see the rest of the industry contract as we continue to move forward. And without something that allows you to bring a client onto your platform and continue to work with them, maybe it\u2019s a second mortgage product that we just released. Another thing that, again, without our tech platform, there\u2019s no way we could go on from not having that to doing all the programming, creating the docs and launching it less than 60 days. Our capital markets team is working on additional products that we\u2019ll launch as we get into the second half of this year to help our client base. So, we\u2019re going to leverage all of that tech, but those type of things that will allow us for a market share, if you don\u2019t have those things, I think it\u2019s going to be a challenge for you to grow market share as we finish up this year, and roll into 2023.\nRyan Nash: Thanks a lot for the colors.\nJay Farner: All right, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker [Piper Sandler]. Your line is open.\nKevin Barker: Great. Thanks for all the color on the operating efficiencies. Just a follow up question, some of that what Ryan\u2019s already asked. You had $1.3 billion of expenses, was there any additional $61 million in there from the changes in the movement of employees, embedded in that $1.3 billion? And then where could we expect a lot of the expenses to come out within going into that third quarter, is a lot of it G&A and marketing expense? Or is it other items that can really drive is some of the efficiencies that you laid out?\nJay Farner: Yes, we\u2019ve got continued thoughts around marketing, although as you probably know from a performance marketing perspective. We\u2019re very thoughtful about making sure that we don\u2019t cut anything that is profitable for us there. And again, as we start getting more and more signal around how that marketing will work, not only in the short run, but the long run it allows for us to continue to spend marketing there. We\u2019ll continue to see attrition, as Julie talked about, we\u2019re being really thoughtful about that. If there\u2019s attrition in places that are critical for us, from a technology perspective to keep building out the platform, then we can \u2013 we will backfill, but in another places we won\u2019t. And so to continuously those salaries drop there\u2019s additional work with the vendors and contracts that we\u2019ve got as Julie referenced before. Even once you go through and identify areas where you need to make adjustments, either renegotiating and or waiting for contracts to season can take a bit of time. It\u2019s not something you can work through in a matter of a month or a quarter. So all that work continues forward and will continue to move forward. And we\u2019re pretty diligent about it. We\u2019ve got a great team here in our procurement group and they\u2019re working every single day to be smart, but I just want to reiterate smart, but also making sure that we have all the proper resources to do what we\u2019ve always done in years past, which is to grow market share. And so, as we think about the expenses, and we think about the revenue, we\u2019ll continue to work on the expenses, but our main focus is driving up that revenue by bringing down the increase in the conversion rates and bringing down the cost to acquire our clients. And that\u2019s what I referenced in my remarks. Our senior leader team, we\u2019re dedicating many, many hours a week reviewing line by line where all of our resources are at the work that is being done. I\u2019ve not seen, I\u2019m not going to say that this is more intense than ever before, but we are an equal intensity than we\u2019ve ever been in the 27 years. I\u2019ve been at the organization in terms of being all over these projects. And I\u2019m watching a team of people that are highly energized because they see the work that we\u2019re doing that no one else is doing that will really differentiate this company moving forward to be far broader than just a mortgage lender. So Julie, if you have any, anything I\u2019ve missed there?\nJulie Booth: The only thing I\u2019ll add to that, have you asked a question about the $61 million in career transition expenses, you\u2019re correct that $1.3 billion does include $61 million of expenses in connection with that career transition program. We have couple of non-recurring items this quarter, that was a $24 million item as well related to just the tax adjustments so we made. So expenses would\u2019ve been $1.276 billion in the second quarter, had not been for those couple of adjustments.\nKevin Barker: Okay, great. And then your leverage is very low. You have a lot of cash. You mentioned that over $8 billion access to liquidity today on a pro form of basis, is there anything you could do to potentially accelerate your revenue diversification efforts, besides, which you\u2019ve already built within Rocket Homes, or Rocket Auto perhaps maybe look at M&A opportunities to potentially diversify or offset some of the revenue headwinds you see on the mortgage side?\nJay Farner: Yes, I think that\u2019s a great question. And we\u2019ve got our team out constantly looking at those opportunities. If you think about the waterfall approach, you\u2019ve got the bottom services layer that actually generates the true revenue Mortgage, Homes, Auto, Solar is growing rapidly. I know, I kind of touched on it just briefly, but all the tech work that we did in Rocket Loans to really build an AI-driven loan agnostic technology platform. So, whether it\u2019s a solar loan today and a auto refinance loan for an example, tomorrow, that tech allows us to do that very quickly. So that\u2019s the revenue component of that. You\u2019ve got the top of the funnel, whether it\u2019s our Quicken Loans site, our Core Digital, LowerMyBills site, our Rocket Mortgage site, other assets we\u2019re building, then you\u2019ve got the middle layer, the engagement layer. So as we drive traffic in, you\u2019ve got to find a way to make sure that you can engage that high end base. And so when we think about M&A, you think about other services you can add to drive revenue, and you think about other ways to drive top of the funnel. It\u2019s a critical that we \u2013 that\u2019s why we said 2,000 people accelerating the growth of the engagement layer, because that\u2019s the kind of secret sauce that unlocks our ability to bring the clients in, keep the clients in. And that\u2019s why the growth of Truebill doubling in a year is so exciting. Because it\u2019s taken us so many years to get to a place where we\u2019ve gotten north of two million people now, I think almost 2.6 million in our servicing book. But to watch and be able to add millions of people a year where they\u2019re linking their bank accounts, where we have access to their credit data, their asset data that informs all those up funnel to how we\u2019re buying leads or engaging with classic goes down funnel into how we generate revenue. That component is critical. So that\u2019s why we really are trying to point out. The work we did the last two quarters. And the work we do the next two quarters. It gets us to kind of Phase 1 completion of that engagement layer, which unlocks all the other M&A activity that we\u2019re doing right now.\nKevin Barker: Okay. So in regards to M&A you still see it as an opportunity we\u2019re still looking at things right now, even in the market [ph]. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Jay.\nJay Farner: This is correct. Yes.\nKevin Barker: Thank you, Jay.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Doug Harter [Credit Suisse]. Your line is open.\nDoug Harter: Thanks. Can you just talk about the impact on rates that you\u2019re seeing on both purchase, and cash out refinance kind of as you went through the second quarter into the third?\nJay Farner: Yes. Certainly I think we\u2019re all seeing the fact that\u2019s taken many consumers out of the market right now. That was why growing the second mortgage home equity loan was so critical for us, because it allows us to monetize lease flow today. But more importantly, it allows to put that client into our servicing portfolio and into Rocket Money and be there to service them tomorrow. So, we\u2019ve really got a waterfall approach here. The first to cash out refinance on the primary mortgage. The second is the \u2013 second HELOC loan, we\u2019ve now just rolled a few days ago, maybe last week, if I remember correctly. And then we\u2019ve got our Rocket Loans loan for those that don\u2019t fit. I know we referenced the fact that our beta credit card from Truebill was in market. So, we\u2019re really stacking a full suite of products that allow a client who\u2019s looking for cash out. And I think we\u2019re all watching the word comes out every week that consumer debt continues to grow. And as inflation occurs that the variable rates keep rising. So there\u2019s more and more demand. We\u2019ve just got to have a full product selection for those clients. And again, I think we uniquely position to health clients across the board where others that we compete with aren\u2019t. Now purchase is another interesting thing, because if slight increase in interest rate is fine, certainly for all purchasers, but first time home buyers as well, the increase we\u2019ve seen probably pooled off purchases more than we had expected going from Q2 and into Q3, which is reflected in some of our guidance. Our team is working on ways to solve that for consumers to help them have an affordable payment and still purchase a home and we\u2019ll talk more about that as we get into further \u2013 future kind of earnings calls or press releases when we can discuss those things. So it is having an impact. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so critical that all these other investments that we\u2019re making we accelerate. So, we can find those avenues to grow even as the mortgage market itself may shrink for a while.\nDoug Harter: I guess, just to follow up Jay, on kind of what the economics look like on home equity loans, if you looking to sell those to someone else would you put those on your balance sheet what type of gain on sale margins might you be able to generate on those?\nJay Farner: Yes. We\u2019re in a unique position to be thoughtful about that. And as you know, we use some of our cash do sell funding for a while, especially when there\u2019s a nice opportunity for us to gain interest income on that. In most cases, at some point in time, we do wind up securitizing or selling mortgages, whether they\u2019re first or seconds. And so we\u2019ll kind of continue to keep that same philosophy there. So that\u2019s kind of how we think about. From an economics perspective, I think it\u2019s really important to remember, although the revenue, because these loan sizes are smaller, although the revenue is lower, the cost of price underwriting close we\u2019ve already got capacity, number one. And number two, there\u2019s no cost to acquire. Those types are already here, we\u2019re already bringing them in up for a first mortgage. And so if the second makes more sense, we\u2019re not incurring any additional marketing costs. So at the end of the day, the profitability and the loan still looks good, even if the loan size is closer to a $100,000 versus $200,000 and $250,000. So that\u2019s how we think about that particular product. And then again, as I referenced, there\u2019s other products that follow after that, again, all of those represent revenue opportunity plan engagement with no cost to acquire.\nDoug Harter: Thanks, Jay.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette [Morgan Stanley]. Your line is open.\nJay Farner: Hi, James.\nBlake Netter: Hi, this is actually Blake Netter on the line for James. Thanks for taking my questions.\nJay Farner: Sure.\nBlake Netter: So first off in the current environment your strong balance sheet gives you the flexibility to play offense and defense. So looking ahead, how are you planning on leveraging this optionality to your advantage?\nJay Farner: Well, I think we\u2019ve touched a bit on it already, but we\u2019re going to continue to be prudent around our expense management. I think Julie and team did an incredible job of kind of exceeding our expectations in Q2. And as I referenced already, the group is all over the next quarters as well to ensure that we\u2019re being thoughtful there. But the other caller had had asked, the first step is the folks that we\u2019ve got on the building the engagement platform and all the services I talked about, if we were to go back in time five or 10 years, and we didn\u2019t have all of these opportunities, you wouldn\u2019t have those 2,000 plus people working on it. Right. And so that\u2019s why I referenced. We kind of think about, or I think about the business in three tranches, mortgage kind of separate, and then you\u2019ve got this investment. So in the services and engagement platform, and that\u2019s how I think about it. It\u2019s a capital investment that we\u2019re making because the best use of our capital is to build out this technology that maximizes our marketing, that reduces our cost to acquire that increases our lifetime value. So when we think about our investments, we say what\u2019s out there from an M&A perspective? What could we build internally? And how do we get to this place where we grow market share in 2023? And that\u2019s where we\u2019re putting a big chunk of our capital right now is that internal investment in technology. But we\u2019ve also got Scott Elkins and our kind of the acquisitions team out there looking at opportunity. We need to be thoughtful about the fact that we\u2019re not all the way through this cycle. And so others who don\u2019t have the same ability to invest may continue to see their value drop. And if so, we\u2019ll be thoughtful about when, and if we pull the trigger on those acquisitions, when it\u2019s the right timing, but certainly one very strong possibility for us to get into niche markets that we want to enter into that fits nicely into our ecosystem.\nBlake Netter: Okay, great. And as a quick follow up given where the markets heading, how much in operating losses are you willing to endure? Would you sell some of the MSR books to reduce cash burn, or conversely, would you be willing to buy servicing portfolios of others in your \u2013 as you seek to gain market share?\nJay Farner: Well, buying MSR is very interesting, especially as we think about how those MSRs will interact inside of everything I\u2019ve just described to get not only short term returns, but better lifetime value. And certainly we\u2019ve demonstrated the fact that we\u2019re thoughtful, but not afraid to deploy some of our cash or have a small burn. Like you just talked about if we\u2019re deploying it in technology and product strategy, building tech, that\u2019s going to build our business. And that\u2019s where that capital\u2019s doing today. But more of our focus is, how do we leverage that to grow market share in 2023, which will make us a stronger company. And that\u2019s where our mindset is here. It\u2019s not a long-term thought around burning cash. It\u2019s about investing now to see growth in 2023.\nBlake Netter: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mihir Bhatia [Bank of America]. Your line is open.\nMihir Bhatia: Hi, good afternoon. And thank you for taking my question. I wanted to maybe just touch on the partnerships a little bit. You announced Santander in Q2 today, maybe just expand a little bit on those partnerships specifically, actually on the Q2, just is that tied to the sales force partnership you previously announced? Or is this just another way to serve credit unions? And just generally maybe to broaden out the discussion also, it seems like you\u2019re leaning in a little bit on partnerships here over the last few quarters. Maybe just talk at a high level about that decision. Is it just driving more volume to the platform? What happens once the customer is on your platform? Can you actually treat them as Rocket customers or [indiscernible] customers of the bottom? Thanks.\nJay Farner: Yes, that, I think you\u2019ve kind of touched on all the reasons why we\u2019re very interested in this. We think that partnership opportunities will accelerate because all the questions we\u2019re getting here, many folks who engage in mortgages, one of their business lines will probably decide to move out of that space as we continue forward through the end of this year and into next year, creating opportunity for us to step in and be there, their mortgage partner. And this is really leveraging the technology, the client experience and the brand that we\u2019ve built. If someone\u2019s thinking of getting out of the space, but wants to remain offering that for their client. I think we\u2019re really obvious choice for them. And so that we think that partnerships will, will continue. Q2 is different than sales force, similar concept, but different technology platform that we\u2019re using. So sales force gives us reach into a certain set of banks and credit unions. Now Q2 gives us reach into another set of hundreds of banks and credit unions. And so it\u2019s an exciting moment in time. And through the end of this year, we\u2019ll be finding those first banks and credit unions and plugging them in as we enter into 2023. So partnerships are strong. It\u2019s a we\u2019re differentiated in that space. And so you\u2019ll continue to see us do more and more of that as we move forward.\nMihir Bhatia: Thank you. And then just, if I could just follow up one, but you mentioned, we\u2019ve talked a little bit about your strong balance sheet. I did want to ask, even on quite a few products now, solar, home equity, credit card, how much, how many of those are you funding off your balance sheet currently? And is that like the near term goal is like, just fund those off the balance sheet and as they grow then diversify out to other partners? Or do you have partners for something like credit card where there\u2019s like actually an issuing partner its small for brand like relationship?\nJay Farner: Well, as we always talk about, Julie can comment, we\u2019re a capital light business. So, if we see an opportunity to leverage the, the cash that we have for a short period of time to cause it\u2019s nice spread between the lending rate and where we\u2019re either borrowing money or using your own cash, we\u2019ll do it. But it\u2019s a small portion of the lending with you because in the end we\u2019re selling those loans to partners, et cetera, securitizing them. We\u2019re not going to hold them for a long period of time.\nJulie Booth: That\u2019s why I completely agree, Jay, and as we think about these new products that we\u2019re getting into, we do look to sell those into either a whole loan market or into a securitization. If there is a market for that right now, there\u2019s not a group securitization market. So, we have some loan sales arrangement setup for those products so that we, while we may finance them for a short period time, when we\u2019ll be selling those and having those be off of our balance sheet.\nMihir Bhatia: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries [Barclays]. Your line is open.\nMark DeVries: Yeah. Thank you. Jay, I think you mentioned several times, you see the need for industry to remove capacity. Interesting to getting your thoughts on how long you think it\u2019ll take for capacity to fully rationalize go to the industry and kind of what the implications are for margins over the coming quarters?\nJay Farner: Yes, it certainly has taken longer than we have seen in the past. I think that\u2019s a function of course, of 2020 and 2021 and people building up reserves. And so their ability to kind of hang on through the cycle a bit longer than usual. I don\u2019t know, if I have a crystal ball to tell you when the capacity will come out, but I have a feeling we\u2019ll see that steadily happen here, moving forward. There\u2019s the strategic advantage I\u2019ve already touched on whether there\u2019s excess capacity or not, for our ability to drive down the cost to acquire, which is more powerful than 10 basis points or 15 basis points in margin in either direction. The other important component, and I\u2019ll bring this up now, as we have multiple business lines and we think about our gain on sale margin. One of those, of course, is our TPO lining, and we\u2019ve got a great set of partners. We work with them very, very closely. We\u2019re going to be launching new products for them as we get into the second half of steer to strengthen their business. But we\u2019ve also made it very, very clear that moving forward, if you\u2019re not a partner of ours, we will be taking advantage of all of our data, information, our massive sales force, their incredible skill to win those partners over into our retail channel. And so we\u2019ve launched some initiatives here in the last a few months to really dial that in strategically find each one of those clients and start bringing them aboard. So that\u2019ll change a have an impact on margin as well as we move more towards that retail channel, winning those clients again, protecting the third party originators that are partners of ours, but being very clear about the fact that we\u2019re going to be full steam ahead, if you\u2019re not a partner of ours winning those clients onto the Rocket platform using our retail group.\nMark DeVries: Okay, great. And just a question for Julie on the margin guidance looks like you\u2019re calling for a little bit of weakness, Q-over-Q. Is that a reflection of you expect a little bit more weakness across channels? Or is it more of a mixed shift to lower margin partner channel?\nJulie Booth: It is attributable to mix and that is driving at decrease in margin. We are seeing the direct-to-consumer margin holding very nicely quarter-over-quarter. And the other thing that\u2019s impacting margins is that in July, as we have moved around with it, we do have MSR component of the gain on sale margin. That was a fairly significant driver of our guide down as well. And that changes quarter-to-quarter, but that was part of it too.\nMark DeVries: Got it. And then just one last quick one on the Santander partnership, are they going to be offering that in their branches or is this going to be exclusively a digital offering for them?\nJay Farner: No, I think it\u2019s across the board, how they\u2019re going to interact. So, they\u2019ll be offering that. My understanding is to the loan officers that are in their branch system that can plug directly in and guide clients into our Rocket ecosystem.\nJay Farner: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Arren Cyganovich [Citi]. Your line is open.\nArren Cyganovich: Thanks. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the Rocket Solar opportunity, and how are you having these loans funded? Are they in being used in warehouse lines and then sold to bank partners? Or is it purely capital markets? Just curious, because they\u2019re generally solar loans are fairly large in size.\nJay Farner: Well, yes, a few things and just taking a step back on solar. There\u2019s three really important components here. Number one, and I know I point this out a lot. We are assisting the millions of clients that come to us for a mortgage. And so it\u2019s an interesting opportunity for us because there\u2019s no cost to require these clients as we bring them into our solar platform. Number two, we\u2019re engaging in the actual assistance, helping the clients plan out the solar. So it\u2019s not just financing, we\u2019re doing the sales of that as well. And there\u2019s a nice revenue opportunity attached to that component. Now, the thing that we\u2019ve just plugged in is the actual solar financing itself. And so Rocket Loans will be providing that, when it\u2019s appropriate, we like to leave ourselves many solar partners, including Rocket Loans. And then of course, once the solar loan is originated within 12 months to 18 months, typically people will roll the solar into their first mortgage. So, we\u2019ll really create, we\u2019ve got lower expenses that our competition, while we create three revenue opportunities through that client, as we help them, save money, on their utility bills. And of course, they are very excited about helping the environment as well. Now, Julie can just \u2013 kind of speak to what we\u2019re doing or what Rocket Loans is doing with the solar loan itself. Because you have flexibility there too.\nJulie Booth: Yes. As I mentioned, when we enter into new products, we do look to get liquidity in markets for those, what we\u2019re doing in solar for right now is self-funding those at the point of origination, but it will be for a very short period of times, we do have a partner that will be buying those loans from us. We may look to get warehouse financing down the road if we need it right now, though, we\u2019ve got the capital to be able to do that while we start up this channel.\nArren Cyganovich: Okay. Got it. And there\u2019s just another question on, on the expense decline the, how much of the, say roughly 400 million over the, the next quarter and in this past quarter is variable. Because you\u2019re, I would assume that a decent amount of that is, is variable just cause your, your production levels have dropped off a decent amount.\nJulie Booth: Yes. A portion of that is certainly variable. When you think about the, the commissions that we have, the production costs that we have associated with origination that did come down, but a substantial portion of this is us looking at additional vendor costs that we can impact through contract renegotiation other things that we are doing to impact those costs. So it is a mix of both looking at marketing, marketing, and down, as you saw by about a $100 million quarter-after-over and other things that we\u2019re doing outside of production to impact those costs. That answer\u2019s your question.\nOperator: This concludes the Q&A session. Jay Farner CEO. I turn the call back over to you.\nJay Farner: Thank you. And thanks everybody for joining today. And in particular, thank you to the team members for joining, as I\u2019ve said here on the call and in the correspondence, I\u2019ll be sending out shortly. The opportunity that we have right now in this market to lean in, to invest and to differentiate and really transform this company again is, is like maybe the four or five times prior that Julie referenced in her remarks. And so we appreciate all of your commitment to what we\u2019re doing because it\u2019s going to make all the difference in the world as we grow this company moving forward. So thanks to all of our team members and thanks everybody joining we\u2019ll see you next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Julie Booth",
            "content": "Thank you, Jay, and good afternoon everyone. As we navigate through these challenging and rapidly changing market conditions, Rocket remains focused on serving our clients, executing on our vision and investing in the key areas of our business. I will be sharing some detail on our cost management program, as well as the actions we're taking to drive short-term results while continuing to invest in our long-term growth. Year-to-date we have seen a seismic shift to a smaller mortgage market. The average weekly 30 year fixed rate mortgage jumped from 3.2% at the beginning of the year to nearly 6% at the end of June, the steepest and fastest rise in over 50 years. The rise in rates had a significant impact on rate and term refinance demand. More recently purchase demand has also been affected as consumer sentiment has declined at a rapid pace, the levels not seen in more than a decade and looming apprehension over the economy has driven fears of a potential recession. Consequently consumer behavior has changed significantly and in particular potential home buyers are staying on the sidelines. In Q2, Rocket Companies generated $1.1 billion of adjusted revenue. We delivered GAAP net income of $60 million resulting in GAAP EPS of $0.02 per diluted share. On an adjusted basis, we reported a loss of $0.03 per adjusted share. In the second quarter, gain on sale margin continued to show strength coming in at 292 basis points, which was above the high end of our guided range and largely consistent with recent quarters. As a reminder, Q1 gain on sale margin was 286 basis points after excluding the 15 basis point lift from the one-time benefits associated with the rapid move in bond markets in Q1. We generated closed loan volume of $34.5 billion and net rate locks of $29.4 billion, both coming in around the low end of our guided range. Both net rate lock and closed loan volume were lower than anticipated, largely due to muted demanding purchase attributable to declining consumer sentiment and recession fears. Regarding our expenses, we continued to execute a disciplined and prudent approach to cost management. We communicated on our last earnings call that we would undertake significant cost reduction measures during the second quarter. At that time, we forecasted a roughly $200 million reduction in total expenses from Q1 to Q2. However, as we closely monitored the challenging macro environment during the quarter, we made a concerted effort to accelerate expense reductions. We took additional cost savings measures beyond the career transition plan, including but not limited to marketing, production and other vendor-related costs, which resulted in a reduction in cost of $300 million as compared to the first quarter. Our total expenses in the second quarter were $1.3 billion, down from $1.6 billion in the first quarter, including a partial quarter of savings from our career transition program, which will result in a cost reduction of approximately $50 million on a four-quarter run rate basis. Looking ahead to Q3, we expect our core mortgage business to continue to face headwinds. For the third quarter, we expect closed loan volume in the range of $23 billion to $28 billion and net rate loss volume between $23 billion and $30 billion. We expect third quarter gain on sale margin to be in the range of 250 basis points to 280 basis points. Our guidance assumes that concerns of recession and subdued consumer sentiment will persist throughout the third quarter. As always, our forward-looking guidance is based on our current outlook and visibility into the third quarter. For Q3, we anticipate a further reduction in total expenses of between $50 million and $150 million from Q2 driven by production and marketing-related expenses and the full quarter savings associated with the career transition plans put into affect in Q2. We will continue to be diligent about managing our costs, balancing the current macro environment as well as our long-term objectives. Today's environment accentuates how important it is for us to continue to invest in the Rocket engagement services platforms. The Rocket engagement platform increases the number of clients that we interact with, improves conversion, and lowers our client acquisition costs. Together with the services platform, this enables us to capture market share and grow profitably. Turning to servicing. As we've talked about on prior earnings calls, our servicing book is a strategic asset for Rocket. As of June 30, our servicing portfolio included 2.5 million clients with $538 billion in unpaid principal balance. At the end of Q2, the value of our mortgage servicing rights was $6.7 billion, including newly created MSRs and the mark-to-market adjustment. This reflects an increase of $1.3 billion year-to-date, including a $1.1 billion mark-to-market adjustment due to changes in assumptions. While the mark-to-market change in the MSR portfolio values excluded from our adjusted net income metrics, it's worth noting that the positive market adjustment on the portfolio is countercyclical in a rising rate environment. As a reminder, the mark-to-market increase in value of the servicing portfolio is a result of the assumption that with higher interest rates, prepayment speed slow, which extends servicing cash flows, and therefore our recurring cash generation from this asset will be greater. We also drive a considerable amount of annualized recurring revenue from servicing our clients' mortgages. During the second quarter, annualized recurring cash revenue from our servicing book was over $1.4 billion. When considering the cash flows from our servicing portfolio and Rocket Money formerly known as Truebill, we generate over $1.5 billion of annualized recurring cash revenue as of June 30. As we have shared with you before, the first priority within our capital allocation waterfall is reinvesting in our business even during challenging times. And that's exactly what we're doing today. Jay mentioned in his remarks that our investments over the years have enhanced our ability to emerge stronger from challenging environment. In 2004, we invested in our core operations process, making it vastly more scalable and efficient, which allowed us to grow production by 70% and double our market share in the next three years. In 2008 and 2009 during the financial crisis, we began investing in our brand and held some excess operations capacity, which allowed us to triple our market share over the next few years. For our continued brand investment, Rocket has become the number one most differentiated brand in mortgage. We have made continuous investments in technology over time building our next generation FinTech lending platform, the foundation for Rocket Mortgage, which we launched in 2015. In 2018, as interest rates began to rise, we continued to focus our energy on investing in technology and growing our TPO business. These investments in technology allowed us to more than quadruple our mortgage origination volume from 2018 to 2021. And today our TPO business is the second largest in the space. These examples demonstrate how our continued investment in the business throughout the cycle gives us a competitive advantage and the time to make that investment is upon us once again. We will also maintain a well capitalized balance sheet with substantial liquidity, capable of navigating different market conditions. Our strong balance sheet is one of our many competitive moats. We exited the second quarter with $915 million of cash on the balance sheet and an additional $3.1 billion of corporate cash used to self-fund loan originations for total available cash and self-funding of $4 billion. Total liquidity stood at $7.3 billion as of June 30, including available cash plus undrawn lines of credit and our undrawn MSR line. Since June 30, our total liquidity has increased. As subsequent to the quarter end, we put in place a new $1 billion MSR facility. On a pro forma basis including this new MSR facility, our total liquidity as of June 30 would have been $8.3 billion. Our $4 billion of available cash in self-funding combined with $6.7 billion of mortgage servicing rights represents a total of $10.7 billion of asset value on our balance sheet as of June 30. This equates to $5.42 per share. Despite broader industry headwinds and a challenging market, we remain focused on serving our clients and taking care of our team members. And we are committed to investing in the expansions of our engagement services platforms to position Rocket well to deliver short-term results and drive long-term growth. We will continue to deploy our capital in a strategic and disciplined manner to generate long-term shareholder value. Before we turn the call over to the operator, I wanted to make you aware that our inaugural ESG report for 2021 can be found on the Social Impact tab on our IR website. This first ESG report highlights Rocket's for more than profit philosophy and approach and the positive impact Rocket has made on our community and our environment. With that, we are ready to turn it back to the operator for questions. Sure. I'll make a few comments on expenses here just to add to that. So looking at the second quarter here, we've reduced expenses by $300 million over the first quarter and exceeded our target of $200 million by $100 million. So we've really taken a lot of moves to reduce our cost into the quarter here. And as we look ahead into the third quarter, we have opportunity of about another $100 million. So if you add all that up $400 million, that's an annual run rate of $1.6 billion of savings. So significant cost reduction has already taken place. As we look ahead, there's more opportunity. We do believe, as Jay mentioned on the vendor cost side of things. Some of these things take a little bit longer to work into as our contracts mature, as we look at how these are going to be coming for renegotiation. We will still see some of these cost savings happening going forward as well. So there's opportunity there. The actual attrition we believe there will be some of that. We will continue to fall throughout the year [indiscernible]. The only thing I'll add to that, have you asked a question about the $61 million in career transition expenses, you're correct that $1.3 billion does include $61 million of expenses in connection with that career transition program. We have couple of non-recurring items this quarter, that was a $24 million item as well related to just the tax adjustments so we made. So expenses would've been $1.276 billion in the second quarter, had not been for those couple of adjustments. That's why I completely agree, Jay, and as we think about these new products that we're getting into, we do look to sell those into either a whole loan market or into a securitization. If there is a market for that right now, there's not a group securitization market. So, we have some loan sales arrangement setup for those products so that we, while we may finance them for a short period time, when we'll be selling those and having those be off of our balance sheet. It is attributable to mix and that is driving at decrease in margin. We are seeing the direct-to-consumer margin holding very nicely quarter-over-quarter. And the other thing that's impacting margins is that in July, as we have moved around with it, we do have MSR component of the gain on sale margin. That was a fairly significant driver of our guide down as well. And that changes quarter-to-quarter, but that was part of it too. Yes. As I mentioned, when we enter into new products, we do look to get liquidity in markets for those, what we're doing in solar for right now is self-funding those at the point of origination, but it will be for a very short period of times, we do have a partner that will be buying those loans from us. We may look to get warehouse financing down the road if we need it right now, though, we've got the capital to be able to do that while we start up this channel. Yes. A portion of that is certainly variable. When you think about the, the commissions that we have, the production costs that we have associated with origination that did come down, but a substantial portion of this is us looking at additional vendor costs that we can impact through contract renegotiation other things that we are doing to impact those costs. So it is a mix of both looking at marketing, marketing, and down, as you saw by about a $100 million quarter-after-over and other things that we're doing outside of production to impact those costs. That answer's your question."

            "name": "Jay Farner",
            "content": "Thank you, Sharon. Good afternoon and welcome to the Rocket Companies' earnings call for the second quarter of 2022. On today's call, I'll share how Rocket is leading during this time of rapid change in the mortgage market and how we're investing in Rocket's future. I'll discuss the transformation of our Rocket services and engagement platform and strengthening of our offerings in both purchase and cash out refinance mortgage products. The mortgage industry has shifted rapidly and is facing challenging times. Volatility and interest rates and declining consumer sentiment have contributed to overall uncertainty about the economy. In this time of flux, we have taken proactive steps to optimize our core mortgage operations by improving lead capture and allocation, launching new products, signing new partnerships and aligning our resources internally. Our senior most leaders, season industry veterans, who have navigated numerous cycles in the 26 years here at Rocket are as close to the business as they've ever been. We are adapting our mortgage operations to the current market environment and we remain focused on managing the business with discipline. Julie will walk through our cost management efforts in more detail a bit later. This is an energizing time for us. Our ability to constantly innovate to serve our clients better through our platform, particularly during these challenging times, will further differentiate us from our competition and will allow us to capture market share over the long-term. Once again, we are revolutionizing the Rocket platform, setting the foundation for our next stage of growth through the use of centralized data across all Rocket businesses, which creates additional touch points to drive revenue. We've always taken a long-term view of our businesses. Through every cycle in our 37 year history, we've adapted, invested and emerged stronger. Our track record has proven that investment into our own business is always the best one that we can make. In fact, we have more than 2,000 team members, including technology, product strategy, data and marketing functions working to expand our client engagement platform. And consequently, the Rocket flywheel is poised to spin faster than ever as we enter 2023. We recently unified the entire Rocket ecosystem by launching Single Sign-On across each of our businesses. In July, we unified more of our businesses under the Rocket umbrella with Truebill, soon to be operated as Rocket Money and Edison Financial, our Canadian digital mortgage brokerage, transitioning to Rocket Mortgage, Canada. These two rebranding initiatives leverage our continued investments in the trusted Rocket brand and draw our businesses closer together. With the Rocket Money rebrand, clients serviced by Rocket Mortgage will enjoy a free Rocket Money premium membership providing access to unlimited budget management tools, our network dashboard, subscription cancellation concierge service, full credit reporting and more. We've been very pleased with our acquisition of Truebill, now known as Rocket Money. And the business is quickly becoming the core of the Rocket engagement platform. Rocket Money has continued to grow rapidly with paying premium members surpassing 2 million in July 2022, more than doubling year-over-year. To put this in perspective, it took Rocket Mortgage nearly 30 years to originate 2 million mortgages. It was only a few years ago that our servicing book surpassed 2 million clients making the growth of Rocket Money even more impressive. Rocket Money has launched its credit card in beta offering unique features like smart pay that help members take control of their credit. The early response is very positive. As I mentioned, Rocket Money provides valuable insights and helps keep clients actively engaged in our ecosystem. For consumers managing their financial lives, especially during times of high inflation, the services Rocket Money provides become even more valuable to its members. The company's members link their financial and credit accounts providing insight into our client's lives, which our industry leading marketing engine can then leverage to help craft bespoke experiences, delivering the right offer to the right client at the right time. Rocket Homes, our home search platform and real estate agent referral network grew overall real estate transactions by 25% from Q2 of 2021 to Q2 of 2022, which is even more impressive considering the overall housing industry declined over that same period. Rocket Homes also notched two record months in the quarter for closed units. The web traffic grew by nearly 60% over that same time period reaching nearly 3 million unique visitors per month. Rocket Solar continues its national expansion in June and is now available in 42 metropolitan areas covering a meaningful portion of the U.S. population, including Arizona, Florida and South Carolina. In addition, as of this week, we are proud to highlight another example of our flywheel in action. As Rocket Solar is now working directly with Rocket Loans to provide solar financing options to our clients. This partnership has made possible by the incredibly flexible AI powered loan decisioning engine and product agnostic platform developed by Rocket Loans over the last few quarters. This is just one of the many examples of our investment in technology continuing to pay off for our company. We look forward to continually growing our solar footprint and expanding the use of the Rocket Loans lending engine through the remainder of 2022 and beyond. As we continue to focus on our future, we're also keeping our sites firmly set on maximizing the opportunities before us. Homeowners are sitting on a record $28 trillion of home equity. The cash out refinance opportunity remains very healthy. We see our clients using cash out refinance to consolidate debt or remodel their existing home. We've also launched a home equity loan product just a few days ago that will provide even more optionality to clients, who may not want to refinance their first mortgage due to favorable terms, but they still want to tap into the equity currently available in their home. To illustrate an example of the power of our platform, we were able to develop and go to market with our new home equity product in just under 60 days by leveraging our flexible technology platform and internal resources. With client insights from Rocket Money, we can offer our home equity loan and other products to come to the right clients at the right times. This client pool represents tremendous future opportunity once they're part of our ecosystem. They may roll their first and second mortgage together when the market is once again right for refinancing or take advantage of other Rocket offerings down the road. The purchase market was more muted than we expected in the second quarter with home buying activity impacted by affordability, inventory and consumer competence. We are prepared and ready to help our clients during these uncertain times and when the macro environment improves. This is exactly why our engagement platform is so crucial. It allows us to keep our clients engaged and active with our brand until the moment they're ready to transact, eliminating the need to market broadly, thus reducing our cost to acquire clients. Over the past few weeks, our capital markets and marketing teams collaborated to launch new products to address our clients' immediate concerns over rate uncertainty. We have placed renewed emphasis on our RateShield program, which gives our purchase clients confidence in a rising rate environment by locking in rates for 90 days while they search for a new home. We also launched our Rate Drop Advantage at the end of July, which provides home buyers with a one-time credit on typical closing costs to refinance their mortgage if rates drop within three years of their purchase, something made possible and profitable by our efficient origination process. We are also very happy to share that we signed two significant premier enterprise relationships. We've entered into a new agreement with global financial leader, Santander, to originate mortgages for the bank. You may remember earlier this year, Santander exited the U.S. mortgage market in light of challenging conditions. We also signed a new partnership with Q2, a banking platform leader, who provides digital banking applications to over 500 financial institutions. We'll work with Q2 to embed the digital Rocket mortgage experience directly into the online banking apps used by their clients. Through the Q2 banking platform partnership, Rocket Mortgage will enable the financial institutions to offer mortgages without the need to manage their own mortgage operations. Consumers will enjoy a comprehensive seamless experience through one app to apply for mortgage, make mortgage payments, deposit checks and build their savings. We're having initial conversations with banks and credit unions now and expect to make this technology available to them in the fall. These challenging markets spurred financial institutions to scale down or exit the mortgage business, creating a compelling case to partner with the industry leader Rocket. More and more financial institutions are seeking out Rocket to help offer mortgage products and in particular purchase mortgage products to their clients without having to make the investment to originate on their own and compete with our strong brand. This is a tailwind for our enterprise partnerships channel and presents an opportunity unique to Rocket to grow our client base and market share. As we look forward, we will invest through the cycle and further prove Rocket's track record of execution. Rocket is incredibly well positioned to seize the opportunities in the financial services space, the mortgage market and beyond by continue to build out our platform and comprehensive end to end home buying and financial services ecosystem. We're excited to continue to move forward in fulfilling our mission to be the best at creating certainty in life's most complex moments, so that our clients can live their dreams. With that I'll turn things over to Julie to go deeper into the numbers. Hey, Ryan. Yes, I'll let Julie make some comments on how we think about the cost moving past Q3. But I think just to frame up how we think about this, we've got our core mortgage business, right? And so, although I look across all of RKT, I think about the operations, underwriting core mortgage technology, and how that is functioning on different mortgage volumes. And we strive to have that as a profitable part of our business. We then have our platform and we talked a lot about that in my prepared remarks, because if you think about a mortgage market, whether it's 1.7 trillion, 1.8 trillion, 2 trillion, and no one's sure, but you've got to find a way to bring down the cost to acquire. And what you're watching right now in the industry is there's still too much capacity and people are fighting very hard for every particular loan that may be out there. And so strategically win in the long run. We've got to make sure that our engagement rates with our clients are up. Our lead flow is still very, very strong, but not every client is ready to transact right now. In particular, we reference this, the purchase market has slowed a bit because people are concerned about the increase in their monthly payment. So how do we stay engaged with that client? How do we increase conversion of those leads over time, driving down our cost to acquire and increasing the lifetime value of the client. We've done a lot of work on the services side of our platform. So offering homes, offering auto, offering solar, which is growing rapidly. But the acquisition of Truebill, now Rocket Money, that's our engagement side of the platform with the budgeting, with the managing of assets in the balance sheet, with the managing of credit, with the subscription canceling. And we will, as we move forward into the second half of this year, we'll make further announcements about how we're going to engage with that client base daily, weekly, monthly, those efforts and now nearly 2,000 or over 2,000 people are focused on that here. And that's the strategic advantage really referenced that. Every so often we've got to put a lot of effort into something outside of core mortgage to grow the overall platform and grow mortgage. And so back to your question, that's what you're watching us do right now. We're taking those resources, those salaries, and we're accelerating that engagement component of our platform. So as we get into 2023 and what we expect to still be a fairly challenging mortgage market, that lead flow that we're generating will be staying in our ecosystem, staying in contact with us, and we will drive down the cost to acquire, thereby allowing us to actually spend more on marketing and drive more mortgage value and take market share. So we can continue to work on expense reduction. And again, Julie will touch on that, but really the focus is taking the assets that we have, our team members and accelerating our ability to drive revenue growth. And that's what you're seeing us do in Q2. That's what you're seeing us do in Q3. And the expense reduction is coming more from the career transition plan that we did. Our team is doing an amazing job of working through all of our vendors and contract costs. And we're just getting smarter about that. But we've got to keep putting money into the tech, the product strategy, the data science, because that's how we're going to grow market share in a more challenging mortgage market in 2023. Julie, I'll let you add comments. Yes. I think that in a moment where you've got to transform your business, and how you're thinking about it. The current environment that we're in is causing like I said, a lot of kind of scrambling, and scraping and so forth, more capacity has to come out. We're very fortunate in our ability to continue to invest. And I touched on this, it's not investing in, although we have a little excess capacity that excess capacity for us is staying around because as we implement all these things, we're working on with our engagement platform for the rest of this year. And that drives market share game we'll need that capacity as we move into 2023, as we grow our market share again. So it would make a lot of sense for us to go through a significant capacity reduction only to turn around and have to hire again, four or five months later. But I don't see a lot of people in the mortgage space making the millions and millions and millions of dollars of monthly investment that we're making in an engagement platform like that. I don't see folks signing up, partners like Santander, like we are. And so I think we're going to see the rest of the industry contract as we continue to move forward. And without something that allows you to bring a client onto your platform and continue to work with them, maybe it's a second mortgage product that we just released. Another thing that, again, without our tech platform, there's no way we could go on from not having that to doing all the programming, creating the docs and launching it less than 60 days. Our capital markets team is working on additional products that we'll launch as we get into the second half of this year to help our client base. So, we're going to leverage all of that tech, but those type of things that will allow us for a market share, if you don't have those things, I think it's going to be a challenge for you to grow market share as we finish up this year, and roll into 2023. All right, great. Thank you. Yes, we've got continued thoughts around marketing, although as you probably know from a performance marketing perspective. We're very thoughtful about making sure that we don't cut anything that is profitable for us there. And again, as we start getting more and more signal around how that marketing will work, not only in the short run, but the long run it allows for us to continue to spend marketing there. We'll continue to see attrition, as Julie talked about, we're being really thoughtful about that. If there's attrition in places that are critical for us, from a technology perspective to keep building out the platform, then we can \u2013 we will backfill, but in another places we won't. And so to continuously those salaries drop there's additional work with the vendors and contracts that we've got as Julie referenced before. Even once you go through and identify areas where you need to make adjustments, either renegotiating and or waiting for contracts to season can take a bit of time. It's not something you can work through in a matter of a month or a quarter. So all that work continues forward and will continue to move forward. And we're pretty diligent about it. We've got a great team here in our procurement group and they're working every single day to be smart, but I just want to reiterate smart, but also making sure that we have all the proper resources to do what we've always done in years past, which is to grow market share. And so, as we think about the expenses, and we think about the revenue, we'll continue to work on the expenses, but our main focus is driving up that revenue by bringing down the increase in the conversion rates and bringing down the cost to acquire our clients. And that's what I referenced in my remarks. Our senior leader team, we're dedicating many, many hours a week reviewing line by line where all of our resources are at the work that is being done. I've not seen, I'm not going to say that this is more intense than ever before, but we are an equal intensity than we've ever been in the 27 years. I've been at the organization in terms of being all over these projects. And I'm watching a team of people that are highly energized because they see the work that we're doing that no one else is doing that will really differentiate this company moving forward to be far broader than just a mortgage lender. So Julie, if you have any, anything I've missed there? Yes, I think that's a great question. And we've got our team out constantly looking at those opportunities. If you think about the waterfall approach, you've got the bottom services layer that actually generates the true revenue Mortgage, Homes, Auto, Solar is growing rapidly. I know, I kind of touched on it just briefly, but all the tech work that we did in Rocket Loans to really build an AI-driven loan agnostic technology platform. So, whether it's a solar loan today and a auto refinance loan for an example, tomorrow, that tech allows us to do that very quickly. So that's the revenue component of that. You've got the top of the funnel, whether it's our Quicken Loans site, our Core Digital, LowerMyBills site, our Rocket Mortgage site, other assets we're building, then you've got the middle layer, the engagement layer. So as we drive traffic in, you've got to find a way to make sure that you can engage that high end base. And so when we think about M&A, you think about other services you can add to drive revenue, and you think about other ways to drive top of the funnel. It's a critical that we \u2013 that's why we said 2,000 people accelerating the growth of the engagement layer, because that's the kind of secret sauce that unlocks our ability to bring the clients in, keep the clients in. And that's why the growth of Truebill doubling in a year is so exciting. Because it's taken us so many years to get to a place where we've gotten north of two million people now, I think almost 2.6 million in our servicing book. But to watch and be able to add millions of people a year where they're linking their bank accounts, where we have access to their credit data, their asset data that informs all those up funnel to how we're buying leads or engaging with classic goes down funnel into how we generate revenue. That component is critical. So that's why we really are trying to point out. The work we did the last two quarters. And the work we do the next two quarters. It gets us to kind of Phase 1 completion of that engagement layer, which unlocks all the other M&A activity that we're doing right now. This is correct. Yes. Yes. Certainly I think we're all seeing the fact that's taken many consumers out of the market right now. That was why growing the second mortgage home equity loan was so critical for us, because it allows us to monetize lease flow today. But more importantly, it allows to put that client into our servicing portfolio and into Rocket Money and be there to service them tomorrow. So, we've really got a waterfall approach here. The first to cash out refinance on the primary mortgage. The second is the \u2013 second HELOC loan, we've now just rolled a few days ago, maybe last week, if I remember correctly. And then we've got our Rocket Loans loan for those that don't fit. I know we referenced the fact that our beta credit card from Truebill was in market. So, we're really stacking a full suite of products that allow a client who's looking for cash out. And I think we're all watching the word comes out every week that consumer debt continues to grow. And as inflation occurs that the variable rates keep rising. So there's more and more demand. We've just got to have a full product selection for those clients. And again, I think we uniquely position to health clients across the board where others that we compete with aren't. Now purchase is another interesting thing, because if slight increase in interest rate is fine, certainly for all purchasers, but first time home buyers as well, the increase we've seen probably pooled off purchases more than we had expected going from Q2 and into Q3, which is reflected in some of our guidance. Our team is working on ways to solve that for consumers to help them have an affordable payment and still purchase a home and we'll talk more about that as we get into further \u2013 future kind of earnings calls or press releases when we can discuss those things. So it is having an impact. That's why it's so critical that all these other investments that we're making we accelerate. So, we can find those avenues to grow even as the mortgage market itself may shrink for a while. Yes. We're in a unique position to be thoughtful about that. And as you know, we use some of our cash do sell funding for a while, especially when there's a nice opportunity for us to gain interest income on that. In most cases, at some point in time, we do wind up securitizing or selling mortgages, whether they're first or seconds. And so we'll kind of continue to keep that same philosophy there. So that's kind of how we think about. From an economics perspective, I think it's really important to remember, although the revenue, because these loan sizes are smaller, although the revenue is lower, the cost of price underwriting close we've already got capacity, number one. And number two, there's no cost to acquire. Those types are already here, we're already bringing them in up for a first mortgage. And so if the second makes more sense, we're not incurring any additional marketing costs. So at the end of the day, the profitability and the loan still looks good, even if the loan size is closer to a $100,000 versus $200,000 and $250,000. So that's how we think about that particular product. And then again, as I referenced, there's other products that follow after that, again, all of those represent revenue opportunity plan engagement with no cost to acquire. Hi, James. Sure. Well, I think we've touched a bit on it already, but we're going to continue to be prudent around our expense management. I think Julie and team did an incredible job of kind of exceeding our expectations in Q2. And as I referenced already, the group is all over the next quarters as well to ensure that we're being thoughtful there. But the other caller had had asked, the first step is the folks that we've got on the building the engagement platform and all the services I talked about, if we were to go back in time five or 10 years, and we didn't have all of these opportunities, you wouldn't have those 2,000 plus people working on it. Right. And so that's why I referenced. We kind of think about, or I think about the business in three tranches, mortgage kind of separate, and then you've got this investment. So in the services and engagement platform, and that's how I think about it. It's a capital investment that we're making because the best use of our capital is to build out this technology that maximizes our marketing, that reduces our cost to acquire that increases our lifetime value. So when we think about our investments, we say what's out there from an M&A perspective? What could we build internally? And how do we get to this place where we grow market share in 2023? And that's where we're putting a big chunk of our capital right now is that internal investment in technology. But we've also got Scott Elkins and our kind of the acquisitions team out there looking at opportunity. We need to be thoughtful about the fact that we're not all the way through this cycle. And so others who don't have the same ability to invest may continue to see their value drop. And if so, we'll be thoughtful about when, and if we pull the trigger on those acquisitions, when it's the right timing, but certainly one very strong possibility for us to get into niche markets that we want to enter into that fits nicely into our ecosystem. Well, buying MSR is very interesting, especially as we think about how those MSRs will interact inside of everything I've just described to get not only short term returns, but better lifetime value. And certainly we've demonstrated the fact that we're thoughtful, but not afraid to deploy some of our cash or have a small burn. Like you just talked about if we're deploying it in technology and product strategy, building tech, that's going to build our business. And that's where that capital's doing today. But more of our focus is, how do we leverage that to grow market share in 2023, which will make us a stronger company. And that's where our mindset is here. It's not a long-term thought around burning cash. It's about investing now to see growth in 2023. Yes, that, I think you've kind of touched on all the reasons why we're very interested in this. We think that partnership opportunities will accelerate because all the questions we're getting here, many folks who engage in mortgages, one of their business lines will probably decide to move out of that space as we continue forward through the end of this year and into next year, creating opportunity for us to step in and be there, their mortgage partner. And this is really leveraging the technology, the client experience and the brand that we've built. If someone's thinking of getting out of the space, but wants to remain offering that for their client. I think we're really obvious choice for them. And so that we think that partnerships will, will continue. Q2 is different than sales force, similar concept, but different technology platform that we're using. So sales force gives us reach into a certain set of banks and credit unions. Now Q2 gives us reach into another set of hundreds of banks and credit unions. And so it's an exciting moment in time. And through the end of this year, we'll be finding those first banks and credit unions and plugging them in as we enter into 2023. So partnerships are strong. It's a we're differentiated in that space. And so you'll continue to see us do more and more of that as we move forward. Well, as we always talk about, Julie can comment, we're a capital light business. So, if we see an opportunity to leverage the, the cash that we have for a short period of time to cause it's nice spread between the lending rate and where we're either borrowing money or using your own cash, we'll do it. But it's a small portion of the lending with you because in the end we're selling those loans to partners, et cetera, securitizing them. We're not going to hold them for a long period of time. Yes, it certainly has taken longer than we have seen in the past. I think that's a function of course, of 2020 and 2021 and people building up reserves. And so their ability to kind of hang on through the cycle a bit longer than usual. I don't know, if I have a crystal ball to tell you when the capacity will come out, but I have a feeling we'll see that steadily happen here, moving forward. There's the strategic advantage I've already touched on whether there's excess capacity or not, for our ability to drive down the cost to acquire, which is more powerful than 10 basis points or 15 basis points in margin in either direction. The other important component, and I'll bring this up now, as we have multiple business lines and we think about our gain on sale margin. One of those, of course, is our TPO lining, and we've got a great set of partners. We work with them very, very closely. We're going to be launching new products for them as we get into the second half of steer to strengthen their business. But we've also made it very, very clear that moving forward, if you're not a partner of ours, we will be taking advantage of all of our data, information, our massive sales force, their incredible skill to win those partners over into our retail channel. And so we've launched some initiatives here in the last a few months to really dial that in strategically find each one of those clients and start bringing them aboard. So that'll change a have an impact on margin as well as we move more towards that retail channel, winning those clients again, protecting the third party originators that are partners of ours, but being very clear about the fact that we're going to be full steam ahead, if you're not a partner of ours winning those clients onto the Rocket platform using our retail group. No, I think it's across the board, how they're going to interact. So, they'll be offering that. My understanding is to the loan officers that are in their branch system that can plug directly in and guide clients into our Rocket ecosystem. Okay, great. Thank you. Well, yes, a few things and just taking a step back on solar. There's three really important components here. Number one, and I know I point this out a lot. We are assisting the millions of clients that come to us for a mortgage. And so it's an interesting opportunity for us because there's no cost to require these clients as we bring them into our solar platform. Number two, we're engaging in the actual assistance, helping the clients plan out the solar. So it's not just financing, we're doing the sales of that as well. And there's a nice revenue opportunity attached to that component. Now, the thing that we've just plugged in is the actual solar financing itself. And so Rocket Loans will be providing that, when it's appropriate, we like to leave ourselves many solar partners, including Rocket Loans. And then of course, once the solar loan is originated within 12 months to 18 months, typically people will roll the solar into their first mortgage. So, we'll really create, we've got lower expenses that our competition, while we create three revenue opportunities through that client, as we help them, save money, on their utility bills. And of course, they are very excited about helping the environment as well. Now, Julie can just \u2013 kind of speak to what we're doing or what Rocket Loans is doing with the solar loan itself. Because you have flexibility there too. Thank you. And thanks everybody for joining today. And in particular, thank you to the team members for joining, as I've said here on the call and in the correspondence, I'll be sending out shortly. The opportunity that we have right now in this market to lean in, to invest and to differentiate and really transform this company again is, is like maybe the four or five times prior that Julie referenced in her remarks. And so we appreciate all of your commitment to what we're doing because it's going to make all the difference in the world as we grow this company moving forward. So thanks to all of our team members and thanks everybody joining we'll see you next quarter."

Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Sharon Ng, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nSharon Ng: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Rocket Company's earnings call covering the first quarter of 2022. With us this afternoon are Rocket Company's CEO, Jay Farner; our CFO, Julie Booth; and our President and COO, Bob Walters. Before I turn things over to Jay, let me quickly go over our disclaimers. On today's call, we provide you with the information regarding our first quarter 2022 performance as well as our financial outlook. This conference call includes forward-looking statements.

We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or further events, except as required by law. This call is being broadcast online and is accessible on our Investor Relations website. A recording of the call will be available later today. Our commentary today will also include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP metrics for our reported results can also be found on our earnings release issued earlier today as well as our filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll turn things over to Jay Farner to get us started. Jay?\nJay Farner: Thank you, Sharon. Good afternoon, and welcome to the Rocket Companies' Earnings Call for the first quarter of 2022. On today's call, I'll share how Rocket will continue to navigate and win in today's rapidly evolving market. We'll discuss our strength with both purchased and cash-out refinance mortgage products and how we continue to thoughtfully expand the Rocket platform.  In the first quarter, Rocket Companies generated $1.9 billion of adjusted revenue and $450 million of adjusted EBITDA. We delivered adjusted net income of $293 million or $0.15 per adjusted diluted share. The rapid increase in interest rates this year has been the largest in over 40 years. 30-year fixed rate mortgage rates are now north of 6% for the first time in more than a decade, increasing over 200 basis points in the past few months. This obviously creates challenging conditions for our industry. Rocket Companies has always navigated successfully through turbulent times by protecting our margin and our profitability, while continuing to invest in technology and marketing to grow market share. We will emerge stronger, grow market share through the cycle and reap the benefits as the ultimate market winner. As we look forward, our second quarter guidance of $35 billion to $40 billion of closed loan volume reflects the impact of a market experiencing unprecedented rate increases. In our experience, the ability to successfully navigate this difficult market requires several key attributes: a strong national brand; broad and diverse channels to capture the top of the funnel, a scaled technology platform with high operational efficiency; an experienced leadership team with the willingness to roll up their sleeves and get into the business; the best talent in the industry and a strong balance sheet, all areas where Rocket excels. Rocket has intentionally built our platform ecosystem and multichannel business model to navigate tough market conditions. We have invested in the pillars of our platform for decades with more than $7 billion invested in our trusted brand, leveraging important performance marketing insights strengthened by more than 200 million client records in our vast data lake, investing heavily in cutting-edge technology, attracting the best talent in the industry and growing our premier enterprise partnerships. Of significant importance is the fact that our servicing book has grown substantially and benefits from a rising rate environment. Servicing rights represent a $6.4 billion asset as of March 31, growing 19% quarter-over-quarter, while maintaining an industry-best retention rate of 92%. Our servicing portfolio alone generates $1.4 billion of annualized recurring cash revenue. Turning to our capital position. The $4.4 billion of available cash and cash used for self-funding along with our mortgage servicing rights, represent a total of $10.8 billion of asset value on our balance sheet as of March 31 or $5.49 per share. Rocket has amassed the financial strength and scale to weather the ebbs and flows of the market while also maintaining the flexibility to expand our platform through strategic acquisitions, if and when the right opportunity presents itself. We will be disciplined with expenses during this changing market. And in the second quarter, we've taken significant cost reduction measures that included implementing a voluntary career transition program to certain team members, reducing our production costs, including renegotiating large vendor contracts and shifting our marketing spend. We continue to review every aspect of our cost structure and are committed to running an efficient and effective business. Julie will dive deeper into these specifics in a few minutes. Our strong capital position and operating efficiencies allow us to be thoughtful about expenses while maintaining flexibility to invest in key strategic areas that set us up well for the long term. While we expect challenging times ahead, there are bright spots in the industry. Home values have risen to new highs, creating $26 trillion of available equity. Home buying demand remains strong, particularly from first-time homebuyers and millennials, currently the largest generation by population.  This is perfect for us. Since 75% of the clients who apply using Rocket's online platform or app our first-time homebuyers or millennials. In fact, recent securitization data shows that Rocket was the nation's largest lender to first-time homebuyers in 2021. Beyond purchase, this client pool represents a tremendous future opportunity when the market is once again ripe for rate and term refinances. As the market has shifted from rate and term refinance in 2020 and 2021, today's predominantly purchase and cash out refinance market, Rocket's ecosystem has shown its ability to provide a strategic advantage. We had our best first quarter ever for purchase mortgages and cash-out refinances, driving more than 80% of our overall mortgage origination volume. Each and every day, our bankers are having nearly 35,000 conversations, helping Americans achieve their dreams. Our technology platform helps deliver the speed and certainty that are critical in today's purchase-heavy market that our clients as well as our real estate agents and broker partners need. In fact, we recently launched the FAST 15 program for our mortgage broker partners, guaranteeing broker purchase loans will go from documents received to clear to close in 15 business days or less.  In addition, for the first time, Rocket Pro TPO has gained the title of number 1 most favored brand among mortgage brokers for its account executives and operations support, according to our brand health study conducted by a third-party firm. This speaks to our commitment to helping our broker partners succeed and grow. We look to further harvest our opportunity in cash out refinance leveraging exceptional marketing expertise, our vast data lake, client insights and highly trained Rocket cloud force. Our bankers are educating clients about using record levels of home equity to consolidate high interest debt, remodel their homes or help navigate life's events like marriage or a growing family. As we move into Q2, which has been seen by many as the official start of home buying season. Our purchase pipeline has been robust, pre-approvals had a record level in March, and our verified approval letters grew by more than 40% year-over-year. We continue to invest and expand the Rocket platform. Truebill, which became part of the Rocket ecosystem in December, has continued its impressive growth. The company now has 3.4 million members, up 142% from Q1 of 2021. Included in that 3.4 million members, our 1.7 million paying premium members, more than doubling from Q1 of 2021. Truebill helps our clients manage their entire financial lives and keeps our clients engaged in our ecosystem, generating over $100 million in growing in annualized recurring revenue. Rocket Homes notched 2 best in March, setting a record for the number of real estate transactions, and reaching 2.8 million monthly active users, both more than doubling year-over-year. Our Canadian subsidiaries are growing rapidly. Edison Financial, our digital mortgage brokerage, surpassed $500 million in cumulative funded loan volume from its first month of production in March of 2020 through March of 2022. Funded loan volume more than doubled and purchase volume more than tripled in Q1 compared to the same quarter last year. And Lendesk, our Fintech provider, servicing brokers, successfully integrated the acquisition of Finmo and nearly tripled its mortgage submission volume from the first quarter of 2021 to the first quarter of 2022. Rocket Solar continues its expansion. In fact, it currently operates in 27 major markets across 9 states, including Arizona, Florida and South Carolina, and a full public launch is slated for early next month. We see exciting opportunity ahead to serve our clients better and in more ways, further extending client lifetime value by leveraging our platform. With this new phase of the mortgage cycle, we look forward to executing on our playbook to exhibit the true strength of our platform. At the same time, we continue to move forward with fulfilling our mission to be the best at creating certainty in life's most complex moments so that our clients can live their dreams. With that, I'll turn it over to Julie to go deeper into the numbers. Julie?\nJulie Booth: Thank you, Jay, and good afternoon, everyone. As we navigate through these rapidly changing market conditions, Rocket has continued to deliver profitable results while also further building out our platform and investing in key areas of our business. It's important to frame what we have experienced in the past few months. Since the beginning of the year, market conditions have changed dramatically. The rapid increase in interest rates this year has been the largest in over 40 years. Just last week, the Fed raised rates by 50 basis points, the first time in 22 years, the Fed has raised rates by more than 25 basis points at any one time. With this backdrop, our company continues to perform, and we are proud of our first quarter results. Rocket Companies generated $1.9 billion of adjusted revenue in Q1 compared to $4 billion in Q1 of 2021. We had $450 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter, representing a 23% adjusted EBITDA margin. We delivered GAAP net income of $1 billion or $0.40 per diluted share and adjusted net income of $293 million or $0.15 per adjusted diluted share. We generated closed loan volume of $54 billion during the quarter and net rate locks of $49.6 billion, at a gain on sale margin of 301 basis points. As Jay mentioned, demand for purchase and cash out refinance remains robust. The rise in home values has spurred demand for cash out refinance transactions. As we are seeing in our own pipeline, purchase demand remained strong with record levels of pre-approvals in March. Looking ahead to Q2, we expect our business to face headwinds due to the rapid increase in rates that has occurred year-to-date. For the second quarter, we expect closed loan volume in the range of $35 billion to $40 billion and net rate lock volume between $31 million and $38 billion. We expect second quarter gain on sale margin to be in the range of 260 to 290 basis points. Our gain on sale margin in the first quarter included a few onetime benefits due to the rapid move in bond markets, which lifted Q1 gain on sale margin by 15 basis points. Excluding this 15 basis point lift, our first quarter gain on sale margin would have been 286 basis points. Moving on to expenses. As a result of the rapidly changing mortgage market, we are taking significant cost reduction measures throughout the remainder of the second quarter. We expect to incur a onetime charge of approximately $50 million to $60 million related to the voluntary career transition program that we rolled out in the second quarter. Excluding this onetime charge, we expect Q2 expenses to be down approximately $200 million to roughly $1.4 billion as compared to first quarter total expenses of $1.6 billion. Around $100 million of the decrease is related to lower production expenses. The remaining decrease of approximately $100 million is expected to be driven by cost savings from a partial quarter of our voluntary career transition program and reductions in other non-team member related costs. On an annualized basis, the cost savings from our voluntary career transition program are expected to be around $180 million or roughly $45 million per quarter. We are focused on serving our clients and taking care of our team members. We will be disciplined with expenses while continuing to invest in key areas of our business to support the growth of our platform and ecosystem to position Rocket well for long-term growth. As we've talked about on prior calls, our servicing book is a strategic asset for Rocket. As of March 31, our servicing portfolio included 2.6 million clients with $546 billion in unpaid principal balance. During the first 3 months of 2022, the value of our mortgage servicing rights increased by $1 billion or 19% compared to Q4 including newly-created MSRs and the mark-to-market adjustment to $6.4 billion. While the mark-to-market change in MSR portfolio value is excluded from our adjusted net income metrics, it's worth noting that the positive market adjustment on the portfolio was $739 million in the first quarter, which is countercyclical in a rising rate environment. As a reminder, the mark-to-market increase in the value of the servicing portfolio is a result of the assumption that with the higher interest rates, servicing cash flows will extend and therefore, our recurring cash revenue will be greater. Our net client retention rate was 92% as of the first quarter of 2022 and reflects our ability to drive substantial client lifetime value for clients coming into our mortgage servicing book and positions us well to serve our clients for their next mortgage and across products in the Rocket ecosystem. We also drive a considerable amount of annualized recurring revenue from servicing our clients' mortgages. During the first quarter, annualized recurring revenues from our servicing book were over $1.4 billion. As Jay mentioned, when considering the cash flows from our servicing portfolio and Truebill, we have more than $1.5 billion of annualized recurring revenue as of March 31. From a capital allocation perspective, we have always prioritized maintaining a well-capitalized balance sheet with substantial liquidity capable of navigating different market conditions while remaining opportunistic. We exited the first quarter with $2.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet, and an additional $2.1 billion of corporate cash used to self-fund loan originations for a total available cash and self-funding of $4.4 billion. Total liquidity stood at $7.7 billion as of March 31, including available cash plus undrawn lines of credit and our undrawn MSR line. Our $4.4 billion of available cash and self-funding combined with $6.4 billion of mortgage servicing rights represent a total of $10.8 billion of asset value on our balance sheet as of March 31. This equates to $5.49 per share. We are well positioned in the current environment, and we'll continue to deploy our capital in a strategic and disciplined manner to generate long-term shareholder value. With that, we are ready to turn it back to the operator for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ryan Nash from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. \nRyan Nash: Hey good evening, everyone. So Jay and Julie, maybe we could flush out the guidance a little bit more. So you talked about voluntary separation and other non-headcount-related cost reductions. I'm guessing there's an element of scaling back in marketing. So -- and when you put all this together, given the revenue backdrop, do you think you have enough leverage on the cost side to remain profitable in the near term? And then second, just stepping back, how do you see the next few quarters of this cycle playing out? And what is sort of the Rocket playbook in terms of how you expect to navigate through the cycle from a profitability perspective? And I have a follow-up.\nJay Farner: Sure. I'll get started, and I think Julie can chime in. But as I've been telling some of our team members, we're kind of in the third inning here of this process and one that we've lived through before, certainly back in 2008, 2009, 2010. We saw little glimpses of this in '14 and '19, but something that you've got to have a long-term view while you're taking short-term actions to ensure that the company is set up for success. And that's exactly what we've been doing.  I think you can tell from my comments and from Julie's comments that I'm very proud of the team and how quickly we have been making adjustments. So that\u2019s the question or made comment about marketing, it's not as much a reduction in marketing, is it a shift in marketing? And so as you start thinking about performance marketing opportunities, what we're starting to see is filing our capacity beginning to come out of the industry.  And that's the first step in the process is that you've got to see that capacity that was built up to handle $4.5 trillion come out to more of a $2 trillion, $2.5 trillion market, which is I think where we think we're going to be at. And as that happens, then opportunity starts presenting itself. So when we look at our marketing and our reach, although the market is moving from $4.5 trillion to $2 trillion, certainly, our ability to reach clients who are interested remains much stronger than that. And so that sets us up for long-term success. The next phase of that process is leading your team. And this isn't something you're going to see on a spreadsheet or probably read about in an earnings release. But you've got all of your team members, in particular, your marketing team members, your mortgage bankers, your operations folks who are now moving into a brand-new mortgage market. And so the amount of effort that our leaders are putting in day in and day out meeting coaching adjusting mindset. I mean this is the hard work that you don't necessarily read about in business books, but -- that you have to do that our leaders are doing day in and day out to position our banker for us to be successful.  And I'm watching it. I'm on the floor. I'm seeing it, and I'm seeing the shift in the change that gives me incredible confidence -- so on that offensive side, shift to marketing, leverage the data, ensure we're reaching the right client with the right offer, get the operations, marketing and team members adjusted to the new market and then go out there and hit the rock every single day. And in the end, you win. And that's what we demonstrated over 36 now, almost 37 years. On the more defensive side and Julie can speak to this, get your expenses in order and ensure that you've got a tight grasp on everything you're spending and it's the right place to put your dollars. And she can kind of talk about where we're at and where we're headed. And then, of course, leverage your balance sheet.  And so we're in a better position than we've ever been in. We talked about the asset value of our organization. But as we see people pull back as we see capacity get reduced, as we see people struggle, there'll be opportunities. And if they're the right ones, we're positioned from an asset perspective to take advantage of those opportunities that will position us to grow. And then the last thing I'll say before I turn to Julie is keep investing. And so we talk about the Rocket platform, not just Rocket Mortgage. And clearly, our history has been originating mortgages. But if you look at the hundreds and hundreds of people we have today in our product strategy group, in our marketing group, in our platform tech group, they are working on things that will grow out our technology platform to serve consumers far beyond mortgage. And that you want to keep investing in that, here is why. The more clients that we engage with and bring into our ecosystem at higher interest rates. The more people we will be able to help when interest rates fall. And I don't need to explain that to you. I can just go back and look at '20 and '21 to see what our company is capable of when we see a reduction in interest rates. Now magnify that by continuing to have other services, Truebill, Rocket Homes, Rocket Auto where we're engaging with clients. And we're setting ourselves up to have relationships with those clients and data about those clients so we can assist them in the future, we're setting ourselves up for the next opportunity to reap those benefits. But you got to do the hard work now and you've got to manage the business. Now we've demonstrated our ability to manage it profitably for 36-plus years. So Julie, maybe you want to comment on how we think about expenses in the process that we're working through there.\nJulie Booth: Yes. I sure can. And as we've said many times before, just to reiterate what Jay said, the decisions that we're making are intended to position the business for that long-term growth. So we won't make short-term decisions on expenses that are going to sacrifice long-term profitability. We've seen time and time again, we've been through these cycles. The amount that we can save today is going to be dwarfed by what we can make in the future when the upside opportunity comes to us by holding a little bit of extra expense, we've seen that time and time again. So that being said, we're certainly very, very diligent and responsible about how we're looking at our expenses. So this is why we're seeing our second quarter expenses coming down roughly $200 million from $1.6 billion in the first quarter to about $1.4 billion in the second quarter, excluding the onetime charge of the $50 million to $60 million related to our voluntary career transition program. So it is something that we are going to continue to be focused on throughout the year. Costs do take some time to come out. We'll have through natural attrition through looking at non-team member expenses. There will be other opportunities to continue to impact our expenses. And maybe just to put a little bit of a finer point on some of these savings. The cost savings that we'll get from our voluntary career transition program are expected to be around $180 million on an annual run rate basis, so $45 million a quarter. About half of that $45 million a quarter is going to be realized in the second quarter. So we'll see a full quarter of that in the third quarter as well. So there's a lot that we will continue to look at here as we go through the rest of the year, but that's how we're looking at our Q2 earnings. And if you annualize that run rate, if you think about $200 million coming out from Q1 to Q2, another $20 million coming out in the third quarter when we fully implement all the savings from the transition program, it's about $880 million of annualized expenses that we're going to be taking out here.\nRyan Nash: And if I could just ask a follow-up question as it pertains to gain on sales. So the guidance for next quarter implies slight pressure. And to Jay's comments, we're starting to hear capacity coming out, which is a good sign. However, just given how rapid the markets move from $4.5 trillion, down to in $2.5 trillion. I'm curious how you think about what the environment can mean for margins just beyond the next quarter, particularly, if we don't see capacity coming out at the pace commensurate with the size in which the market is adjusting to. \nJay Farner: Yes. I think capacity is coming out quite rapidly. As I watch and talk to other leaders across the mortgage space in particular. And as you listen to Julie's comments, excluding kind of the onetime effect of margin in Q1, I think she referenced 285 -- 286. And then if you look at the guidance that you provided for Q2, I think it's kind of in the similar ballpark.\nJulie Booth: 260 to 290.\nJay Farner: 260 to 290. So I think you're seeing us kind of in a range that we've seen in the past as well.\nJulie Booth: Yes, I think that's right, Jay. As you look at margins from 2020 into 2021. By the second quarter of 2021, I think we were at 278 for gain on sale margin. You kind of see it hold steady Q3, 305, then to 282 in the fourth quarter. 301, as I mentioned, that would have been 286. So as you look at our guidance, 260 to 290, it really is leveling out here over the past several quarters.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Harter from Credit Suisse.\nDoug Harter: Hi, Jay, just following up on a comment you made about wanting to kind of invest and get as many higher coupon customers. How do you think about MSR purchases and using that liquidity that you have to possibly do invest in MSRs?\nJay Farner: Yes, a very good question. And certainly, one of the ways that we can continue to add to the servicing book, especially in the rising strategies that we are working on to inform that decision. And I referenced our Rocket Central team because as we think about Truebill, as we think about some other programs we're working on to launch this year, the engagement of that client is critical for us. As the number 1 service ranked by J.D. Power already as an advantage if we purchase MSRs because people are going to have a great experience coming in our servicing platform.  But it's also important to remember when we buy the client doesn't have the opportunity to originate through our system. And so they don't have that experience to kind of rely on. So developing and then employing these other engagement tools that we're working on. So as we purchased MSR, we can extend the lifetime value of that client has been our mission. And you see our 92% retention rate. And we know that, that works. And that, of course, gives us great confidence that we want to continue to bring clients on to our book because we know in the future, we'll reap the benefits. But the next strategic move is to build out or continue to build out these additional components of our platform because they do exactly what you're asking. They engage clients that we purchase if we purchase as an MSR and kind of turn their conversion rates similar to ones that we would originate and that's a very strategic advantage to us. So I'm sure as we continue forward this year in subsequent calls, we'll talk more about the work that we're doing there. So important strategy, being really thoughtful about it, but also wanting to make sure that we've got all of the components that we think are critical to maximizing the lifetime value of those MSRs that we bring on the platform.\nJulie Booth: Yes. Maybe while we're on the topic of MSRs, just to put some numbers around that, in 2021, we did about $200 million of capital acquiring MSR. So it is something that we are in the market looking at these potential opportunities. And if there's a one that makes sense for us for the reasons that Jay just mentioned, we're going to take that opportunity.  That asset is a very strategic one for us for many reasons. In terms of value, just year-to-date in the first quarter, the asset increased by about $739 million. As interest rates continue to rise, that asset becomes more and more valuable as those cash flows continue to expand. In fact, through April, it's up about another $250 million in value to us, so nearly $1 billion now. Interest rates at June 30 will ultimately depend or determine where that total value is for the quarter, but it's very, very valuable to us.\nJay Farner: Yes. And the last thing I'll mention that maybe people kind of catch people off guard, sometimes people will say, well, you want to buy MSRs at a lower weighted average cost or interest rate because you want to refinance it. I suppose in a falling rate market, it's always beneficial. But actually now, it benefits us to be buying MSRs at a higher weighted average coupon because we set ourselves up to take advantage of that opportunity with that client when it's appropriate in the future.  So that's again, back to the lifetime value and our retention rate and all the things that we're building give us a strategic advantage to even be purchasing the MSRs at a higher interest rate level. So you'll see us continue to lean in as time goes on there.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kevin Barker from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. \nKevin Barker: Good afternoon. I just wanted to dig in a little bit further in regards to the volume that you're producing. I mean, obviously, cash out refis are a large portion of it, you started to increase a significant amount of purchase volume. But it's still not quite keeping pace or it appears it's not quite keeping pace with the direction of purchase volume relative to the market.  Meanwhile, you have enormous amount of cash and your leverage is the lowest we've seen. And while you have tangible common equity ratio of 34%, it would appear you have a significant amount of cash that you could deploy. Why not look to maybe some strategic acquisitions that could be accretive to your equity and potentially increase your capacity to garner more purchase originations. And then at the same time, you can apply some of the Rocket technology to make that -- those operations more efficient on some of those acquisitions. What are your thoughts on that?\nJay Farner: Yes. Well, first, I think when we look at the record level of pre-approvals that we were able to originate in Q1, when we look at, I think, setting a record for the most purchase volume closed in Q1 compared to any other Q1 we've had, we continue to see traction in purchase. I think that will be amplified by the fact that the capacity is coming out quickly. And in particular, in areas where people don't have the strong resources to continue to market.  So I feel very confident about our way to -- our ability to organically grow purchase. That said, your other comment about the availability of strategic opportunities that may allow us to lean into the purchase market, there are a handful of those type of opportunities that exist. And I think it's just a matter of staying close to them, watching them and ensure that we are making the right -- if we make an investment, making the right investment at the right time. And like Julie always says, we've got the capital to be strategic, and that's what we'll do.\nKevin Barker: And do you also see it as an opportunity to potentially increase your float just given the aluminum outflow that exists for today?\nJay Farner: I don't know about increasing the flow. I think we see it as an opportunity to be buying our shares back as I've been doing and we've been doing at this point in time.\nKevin Barker: Got it. Thank you for taking the question. \nOperator: The next question comes from James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. \nBlake Netter: Hi, this is Blake Netter on the line for James. First question, certain competitors are leaning into HELOC. In addition, the cash out refi as a means of making up for the decline in refi volumes. Is that something you consider given that you currently aren't in the HELOC space as far as I'm aware? And what are some of the puts and takes there?\nJay Farner: Yes. Our product strategy team and our team in capital markets is very actively looking at additional programs that we can offer. I think they've rolled out a few different programs here recently, in particular, to our TPO space. I was reading something here a week or 2 ago. And so we're active there, whether it's a HELOC or a second or those type of things. I know they'll continue to think about the right products that help our clients not only today, but then allow us to build the relationship to a system in the future. One of the things that we've stood a team up here recently on is the rolling in of seconds and solar and/or home improvement loans because certainly, it makes sense for those clients to do so even in a rising rate market. And so we'll continue to think about those products and rolling them out and understand only the revenue that brings us today, but also the future revenue will gain when it's time for those clients to refinance again.\nBlake Netter: Got it. That's helpful. And then moving on, given the recent volatility in rates, can you discuss any challenges you faced in terms of hedging your pipeline? And how big of an uptick have you seen if any around hedging costs? \nJay Farner: I would say that our capital markets team is doing an excellent job hedging the pipeline and think about where our pipeline was here a year or so ago from a size perspective, it's well in hand and very pleased with the results that they've been delivering.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brock Vandervliet from UBS. Please go ahead. \nBrock Vandervliet: Yes, thanks for the question. Just in terms of -- as you kind of rejig your marketing outlook and your resource commitments, how has that affected your orientation toward direct-to-consumer versus partner? And this -- also in this rate backdrop, how is that orientation changed, if at all, how should we think about that?\nJay Farner: Yes. Very good question. Look, all of our -- we're leaning into all of our different channels. Some we have more direct control over than others. And so from a direct-to-consumer perspective, that gives us the ability to make adjustments almost at an hourly basis in terms of how we market, how we allocate leads, all of those things.  So we're probably most active there. I was really pleased to see the third-party survey that was given to us here just a week or 2 ago, we're now in the wholesale space, we're the most favored brand based on our account executives and operations group. We know we've been delivering excellent service in that space, but it's great for a third party to reiterate that fact. And our broker partners have been asking for more assistance as they think about having to grow out their marketing platform in a more challenging market. So we're providing that assistance to those partners. And some of our other relationships are more long term and strategic. So as we leverage our sales force partnership, and start integrating with banking institutions. These are not relationships that are going to -- we're focused on driving revenue in a month or two, these are long-standing relationships where the focus is in the next 2, 3, 4 years and the ability for us to be plugged in directly to these financial institutions will allow us to grow at scale down the road. So we're not taking a, hey, how's the originations today approach there. We're really being more thoughtful about what kind of originations can that drive in the years to come, especially in years where we start seeing interest rates drop back down again, whether that's 4, 6, 8, no one can predict exactly when that will happen. But when it happens, with all that tech work being done fully integrated, it will just accelerate our ability to take advantage of a drop -- a lowering rate market in the future.\nBrock Vandervliet: Okay. And as a follow-up regarding gain on sale, I heard the overall guidance, which is helpful. Is there any particular contours you'd call out again in terms of the direct-to-consumer versus partner break on gain on sale?\nJulie Booth: No. It's really been fairly consistent quarter-over-quarter.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ryan McKeveny from Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead. \nRyan McKeveny: So looking around the Fintech space, broadly, there's obviously a lot of turmoil as rates have moved higher. And the necessity of profits and cash flow come into focus. So in relation to your business, obviously, the mortgage business has remained profitable and cash generative, but you've also continued expanding in the newer aspects of the platform, whether it's auto or Rocket Homes or solar or Truebill. I believe in the past, you've referenced the profit first approach when expanding into new segments.  So I guess if you can comment, how do you feel about your positioning today for continued investment and expansion in those non-mortgage businesses? Are you driving profits across those businesses today? And I guess, given what's going on from a macro or competitive dynamic across the Fintech space, any change in the outlook for just how you see those business -- businesses growing and penetrating the market moving forward?\nJay Farner: Yes. So I think Julie can make a few comments here. But our philosophy has been, certainly, when you're standing up young businesses, the infrastructure and the growth is the primary objective. I talked a bit about the success we're seeing in Canada today, both on the tech side with Venmo and Lendesk technology, and then the Edison side with the growth there in the brokerage. That's a few years of investment that we're now really starting to see the traction. And it's a very interesting market for us because folks are refinancing their mortgage there every 3 or 4 years regardless of interest rate. And so now we'll start thinking about those businesses as they get their feet underneath them from a profitability perspective on things like Rocket Homes or Rocket Solar, those businesses offer some very good unit economics. Rocket Homes, in particular, allows not only for our clients to have a great experience, but has an impact across our platform. And so when we think about that business and how it impacts both mortgage and title and real estate, we think about that as being operated as a profitable business. And solar, although early on in its growth, and I announced the fact that here in a month or so, we're going to have our client-facing website will be launched, but the unit economics there are quite good, and especially the interest that our current client base is showing in these states which, of course, gives us a virtually incredibly low CAC on that client. So we think about that as a business that can grow, but also can move to profitability fairly quickly. And that's really where Julie has been focused is across the board, ensuring that we're being very thoughtful about how we manage these businesses to ensure that we're in a strong position today and in the future.\nJulie Booth: That's right. Yes. And today, we are -- those businesses are in various maturity stages in their life cycle, and we're investing in some and others are profitable on their own. Some of them were going to continue to invest for the next several quarters here as they continue to get their feet under them.  But from an ecosystem perspective, and there's lift that we get in other aspects of the business, the mortgage business from those other new start-up businesses and vice versa. So -- it's also about what we gain as a company as a whole for each of those businesses working together and the synergies that we get in addition to the individual profitability of those businesses, but we do have certainly a path to each one of those being profitable beyond the investment phase.\nRyan McKeveny: That's great. Helpful. Thanks, Jay and Julie.  So one more question. Just back to capital allocation. I know this has somewhat been asked, but obviously, with the strong balance sheet, but an uncertain macro environment. And I guess just looking at what's been done thus far, obviously, pretty significant capital returns via special dividends and share repurchases. So I guess how should we think about the capital allocation priorities and plans for shareholder returns into what is looking to be a more uncertain backdrop going forward?\nJulie Booth: Yes, it's a good question. And if you look at cumulatively now we have bought back 25.3 million shares and have executed $359 million of our $1 billion buyback program at this point. So -- we're continuing to look at the opportunity there to buy back shares as we've said in the past and talked about on this call, we're always going to look at investing in the business first. You saw us purchase Truebill just here in the fourth quarter, and continue to look for opportunities there. We do think there's -- kind of early on in the cycle here to see additional opportunities come to market just yet. And returning capital to shareholders through buybacks will be something that we continue to look at. And nothing's changed per se in the way we look at our capital structure from what we said in the past.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Richard Shane from JPMorgan.\nRichard Shane: Thanks everybody, for taking my question. Two questions. First, there was a conversation about MSR and the impact of higher rates. But ultimately, MSR valuations are really a function of CPR\u2019s. And as we sort of approach what's likely to be a terminal CPR, how much more room do you think there is for appreciation of the servicing rights?\nJulie Booth: Yes, that's a great question. As we do see CPR floors get kind of closer and closer the upside that we have is less significant. Now I just said $250 million is the year-to-date -- or sorry, quarter-to-date in Q2 increase. So there's still room for increase. Interest rates also drive that. The earnings on float is very significant to the assumptions that drive the value as well, and that is what is driving a lot of the increase in the second quarter. So you'll have both of those at play with still some upside room. But you're right, the levels upside does start to diminish.\nJay Farner: Yes. And that actually is an interesting opportunity perhaps because as we think about and generally spend a lot of time thinking about or talking about the management of this business, when she referenced on an annualized rate, $800 million or $880 million of cost savings that we've now taken action on. And we talk about the margin, and we talked about the direct-to-consumer, and we talk about the profitability. We're in a situation where holding MSRs still benefits us and we discuss our platform and lifetime value. I imagine that we'll see others have to sell MSRs to raise capital to continue operations. And that should present an opportunity for us to strategically be purchasing those MSRs as there's more pressure in the market for those who need to sell. So that, along with origination platforms, tech platforms, all under pressure means that thoughtfully exploring these opportunities, bolt-on or otherwise is an important place for us to focus our energies as we go through the year.\nRichard Shane: Got it. That's helpful. Second question, and again, I want to be sensitive to the context of this, which is that some of the new sort of alternative products in the mortgage business are very small in the context of your balance sheet and your overall business. But one of the hallmarks of Rocket as a public company has been mitigating liquidity risk related to originations by focusing on the conforming markets. And when we think about some of the other products that you're expanding into, I suspect that there is greater liquidity risk or uncertainty in terms of execution. Can you just talk about that a little bit and how you manage that?\nJay Farner: Well, if you look at what we're originating today from a mortgage perspective, we've got great liquidity. We'll always be thoughtful about anything that we're doing and whether we do want to hold any of that because we think it's a good financial investment for us, but always also making sure that we've got other avenues for that product. And if you're talking about products outside of mortgage, same situation. Everything that we're working on today, it's really our option whether we would want to hold that or whether we want to sell it, but there's multiple buyers in the marketplace for us. And I think that's an important philosophy that we've had for many years, and we will continue to have.\nJulie Booth: Great. We will always be looking first out, making sure we have liquidity for those products that we originate, whether it be immediate liquidity, certainly to finance it, consider securitizing it down the road as the volume grows, and that's always first and foremost in our minds as we're setting up.\nJay Farner: Yes. And I think this is a great place to end because life is one of those situations where you're living in the moment, sometimes it's very challenging to see past the month you just lived or the month that you're in, and it's critical that we keep a long-term view like we have for many decades now of this business. So originating a product that today might add a little bit of revenue to the top line of our business. But has a concern around liquidity would be something that we would not be interested in doing. Our focus would be on making sure our business is strong because it's not a matter of if, but when rates shift change and move and there's opportunity. The key is that you're there, that you can move quickly, that you have capacity and you have a strong company. And the way that we're setting up our platform in the way that we're continuing to grow our business as we bring on higher interest rate. And the entire industry brings on higher interest rate clients is that what we've done in the past we will be able to do it again, but at even greater scale. And so we would never want to put any of that at risk over some sort of short-term decision around a product that's not liquid. Our focus here is continuing to invest in all of the things that we know that will build out this platform for the long run to have success and take care of our clients and take care of our team members.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jay Farner for any closing remarks.\nJay Farner: Well, thanks, everybody, for joining us. We appreciate all the thoughtful questions, and we look forward to catching up with you again here at the next call. Have a great night.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Julie Booth",
            "content": "Thank you, Jay, and good afternoon, everyone. As we navigate through these rapidly changing market conditions, Rocket has continued to deliver profitable results while also further building out our platform and investing in key areas of our business. It's important to frame what we have experienced in the past few months. Since the beginning of the year, market conditions have changed dramatically. The rapid increase in interest rates this year has been the largest in over 40 years. Just last week, the Fed raised rates by 50 basis points, the first time in 22 years, the Fed has raised rates by more than 25 basis points at any one time. With this backdrop, our company continues to perform, and we are proud of our first quarter results. Rocket Companies generated $1.9 billion of adjusted revenue in Q1 compared to $4 billion in Q1 of 2021. We had $450 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter, representing a 23% adjusted EBITDA margin. We delivered GAAP net income of $1 billion or $0.40 per diluted share and adjusted net income of $293 million or $0.15 per adjusted diluted share. We generated closed loan volume of $54 billion during the quarter and net rate locks of $49.6 billion, at a gain on sale margin of 301 basis points. As Jay mentioned, demand for purchase and cash out refinance remains robust. The rise in home values has spurred demand for cash out refinance transactions. As we are seeing in our own pipeline, purchase demand remained strong with record levels of pre-approvals in March. Looking ahead to Q2, we expect our business to face headwinds due to the rapid increase in rates that has occurred year-to-date. For the second quarter, we expect closed loan volume in the range of $35 billion to $40 billion and net rate lock volume between $31 million and $38 billion. We expect second quarter gain on sale margin to be in the range of 260 to 290 basis points. Our gain on sale margin in the first quarter included a few onetime benefits due to the rapid move in bond markets, which lifted Q1 gain on sale margin by 15 basis points. Excluding this 15 basis point lift, our first quarter gain on sale margin would have been 286 basis points. Moving on to expenses. As a result of the rapidly changing mortgage market, we are taking significant cost reduction measures throughout the remainder of the second quarter. We expect to incur a onetime charge of approximately $50 million to $60 million related to the voluntary career transition program that we rolled out in the second quarter. Excluding this onetime charge, we expect Q2 expenses to be down approximately $200 million to roughly $1.4 billion as compared to first quarter total expenses of $1.6 billion. Around $100 million of the decrease is related to lower production expenses. The remaining decrease of approximately $100 million is expected to be driven by cost savings from a partial quarter of our voluntary career transition program and reductions in other non-team member related costs. On an annualized basis, the cost savings from our voluntary career transition program are expected to be around $180 million or roughly $45 million per quarter. We are focused on serving our clients and taking care of our team members. We will be disciplined with expenses while continuing to invest in key areas of our business to support the growth of our platform and ecosystem to position Rocket well for long-term growth. As we've talked about on prior calls, our servicing book is a strategic asset for Rocket. As of March 31, our servicing portfolio included 2.6 million clients with $546 billion in unpaid principal balance. During the first 3 months of 2022, the value of our mortgage servicing rights increased by $1 billion or 19% compared to Q4 including newly-created MSRs and the mark-to-market adjustment to $6.4 billion. While the mark-to-market change in MSR portfolio value is excluded from our adjusted net income metrics, it's worth noting that the positive market adjustment on the portfolio was $739 million in the first quarter, which is countercyclical in a rising rate environment. As a reminder, the mark-to-market increase in the value of the servicing portfolio is a result of the assumption that with the higher interest rates, servicing cash flows will extend and therefore, our recurring cash revenue will be greater. Our net client retention rate was 92% as of the first quarter of 2022 and reflects our ability to drive substantial client lifetime value for clients coming into our mortgage servicing book and positions us well to serve our clients for their next mortgage and across products in the Rocket ecosystem. We also drive a considerable amount of annualized recurring revenue from servicing our clients' mortgages. During the first quarter, annualized recurring revenues from our servicing book were over $1.4 billion. As Jay mentioned, when considering the cash flows from our servicing portfolio and Truebill, we have more than $1.5 billion of annualized recurring revenue as of March 31. From a capital allocation perspective, we have always prioritized maintaining a well-capitalized balance sheet with substantial liquidity capable of navigating different market conditions while remaining opportunistic. We exited the first quarter with $2.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet, and an additional $2.1 billion of corporate cash used to self-fund loan originations for a total available cash and self-funding of $4.4 billion. Total liquidity stood at $7.7 billion as of March 31, including available cash plus undrawn lines of credit and our undrawn MSR line. Our $4.4 billion of available cash and self-funding combined with $6.4 billion of mortgage servicing rights represent a total of $10.8 billion of asset value on our balance sheet as of March 31. This equates to $5.49 per share. We are well positioned in the current environment, and we'll continue to deploy our capital in a strategic and disciplined manner to generate long-term shareholder value. With that, we are ready to turn it back to the operator for questions. Yes. I sure can. And as we've said many times before, just to reiterate what Jay said, the decisions that we're making are intended to position the business for that long-term growth. So we won't make short-term decisions on expenses that are going to sacrifice long-term profitability. We've seen time and time again, we've been through these cycles. The amount that we can save today is going to be dwarfed by what we can make in the future when the upside opportunity comes to us by holding a little bit of extra expense, we've seen that time and time again. So that being said, we're certainly very, very diligent and responsible about how we're looking at our expenses. So this is why we're seeing our second quarter expenses coming down roughly $200 million from $1.6 billion in the first quarter to about $1.4 billion in the second quarter, excluding the onetime charge of the $50 million to $60 million related to our voluntary career transition program. So it is something that we are going to continue to be focused on throughout the year. Costs do take some time to come out. We'll have through natural attrition through looking at non-team member expenses. There will be other opportunities to continue to impact our expenses. And maybe just to put a little bit of a finer point on some of these savings. The cost savings that we'll get from our voluntary career transition program are expected to be around $180 million on an annual run rate basis, so $45 million a quarter. About half of that $45 million a quarter is going to be realized in the second quarter. So we'll see a full quarter of that in the third quarter as well. So there's a lot that we will continue to look at here as we go through the rest of the year, but that's how we're looking at our Q2 earnings. And if you annualize that run rate, if you think about $200 million coming out from Q1 to Q2, another $20 million coming out in the third quarter when we fully implement all the savings from the transition program, it's about $880 million of annualized expenses that we're going to be taking out here. 260 to 290. Yes, I think that's right, Jay. As you look at margins from 2020 into 2021. By the second quarter of 2021, I think we were at 278 for gain on sale margin. You kind of see it hold steady Q3, 305, then to 282 in the fourth quarter. 301, as I mentioned, that would have been 286. So as you look at our guidance, 260 to 290, it really is leveling out here over the past several quarters. Yes. Maybe while we're on the topic of MSRs, just to put some numbers around that, in 2021, we did about $200 million of capital acquiring MSR. So it is something that we are in the market looking at these potential opportunities. And if there's a one that makes sense for us for the reasons that Jay just mentioned, we're going to take that opportunity.  That asset is a very strategic one for us for many reasons. In terms of value, just year-to-date in the first quarter, the asset increased by about $739 million. As interest rates continue to rise, that asset becomes more and more valuable as those cash flows continue to expand. In fact, through April, it's up about another $250 million in value to us, so nearly $1 billion now. Interest rates at June 30 will ultimately depend or determine where that total value is for the quarter, but it's very, very valuable to us. No. It's really been fairly consistent quarter-over-quarter. That's right. Yes. And today, we are -- those businesses are in various maturity stages in their life cycle, and we're investing in some and others are profitable on their own. Some of them were going to continue to invest for the next several quarters here as they continue to get their feet under them.  But from an ecosystem perspective, and there's lift that we get in other aspects of the business, the mortgage business from those other new start-up businesses and vice versa. So -- it's also about what we gain as a company as a whole for each of those businesses working together and the synergies that we get in addition to the individual profitability of those businesses, but we do have certainly a path to each one of those being profitable beyond the investment phase. Yes, it's a good question. And if you look at cumulatively now we have bought back 25.3 million shares and have executed $359 million of our $1 billion buyback program at this point. So -- we're continuing to look at the opportunity there to buy back shares as we've said in the past and talked about on this call, we're always going to look at investing in the business first. You saw us purchase Truebill just here in the fourth quarter, and continue to look for opportunities there. We do think there's -- kind of early on in the cycle here to see additional opportunities come to market just yet. And returning capital to shareholders through buybacks will be something that we continue to look at. And nothing's changed per se in the way we look at our capital structure from what we said in the past. Yes, that's a great question. As we do see CPR floors get kind of closer and closer the upside that we have is less significant. Now I just said $250 million is the year-to-date -- or sorry, quarter-to-date in Q2 increase. So there's still room for increase. Interest rates also drive that. The earnings on float is very significant to the assumptions that drive the value as well, and that is what is driving a lot of the increase in the second quarter. So you'll have both of those at play with still some upside room. But you're right, the levels upside does start to diminish. Great. We will always be looking first out, making sure we have liquidity for those products that we originate, whether it be immediate liquidity, certainly to finance it, consider securitizing it down the road as the volume grows, and that's always first and foremost in our minds as we're setting up."

            "name": "Jay Farner",
            "content": "Thank you, Sharon. Good afternoon, and welcome to the Rocket Companies' Earnings Call for the first quarter of 2022. On today's call, I'll share how Rocket will continue to navigate and win in today's rapidly evolving market. We'll discuss our strength with both purchased and cash-out refinance mortgage products and how we continue to thoughtfully expand the Rocket platform.  In the first quarter, Rocket Companies generated $1.9 billion of adjusted revenue and $450 million of adjusted EBITDA. We delivered adjusted net income of $293 million or $0.15 per adjusted diluted share. The rapid increase in interest rates this year has been the largest in over 40 years. 30-year fixed rate mortgage rates are now north of 6% for the first time in more than a decade, increasing over 200 basis points in the past few months. This obviously creates challenging conditions for our industry. Rocket Companies has always navigated successfully through turbulent times by protecting our margin and our profitability, while continuing to invest in technology and marketing to grow market share. We will emerge stronger, grow market share through the cycle and reap the benefits as the ultimate market winner. As we look forward, our second quarter guidance of $35 billion to $40 billion of closed loan volume reflects the impact of a market experiencing unprecedented rate increases. In our experience, the ability to successfully navigate this difficult market requires several key attributes: a strong national brand; broad and diverse channels to capture the top of the funnel, a scaled technology platform with high operational efficiency; an experienced leadership team with the willingness to roll up their sleeves and get into the business; the best talent in the industry and a strong balance sheet, all areas where Rocket excels. Rocket has intentionally built our platform ecosystem and multichannel business model to navigate tough market conditions. We have invested in the pillars of our platform for decades with more than $7 billion invested in our trusted brand, leveraging important performance marketing insights strengthened by more than 200 million client records in our vast data lake, investing heavily in cutting-edge technology, attracting the best talent in the industry and growing our premier enterprise partnerships. Of significant importance is the fact that our servicing book has grown substantially and benefits from a rising rate environment. Servicing rights represent a $6.4 billion asset as of March 31, growing 19% quarter-over-quarter, while maintaining an industry-best retention rate of 92%. Our servicing portfolio alone generates $1.4 billion of annualized recurring cash revenue. Turning to our capital position. The $4.4 billion of available cash and cash used for self-funding along with our mortgage servicing rights, represent a total of $10.8 billion of asset value on our balance sheet as of March 31 or $5.49 per share. Rocket has amassed the financial strength and scale to weather the ebbs and flows of the market while also maintaining the flexibility to expand our platform through strategic acquisitions, if and when the right opportunity presents itself. We will be disciplined with expenses during this changing market. And in the second quarter, we've taken significant cost reduction measures that included implementing a voluntary career transition program to certain team members, reducing our production costs, including renegotiating large vendor contracts and shifting our marketing spend. We continue to review every aspect of our cost structure and are committed to running an efficient and effective business. Julie will dive deeper into these specifics in a few minutes. Our strong capital position and operating efficiencies allow us to be thoughtful about expenses while maintaining flexibility to invest in key strategic areas that set us up well for the long term. While we expect challenging times ahead, there are bright spots in the industry. Home values have risen to new highs, creating $26 trillion of available equity. Home buying demand remains strong, particularly from first-time homebuyers and millennials, currently the largest generation by population.  This is perfect for us. Since 75% of the clients who apply using Rocket's online platform or app our first-time homebuyers or millennials. In fact, recent securitization data shows that Rocket was the nation's largest lender to first-time homebuyers in 2021. Beyond purchase, this client pool represents a tremendous future opportunity when the market is once again ripe for rate and term refinances. As the market has shifted from rate and term refinance in 2020 and 2021, today's predominantly purchase and cash out refinance market, Rocket's ecosystem has shown its ability to provide a strategic advantage. We had our best first quarter ever for purchase mortgages and cash-out refinances, driving more than 80% of our overall mortgage origination volume. Each and every day, our bankers are having nearly 35,000 conversations, helping Americans achieve their dreams. Our technology platform helps deliver the speed and certainty that are critical in today's purchase-heavy market that our clients as well as our real estate agents and broker partners need. In fact, we recently launched the FAST 15 program for our mortgage broker partners, guaranteeing broker purchase loans will go from documents received to clear to close in 15 business days or less.  In addition, for the first time, Rocket Pro TPO has gained the title of number 1 most favored brand among mortgage brokers for its account executives and operations support, according to our brand health study conducted by a third-party firm. This speaks to our commitment to helping our broker partners succeed and grow. We look to further harvest our opportunity in cash out refinance leveraging exceptional marketing expertise, our vast data lake, client insights and highly trained Rocket cloud force. Our bankers are educating clients about using record levels of home equity to consolidate high interest debt, remodel their homes or help navigate life's events like marriage or a growing family. As we move into Q2, which has been seen by many as the official start of home buying season. Our purchase pipeline has been robust, pre-approvals had a record level in March, and our verified approval letters grew by more than 40% year-over-year. We continue to invest and expand the Rocket platform. Truebill, which became part of the Rocket ecosystem in December, has continued its impressive growth. The company now has 3.4 million members, up 142% from Q1 of 2021. Included in that 3.4 million members, our 1.7 million paying premium members, more than doubling from Q1 of 2021. Truebill helps our clients manage their entire financial lives and keeps our clients engaged in our ecosystem, generating over $100 million in growing in annualized recurring revenue. Rocket Homes notched 2 best in March, setting a record for the number of real estate transactions, and reaching 2.8 million monthly active users, both more than doubling year-over-year. Our Canadian subsidiaries are growing rapidly. Edison Financial, our digital mortgage brokerage, surpassed $500 million in cumulative funded loan volume from its first month of production in March of 2020 through March of 2022. Funded loan volume more than doubled and purchase volume more than tripled in Q1 compared to the same quarter last year. And Lendesk, our Fintech provider, servicing brokers, successfully integrated the acquisition of Finmo and nearly tripled its mortgage submission volume from the first quarter of 2021 to the first quarter of 2022. Rocket Solar continues its expansion. In fact, it currently operates in 27 major markets across 9 states, including Arizona, Florida and South Carolina, and a full public launch is slated for early next month. We see exciting opportunity ahead to serve our clients better and in more ways, further extending client lifetime value by leveraging our platform. With this new phase of the mortgage cycle, we look forward to executing on our playbook to exhibit the true strength of our platform. At the same time, we continue to move forward with fulfilling our mission to be the best at creating certainty in life's most complex moments so that our clients can live their dreams. With that, I'll turn it over to Julie to go deeper into the numbers. Julie? Sure. I'll get started, and I think Julie can chime in. But as I've been telling some of our team members, we're kind of in the third inning here of this process and one that we've lived through before, certainly back in 2008, 2009, 2010. We saw little glimpses of this in '14 and '19, but something that you've got to have a long-term view while you're taking short-term actions to ensure that the company is set up for success. And that's exactly what we've been doing.  I think you can tell from my comments and from Julie's comments that I'm very proud of the team and how quickly we have been making adjustments. So that's the question or made comment about marketing, it's not as much a reduction in marketing, is it a shift in marketing? And so as you start thinking about performance marketing opportunities, what we're starting to see is filing our capacity beginning to come out of the industry.  And that's the first step in the process is that you've got to see that capacity that was built up to handle $4.5 trillion come out to more of a $2 trillion, $2.5 trillion market, which is I think where we think we're going to be at. And as that happens, then opportunity starts presenting itself. So when we look at our marketing and our reach, although the market is moving from $4.5 trillion to $2 trillion, certainly, our ability to reach clients who are interested remains much stronger than that. And so that sets us up for long-term success. The next phase of that process is leading your team. And this isn't something you're going to see on a spreadsheet or probably read about in an earnings release. But you've got all of your team members, in particular, your marketing team members, your mortgage bankers, your operations folks who are now moving into a brand-new mortgage market. And so the amount of effort that our leaders are putting in day in and day out meeting coaching adjusting mindset. I mean this is the hard work that you don't necessarily read about in business books, but -- that you have to do that our leaders are doing day in and day out to position our banker for us to be successful.  And I'm watching it. I'm on the floor. I'm seeing it, and I'm seeing the shift in the change that gives me incredible confidence -- so on that offensive side, shift to marketing, leverage the data, ensure we're reaching the right client with the right offer, get the operations, marketing and team members adjusted to the new market and then go out there and hit the rock every single day. And in the end, you win. And that's what we demonstrated over 36 now, almost 37 years. On the more defensive side and Julie can speak to this, get your expenses in order and ensure that you've got a tight grasp on everything you're spending and it's the right place to put your dollars. And she can kind of talk about where we're at and where we're headed. And then, of course, leverage your balance sheet.  And so we're in a better position than we've ever been in. We talked about the asset value of our organization. But as we see people pull back as we see capacity get reduced, as we see people struggle, there'll be opportunities. And if they're the right ones, we're positioned from an asset perspective to take advantage of those opportunities that will position us to grow. And then the last thing I'll say before I turn to Julie is keep investing. And so we talk about the Rocket platform, not just Rocket Mortgage. And clearly, our history has been originating mortgages. But if you look at the hundreds and hundreds of people we have today in our product strategy group, in our marketing group, in our platform tech group, they are working on things that will grow out our technology platform to serve consumers far beyond mortgage. And that you want to keep investing in that, here is why. The more clients that we engage with and bring into our ecosystem at higher interest rates. The more people we will be able to help when interest rates fall. And I don't need to explain that to you. I can just go back and look at '20 and '21 to see what our company is capable of when we see a reduction in interest rates. Now magnify that by continuing to have other services, Truebill, Rocket Homes, Rocket Auto where we're engaging with clients. And we're setting ourselves up to have relationships with those clients and data about those clients so we can assist them in the future, we're setting ourselves up for the next opportunity to reap those benefits. But you got to do the hard work now and you've got to manage the business. Now we've demonstrated our ability to manage it profitably for 36-plus years. So Julie, maybe you want to comment on how we think about expenses in the process that we're working through there. Yes. I think capacity is coming out quite rapidly. As I watch and talk to other leaders across the mortgage space in particular. And as you listen to Julie's comments, excluding kind of the onetime effect of margin in Q1, I think she referenced 285 -- 286. And then if you look at the guidance that you provided for Q2, I think it's kind of in the similar ballpark. 260 to 290. So I think you're seeing us kind of in a range that we've seen in the past as well. Yes, a very good question. And certainly, one of the ways that we can continue to add to the servicing book, especially in the rising strategies that we are working on to inform that decision. And I referenced our Rocket Central team because as we think about Truebill, as we think about some other programs we're working on to launch this year, the engagement of that client is critical for us. As the number 1 service ranked by J.D. Power already as an advantage if we purchase MSRs because people are going to have a great experience coming in our servicing platform.  But it's also important to remember when we buy the client doesn't have the opportunity to originate through our system. And so they don't have that experience to kind of rely on. So developing and then employing these other engagement tools that we're working on. So as we purchased MSR, we can extend the lifetime value of that client has been our mission. And you see our 92% retention rate. And we know that, that works. And that, of course, gives us great confidence that we want to continue to bring clients on to our book because we know in the future, we'll reap the benefits. But the next strategic move is to build out or continue to build out these additional components of our platform because they do exactly what you're asking. They engage clients that we purchase if we purchase as an MSR and kind of turn their conversion rates similar to ones that we would originate and that's a very strategic advantage to us. So I'm sure as we continue forward this year in subsequent calls, we'll talk more about the work that we're doing there. So important strategy, being really thoughtful about it, but also wanting to make sure that we've got all of the components that we think are critical to maximizing the lifetime value of those MSRs that we bring on the platform. Yes. And the last thing I'll mention that maybe people kind of catch people off guard, sometimes people will say, well, you want to buy MSRs at a lower weighted average cost or interest rate because you want to refinance it. I suppose in a falling rate market, it's always beneficial. But actually now, it benefits us to be buying MSRs at a higher weighted average coupon because we set ourselves up to take advantage of that opportunity with that client when it's appropriate in the future.  So that's again, back to the lifetime value and our retention rate and all the things that we're building give us a strategic advantage to even be purchasing the MSRs at a higher interest rate level. So you'll see us continue to lean in as time goes on there. Yes. Well, first, I think when we look at the record level of pre-approvals that we were able to originate in Q1, when we look at, I think, setting a record for the most purchase volume closed in Q1 compared to any other Q1 we've had, we continue to see traction in purchase. I think that will be amplified by the fact that the capacity is coming out quickly. And in particular, in areas where people don't have the strong resources to continue to market.  So I feel very confident about our way to -- our ability to organically grow purchase. That said, your other comment about the availability of strategic opportunities that may allow us to lean into the purchase market, there are a handful of those type of opportunities that exist. And I think it's just a matter of staying close to them, watching them and ensure that we are making the right -- if we make an investment, making the right investment at the right time. And like Julie always says, we've got the capital to be strategic, and that's what we'll do. I don't know about increasing the flow. I think we see it as an opportunity to be buying our shares back as I've been doing and we've been doing at this point in time. Yes. Our product strategy team and our team in capital markets is very actively looking at additional programs that we can offer. I think they've rolled out a few different programs here recently, in particular, to our TPO space. I was reading something here a week or 2 ago. And so we're active there, whether it's a HELOC or a second or those type of things. I know they'll continue to think about the right products that help our clients not only today, but then allow us to build the relationship to a system in the future. One of the things that we've stood a team up here recently on is the rolling in of seconds and solar and/or home improvement loans because certainly, it makes sense for those clients to do so even in a rising rate market. And so we'll continue to think about those products and rolling them out and understand only the revenue that brings us today, but also the future revenue will gain when it's time for those clients to refinance again. I would say that our capital markets team is doing an excellent job hedging the pipeline and think about where our pipeline was here a year or so ago from a size perspective, it's well in hand and very pleased with the results that they've been delivering. Yes. Very good question. Look, all of our -- we're leaning into all of our different channels. Some we have more direct control over than others. And so from a direct-to-consumer perspective, that gives us the ability to make adjustments almost at an hourly basis in terms of how we market, how we allocate leads, all of those things.  So we're probably most active there. I was really pleased to see the third-party survey that was given to us here just a week or 2 ago, we're now in the wholesale space, we're the most favored brand based on our account executives and operations group. We know we've been delivering excellent service in that space, but it's great for a third party to reiterate that fact. And our broker partners have been asking for more assistance as they think about having to grow out their marketing platform in a more challenging market. So we're providing that assistance to those partners. And some of our other relationships are more long term and strategic. So as we leverage our sales force partnership, and start integrating with banking institutions. These are not relationships that are going to -- we're focused on driving revenue in a month or two, these are long-standing relationships where the focus is in the next 2, 3, 4 years and the ability for us to be plugged in directly to these financial institutions will allow us to grow at scale down the road. So we're not taking a, hey, how's the originations today approach there. We're really being more thoughtful about what kind of originations can that drive in the years to come, especially in years where we start seeing interest rates drop back down again, whether that's 4, 6, 8, no one can predict exactly when that will happen. But when it happens, with all that tech work being done fully integrated, it will just accelerate our ability to take advantage of a drop -- a lowering rate market in the future. Yes. So I think Julie can make a few comments here. But our philosophy has been, certainly, when you're standing up young businesses, the infrastructure and the growth is the primary objective. I talked a bit about the success we're seeing in Canada today, both on the tech side with Venmo and Lendesk technology, and then the Edison side with the growth there in the brokerage. That's a few years of investment that we're now really starting to see the traction. And it's a very interesting market for us because folks are refinancing their mortgage there every 3 or 4 years regardless of interest rate. And so now we'll start thinking about those businesses as they get their feet underneath them from a profitability perspective on things like Rocket Homes or Rocket Solar, those businesses offer some very good unit economics. Rocket Homes, in particular, allows not only for our clients to have a great experience, but has an impact across our platform. And so when we think about that business and how it impacts both mortgage and title and real estate, we think about that as being operated as a profitable business. And solar, although early on in its growth, and I announced the fact that here in a month or so, we're going to have our client-facing website will be launched, but the unit economics there are quite good, and especially the interest that our current client base is showing in these states which, of course, gives us a virtually incredibly low CAC on that client. So we think about that as a business that can grow, but also can move to profitability fairly quickly. And that's really where Julie has been focused is across the board, ensuring that we're being very thoughtful about how we manage these businesses to ensure that we're in a strong position today and in the future. Yes. And that actually is an interesting opportunity perhaps because as we think about and generally spend a lot of time thinking about or talking about the management of this business, when she referenced on an annualized rate, $800 million or $880 million of cost savings that we've now taken action on. And we talk about the margin, and we talked about the direct-to-consumer, and we talk about the profitability. We're in a situation where holding MSRs still benefits us and we discuss our platform and lifetime value. I imagine that we'll see others have to sell MSRs to raise capital to continue operations. And that should present an opportunity for us to strategically be purchasing those MSRs as there's more pressure in the market for those who need to sell. So that, along with origination platforms, tech platforms, all under pressure means that thoughtfully exploring these opportunities, bolt-on or otherwise is an important place for us to focus our energies as we go through the year. Well, if you look at what we're originating today from a mortgage perspective, we've got great liquidity. We'll always be thoughtful about anything that we're doing and whether we do want to hold any of that because we think it's a good financial investment for us, but always also making sure that we've got other avenues for that product. And if you're talking about products outside of mortgage, same situation. Everything that we're working on today, it's really our option whether we would want to hold that or whether we want to sell it, but there's multiple buyers in the marketplace for us. And I think that's an important philosophy that we've had for many years, and we will continue to have. Yes. And I think this is a great place to end because life is one of those situations where you're living in the moment, sometimes it's very challenging to see past the month you just lived or the month that you're in, and it's critical that we keep a long-term view like we have for many decades now of this business. So originating a product that today might add a little bit of revenue to the top line of our business. But has a concern around liquidity would be something that we would not be interested in doing. Our focus would be on making sure our business is strong because it's not a matter of if, but when rates shift change and move and there's opportunity. The key is that you're there, that you can move quickly, that you have capacity and you have a strong company. And the way that we're setting up our platform in the way that we're continuing to grow our business as we bring on higher interest rate. And the entire industry brings on higher interest rate clients is that what we've done in the past we will be able to do it again, but at even greater scale. And so we would never want to put any of that at risk over some sort of short-term decision around a product that's not liquid. Our focus here is continuing to invest in all of the things that we know that will build out this platform for the long run to have success and take care of our clients and take care of our team members. Well, thanks, everybody, for joining us. We appreciate all the thoughtful questions, and we look forward to catching up with you again here at the next call. Have a great night."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Rocket Companies Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Sharon Ng, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\nSharon Ng: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Rocket Companies' earnings call covering the fourth quarter and full year 2023. With us this afternoon are Rocket Companies' CEO, Varun Krishna; and our CFO, Brian Brown. Earlier today, we issued our fourth quarter and full year earnings release, which is available on our website at rocketcompanies.com under Investor Info. Also available on our website is an investor presentation. Before I turn things over to Varun, let me quickly go over our disclaimers. On today's call, we provide you with information regarding our fourth quarter and full year 2023 performance as well as our financial outlook.  This conference call includes forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions we mentioned today. We encourage you to consider the risk factors contained in our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or further events except as required by law. This call is being broadcast online and is accessible on our Investor Relations website. A recording of the call will be posted later today.  Our commentary today will also include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP metrics for our reported results can be found in our earnings release issued earlier today as well as in our filings with the SEC.  And with that, I'll turn things over to Varun Krishna to get us started. Varun?\nVarun Krishna : Thanks, Sharon. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining the Rocket Companies earnings call for the fourth quarter and full year 2023. Reflecting back on the last year, today, I'll talk about how our consistent execution drove exceptional results for the quarter and the year, especially given the backdrop of the market. I am so eager to share with you how we are positioning Rocket to operate with greater clarity, focus and velocity and how we will achieve growth and profitability at scale through our AI-fueled homeownership strategy. I'd like to begin on more of a personal note. It's hard to believe it's been nearly six months since I joined Rocket Companies, and time certainly flies when you're on a rocket ship. I continue to be inspired by our team members whose talent, energy and grit are the lifeblood of our company. I am so confident about our future and the collective impact we will make as a team. And the best part is that our journey is just beginning. We delivered strong fourth quarter and full year results against the backdrop of extreme market challenges as the industry faced persistent constraints in affordability and inventory. In Q4, we reported adjusted revenue of $885 million, representing an increase of 30% when compared to Q4 of 2022 and the second consecutive quarter that we've accelerated top-line growth on a year-over-year basis.  Now, adjusted revenue in the quarter was $85 million above the top end of our guidance range. We reported positive adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter in a row despite some of the most difficult industry conditions in three decades. Now in 2023, we delivered $3.8 billion in adjusted revenue, and I'm proud to share that we grew market share in both purchase and refinance annually. Purchase market share grew by 14%, and refinance market share grew by 10% from 2022 to 2023. It's worth emphasizing that we delivered positive adjusted EBITDA for the year which is largely a function of two factors: one, a strong top line; and two, our commitment to operational efficiency. And as you'll hear Brian discuss in more detail shortly, we made significant reductions to our cost base over the past two years, and we took difficult yet necessary actions to rightsize the company. This has helped us prioritize and focus on what we do best and what matters most. Now, as we look back at our 2023 results, there are a lot of great accomplishments to be proud of, but we are even more excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. We repositioned our organization in 2023, and we entered 2024 reinvigorated with momentum, clarity and a lean competitive edge. We are poised to deliver revenue growth, market share growth and further operational efficiency. Now I'd like to take a moment to recap what the leadership team and I have been focused on recently. And how it will position us for success in the future. Now, embracing transformation is an essential part of any big journey. A few months ago, I collaborated closely with our leadership team to write the next chapter of Rocket story together. We look inward. We spent thousands of hours engaging in a rigorous process of research, interviews, analysis, introspection and debate.  We dug deep to review the state of our business, our competitive strengths, and we identified our gaps as well as our opportunities. The outcome of this effort was a clear strategy to enable AI-fueled homeownership and a comprehensive blueprint that brings clarity and focus to our entire organization. By leveraging AI, we will transform an industry that is ripe for innovation, establishing Rocket as the premier choice for clients and partners, including local real estate agents, mortgage brokers and financial institutions. With a clear north star, we bend to bold steps to simplify our organizational structure, and we aligned our resources to our strategic priorities. We recently reviewed our full list of priorities and significantly narrowed the focus, reducing it by more than 80%. This allowed us to reallocate resources to areas where we wanted to double down while simultaneously streamlining our operational execution. Our goal is to focus intently on the things that matter the most to our clients and to do them better and faster than anyone else. I am personally committed to maintaining transparency regarding our progress, the cornerstone of which is providing visibility into how we are tracking against our goals and delivering on our commitments, which is what we internally refer to as having a high say-do ratio.  We have incredible talent here at Rocket, and we will continue to build a team that drives our success. We've realigned our organization with key leaders stepping into expanded roles. We also welcomed new talent to propel us forward. In January, Alex Rampell joined our Board. Alex is a Partner at Andreessen Horowitz and is one of the world's leading experts in AI and fintech. In addition, Jonathan Mildenhall, the former CMO at Airbnb, who Forbes is listed as 1 of the 10 most influential CMOs in the world recently joined our leadership team as the first ever Chief Marketing Officer for Rocket Companies. We're investing in world-class talent here at Rocket, and we're playing to win. Now our entire company is united behind a common vision and strategy, and we are executing at full speed. Earlier this month at Little Caesars Arena, right here in Detroit, we held our first all-company meeting since our IPO. More than 14,000 team members attended in the energy and the level of engagement were simply off the charts. The main focus of our all-company meeting was heavily geared towards artificial intelligence and the opportunity it presents for Rocket. With AI, we are rewriting the rules of the game and structurally and fundamentally changing how this industry operates.  Our mortgage origination has long been associated with inefficient up and down hiring cycles. Because of that, scale profitability has been notoriously difficult to achieve in the mortgage industry because that volatility and cyclicality have made it challenging to adequately plan ahead and invest for the future. The industry has traditionally staffed up rapidly to handle higher volume in upmarkets, only to reduce staff and respond to down markets. So those who don't manage capacity or liquidity effectively may be acquired or exit the industry altogether. And in 2023 alone, we saw this. We saw the industry with 62 M&A transactions, exits and bankruptcies, and recent data shows that capacity is down nearly 35% from the peak. We believe AI will shape the future of the home buying industry and Rocket leading the way. Technology is the answer to better client experiences and capacity management in our industry. We aim to redefine the home buying experience through AI and deliver market share growth, scaled revenue growth and profitability. I will share with you that automation and AI are being aggressively deployed across Rocket, helping us to deliver better client experiences at scale across the entire home-buying process. Now I'm going to share three examples of how AI is driving impact today across mortgage banking, underwriting and servicing. Purchasing a home can be an overwhelming process, which is why at Rocket, we excel in blending personalized service with cutting-edge technology. Now AI lets computers do what they do best, while allowing our team members to focus on what they do best, fostering relationships and connecting with our clients. So if you take, for example, our mortgage bankers, these team members play a crucial role because they guide clients through the entire mortgage journey. In Q4, we piloted an AI virtual assistant with 325 mortgage bankers or outbound client calls. Now previously, these bankers juggled notetaking, selling out applications, remembering regulatory requirements, all the while talking to our clients. What the AI assistant does is it seamlessly and accurately automatically transcribes, summarizes and populate hundreds of crucial application fields, hands-free in real time. So our bankers are more productive than they've ever been and they can now focus on what they do best with AI handling the rest. Now the initial response from this pilot has been overwhelmingly positive, and we're already seeing signs of dramatically faster turn times. We're excited to roll this technology out to our broader banking force to deliver a better client experience through the millions of calls that we make in a given year. Now switching gears in underwriting. Automation and AI are helping to deliver higher accuracy and operational efficiency at scale. An underwriting decision typically requires the gathering and verification of thousands of data fields, which are drawn from disparate resources and formats to populate key categories of income, assets, collateral, property and the credit profile.  Now, income verification is one of the critical inputs to an underwriting decision and also a very complex process that takes regulatory requirement, documentation accuracy, employment types and unstandardized data format into consideration. So in December, nearly two thirds of income verification were automated without an underwriter needing to intervene. This provided a fivefold improvement compared to just 15 months prior here at Rocket. So thus far, our automated income verification has posted zero audit findings which is also highly impactful as income verification issues are amongst the top reasons behind GSE repurchase request. I'm also excited to share that we've recently rolled out this great income verification technology to our mortgage broker partners, further enriching the offerings we provide to help them thrive. Now imagine applying these advances in automation at scale across all underwriting categories as we continue to take market share and grow.  Now in 2021, a record year for mortgage origination, when we processed 4 times the number of applications that we did in 2023, we demonstrated that our technology could scale up even when the industry was constrained by capacity. Today, we're in an even better position to drive operating leverage through automation and AI. We've made significant advances in automating income verification and then we're tackling asset verification next. Now, AI is also enhancing our client interactions at scale across devices, whether our clients are reaching us by phone, by computer or by mobile app. So take servicing, for example, in 2023, we facilitated 3.1 million client interactions with payment and escrow questions topping the list. Our servicing calls and chats are increasingly powered by AI, providing clients with smart, conversational self-service experiences 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Approximately 70% of our servicing calls and chats are fully self-serve without the need of team member assistance with interactions only escalating to team members where the human touch is required.  We've seen a continued trend of lower call volume in servicing as our AI-powered digital experiences become the preferred choice for our clients. And we're not just handling interactions, we're actually turning them into actionable insights. With AI's assistance, we're transcribing and tagging these servicing interactions, organizing this invaluable data to construct unified client profile in a centralized repository. From this repository, we train models to gain deeper insights and analytics. Our next objective is to expand this initiative to other areas of the business which ensures that AI continues to drive enhanced client experiences and operational efficiency across the board. With these examples, the consistent themes I hope to convey are, first, to harness the power of our data and artificial intelligence; second, to simplify and automate; and to third, unlock team member productivity and deliver better client experiences through speed, certainty and value.  The efficiency gains when deployed at full scale will be an absolute game changer for our organization as we will be able to serve many more clients without adding to our fixed cost structure. So really just scratching the surface here. There's so much more impact that generative AI can bring, and we're incredibly well positioned to capitalize on the opportunity and lead the industry. I am so honored to be a part of this next chapter in Rocket story. Looking ahead to the coming year, I'm confident in our team, our capabilities and our mindset. We look forward to sharing our progress with you on future earnings calls and during our first Investor Day later this year when our senior leaders will present on how we're executing our strategic priorities to enable AI-fueled homeownership.  And with that, I will turn it over to Brian.\nBrian Brown : Thank you, Varun, and good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, I'll cover our strong financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year 2023. I'll share how our AI-fueled homeownership strategy positions us for success this year and into the future. I'll conclude by sharing our outlook for the first quarter of 2024. In 2023, Rocket again made significant strides in market share growth, gaining share on a year-over-year basis in both purchase and refinance. More specifically, we grew purchase market share by 14% and refinance market share by 10% from 2022 to 2023. I am incredibly proud of what we accomplished in the face of an extremely challenging mortgage market. It's a testament to our grit and tenacity.  In my 10 years at Rocket, I have never been more excited about what's to come. Through the ups and downs of mortgage cycles, we have continued to invest in our data and technology foundation. And now with AI, Rocket will change this industry.  As Varun shared, we are unlocking capacity at scale through higher team member productivity and delivering a better client experience. We have made material progress in increasing scale and capacity in 2023, and we expect those gains to accelerate into 2024. Said differently, we believe we can keep our fixed costs relatively flat while originating significantly higher volumes. Turning to the full year results. We delivered $79 billion in closed loan volume and $3.8 billion in adjusted revenue in 2023. After cutting roughly a quarter of our cost base in 2022, we further reduced expenses in 2023 by nearly 20%. We are operating with greater clarity, and we're laser-focused on prioritizing the most important work that will deliver the highest impact.  In 2023, we took action to pivot or sunset projects that were not meeting our expectations, such as Rocket Auto and Rocket Solar. More recently, after conducting a review of our entire portfolio of projects, we cut the list by more than 80%, which helped reduce cost, but more importantly, it freed up resources to work on the core business. Despite the persistent macro challenges in 2023, for the full year, we delivered $67 million in adjusted EBITDA. We reported an adjusted diluted loss of $0.07 per share in a GAAP diluted loss of $0.15 per share.  Now, let's dive into our strong fourth quarter results. We generated adjusted revenue of $885 million, well above the high end of our guidance range. The $885 million of adjusted revenue represents a 30% increase from the fourth quarter of 2022 and marks the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth.  Our performance in the quarter was primarily driven by stronger-than-anticipated purchase and refinance volume and gain on sale margin as we continue to see capacity come out of the industry. We delivered these achievements in what was one of the worst quarters for mortgage originations in recent history.  Gain on sale margin for the quarter was 268 basis points, up nearly 25% from 217 basis points in the fourth quarter of last year. Net rate lock volume for the quarter was $16 billion. We generated $55 million of adjusted EBITDA, a year-over-year improvement of more than $250 million from Q4 2022 and this marks the third quarter in a row that we've reported positive adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was breakeven.  On our last earnings call, we committed to a further reduction in total expenses in the fourth quarter of $50 million to $100 million. Excluding the $51 million onetime charge in the third quarter, and we came in at the top end of the range, reducing total expenses by approximately $100 million in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. Our innovative products were also a key driver of our success in the period. Our home equity loan product continued to resonate with clients as we saw volume more than triple in the fourth quarter compared to the first quarter. This product offers a solution for clients who may want to tap into their home's equity without impacting the lower rate on their first lien mortgage. It also provides us with a great opportunity for a refinance transaction because when rates move lower, we will have the opportunity to consolidate the client's first and second lien mortgages. Home equity loans, ONE+ and BUY+ are unique products that have resonated strongly with both existing and new clients. Notably, the vast majority of our clients who came to us through these products were new clients who did not already have a loan with us. These innovative solutions helped us attract new clients into the Rocket ecosystem where they can experience our award-winning service for the first time and many times thereafter throughout their lives as homeowners. From a capital perspective, Rocket's strong balance sheet and substantial liquidity continued to serve as a major competitive advantage. Our financial strength provides us with flexibility and optionality that most of our competitors simply do not have. We ended the fourth quarter with $3.6 billion of available cash and $6.4 billion of mortgage servicing rights. Together, these assets represent a total of approximately $10 billion of value on our balance sheet.  Our $3.6 billion of available cash consists of $1.1 billion of cash on the balance sheet and an additional $2.5 billion of corporate cash used to self-fund loan originations. Total liquidity stood at approximately $9 billion as of December 31, including available cash plus undrawn lines of credit, plus our undrawn MSR lines. Our servicing portfolio is a key strategic asset and one where we have delivered award-winning service to our clients. J.D. Power has recognized Rocket Mortgage as being the best servicer in 9 of the last 10 years. We've notched these repeated wins by delivering amazing service. We meet our clients where they are, augmenting the human touch with technology to provide confidence and peace of mind. As Varun mentioned, AI is driving impact across our organization, including servicing, where we are enabling better client experiences through AI-powered interactions and insights. As of December 31, our mortgage servicing portfolio included nearly 2.5 million loans with $509 billion in unpaid principal balance. Our net client retention rate in the fourth quarter was 97%, which continues to be multiples higher than the industry average. Retention rate serves as a key metric engaging client satisfaction and is one of the primary indicators of client lifetime value. We also drive significant recurring revenue from mortgage servicing. During the fourth quarter, we generated $348 million of cash revenue from our servicing book, which represents approximately $1.4 billion on an annualized basis. Our industry-leading recapture rates resulting in significant client lifetime value allows us to be opportunistic with MSR acquisitions, and this will continue to be a focus of ours during 2024. Turning to our outlook for the first quarter of 2024. We expect adjusted revenue to be in the range of $925 million to $1.075 billion, the midpoint of which would represent a 13% increase quarter-over-quarter. This sequential improvement demonstrates notable strength as the industry's typical seasonality calls for a double-digit decline in origination volume from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. On a like-for-like basis, the midpoint of our Q1 outlook implies year-over-year growth of 13.4%, building on the trend of year-over-year revenue growth we've achieved in each of the past two quarters. Regarding operating expenses, we expect Q1 to be slightly lower compared to the same period last year due to savings realized from our operational efficiency efforts implemented in 2023. These savings will be partially offset by reinvestments in performance marketing, leveraged by Rocket Mortgage and a seasonal Rocket Money campaign. As always, our forward-looking guidance is based on our current outlook and visibility. We are entering 2024 with momentum, and we are poised for growth. We are optimistic about market conditions improving from 2023. Industry forecasters expect the size of the mortgage origination market to grow by north of 30% in 2024.  But regardless of what the market does, we expect to continue growing market share through our AI-fueled homeownership strategy and by driving scalable revenue growth and profitability. As I mentioned earlier, I have never been more excited about Rocket's future and what we can accomplish. The opportunity is tremendous, and we are poised to continue taking share and be the leader in the home ownership category.  With that, we're ready to turn it back over to the operator for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kevin Barker from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nKevin Barker : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to follow up on the outlook. It seems like you're implying that you're going to take market share in the first quarter. Do you assume that, that's going to continue throughout 2024 and accelerate revenue growth in '24 above the 30% growth that's implied from industry originations? And what I mean by that is, are you taking market share and then subsequently, the revenue growth will come with it? Thanks. Hello?\nOperator: Please stand by. We are experiencing some technical difficulties. One moment.\nVarun Krishna : Okay. Can you guys hear me okay?\nKevin Barker : Yeah, I hear you.\nVarun Krishna : Okay. Sorry about that, Kevin. Let me just repeat. Thank you for your question. We ended 2023 strong. We're entering '24 with momentum, and that's reflected in both our results and our guide. And we look at many factors when we think about the outlook for the year. We look at the forecast. We look at the CPI, we look at the 10-year treasury, we look at the Fed forward curve.  We look at our own data and most of the industry, we predict a 33% larger market, $2 trillion versus $1.5 trillion. We expect rates to drop in the second half of the year. And these are all tailwinds for Rocket. And so we're investing in growth, and we're playing to win. At the same time, when you think about the market share itself, the second part of your question, there are still multiple tailwinds as well. You have a lot of market consolidation with M&As and exits and bankruptcies. You have banks that are seeing market share and leaning back. You have Basel III, which is on the horizon. You also have industry capacity coming out.  So when you put all these things together, I mean, we do expect to accelerate growth. It's a bit of a survival of the fittest dynamic with winners taking most. We grew share double digits in both purchase and refi, and we feel very good about our position in terms of our assets and our endurance. So we're confident on building on those gains.\nKevin Barker : Okay. And then just to follow up on some of your comments around AI. Obviously, you're embracing this wave that's happening within fintech and AI in general. Could you just maybe give us a little bit more depth or a little more color around why the AI that you've developed or how far you've developed it, that is better than some of the biggest industry competitors, given we've seen several other companies also look to embrace AI. Maybe not at the scale, but maybe you can delve into why Rocket is different or at least well ahead of the rest of the industry? Thanks.\nVarun Krishna : Yeah, absolutely. Look, I'd start by just saying that we believe that AI is going to be absolutely transformative to this industry and to fintech and tech in general. And we've made quite a bit of progress, but we're just still scratching the surface. And we're in the earliest of innings, but our progress is only going to accelerate with generative AI. It's a major area of investment across the board. The biggest thing that I would say is AI is something that you have to have a right to win and the right to win means you have to have the assets, you have to have capabilities, you have to have data. You have to have these ingredients to create the right recipe. So because of those ingredients that we have at scale, it's why we expect to be a benefactor.  And I shared a couple of examples earlier on this call, three in particular, but you're going to expect -- you can expect to see us continue to show you more and more and more examples of how we're going to be differentiated, whether it's the 50 million call logs that we process every year, the thousands of attributes that we have on clients, how we use chat, how we use transcription, the 3.1 million clients that we engage with in servicing, document automation, appraisal review, hiring. So kind of across the board, we think we have a durable advantage because we have many of the ingredients that it takes to build one of the AI companies of the future. And so those are just some examples, and you can expect to see many more as we continue to make progress on this journey but it is a major strategic imperative, and we're investing across the board.\nKevin Barker : Thank you, Varun.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJeff Adelson : Yes, hi. This is Jeff Adelson on for James. I guess maybe I wanted to ask about some of the more recent focus from regulators on the nonbank oversight world on. Yellen's making some comments about that oversight of nonbank mortgage lenders in the future. And that sought put out this framework for monitoring risk for non-banks. I'm just curious if you could share your thoughts on how you're thinking about this. How have you been interacting with the regulators on this front yet? And maybe what could we be expecting to come here over the next year or two on this front?\nBrian Brown : Yeah, Jeff, I'll take that one. Thanks for the question. Listen, I'll start by saying, of course, we're aware of the comments, and we're staying close. But I'll also add, it's never a good idea to speculate too much on these matters. We have a really active presence in D.C., and we're watching it closely. But I guess if you think about it, from our perspective, we have an extremely strong balance sheet or a really strong capital profile and a ton of liquidity. I would say, one of the strongest in the industry, if not the strongest. The way we look at it, we actually stand up pretty well to even some of the banking capital requirements. So it's something we'll pay close attention to. But in a lot of cases, new regulation like this could actually increase our competitive advantage and sometimes even increase the moat around this business.\nJeff Adelson : Understood. And just to maybe circle back on some of the comments around AI, generative AI. Lots of examples here. It sounds like in initiatives you're kind of rolling through here. But do you have any early views at this point to maybe what kind of uplift to financial metrics look like as a result of these initiatives, whether it be profitability, EBITDA margin, EPS growth?\nVarun Krishna : Yeah. Thank you for sharing. I mean look, I think fundamentally, the simple answer is we expect this to be a transformative implication across the board, whether it's helping us be more efficient and productive, driving top line growth as well as bottom line growth. But it's a very natural technology to fit with every aspect of the home ownership journey, everything from home search to lead generation to underwriting, to servicing, appraisals. And so the great thing about this is we feel like the sky is the limit. And so we have made it a strategic imperative to apply this at the top level at every aspect of the company.  And so you can expect to see those gains be transformatively impacting every aspect of how we do business.\nBrian Brown : Yeah, Jeff. And I would just say completely agree with what Varun said. And to be clear, going back to some of our prepared remarks, we did about $79 billion of mortgage production last year. And right now today, we believe that we could put through the system a significantly higher amount of mortgage volume. And to Varun's point, we believe that will only accelerate in 2024 with some of our plans and future releases.  But if you think about it, there's kind of a couple of key roles in the mortgage business. One is a licensed loan officer, another one is a licensed underwriter and the ultimate goal is to increase the productivity of those roles because if you increase the productivity, you increase the capacity, but you also increase the velocity.  And if you increase the velocity, that means faster turn times and faster turn times mean better client experiences because if you're refinancing on interim refinance, you're saving money faster. If you're getting cash out, you're getting your cash faster. If you're making a purchase offer, having faster turn times means in a very competitive market, it makes your offer stronger because you can close faster. And by the way, to the extent that you can get loans off your balance sheet faster, it lowers your financing costs. So we completely believe that these will translate into financial metrics. And frankly speaking, they already have through some of the investments in 2023.\nJeff Adelson : Great. Thank you for taking my questions. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Christian DeGrasse from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. \nChristian DeGrasse : Hey, thank you. Data sale margin has hovered around the 2.7% levels for the past couple of quarters it\u2019s more off the lows, as you guys mentioned. So as you guys look at the competitive dynamics, the capacity coming out of mortgage, as you guys mentioned, and what could be a potential improving volume environment? How do you see margins trending from here over 2024?\nBrian Brown : Yeah, Christian, thanks for the question. So yeah, just to take a step back, I think it's important to look at what happened over 2023. To your point, there was sequential increase from Q1 to Q2 to Q3. And then as you saw here in the release, a slight dip in Q4, but that dip was completely planned because we see that in Q4. And it wasn't down as much as we typically see in Q4. And that's really important.  And then as we look ahead into the guide in Q1, the big component of that is strong gain on sale margins. There's no doubt about it. And when I say strong, I mean building on even the high point of last year, the Q3 number of 276 basis points. So I think your question is what are we seeing and why is that happening? And one component of it is absolutely capacity coming out of the system and price competitiveness seeing a little bit of relief. There's other components that go into gain on sale margins, too, like primary secondary spreads but absolutely capacity is a big part of that. Varun mentioned in his prepared remarks, some of the more recent reports are 30% to 35% down. We're starting to see that come through the system now. So look, we're not going to comment on exactly where we think gain on sale margins will be all of 2024, but I can say this is a great way to start the first quarter, being two thirds of the way through, a great way to start the year with a lot of momentum around gain on sale margins.\nChristian DeGrasse : Thank you. And I'd like to follow up on expenses. I understand the first quarter revenue guide this point to a nice uplift and looks to be pretty strong. It also looks like expenses are guided to be up a decent step higher quarter-over-quarter, down year-over-year. Can you maybe just help contextualize some of the moving pieces you guys mentioned a little bit further? How much of that's being driven by a pickup in volume, the seasonal marketing campaign you guys have talked about, some of these investments in AI. And then maybe beyond that, strategically how have you been thinking about expenses throughout the year beyond the first quarter?\nVarun Krishna : Yeah. I'll start and maybe ask Brian to chime in as well. I think the biggest thing I would share is that our primary focus is growth. And the reason for that is you have a $5 trillion home buying TAM. You have an incredibly fragmented market. You have no player with more than double-digit market share, and that's a great place for us to be disruptive and drive growth, especially with AI. So we're always looking for efficiency.  We think we're in a good place. We're actually well capitalized, as Brian shared, but we're trying to invest our dollars in innovation, and we're trying to figure out ways that we can actually attrite significantly more with the ingredients that we have. So part of that is where you see our increase in focus and prioritization. But we have a lot of share to take, and we want to invest our resources to win. And let me ask Brian if there's anything he would add.\nBrian Brown : Yeah. Thanks, Varun. I completely agree. And just even taking a step back on the expense front, 2023 was about doing the difficult but necessary work to rightsize the business, but it was also about narrowing our focus. We mentioned narrowing our priority list by roughly 80%. And if you think about what's left, it's really stuff about -- that's a part of our core business and home ownership.  And then to Varun's point, we did something we don't believe others did. We still continue to invest through the down part of the cycle. And that's important because if you were going to start that now, it's much, much too late. And this is largely a big reason for some of this capacity gains that we've been talking about. To answer your question more specifically, I'll talk a little bit -- if you look at like Q1 of this year to Q1 of last year, there are a couple of things going on. Number one, Rocket Money had a really great first quarter of this year. That's their biggest customer acquisition month. They call it their Q5. They actually had a record quarter. So there was some performance marketing this year in Q1 that wasn't quite substantial last year.  And then the other piece, and you mentioned it is a difference in performance marketing. You mentioned the growth in the client acquisition. That's simply a math equation. We're going to spend that money when we like the returns. And starting off the first quarter with momentum, we're seeing some nice returns.\nChristian DeGrasse : Great, thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kyle Joseph from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nKyle Joseph : Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to dig into expenses and profitability a little bit more. I just want to get a sense for how big Rocket Money has become as a percentage of marketing. Obviously, there's some seasonality to that business.  And then just as we think about, obviously, there's some variability in your expenses tied to your originations. But how much does the AI initiative really impact the fixed versus kind of floating nature of your expense as originations hopefully ramp up?\nVarun Krishna : Yeah. Thank you for the question, Kyle. I want to -- I'll just start with Rocket Money. And Rocket Money, obviously, is a part of our Personal Finance division, and the team has done a fantastic job. I believe they've grown almost twice the volume since the acquisition. This is an area on a personal note that I'm very passionate about, given my background. The business has over 5 million members. They've saved our clients over $1 billion in savings. And quite frankly, it's the best personal finance app there is.  We've seen impressive top line growth. I believe in December, they were the number one app in the App Store in the finance category, and they're on track, as Brian said, for the best quarter ever. And as we think about AI, the thing I would say before handing it over to Brian is this is really about supercharging everything we do around homeownership. It's about making sure that our team members can be orders of magnitude, more productive which is what we need when we're trying to go after a massive market and go after share. And so this is really about allowing us to do more with the same and to allow us to basically take share and grow in a market that's incredibly fragmented and there are multiple places in which we're investing in AI across the board at every level of the organization.  And so a huge strategic imperative for us. And I'll ask Brian to comment on some of the more specifics.\nBrian Brown : Yeah, Kyle. Just to jump in a little bit on your fixed versus variable. I want to be clear because we think we're in a really good spot on expense reductions after the past two years in those tough efforts. We focused, of course, mostly on the fixed expenses and we feel really good about that. I mean this business is a beautiful thing, is volume and revenue is growing and operating leverage continues to expand. Again, not -- we don't know exactly what will happen in 2024. But to Varun's earlier comments, most of the industry forecasters are predicting about a 30% to 35% increase.  So if you slap something like that on the same fixed cost base, you'll really like the outcome. The beauty of this business is once you cover those fixed costs, that next loan, a huge chunk of that drops to the bottom line. We still focus on, of course, the variable side and lowering that aspect of the business. But from a fixed cost side, we feel good about where we're at. We'll continue to monitor and watch the market and respond to conditions as any good business leader would but as we sit today with a strong Q1 guide and a decent forecast from the market of what '24 could look like, we feel good.\nKyle Joseph : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nDon Fandetti : Yeah. I guess on the capacity coming down in the industry, are you -- is the trend strong enough in your view that you can sort of get back to like the 300-plus basis point gain on sale margin ultimately? And is Q1, I guess, will we see progression through the year? Is that kind of your sense where it's not just like a kind of peak in Q1 on the margin?\nBrian Brown : Yeah. It's hard to say exactly what will happen in terms of the rest of '24 because obviously, there's a lot of factors like interest rates and things that go into that. But what I can say is we're sitting here two thirds of the way through the first quarter. And we're building on the high point of last year, those Q3 gain on sale margins.  So it feels good. Like we had mentioned earlier, we do believe the primary reason for that is capacity coming out of the system. We saw that through 2023, really elevated in the second half of 2023. And now we're starting to actually see it flow through in terms of pricing competitiveness.  So it's hard to say exactly what will happen. But I'll tell you what, as we sit here in the first quarter, guiding up and we sit here looking at the overall mortgage forecast and it's both coming from volume increases and gain on sale margin increases, it feels pretty good to us.\nDon Fandetti : Okay. Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan McKeveny from Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.\nRyan McKeveny : Hey, thank you. Exciting times even with this macro. So I want to ask on Rocket Homes. Always a lot of buzz around the online search portals. There's some new competitors. There's always a lot of innovation. Can you maybe talk to us about how you feel Rocket Homes is positioned within that online ecosystem? What's your view around the differentiation of your platform and ultimately, maybe tie it to some of the long-term vision, either specific to the Rocket Homes business or even the interplay with purchase market share over time? Thanks.\nVarun Krishna : Yeah. Thank you for the question, Ryan. I'll start by just saying that it's critical. And one of the reasons we have this amazing aspect of our company structure and organization is that home search is the first part of the journey. And it's no secret that hundreds of millions of consumers use home search apps multiple times daily because it's the starting point of the journey. And so that part of the experience is critical to drive a disruptive experience in purchase, which is why this is such an important part of our strategy.  And I'm very proud of the Rocket Homes team because they continue to innovate past the bleeding edge. Two examples I will give you is the recent release that they launched with CarPlay, which allows you to have a local driving experience as you're driving around looking for homes. It's a very natural experience that is cultivated around home search. It's a way to build intent. It's the way to use location services, AI and data to really create a personalized experience that meets clients where they are. The second thing I would share is the team isn't stopping there. We just talked about a beta that we released with the new Apple Vision Pro that changes the game when it comes to things like spatial computing and being able to tour homes, publish listings and really using the next generation of virtual and augmented reality. And so home search is a big, big part of our strategy because it's kind of the beginning point of the journey of the purchase experience and if we can build intent with clients and we can build readiness with a combination of assets like Rocket Homes, Rocket Money, leveraging technology, we can bring them into the home purchase journey in a way that's more personalized, that's more streamlined and ultimately drives speed, certainty and value.  So it's a big part of our strategy. It's a big part of the top of the funnel and the team has done a good job, and we're continuing to invest.\nRyan McKeveny : Thanks, Varun. That's helpful. Second question, on the marketing side of things. I guess, big picture, you guys have always innovated there. You've been very prominent as a brand in this industry. I guess, anything you can share with us on how things evolve with Jonathan as CMO, what changes in terms of the focus, what remains the same? Any thoughts there?\nVarun Krishna : Yeah. I mean I would start by just saying that the best is yet to come. We've hired a pretty kickass new CMO, and we have big, big plans for our brand. The great thing about Rocket is it already is a household brand but we're scratching the surface on what's possible. And so we're continuing to invest. I think we have big plans for the near future and buckle up and stay tuned is what I would say.\nRyan McKeveny : Sounds, great. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harter from UBS. Your line is open.\nDoug Harter: Thanks. In prior quarters or I think last quarter, you purchased MSR. Can you talk about how your appetite -- what your appetite is today for using that as a potential customer acquisition channel?\nBrian Brown : Hey, Doug, it's Brian. Yeah. Thanks. I'll take a shot at that. Servicing continues to be an important asset. It's a strategic asset for us. We really like the returns, of course. You're looking at double-digit returns just when you look at the cash flows alone. But as you know, when you add in the recapture rates, that's where the returns get really exciting. And just for the record, we think about the servicing asset a bit differently than some others in the space.  We think we're pretty good at collecting the cash flows efficiently and a lot of that drops to the bottom line. But more importantly, is building that lifetime relationship with the client and capturing that next mortgage transaction because we know that next mortgage transaction is worth more than almost all the actual cash flows that you're collecting combined. So we have been active in the market. We have been actively bidding. In terms of supply, there is supply out there. I wouldn't call it great supply right now. The bids are fairly aggressive. You have players out there that have publicly stated that they need to grow the servicing portfolio. So of course, you see a lot of those players show up. In terms of us, the stuff that's interesting for us is a couple fold. One, we like the higher note rates out there, the on-the-run production because rates or when rates were to drop, those clients getting the money pretty fast and we'd love to take care of them and save them some money on their monthly payment. But it's also just about onboarding new clients to our servicing experience, which is J.D. Power award-winning and letting them experience Rocket experience in taking care of them. It's a lifetime value lens. It's not just a servicing lens.\nDoug Harter: Great. And just to follow up on that last point. I mean, I guess, what are the steps that you can do to kind of increase your ability to kind of retain that customer versus if they might have more loyalties elsewhere versus the customer that kind of chose to come in with Rocket on the initial mortgage?\nBrian Brown : Yeah. Well, it starts with a great onboarding experience. Switching services can be a difficult and painful experience, if you've ever had that happen to you. So it starts with a great onboarding experience and it starts with a great servicing platform and a great product and making sure that you're building a relationship with the client and getting in front of them at the right time without getting in front of them too often.  So that -- if you think about our wheelhouse in terms of performance marketing, sharing a great experience in our brand with clients, there's no better way of doing it than when we have an excuse, at least on a monthly basis to interact with them and show off some of the products and features that we have built into the experience.\nDoug Harter: Thank you. \nOperator: And we have reached the end of our question-and-answer period. I will now turn the call back over to CEO, Varun Krishna, for some final closing remarks.\nVarun Krishna: Well, thank you, everyone, for joining our call, and we look forward to seeing you next quarter and just a special invite to come to our Investor Day. Stay tuned for details.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brian Brown",
            "content": "Thank you, Varun, and good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, I'll cover our strong financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year 2023. I'll share how our AI-fueled homeownership strategy positions us for success this year and into the future. I'll conclude by sharing our outlook for the first quarter of 2024. In 2023, Rocket again made significant strides in market share growth, gaining share on a year-over-year basis in both purchase and refinance. More specifically, we grew purchase market share by 14% and refinance market share by 10% from 2022 to 2023. I am incredibly proud of what we accomplished in the face of an extremely challenging mortgage market. It's a testament to our grit and tenacity.  In my 10 years at Rocket, I have never been more excited about what's to come. Through the ups and downs of mortgage cycles, we have continued to invest in our data and technology foundation. And now with AI, Rocket will change this industry.  As Varun shared, we are unlocking capacity at scale through higher team member productivity and delivering a better client experience. We have made material progress in increasing scale and capacity in 2023, and we expect those gains to accelerate into 2024. Said differently, we believe we can keep our fixed costs relatively flat while originating significantly higher volumes. Turning to the full year results. We delivered $79 billion in closed loan volume and $3.8 billion in adjusted revenue in 2023. After cutting roughly a quarter of our cost base in 2022, we further reduced expenses in 2023 by nearly 20%. We are operating with greater clarity, and we're laser-focused on prioritizing the most important work that will deliver the highest impact.  In 2023, we took action to pivot or sunset projects that were not meeting our expectations, such as Rocket Auto and Rocket Solar. More recently, after conducting a review of our entire portfolio of projects, we cut the list by more than 80%, which helped reduce cost, but more importantly, it freed up resources to work on the core business. Despite the persistent macro challenges in 2023, for the full year, we delivered $67 million in adjusted EBITDA. We reported an adjusted diluted loss of $0.07 per share in a GAAP diluted loss of $0.15 per share.  Now, let's dive into our strong fourth quarter results. We generated adjusted revenue of $885 million, well above the high end of our guidance range. The $885 million of adjusted revenue represents a 30% increase from the fourth quarter of 2022 and marks the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth.  Our performance in the quarter was primarily driven by stronger-than-anticipated purchase and refinance volume and gain on sale margin as we continue to see capacity come out of the industry. We delivered these achievements in what was one of the worst quarters for mortgage originations in recent history.  Gain on sale margin for the quarter was 268 basis points, up nearly 25% from 217 basis points in the fourth quarter of last year. Net rate lock volume for the quarter was $16 billion. We generated $55 million of adjusted EBITDA, a year-over-year improvement of more than $250 million from Q4 2022 and this marks the third quarter in a row that we've reported positive adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was breakeven.  On our last earnings call, we committed to a further reduction in total expenses in the fourth quarter of $50 million to $100 million. Excluding the $51 million onetime charge in the third quarter, and we came in at the top end of the range, reducing total expenses by approximately $100 million in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. Our innovative products were also a key driver of our success in the period. Our home equity loan product continued to resonate with clients as we saw volume more than triple in the fourth quarter compared to the first quarter. This product offers a solution for clients who may want to tap into their home's equity without impacting the lower rate on their first lien mortgage. It also provides us with a great opportunity for a refinance transaction because when rates move lower, we will have the opportunity to consolidate the client's first and second lien mortgages. Home equity loans, ONE+ and BUY+ are unique products that have resonated strongly with both existing and new clients. Notably, the vast majority of our clients who came to us through these products were new clients who did not already have a loan with us. These innovative solutions helped us attract new clients into the Rocket ecosystem where they can experience our award-winning service for the first time and many times thereafter throughout their lives as homeowners. From a capital perspective, Rocket's strong balance sheet and substantial liquidity continued to serve as a major competitive advantage. Our financial strength provides us with flexibility and optionality that most of our competitors simply do not have. We ended the fourth quarter with $3.6 billion of available cash and $6.4 billion of mortgage servicing rights. Together, these assets represent a total of approximately $10 billion of value on our balance sheet.  Our $3.6 billion of available cash consists of $1.1 billion of cash on the balance sheet and an additional $2.5 billion of corporate cash used to self-fund loan originations. Total liquidity stood at approximately $9 billion as of December 31, including available cash plus undrawn lines of credit, plus our undrawn MSR lines. Our servicing portfolio is a key strategic asset and one where we have delivered award-winning service to our clients. J.D. Power has recognized Rocket Mortgage as being the best servicer in 9 of the last 10 years. We've notched these repeated wins by delivering amazing service. We meet our clients where they are, augmenting the human touch with technology to provide confidence and peace of mind. As Varun mentioned, AI is driving impact across our organization, including servicing, where we are enabling better client experiences through AI-powered interactions and insights. As of December 31, our mortgage servicing portfolio included nearly 2.5 million loans with $509 billion in unpaid principal balance. Our net client retention rate in the fourth quarter was 97%, which continues to be multiples higher than the industry average. Retention rate serves as a key metric engaging client satisfaction and is one of the primary indicators of client lifetime value. We also drive significant recurring revenue from mortgage servicing. During the fourth quarter, we generated $348 million of cash revenue from our servicing book, which represents approximately $1.4 billion on an annualized basis. Our industry-leading recapture rates resulting in significant client lifetime value allows us to be opportunistic with MSR acquisitions, and this will continue to be a focus of ours during 2024. Turning to our outlook for the first quarter of 2024. We expect adjusted revenue to be in the range of $925 million to $1.075 billion, the midpoint of which would represent a 13% increase quarter-over-quarter. This sequential improvement demonstrates notable strength as the industry's typical seasonality calls for a double-digit decline in origination volume from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. On a like-for-like basis, the midpoint of our Q1 outlook implies year-over-year growth of 13.4%, building on the trend of year-over-year revenue growth we've achieved in each of the past two quarters. Regarding operating expenses, we expect Q1 to be slightly lower compared to the same period last year due to savings realized from our operational efficiency efforts implemented in 2023. These savings will be partially offset by reinvestments in performance marketing, leveraged by Rocket Mortgage and a seasonal Rocket Money campaign. As always, our forward-looking guidance is based on our current outlook and visibility. We are entering 2024 with momentum, and we are poised for growth. We are optimistic about market conditions improving from 2023. Industry forecasters expect the size of the mortgage origination market to grow by north of 30% in 2024.  But regardless of what the market does, we expect to continue growing market share through our AI-fueled homeownership strategy and by driving scalable revenue growth and profitability. As I mentioned earlier, I have never been more excited about Rocket's future and what we can accomplish. The opportunity is tremendous, and we are poised to continue taking share and be the leader in the home ownership category.  With that, we're ready to turn it back over to the operator for questions. Yeah, Jeff, I'll take that one. Thanks for the question. Listen, I'll start by saying, of course, we're aware of the comments, and we're staying close. But I'll also add, it's never a good idea to speculate too much on these matters. We have a really active presence in D.C., and we're watching it closely. But I guess if you think about it, from our perspective, we have an extremely strong balance sheet or a really strong capital profile and a ton of liquidity. I would say, one of the strongest in the industry, if not the strongest. The way we look at it, we actually stand up pretty well to even some of the banking capital requirements. So it's something we'll pay close attention to. But in a lot of cases, new regulation like this could actually increase our competitive advantage and sometimes even increase the moat around this business. Yeah, Jeff. And I would just say completely agree with what Varun said. And to be clear, going back to some of our prepared remarks, we did about $79 billion of mortgage production last year. And right now today, we believe that we could put through the system a significantly higher amount of mortgage volume. And to Varun's point, we believe that will only accelerate in 2024 with some of our plans and future releases.  But if you think about it, there's kind of a couple of key roles in the mortgage business. One is a licensed loan officer, another one is a licensed underwriter and the ultimate goal is to increase the productivity of those roles because if you increase the productivity, you increase the capacity, but you also increase the velocity.  And if you increase the velocity, that means faster turn times and faster turn times mean better client experiences because if you're refinancing on interim refinance, you're saving money faster. If you're getting cash out, you're getting your cash faster. If you're making a purchase offer, having faster turn times means in a very competitive market, it makes your offer stronger because you can close faster. And by the way, to the extent that you can get loans off your balance sheet faster, it lowers your financing costs. So we completely believe that these will translate into financial metrics. And frankly speaking, they already have through some of the investments in 2023. Yeah, Christian, thanks for the question. So yeah, just to take a step back, I think it's important to look at what happened over 2023. To your point, there was sequential increase from Q1 to Q2 to Q3. And then as you saw here in the release, a slight dip in Q4, but that dip was completely planned because we see that in Q4. And it wasn't down as much as we typically see in Q4. And that's really important.  And then as we look ahead into the guide in Q1, the big component of that is strong gain on sale margins. There's no doubt about it. And when I say strong, I mean building on even the high point of last year, the Q3 number of 276 basis points. So I think your question is what are we seeing and why is that happening? And one component of it is absolutely capacity coming out of the system and price competitiveness seeing a little bit of relief. There's other components that go into gain on sale margins, too, like primary secondary spreads but absolutely capacity is a big part of that. Varun mentioned in his prepared remarks, some of the more recent reports are 30% to 35% down. We're starting to see that come through the system now. So look, we're not going to comment on exactly where we think gain on sale margins will be all of 2024, but I can say this is a great way to start the first quarter, being two thirds of the way through, a great way to start the year with a lot of momentum around gain on sale margins. Yeah. Thanks, Varun. I completely agree. And just even taking a step back on the expense front, 2023 was about doing the difficult but necessary work to rightsize the business, but it was also about narrowing our focus. We mentioned narrowing our priority list by roughly 80%. And if you think about what's left, it's really stuff about -- that's a part of our core business and home ownership.  And then to Varun's point, we did something we don't believe others did. We still continue to invest through the down part of the cycle. And that's important because if you were going to start that now, it's much, much too late. And this is largely a big reason for some of this capacity gains that we've been talking about. To answer your question more specifically, I'll talk a little bit -- if you look at like Q1 of this year to Q1 of last year, there are a couple of things going on. Number one, Rocket Money had a really great first quarter of this year. That's their biggest customer acquisition month. They call it their Q5. They actually had a record quarter. So there was some performance marketing this year in Q1 that wasn't quite substantial last year.  And then the other piece, and you mentioned it is a difference in performance marketing. You mentioned the growth in the client acquisition. That's simply a math equation. We're going to spend that money when we like the returns. And starting off the first quarter with momentum, we're seeing some nice returns. Yeah, Kyle. Just to jump in a little bit on your fixed versus variable. I want to be clear because we think we're in a really good spot on expense reductions after the past two years in those tough efforts. We focused, of course, mostly on the fixed expenses and we feel really good about that. I mean this business is a beautiful thing, is volume and revenue is growing and operating leverage continues to expand. Again, not -- we don't know exactly what will happen in 2024. But to Varun's earlier comments, most of the industry forecasters are predicting about a 30% to 35% increase.  So if you slap something like that on the same fixed cost base, you'll really like the outcome. The beauty of this business is once you cover those fixed costs, that next loan, a huge chunk of that drops to the bottom line. We still focus on, of course, the variable side and lowering that aspect of the business. But from a fixed cost side, we feel good about where we're at. We'll continue to monitor and watch the market and respond to conditions as any good business leader would but as we sit today with a strong Q1 guide and a decent forecast from the market of what '24 could look like, we feel good. Yeah. It's hard to say exactly what will happen in terms of the rest of '24 because obviously, there's a lot of factors like interest rates and things that go into that. But what I can say is we're sitting here two thirds of the way through the first quarter. And we're building on the high point of last year, those Q3 gain on sale margins.  So it feels good. Like we had mentioned earlier, we do believe the primary reason for that is capacity coming out of the system. We saw that through 2023, really elevated in the second half of 2023. And now we're starting to actually see it flow through in terms of pricing competitiveness.  So it's hard to say exactly what will happen. But I'll tell you what, as we sit here in the first quarter, guiding up and we sit here looking at the overall mortgage forecast and it's both coming from volume increases and gain on sale margin increases, it feels pretty good to us. Hey, Doug, it's Brian. Yeah. Thanks. I'll take a shot at that. Servicing continues to be an important asset. It's a strategic asset for us. We really like the returns, of course. You're looking at double-digit returns just when you look at the cash flows alone. But as you know, when you add in the recapture rates, that's where the returns get really exciting. And just for the record, we think about the servicing asset a bit differently than some others in the space.  We think we're pretty good at collecting the cash flows efficiently and a lot of that drops to the bottom line. But more importantly, is building that lifetime relationship with the client and capturing that next mortgage transaction because we know that next mortgage transaction is worth more than almost all the actual cash flows that you're collecting combined. So we have been active in the market. We have been actively bidding. In terms of supply, there is supply out there. I wouldn't call it great supply right now. The bids are fairly aggressive. You have players out there that have publicly stated that they need to grow the servicing portfolio. So of course, you see a lot of those players show up. In terms of us, the stuff that's interesting for us is a couple fold. One, we like the higher note rates out there, the on-the-run production because rates or when rates were to drop, those clients getting the money pretty fast and we'd love to take care of them and save them some money on their monthly payment. But it's also just about onboarding new clients to our servicing experience, which is J.D. Power award-winning and letting them experience Rocket experience in taking care of them. It's a lifetime value lens. It's not just a servicing lens. Yeah. Well, it starts with a great onboarding experience. Switching services can be a difficult and painful experience, if you've ever had that happen to you. So it starts with a great onboarding experience and it starts with a great servicing platform and a great product and making sure that you're building a relationship with the client and getting in front of them at the right time without getting in front of them too often.  So that -- if you think about our wheelhouse in terms of performance marketing, sharing a great experience in our brand with clients, there's no better way of doing it than when we have an excuse, at least on a monthly basis to interact with them and show off some of the products and features that we have built into the experience."

            "name": "Varun Krishna",
            "content": "Thanks, Sharon. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining the Rocket Companies earnings call for the fourth quarter and full year 2023. Reflecting back on the last year, today, I'll talk about how our consistent execution drove exceptional results for the quarter and the year, especially given the backdrop of the market. I am so eager to share with you how we are positioning Rocket to operate with greater clarity, focus and velocity and how we will achieve growth and profitability at scale through our AI-fueled homeownership strategy. I'd like to begin on more of a personal note. It's hard to believe it's been nearly six months since I joined Rocket Companies, and time certainly flies when you're on a rocket ship. I continue to be inspired by our team members whose talent, energy and grit are the lifeblood of our company. I am so confident about our future and the collective impact we will make as a team. And the best part is that our journey is just beginning. We delivered strong fourth quarter and full year results against the backdrop of extreme market challenges as the industry faced persistent constraints in affordability and inventory. In Q4, we reported adjusted revenue of $885 million, representing an increase of 30% when compared to Q4 of 2022 and the second consecutive quarter that we've accelerated top-line growth on a year-over-year basis.  Now, adjusted revenue in the quarter was $85 million above the top end of our guidance range. We reported positive adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter in a row despite some of the most difficult industry conditions in three decades. Now in 2023, we delivered $3.8 billion in adjusted revenue, and I'm proud to share that we grew market share in both purchase and refinance annually. Purchase market share grew by 14%, and refinance market share grew by 10% from 2022 to 2023. It's worth emphasizing that we delivered positive adjusted EBITDA for the year which is largely a function of two factors: one, a strong top line; and two, our commitment to operational efficiency. And as you'll hear Brian discuss in more detail shortly, we made significant reductions to our cost base over the past two years, and we took difficult yet necessary actions to rightsize the company. This has helped us prioritize and focus on what we do best and what matters most. Now, as we look back at our 2023 results, there are a lot of great accomplishments to be proud of, but we are even more excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. We repositioned our organization in 2023, and we entered 2024 reinvigorated with momentum, clarity and a lean competitive edge. We are poised to deliver revenue growth, market share growth and further operational efficiency. Now I'd like to take a moment to recap what the leadership team and I have been focused on recently. And how it will position us for success in the future. Now, embracing transformation is an essential part of any big journey. A few months ago, I collaborated closely with our leadership team to write the next chapter of Rocket story together. We look inward. We spent thousands of hours engaging in a rigorous process of research, interviews, analysis, introspection and debate.  We dug deep to review the state of our business, our competitive strengths, and we identified our gaps as well as our opportunities. The outcome of this effort was a clear strategy to enable AI-fueled homeownership and a comprehensive blueprint that brings clarity and focus to our entire organization. By leveraging AI, we will transform an industry that is ripe for innovation, establishing Rocket as the premier choice for clients and partners, including local real estate agents, mortgage brokers and financial institutions. With a clear north star, we bend to bold steps to simplify our organizational structure, and we aligned our resources to our strategic priorities. We recently reviewed our full list of priorities and significantly narrowed the focus, reducing it by more than 80%. This allowed us to reallocate resources to areas where we wanted to double down while simultaneously streamlining our operational execution. Our goal is to focus intently on the things that matter the most to our clients and to do them better and faster than anyone else. I am personally committed to maintaining transparency regarding our progress, the cornerstone of which is providing visibility into how we are tracking against our goals and delivering on our commitments, which is what we internally refer to as having a high say-do ratio.  We have incredible talent here at Rocket, and we will continue to build a team that drives our success. We've realigned our organization with key leaders stepping into expanded roles. We also welcomed new talent to propel us forward. In January, Alex Rampell joined our Board. Alex is a Partner at Andreessen Horowitz and is one of the world's leading experts in AI and fintech. In addition, Jonathan Mildenhall, the former CMO at Airbnb, who Forbes is listed as 1 of the 10 most influential CMOs in the world recently joined our leadership team as the first ever Chief Marketing Officer for Rocket Companies. We're investing in world-class talent here at Rocket, and we're playing to win. Now our entire company is united behind a common vision and strategy, and we are executing at full speed. Earlier this month at Little Caesars Arena, right here in Detroit, we held our first all-company meeting since our IPO. More than 14,000 team members attended in the energy and the level of engagement were simply off the charts. The main focus of our all-company meeting was heavily geared towards artificial intelligence and the opportunity it presents for Rocket. With AI, we are rewriting the rules of the game and structurally and fundamentally changing how this industry operates.  Our mortgage origination has long been associated with inefficient up and down hiring cycles. Because of that, scale profitability has been notoriously difficult to achieve in the mortgage industry because that volatility and cyclicality have made it challenging to adequately plan ahead and invest for the future. The industry has traditionally staffed up rapidly to handle higher volume in upmarkets, only to reduce staff and respond to down markets. So those who don't manage capacity or liquidity effectively may be acquired or exit the industry altogether. And in 2023 alone, we saw this. We saw the industry with 62 M&A transactions, exits and bankruptcies, and recent data shows that capacity is down nearly 35% from the peak. We believe AI will shape the future of the home buying industry and Rocket leading the way. Technology is the answer to better client experiences and capacity management in our industry. We aim to redefine the home buying experience through AI and deliver market share growth, scaled revenue growth and profitability. I will share with you that automation and AI are being aggressively deployed across Rocket, helping us to deliver better client experiences at scale across the entire home-buying process. Now I'm going to share three examples of how AI is driving impact today across mortgage banking, underwriting and servicing. Purchasing a home can be an overwhelming process, which is why at Rocket, we excel in blending personalized service with cutting-edge technology. Now AI lets computers do what they do best, while allowing our team members to focus on what they do best, fostering relationships and connecting with our clients. So if you take, for example, our mortgage bankers, these team members play a crucial role because they guide clients through the entire mortgage journey. In Q4, we piloted an AI virtual assistant with 325 mortgage bankers or outbound client calls. Now previously, these bankers juggled notetaking, selling out applications, remembering regulatory requirements, all the while talking to our clients. What the AI assistant does is it seamlessly and accurately automatically transcribes, summarizes and populate hundreds of crucial application fields, hands-free in real time. So our bankers are more productive than they've ever been and they can now focus on what they do best with AI handling the rest. Now the initial response from this pilot has been overwhelmingly positive, and we're already seeing signs of dramatically faster turn times. We're excited to roll this technology out to our broader banking force to deliver a better client experience through the millions of calls that we make in a given year. Now switching gears in underwriting. Automation and AI are helping to deliver higher accuracy and operational efficiency at scale. An underwriting decision typically requires the gathering and verification of thousands of data fields, which are drawn from disparate resources and formats to populate key categories of income, assets, collateral, property and the credit profile.  Now, income verification is one of the critical inputs to an underwriting decision and also a very complex process that takes regulatory requirement, documentation accuracy, employment types and unstandardized data format into consideration. So in December, nearly two thirds of income verification were automated without an underwriter needing to intervene. This provided a fivefold improvement compared to just 15 months prior here at Rocket. So thus far, our automated income verification has posted zero audit findings which is also highly impactful as income verification issues are amongst the top reasons behind GSE repurchase request. I'm also excited to share that we've recently rolled out this great income verification technology to our mortgage broker partners, further enriching the offerings we provide to help them thrive. Now imagine applying these advances in automation at scale across all underwriting categories as we continue to take market share and grow.  Now in 2021, a record year for mortgage origination, when we processed 4 times the number of applications that we did in 2023, we demonstrated that our technology could scale up even when the industry was constrained by capacity. Today, we're in an even better position to drive operating leverage through automation and AI. We've made significant advances in automating income verification and then we're tackling asset verification next. Now, AI is also enhancing our client interactions at scale across devices, whether our clients are reaching us by phone, by computer or by mobile app. So take servicing, for example, in 2023, we facilitated 3.1 million client interactions with payment and escrow questions topping the list. Our servicing calls and chats are increasingly powered by AI, providing clients with smart, conversational self-service experiences 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Approximately 70% of our servicing calls and chats are fully self-serve without the need of team member assistance with interactions only escalating to team members where the human touch is required.  We've seen a continued trend of lower call volume in servicing as our AI-powered digital experiences become the preferred choice for our clients. And we're not just handling interactions, we're actually turning them into actionable insights. With AI's assistance, we're transcribing and tagging these servicing interactions, organizing this invaluable data to construct unified client profile in a centralized repository. From this repository, we train models to gain deeper insights and analytics. Our next objective is to expand this initiative to other areas of the business which ensures that AI continues to drive enhanced client experiences and operational efficiency across the board. With these examples, the consistent themes I hope to convey are, first, to harness the power of our data and artificial intelligence; second, to simplify and automate; and to third, unlock team member productivity and deliver better client experiences through speed, certainty and value.  The efficiency gains when deployed at full scale will be an absolute game changer for our organization as we will be able to serve many more clients without adding to our fixed cost structure. So really just scratching the surface here. There's so much more impact that generative AI can bring, and we're incredibly well positioned to capitalize on the opportunity and lead the industry. I am so honored to be a part of this next chapter in Rocket story. Looking ahead to the coming year, I'm confident in our team, our capabilities and our mindset. We look forward to sharing our progress with you on future earnings calls and during our first Investor Day later this year when our senior leaders will present on how we're executing our strategic priorities to enable AI-fueled homeownership.  And with that, I will turn it over to Brian. Okay. Can you guys hear me okay? Okay. Sorry about that, Kevin. Let me just repeat. Thank you for your question. We ended 2023 strong. We're entering '24 with momentum, and that's reflected in both our results and our guide. And we look at many factors when we think about the outlook for the year. We look at the forecast. We look at the CPI, we look at the 10-year treasury, we look at the Fed forward curve.  We look at our own data and most of the industry, we predict a 33% larger market, $2 trillion versus $1.5 trillion. We expect rates to drop in the second half of the year. And these are all tailwinds for Rocket. And so we're investing in growth, and we're playing to win. At the same time, when you think about the market share itself, the second part of your question, there are still multiple tailwinds as well. You have a lot of market consolidation with M&As and exits and bankruptcies. You have banks that are seeing market share and leaning back. You have Basel III, which is on the horizon. You also have industry capacity coming out.  So when you put all these things together, I mean, we do expect to accelerate growth. It's a bit of a survival of the fittest dynamic with winners taking most. We grew share double digits in both purchase and refi, and we feel very good about our position in terms of our assets and our endurance. So we're confident on building on those gains. Yeah, absolutely. Look, I'd start by just saying that we believe that AI is going to be absolutely transformative to this industry and to fintech and tech in general. And we've made quite a bit of progress, but we're just still scratching the surface. And we're in the earliest of innings, but our progress is only going to accelerate with generative AI. It's a major area of investment across the board. The biggest thing that I would say is AI is something that you have to have a right to win and the right to win means you have to have the assets, you have to have capabilities, you have to have data. You have to have these ingredients to create the right recipe. So because of those ingredients that we have at scale, it's why we expect to be a benefactor.  And I shared a couple of examples earlier on this call, three in particular, but you're going to expect -- you can expect to see us continue to show you more and more and more examples of how we're going to be differentiated, whether it's the 50 million call logs that we process every year, the thousands of attributes that we have on clients, how we use chat, how we use transcription, the 3.1 million clients that we engage with in servicing, document automation, appraisal review, hiring. So kind of across the board, we think we have a durable advantage because we have many of the ingredients that it takes to build one of the AI companies of the future. And so those are just some examples, and you can expect to see many more as we continue to make progress on this journey but it is a major strategic imperative, and we're investing across the board. Yeah. Thank you for sharing. I mean look, I think fundamentally, the simple answer is we expect this to be a transformative implication across the board, whether it's helping us be more efficient and productive, driving top line growth as well as bottom line growth. But it's a very natural technology to fit with every aspect of the home ownership journey, everything from home search to lead generation to underwriting, to servicing, appraisals. And so the great thing about this is we feel like the sky is the limit. And so we have made it a strategic imperative to apply this at the top level at every aspect of the company.  And so you can expect to see those gains be transformatively impacting every aspect of how we do business. Yeah. I'll start and maybe ask Brian to chime in as well. I think the biggest thing I would share is that our primary focus is growth. And the reason for that is you have a $5 trillion home buying TAM. You have an incredibly fragmented market. You have no player with more than double-digit market share, and that's a great place for us to be disruptive and drive growth, especially with AI. So we're always looking for efficiency.  We think we're in a good place. We're actually well capitalized, as Brian shared, but we're trying to invest our dollars in innovation, and we're trying to figure out ways that we can actually attrite significantly more with the ingredients that we have. So part of that is where you see our increase in focus and prioritization. But we have a lot of share to take, and we want to invest our resources to win. And let me ask Brian if there's anything he would add. Yeah. Thank you for the question, Kyle. I want to -- I'll just start with Rocket Money. And Rocket Money, obviously, is a part of our Personal Finance division, and the team has done a fantastic job. I believe they've grown almost twice the volume since the acquisition. This is an area on a personal note that I'm very passionate about, given my background. The business has over 5 million members. They've saved our clients over $1 billion in savings. And quite frankly, it's the best personal finance app there is.  We've seen impressive top line growth. I believe in December, they were the number one app in the App Store in the finance category, and they're on track, as Brian said, for the best quarter ever. And as we think about AI, the thing I would say before handing it over to Brian is this is really about supercharging everything we do around homeownership. It's about making sure that our team members can be orders of magnitude, more productive which is what we need when we're trying to go after a massive market and go after share. And so this is really about allowing us to do more with the same and to allow us to basically take share and grow in a market that's incredibly fragmented and there are multiple places in which we're investing in AI across the board at every level of the organization.  And so a huge strategic imperative for us. And I'll ask Brian to comment on some of the more specifics. Yeah. Thank you for the question, Ryan. I'll start by just saying that it's critical. And one of the reasons we have this amazing aspect of our company structure and organization is that home search is the first part of the journey. And it's no secret that hundreds of millions of consumers use home search apps multiple times daily because it's the starting point of the journey. And so that part of the experience is critical to drive a disruptive experience in purchase, which is why this is such an important part of our strategy.  And I'm very proud of the Rocket Homes team because they continue to innovate past the bleeding edge. Two examples I will give you is the recent release that they launched with CarPlay, which allows you to have a local driving experience as you're driving around looking for homes. It's a very natural experience that is cultivated around home search. It's a way to build intent. It's the way to use location services, AI and data to really create a personalized experience that meets clients where they are. The second thing I would share is the team isn't stopping there. We just talked about a beta that we released with the new Apple Vision Pro that changes the game when it comes to things like spatial computing and being able to tour homes, publish listings and really using the next generation of virtual and augmented reality. And so home search is a big, big part of our strategy because it's kind of the beginning point of the journey of the purchase experience and if we can build intent with clients and we can build readiness with a combination of assets like Rocket Homes, Rocket Money, leveraging technology, we can bring them into the home purchase journey in a way that's more personalized, that's more streamlined and ultimately drives speed, certainty and value.  So it's a big part of our strategy. It's a big part of the top of the funnel and the team has done a good job, and we're continuing to invest. Yeah. I mean I would start by just saying that the best is yet to come. We've hired a pretty kickass new CMO, and we have big, big plans for our brand. The great thing about Rocket is it already is a household brand but we're scratching the surface on what's possible. And so we're continuing to invest. I think we have big plans for the near future and buckle up and stay tuned is what I would say. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining our call, and we look forward to seeing you next quarter and just a special invite to come to our Investor Day. Stay tuned for details."

Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there\u2019ll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Sharon Ng, Head of Investor Relations. Sharon, please go ahead.\nSharon Ng: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Rocket Companies earnings call covering the third quarter of 2023.

Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP metrics for reported results can be found in our earnings release issued earlier today as well as in our filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll turn things over to Varun Krishna to get us started. Varun?\nVarun Krishna: Thanks, Sharon. Good afternoon, and welcome, everybody, to the Rocket Companies earnings call for the third quarter of 2023. It is such an honor to be here with you today, and I'd like to begin by sharing why I chose to join this great company. Rocket is a business I've admired from afar for a long time. And in my view, it's among those on a short list of companies that are working on a truly worthy problem to solve. We are at the heart of helping Americans achieve the dream of home ownership and financial freedom. Now according to a bank rate report, 74% of consumers surveyed ranked homeownership as the number one aspect of their American dream, surpassing aspirations such as retirement or a successful career. Homeownership represents stability in financial security and it often serves as the single best way for people from all walks of life to create intergenerational wealth for their family. Now I was also drawn to the huge market potential. The more than $5 trillion home buying total addressable market is massive. Maybe take just one part of it, the mortgage market, which itself is sizable at roughly $2 trillion and yet independent of rates and inventory remains highly fragmented. According to Inside Mortgage Finance, through the first nine months of this year, the top 10 mortgage lenders comprised just 38% of the total origination market share. Home buying represents, in some ways, the last frontier. It's a category that is often associated with antiquated, manual processes that remain highly complex, inefficient and time-consuming. Across the industry, the average time to originate a mortgage is more than 40 days from application to close. For documentation alone, our proprietary platform, which is responsible for extraction, classification and application process 39 million documents over the last 12 months alone. Now, the benefits of digitizing documents and automating discrete tasks at such enormous scale have profound benefits for our business from enhancing productivity, to faster turn times, the higher decisioning accuracy. If you take just underwriting as an example, an underwriting decision requires the gathering and verification of thousands of data fields, which are drawn from disparate sources and formats to populate key categories like income, assets, collateral and property and credit profile. Now, we've already made significant headway to simplify and digitize the loan origination process. And with our early application of generative AI, we know that our progress will only accelerate based on what we have witnessed firsthand. Now, just imagine what can be done when we apply this transformative technology across our business and throughout the entire home-buying process. Now since starting this role, I had completely immersed myself in the business. I spent countless hours going deep in conversation with our team members with the goal of better understanding our company's culture, our products, and the components of our client experience and where our frontline team members really see the opportunity. Now, on my first day, I invited our team members to share their perspectives and questions with me and they responded enthusiastically. I've had the chance to read and respond to hundreds of pieces of feedback and the passion and dedication of our team members has absolutely blown me away. I've also had a chance to experience our culture of innovation and putting our clients first. We have a rich history of winning awards, but we never rest on our laurels. We believe excellence can always be improved upon and are obsessed with finding a better way. Every day, we live the mindset of every client, every time, no exceptions and no excuses. This relentless client focus enables us to thrive through the inevitable ups and downs of mortgage cycles. Now, another observation for my first couple of months is just how well positioned we are to lead the transformation of the industry through generative AI. I believe we are now approaching a critical inflection point in the world when artificial intelligence, knowledge engineering, machine learning, automation, and personalization will change every aspect of our industry and our lives. I believe AI will be at the center of how clients buy, sell and finance homes. We will quickly and efficiently provide the best end-to-end experience across the home buying industry. Now at Rocket, this effort is actually already well underway. Today, thousands of our bankers and underwriters utilize Rocket Logic, which is our proprietary AI-powered next-generation loan origination system. Now, Rocket Logic intelligently generates tasks to seamlessly complete the mortgage origination process, from application all the way through underwrite. This, along with other tools that Rocket has automated routine and complex tasks, enhance productivity and ultimately drive a superior client experience. In August of this year, we delivered 20% faster purchase turn times, and we reduced manual touches by more than 20% compared to the same time last year. We have a strong foundation in place and a wealth of assets at our fingertips to leverage generative AI. We have data in sales that most fintech companies would be envious of, and we believe no one in the mortgage industry even comes close. For example, we have 10 petabytes of data in our environment, and we have thousands of attributes in our clients that give us an accurate profile of who they are today and how we might help them achieve their dreams of tomorrow. We generate over 50 million call logs annually, which we use to develop technology and processes to continuously improve upon our client experience. And we've already begun expanding our AI capabilities. In a single year, we used AI to generate approximately 3.7 billion customer interactions and decisions. This is just the start.  While Rocket is the established industry leader and a technology Trailblazer, there's still so much opportunity to unlock across our business. From lead generation, allocation to underwriting, closing, servicing, we will harness the power of generative AI and revolutionize the home buying and financing process to help everyone experience home. My career has been shaped by world-class mentors and disruptive technology companies. I've seen firsthand the power of innovation in AI to transform industries and capture massive opportunities with products that are used by millions of clients. As I look around Rocket, I see a company with the talent, the culture and the assets to drive meaningful disruption and transformation. I am beyond excited for the tremendous opportunities that lie ahead of us. Before turning it over to Brian, I'd like to say a few things on our third quarter results. First, I'm extremely proud of our team members for the work they've done and the commitment they've shown in the midst of what is obviously a challenging market environment. We grew purchase market share and reported strong results for the quarter with adjusted revenue north of $1 billion, which is above the top end of our guidance range, reflective of continued momentum over the past four quarters. This was a result of strong execution and continued expansion in gain on sale margin. In the third quarter, we turned a corner and achieved positive adjusted net income. And for the second quarter, we achieved positive adjusted EBITDA and GAAP net income. We feel good about these results, but we're even more excited about disrupting the industry as we work to write the next chapter of this great company's story. I look forward to updating you on our progress on our next call. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\nBrian Brown: Thank you, Varun, and good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, I'll cover our third quarter operating highlights and financial results as well as our fourth quarter outlook. As Varun mentioned, we are focused on serving our clients through innovation and leveraging our robust data assets in the power of generative AI to deliver seamless personalized experiences. We posted strong results for the quarter, and I'm proud of how well our team members executed to serve our clients in this tough market. For many in this environment, homeownership might feel like it's becoming less and less achievable. Affordability, which hit the historic low in Q3 is a major concern for those looking to buy a home and inventory levels are not cooperating, which is extending the time to buy. At Rocket, we want to give our clients the confidence they need to transact and help them achieve their dream of homeownership. Our innovative products such as BUY+ One+, which address home affordability and our home equity loan, which helps clients take advantage of equity in their home, continue to resonate. BUY+, our Rocket exclusive collaboration between Rocket Mortgage and Rocket Homes helps clients save thousands of dollars in upfront costs when they work with the Rocket Homes' partner real estate agent and obtained financing with Rocket Mortgage. This product is a great example of the power of the Rocket ecosystem. Since we launched BUY+, we've seen our acumen rate defined as clients who use both Rocket Mortgage and Rocket Homes roughly double. It's worth noting that this combination is something that only Rocket can offer at scale through our integrated real estate and mortgage experience. One+, our 1% down program increases access to homeownership for low to-moderate income Americans and further broadens our purchase portfolio. One+ has gained significant traction since its launch in May, with closing volume more than tripling from June to September. In a challenging rate environment, our home equity loan product provides a solution for those who may want to tap into their home's equity without impacting the lower rate on their first lien mortgage. In addition, we may have the opportunity to consolidate the clients first and second lien if rates were to move lower. This product has performed well for us and continues to resonate with homeowners. Home equity volume has more than doubled in Q3 compared to the beginning of this year. As you heard from Varun, we reported strong third quarter results, and I'm pleased to share with you three important milestones. First, we achieved year-over-year growth in adjusted revenue and exceeded the high end of our guidance range. Secondly, we delivered profitability across adjusted EBITDA, GAAP net income and adjusted net income. Finally, we continued to gain purchase market share both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. We've accomplished all of this against the backdrop of a challenging macroeconomic environment. Diving deeper into the numbers, we generated adjusted revenue north of $1 billion in the third quarter, above the high end of our guidance range. Our performance in the quarter was driven by market share gains as well as increases in both direct-to-consumer and partner network gain on sale margins. Net rate lock volume for the quarter was $21 billion, roughly consistent with the $22 billion in the second quarter. Gain on sale margin for the third quarter came in at 276 basis points which was a 9 basis point increase over the second quarter. Turning to expenses. In the third quarter, we continued to execute on our company-wide focus on operational efficiencies. Q3 expenses were roughly $60 million lower than the prior quarter, excluding the $51 million onetime charge. On our last earnings call, we committed to an additional cost savings on an annualized basis in the range of $150 million to $200 million. I'm pleased to share that we expect to come in at the top end of that range with approximately $200 million of annualized savings. This achievement is a result of a concerted effort that has spanned the winding down of underperforming businesses to a rigorous reprioritization of company initiatives to the implementation of a career transition program. These savings are expected to fully take effect in the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, we generated $73 million of adjusted EBITDA, Thanks in large part to the continued cost reductions we've implemented over the last 18 months, coupled with the outperformance in adjusted revenue. We reported adjusted net income of $7 million, positive adjusted diluted EPS and $0.04 of GAAP diluted EPS. Turning to our balance sheet. Rocket's financial position continues to be a strategic strength. We consider this to be a major competitive advantage in today's market as it provides us with flexibility and optionality that most of our competitors simply do not have. We ended the third quarter with $3.8 billion of available cash and $6.7 billion of mortgage servicing rights. Together, these assets represent a total of approximately $10.4 billion of value on our balance sheet. Our $3.8 billion of available cash consists of $957 million of cash on the balance sheet and an additional $2.8 billion of corporate cash used to self-fund loan originations. Total liquidity stood at approximately $8.7 billion as of September 30, including available cash plus undrawn line of credit and our undrawn MSR lines. As of September 30, our mortgage servicing portfolio included more than 2.4 million loan serviced with approximately $506 billion in unpaid principal balance. In the third quarter, we acquired $103 million in mortgage servicing rights, adding $6.2 billion of unpaid principal balance to our servicing portfolio. Our net client retention rate in the third quarter was 97%, which is multiples higher than the industry average. Retention rate serves as a key metric engaging client satisfaction, and is one of the primary indicators of client lifetime value. We also drive considerable recurring revenue from mortgage servicing. During the third quarter, we generated $344 million of cash revenue from our servicing book, which represents approximately $1.4 billion on an annualized basis. Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect industry conditions to remain challenging through the balance of the year. We anticipate adjusted revenue to be in the range of $650 million to $800 million. The guidance takes into consideration difficult market conditions marked by record low affordability and inventory levels, further magnifying the traditional low seasonality in the fourth quarter. The industry typically sees decreased purchase activity and volume in the fourth quarter due to the winter months and fewer working days due to the holiday season. The lower volume also puts pressure on gain on sale margins in the fourth quarter. Excluding the $51 million onetime charge in the third quarter, we expect fourth quarter expenses to be roughly $50 million to $100 million lower than Q3 expenses. As always, our forward-looking guidance is based on our current outlook and visibility. Looking ahead, we believe our culture of client obsession, wealth of assets and use of generative AI will help us make significant strides in operational efficiency and innovation. As Varun highlighted, we see tremendous opportunity ahead to disrupt the industry and completely reimagine the home buying experience. I look forward to sharing more in the coming quarters we're just getting started. With that, we're ready to turn it back over to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Sandler. Kevin, please go ahead.\nKevin Barker: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to maybe touch base here with Varun and maybe get his first impressions of the company given that he's been there for -- I know you've been there for a few weeks and got to meet several of the folks in different departments. Maybe just give us a view of what you've seen and what the opportunities you see within Rocket today?\nVarun Krishna: Kevin, thank you for your question. Great to have you here. An amazing first couple of weeks here, I had the chance to really go deep into our business and immerse myself. I have read and responded to hundreds of team members. And I spent countless hours just going deep into the business, into the product, talking to our clients and just understanding every aspect of all that is that we do. I can just tell you that I'm very impressed with the leadership, our team members, our culture, and it's early days. I think there are some opportunities as well, how we can increase our focus, our prioritization. How big we can bet big on technology as a key part of our future strategy. And we're in the midst of writing that next chapter with the leadership team. So I look forward to sharing more with you but it's been super exciting, and we're just getting started.\nKevin Barker: And then maybe a follow-up regarding the servicing transaction maybe for Brian. Could you just give us a little more detail on what the gross yield was on the MSR portfolio you purchased, maybe what the weighted average coupon was? I believe that you mentioned it was higher coupon than your existing portfolio now, which makes it opportunistic for refis? Thanks.\nBrian Brown: Yes. Thanks, Kevin. Happy to take that question. I mean, first, just to take a step back, servicing continues to be a strategic asset for us. It's a nice hedge, of course, to the origination business, and we definitely like the returns on the cash flows right now. It's proving to have a very valuable ROIs. But as you know, and we've talked about before, we really look at it through this LTV lens. And the LTV is really based on these industry-leading recapture. So if you think about what we're trying to accomplish, we're trying to acquire portfolios. We're trying to acquire clients that have a high LTV that we believe we have an opportunity to recapture. We've mentioned that we've sold some servicing that we believe the LTV is low on. This is an example of buying some servicing that has a higher LTV. To answer your question on the note rate, it was north of 6%. But we're creating servicing every single day through our organic originations, and those are at prevailing rates, higher note rates. We're also looking to acquire servicing at higher note rates and slowly, but surely, you end up taking up that average note rate and then if rates -- if and when rates do decrease, you have a really nice refinance opportunity.\nKevin Barker: Just a quick follow-up on that. Just given your 97% client retention rate and a market that -- it seems like it's a buyer's market out there for MSRs. Why not become much more aggressive in buying higher coupon MSRs in order to increase the pool of available refis for you?\nBrian Brown: Yes. That's exactly what we're trying to accomplish. We are -- as we've said, we're very active in this space. We get a lot of looks. This is a good example of a competitive process that we won. It's something -- it's an asset that we're looking to grow. There's no question about it because of what you said the lifetime value on those is really good.\nKevin Barker: Thank you, Brian. Thank you, Varun.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you. And it looks like our next question will come from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan, go ahead.\nRyan Nash: Hey good evening everyone. Varun, the term AI was thrown around about several times in the prepared remarks, you both yourself and Brian talking about it. Maybe just digging a little bit deeper in terms of what you see as the biggest opportunities for the company to use generative AI? And what do you think this can mean for the overall efficiency of the origination process and the company overall?\nVarun Krishna: Yes. Thank you for the question, Ryan. Great to have you. I would just start by saying that I think that fintech in general, and in particular, the homeownership market is very ripe for disruption with artificial intelligence. And there are a couple of things that make Rocket in particular, unique. It's -- whether it's the vast amount of data that we have for personalization, the 50 million call logs, the thousands of attributes of data that we have on our clients. And I think what's compelling is that we have an opportunity to really transform every aspect of the home buying process, whether it's lead generation, allocation, underwriting, closing, servicing. And I think really, almost every aspect of the home buying experience can, should and will be transformed with AI. We have made some progress in this space, and I'm really excited about the foundation, but I think we're just scratching the surface. We've made some investments here in capabilities like Rocket Logic and our data platform. When you think about the role of knowledge engineering, machine learning, natural language processing, automation workflow this is a perfect fit problem for Artificial Intelligence to solve. And so I'm really excited about the foundation, but we're just scratching the surface.\nRyan Nash: Got it. No, that's helpful. And then, Brian, maybe a question for you, so we had three straight quarters of both top and adjusted EBITDA improvement, it seems like in the fourth quarter, you're going to take a little bit of a step back, at least, on the top line, but some of that will come back via the $50 million to $100 million of cost cuts. Can you maybe just give us a little bit more color on how much of the volume impact is seasonal declines? How much should we expect to see? And can you maybe just expand on the comments around increased margin pressure in the fourth quarter. Is that just because of greater competition for lower overall volumes? Or is there something else that you're seeing there? Thanks.\nBrian Brown: Yeah. Thanks, Ryan. So when I think about the fourth quarter guide, I don't think it should come as a surprise. To your point, the fourth quarter is typically a seasonally low quarter. As we think about the home buying season, it cools off. You have the additional holidays around Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's. And consumers are -- they're relatively inactive during those times. And because the volumes are challenged, you definitely get pressure on gain on sale margins. Firms will use price as a lever. And everything that I just described is just describing a normal fourth quarter in a normal mortgage market, and this market is, of course, more challenged. So you have those same challenges, coupled with the lowest inventory on record in September, at least according to NAR. You have affordability challenges that we haven't seen since the early '90s. So all that goes into the guide. There's no question. But just I think a couple of important takeaways. We believe even at this revenue guide level, we're taking share in the fourth quarter. And it's still a guide up from the fourth quarter of last year. So it's still top line improvement year-over-year.\nRyan Nash: Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Thank you. And it looks like our next question comes from the line of Derek Sommers with Jefferies. Derek, go ahead.\nDerek Sommers: Hi. Good afternoon. Could you share details about your outlook for 2024 originations? The MBA has projected a market close to $2 trillion, which would be about 19% year-on-year growth. But current market run rate is about 1.7%. So, any details on how you're thinking about volumes and mortgage rates for 2024 would be helpful. And then also kind of at what mortgage rate, we would start to see a meaningful up-tick in refinance volume.\nVarun Krishna: Yeah. Thank you for the question, Derek. Great to have you, I would just start by saying that from a Rocket perspective, I like our position. The market is going to be the market, meaning that rates will go up and down, inventory will go up and down, and there's sort of a cyclical nature to the business, but we believe our strategy is incredibly durable, meaning that there's a huge fragmented market, and we are very underpenetrated. And what is a headwind for the industry, we believe, is a tailwind for Rocket in particular. It is a dynamic where it may be tougher for small players to compete, but we are incredibly well capitalized. We have liquidity. And we have a huge opportunity to accelerate growth and take share, especially when you think about the opportunity to create a more disruptive experience, leveraging technology. So, I'll ask Brian, if there's anything that he would add to that, but we're very excited about our position, given the size of the market, the level of under-penetration sort of independent of rates and inventory.\nBrian Brown: Yeah. Thanks, Varun. I think that was well. So the only other thing I'd add, Derek, when you think about where 2023 this year will end up. I know I think you said $1.7 million. I think it's less than that. We've looked at more recent forecast from banks, and we're probably more at like $1.3 million, $1.4 million. So then take your point about the MBA, who was the most recent to reforecast 2024 at $2 trillion, that's north of a 50% increase. A $2 trillion market coming off this market could actually be very healthy and very productive. That said, that's not necessarily what we're planning for. We're hoping that's true, but we're planning for a market that is more challenged. And to exactly back to Varun's point with our balance sheet, our liquidity and our capital profile, you could look at rates higher for longer scenario is a tailwind for ROCCAT as more capacity keeps coming out of the industry.\nDerek Sommers: Got it. Helpful color there and one more, quick one, is the quarter-over-quarter increase in other income, primarily driven by escrow income? Or is there anything else to be aware of in that number?\nBrian Brown: Yeah. You nailed it. A lot of it is coming from just increased escrow earnings as rates continue to increase.\nDerek Sommers: Got it. Thank you. That's all for me.\nBrian Brown: Thanks Derek.\nOperator: And our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. James, go ahead.\nJeff Adelson: This is Jeff Adelson on for James. Good afternoon. I guess just last quarter, Brian, you talked about the pre-approval rates increasing, I think, higher than seasonality at 20%, which was a good sign for this quarter. Is there anything you're seeing today on that front that might help you inform you about the next quarter into next year?\nBrian Brown: Yeah. Thanks for the question. I mean I think you -- what you're alluding to is the beat this quarter, maybe at the top end of our guidance that largely came from share gains. It definitely came from share gains and then a little bit of help from gain on sale margins from good pre-approval numbers. We're seeing that trend continue through the third quarter. But of course, we are starting to see the seasonality of the fourth quarter take place. But again, I think it's important to just come back to something we said earlier. When we look at this fourth quarter guide, we still believe this guide is taking share in the fourth quarter. We know people are going to buy and films we're still seeing very high demand for homes and consumers interested in buying homes, we just need cooperation from inventory to get them in homes.\nJeff Adelson: Got it. That's helpful. And just given the difficult environment out there, the rate environment has turned more unfavorable in recent months, would you anticipate doing more expense reductions next year if things kind of stay where they are? Or do you feel comfortable with what you've done so far? And as part of that, if we do stay in this kind of higher for longer environment, I know you talked about some more excess capacity coming out of the system, but what do you think it would take for you to get to more consistent profitability? Or what are you looking to reach that if the environment doesn't turn?\nVarun Krishna: Thank you for the question. I'll start and then maybe, Brian, you can add any perspective. I'd just start by saying that our primary focus is on growth. You have a $5 trillion home buying TAM. You have a fragmented market. The mortgage market is $1.5 to $2 trillion. And we have this crazy opportunity to be very disruptive with AI. Now we're always looking for efficiency. We think we're in a good place. But as Brian shared earlier, I mean we're well capitalized. And our perspective is we're in a position to actually invest. And we're looking for ways to increase our focus, our prioritization, but we are being very opportunistic given where we are in the market.\nBrian Brown: Yes, that's right. And the only other thing I'd add, just going back to those prepared remarks, we're happy to report. We talked about expense reduction plan of $150 million to $200 million. We're pleased to report we're at the high end of that. And we pursuit of operational efficiency that Varun has alluded to, and that's not something you start and stop. That's something that's built into your DNA.\nJeff Adelson: Great. Thanks for taking my question. \nBrian Brown: Thanks, Jeff\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Arren Cyganovich with Citi. Arren go ahead.\nArren Cyganovich: Thanks. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your progress making pickup in market share on the purchase side and whether or not the BUY+ program that you've put in place earlier this year is making a notable difference.\nVarun Krishna: Thank you for the question, Arren. I'll start and then Brian can add any perspective. Just start by saying that our purchase products just continue to be relevant and resonate with our clients. A few examples. We have our BUY+ program. And since the launch, we've seen the attachment rate double our One+ program, which is a 1% down program. We've seen the units triple between June and September. We also have our home equity loan program, and we've seen loan units and net rate lock volume double just in the Q3 alone. And so I think the goal for us is to ensure that the programs that we're putting out are innovative. And more importantly, that they're relevant and that they resonate with the clients. And so we're excited to see that progress, and we're also excited to continue to innovate. And Brian, anything that you would add?\nBrian Brown: Yes. I think that's great. I think the only thing I'd add, we've talked about in terms of how we measure share. We, of course, use the industry forecast, but a really good indication is securitization data. When we look at that, and that's, of course, available to everyone, it shows us taking purchase share quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. We also look at a lot of internal data to get more real-time results like Optimal Blue and CoreLogic. But the nice thing is no matter how you do that math, all three of them point in the same direction that we're continuing to take share. And we're seeing capacity continue to come out of the system, so it's no surprise.\nArren Cyganovich: Thanks. On that last point, from a capacity standpoint, I guess where do you think we are in that process? Do you think there's still a lot of capacity that continues to need to come out of the market?\nBrian Brown: Look, I think we talked a bit about what 2024 could look like, at least from how the industry forecasters are looking at it. And if rates are higher for longer, that bodes well for us from capacity continuing to come out I think we'd all like it to come out faster. But if you think about all these mortgage companies that went public and raised capital, at that time and put them in a different position. Time will tell in terms of how that shakes out. Again, we think about us. We think about our balance sheet, our liquidity profile, be able to keep investing through these cycles. That's the stuff that gets us excited.\nArren Cyganovich: Got it. Thank you.\nBrian Brown: Thanks Arren.\nOperator: And our final question today will come from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Don, go ahead.\nDon Fandetti: I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the acquisition strategy. If you see any fintech opportunities to kind of feed the funnel and also just an update on Rocket Money and how you feel like that traction is moving?\nVarun Krishna: Yes. I'll take this one. Thank you, Don, for your question. I think the first thing I would just point to, again, as Brian alluded to, is one of the great things about Rocket is, we have a very robust capitalization structure. We have what we call a fortress balance sheet and high levels of liquidity. And I think that gives us a lot of flexibility and it affords us the chance to be opportunistic, especially in this market where you think like valuations being down. So, what I would share is just we are actively in the process of writing the next chapter of our strategy with our leadership team, and we're going to be pursuing ways to accelerate that strategy, whether it's organic or inorganic. And so I look forward to sharing more as we write that next chapter. And so more to come. We are going to have an Investor Day in the coming quarters. And so we'll have an opportunity to go very deep on our strategy with all of our folks in the investor community. And I'd also just say with Rocket Money, we're pleased with the progress that we're making, and I look forward to sharing more with you in the quarters ahead.\nDon Fandetti: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you, Don. Thanks to all who ask questions today. I will now turn the call back over to Varun Krishna for closing remarks. Varun, over to you.\nVarun Krishna: All right. Thank you, everybody, for joining us today. We appreciate you, and we look forward to connecting again next quarter.\nOperator: Thanks, Varun. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a great day, everyone.",

            "name": "Brian Brown",
            "content": "Thank you, Varun, and good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, I'll cover our third quarter operating highlights and financial results as well as our fourth quarter outlook. As Varun mentioned, we are focused on serving our clients through innovation and leveraging our robust data assets in the power of generative AI to deliver seamless personalized experiences. We posted strong results for the quarter, and I'm proud of how well our team members executed to serve our clients in this tough market. For many in this environment, homeownership might feel like it's becoming less and less achievable. Affordability, which hit the historic low in Q3 is a major concern for those looking to buy a home and inventory levels are not cooperating, which is extending the time to buy. At Rocket, we want to give our clients the confidence they need to transact and help them achieve their dream of homeownership. Our innovative products such as BUY+ One+, which address home affordability and our home equity loan, which helps clients take advantage of equity in their home, continue to resonate. BUY+, our Rocket exclusive collaboration between Rocket Mortgage and Rocket Homes helps clients save thousands of dollars in upfront costs when they work with the Rocket Homes' partner real estate agent and obtained financing with Rocket Mortgage. This product is a great example of the power of the Rocket ecosystem. Since we launched BUY+, we've seen our acumen rate defined as clients who use both Rocket Mortgage and Rocket Homes roughly double. It's worth noting that this combination is something that only Rocket can offer at scale through our integrated real estate and mortgage experience. One+, our 1% down program increases access to homeownership for low to-moderate income Americans and further broadens our purchase portfolio. One+ has gained significant traction since its launch in May, with closing volume more than tripling from June to September. In a challenging rate environment, our home equity loan product provides a solution for those who may want to tap into their home's equity without impacting the lower rate on their first lien mortgage. In addition, we may have the opportunity to consolidate the clients first and second lien if rates were to move lower. This product has performed well for us and continues to resonate with homeowners. Home equity volume has more than doubled in Q3 compared to the beginning of this year. As you heard from Varun, we reported strong third quarter results, and I'm pleased to share with you three important milestones. First, we achieved year-over-year growth in adjusted revenue and exceeded the high end of our guidance range. Secondly, we delivered profitability across adjusted EBITDA, GAAP net income and adjusted net income. Finally, we continued to gain purchase market share both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. We've accomplished all of this against the backdrop of a challenging macroeconomic environment. Diving deeper into the numbers, we generated adjusted revenue north of $1 billion in the third quarter, above the high end of our guidance range. Our performance in the quarter was driven by market share gains as well as increases in both direct-to-consumer and partner network gain on sale margins. Net rate lock volume for the quarter was $21 billion, roughly consistent with the $22 billion in the second quarter. Gain on sale margin for the third quarter came in at 276 basis points which was a 9 basis point increase over the second quarter. Turning to expenses. In the third quarter, we continued to execute on our company-wide focus on operational efficiencies. Q3 expenses were roughly $60 million lower than the prior quarter, excluding the $51 million onetime charge. On our last earnings call, we committed to an additional cost savings on an annualized basis in the range of $150 million to $200 million. I'm pleased to share that we expect to come in at the top end of that range with approximately $200 million of annualized savings. This achievement is a result of a concerted effort that has spanned the winding down of underperforming businesses to a rigorous reprioritization of company initiatives to the implementation of a career transition program. These savings are expected to fully take effect in the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, we generated $73 million of adjusted EBITDA, Thanks in large part to the continued cost reductions we've implemented over the last 18 months, coupled with the outperformance in adjusted revenue. We reported adjusted net income of $7 million, positive adjusted diluted EPS and $0.04 of GAAP diluted EPS. Turning to our balance sheet. Rocket's financial position continues to be a strategic strength. We consider this to be a major competitive advantage in today's market as it provides us with flexibility and optionality that most of our competitors simply do not have. We ended the third quarter with $3.8 billion of available cash and $6.7 billion of mortgage servicing rights. Together, these assets represent a total of approximately $10.4 billion of value on our balance sheet. Our $3.8 billion of available cash consists of $957 million of cash on the balance sheet and an additional $2.8 billion of corporate cash used to self-fund loan originations. Total liquidity stood at approximately $8.7 billion as of September 30, including available cash plus undrawn line of credit and our undrawn MSR lines. As of September 30, our mortgage servicing portfolio included more than 2.4 million loan serviced with approximately $506 billion in unpaid principal balance. In the third quarter, we acquired $103 million in mortgage servicing rights, adding $6.2 billion of unpaid principal balance to our servicing portfolio. Our net client retention rate in the third quarter was 97%, which is multiples higher than the industry average. Retention rate serves as a key metric engaging client satisfaction, and is one of the primary indicators of client lifetime value. We also drive considerable recurring revenue from mortgage servicing. During the third quarter, we generated $344 million of cash revenue from our servicing book, which represents approximately $1.4 billion on an annualized basis. Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect industry conditions to remain challenging through the balance of the year. We anticipate adjusted revenue to be in the range of $650 million to $800 million. The guidance takes into consideration difficult market conditions marked by record low affordability and inventory levels, further magnifying the traditional low seasonality in the fourth quarter. The industry typically sees decreased purchase activity and volume in the fourth quarter due to the winter months and fewer working days due to the holiday season. The lower volume also puts pressure on gain on sale margins in the fourth quarter. Excluding the $51 million onetime charge in the third quarter, we expect fourth quarter expenses to be roughly $50 million to $100 million lower than Q3 expenses. As always, our forward-looking guidance is based on our current outlook and visibility. Looking ahead, we believe our culture of client obsession, wealth of assets and use of generative AI will help us make significant strides in operational efficiency and innovation. As Varun highlighted, we see tremendous opportunity ahead to disrupt the industry and completely reimagine the home buying experience. I look forward to sharing more in the coming quarters we're just getting started. With that, we're ready to turn it back over to the operator for questions. Yes. Thanks, Kevin. Happy to take that question. I mean, first, just to take a step back, servicing continues to be a strategic asset for us. It's a nice hedge, of course, to the origination business, and we definitely like the returns on the cash flows right now. It's proving to have a very valuable ROIs. But as you know, and we've talked about before, we really look at it through this LTV lens. And the LTV is really based on these industry-leading recapture. So if you think about what we're trying to accomplish, we're trying to acquire portfolios. We're trying to acquire clients that have a high LTV that we believe we have an opportunity to recapture. We've mentioned that we've sold some servicing that we believe the LTV is low on. This is an example of buying some servicing that has a higher LTV. To answer your question on the note rate, it was north of 6%. But we're creating servicing every single day through our organic originations, and those are at prevailing rates, higher note rates. We're also looking to acquire servicing at higher note rates and slowly, but surely, you end up taking up that average note rate and then if rates -- if and when rates do decrease, you have a really nice refinance opportunity. Yes. That's exactly what we're trying to accomplish. We are -- as we've said, we're very active in this space. We get a lot of looks. This is a good example of a competitive process that we won. It's something -- it's an asset that we're looking to grow. There's no question about it because of what you said the lifetime value on those is really good. Yeah. Thanks, Ryan. So when I think about the fourth quarter guide, I don't think it should come as a surprise. To your point, the fourth quarter is typically a seasonally low quarter. As we think about the home buying season, it cools off. You have the additional holidays around Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's. And consumers are -- they're relatively inactive during those times. And because the volumes are challenged, you definitely get pressure on gain on sale margins. Firms will use price as a lever. And everything that I just described is just describing a normal fourth quarter in a normal mortgage market, and this market is, of course, more challenged. So you have those same challenges, coupled with the lowest inventory on record in September, at least according to NAR. You have affordability challenges that we haven't seen since the early '90s. So all that goes into the guide. There's no question. But just I think a couple of important takeaways. We believe even at this revenue guide level, we're taking share in the fourth quarter. And it's still a guide up from the fourth quarter of last year. So it's still top line improvement year-over-year. Yeah. Thanks, Varun. I think that was well. So the only other thing I'd add, Derek, when you think about where 2023 this year will end up. I know I think you said $1.7 million. I think it's less than that. We've looked at more recent forecast from banks, and we're probably more at like $1.3 million, $1.4 million. So then take your point about the MBA, who was the most recent to reforecast 2024 at $2 trillion, that's north of a 50% increase. A $2 trillion market coming off this market could actually be very healthy and very productive. That said, that's not necessarily what we're planning for. We're hoping that's true, but we're planning for a market that is more challenged. And to exactly back to Varun's point with our balance sheet, our liquidity and our capital profile, you could look at rates higher for longer scenario is a tailwind for ROCCAT as more capacity keeps coming out of the industry. Yeah. You nailed it. A lot of it is coming from just increased escrow earnings as rates continue to increase. Thanks Derek. Yeah. Thanks for the question. I mean I think you -- what you're alluding to is the beat this quarter, maybe at the top end of our guidance that largely came from share gains. It definitely came from share gains and then a little bit of help from gain on sale margins from good pre-approval numbers. We're seeing that trend continue through the third quarter. But of course, we are starting to see the seasonality of the fourth quarter take place. But again, I think it's important to just come back to something we said earlier. When we look at this fourth quarter guide, we still believe this guide is taking share in the fourth quarter. We know people are going to buy and films we're still seeing very high demand for homes and consumers interested in buying homes, we just need cooperation from inventory to get them in homes. Yes, that's right. And the only other thing I'd add, just going back to those prepared remarks, we're happy to report. We talked about expense reduction plan of $150 million to $200 million. We're pleased to report we're at the high end of that. And we pursuit of operational efficiency that Varun has alluded to, and that's not something you start and stop. That's something that's built into your DNA. Thanks, Jeff Yes. I think that's great. I think the only thing I'd add, we've talked about in terms of how we measure share. We, of course, use the industry forecast, but a really good indication is securitization data. When we look at that, and that's, of course, available to everyone, it shows us taking purchase share quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. We also look at a lot of internal data to get more real-time results like Optimal Blue and CoreLogic. But the nice thing is no matter how you do that math, all three of them point in the same direction that we're continuing to take share. And we're seeing capacity continue to come out of the system, so it's no surprise. Look, I think we talked a bit about what 2024 could look like, at least from how the industry forecasters are looking at it. And if rates are higher for longer, that bodes well for us from capacity continuing to come out I think we'd all like it to come out faster. But if you think about all these mortgage companies that went public and raised capital, at that time and put them in a different position. Time will tell in terms of how that shakes out. Again, we think about us. We think about our balance sheet, our liquidity profile, be able to keep investing through these cycles. That's the stuff that gets us excited. Thanks Arren."

            "name": "Varun Krishna",
            "content": "Thanks, Sharon. Good afternoon, and welcome, everybody, to the Rocket Companies earnings call for the third quarter of 2023. It is such an honor to be here with you today, and I'd like to begin by sharing why I chose to join this great company. Rocket is a business I've admired from afar for a long time. And in my view, it's among those on a short list of companies that are working on a truly worthy problem to solve. We are at the heart of helping Americans achieve the dream of home ownership and financial freedom. Now according to a bank rate report, 74% of consumers surveyed ranked homeownership as the number one aspect of their American dream, surpassing aspirations such as retirement or a successful career. Homeownership represents stability in financial security and it often serves as the single best way for people from all walks of life to create intergenerational wealth for their family. Now I was also drawn to the huge market potential. The more than $5 trillion home buying total addressable market is massive. Maybe take just one part of it, the mortgage market, which itself is sizable at roughly $2 trillion and yet independent of rates and inventory remains highly fragmented. According to Inside Mortgage Finance, through the first nine months of this year, the top 10 mortgage lenders comprised just 38% of the total origination market share. Home buying represents, in some ways, the last frontier. It's a category that is often associated with antiquated, manual processes that remain highly complex, inefficient and time-consuming. Across the industry, the average time to originate a mortgage is more than 40 days from application to close. For documentation alone, our proprietary platform, which is responsible for extraction, classification and application process 39 million documents over the last 12 months alone. Now, the benefits of digitizing documents and automating discrete tasks at such enormous scale have profound benefits for our business from enhancing productivity, to faster turn times, the higher decisioning accuracy. If you take just underwriting as an example, an underwriting decision requires the gathering and verification of thousands of data fields, which are drawn from disparate sources and formats to populate key categories like income, assets, collateral and property and credit profile. Now, we've already made significant headway to simplify and digitize the loan origination process. And with our early application of generative AI, we know that our progress will only accelerate based on what we have witnessed firsthand. Now, just imagine what can be done when we apply this transformative technology across our business and throughout the entire home-buying process. Now since starting this role, I had completely immersed myself in the business. I spent countless hours going deep in conversation with our team members with the goal of better understanding our company's culture, our products, and the components of our client experience and where our frontline team members really see the opportunity. Now, on my first day, I invited our team members to share their perspectives and questions with me and they responded enthusiastically. I've had the chance to read and respond to hundreds of pieces of feedback and the passion and dedication of our team members has absolutely blown me away. I've also had a chance to experience our culture of innovation and putting our clients first. We have a rich history of winning awards, but we never rest on our laurels. We believe excellence can always be improved upon and are obsessed with finding a better way. Every day, we live the mindset of every client, every time, no exceptions and no excuses. This relentless client focus enables us to thrive through the inevitable ups and downs of mortgage cycles. Now, another observation for my first couple of months is just how well positioned we are to lead the transformation of the industry through generative AI. I believe we are now approaching a critical inflection point in the world when artificial intelligence, knowledge engineering, machine learning, automation, and personalization will change every aspect of our industry and our lives. I believe AI will be at the center of how clients buy, sell and finance homes. We will quickly and efficiently provide the best end-to-end experience across the home buying industry. Now at Rocket, this effort is actually already well underway. Today, thousands of our bankers and underwriters utilize Rocket Logic, which is our proprietary AI-powered next-generation loan origination system. Now, Rocket Logic intelligently generates tasks to seamlessly complete the mortgage origination process, from application all the way through underwrite. This, along with other tools that Rocket has automated routine and complex tasks, enhance productivity and ultimately drive a superior client experience. In August of this year, we delivered 20% faster purchase turn times, and we reduced manual touches by more than 20% compared to the same time last year. We have a strong foundation in place and a wealth of assets at our fingertips to leverage generative AI. We have data in sales that most fintech companies would be envious of, and we believe no one in the mortgage industry even comes close. For example, we have 10 petabytes of data in our environment, and we have thousands of attributes in our clients that give us an accurate profile of who they are today and how we might help them achieve their dreams of tomorrow. We generate over 50 million call logs annually, which we use to develop technology and processes to continuously improve upon our client experience. And we've already begun expanding our AI capabilities. In a single year, we used AI to generate approximately 3.7 billion customer interactions and decisions. This is just the start.  While Rocket is the established industry leader and a technology Trailblazer, there's still so much opportunity to unlock across our business. From lead generation, allocation to underwriting, closing, servicing, we will harness the power of generative AI and revolutionize the home buying and financing process to help everyone experience home. My career has been shaped by world-class mentors and disruptive technology companies. I've seen firsthand the power of innovation in AI to transform industries and capture massive opportunities with products that are used by millions of clients. As I look around Rocket, I see a company with the talent, the culture and the assets to drive meaningful disruption and transformation. I am beyond excited for the tremendous opportunities that lie ahead of us. Before turning it over to Brian, I'd like to say a few things on our third quarter results. First, I'm extremely proud of our team members for the work they've done and the commitment they've shown in the midst of what is obviously a challenging market environment. We grew purchase market share and reported strong results for the quarter with adjusted revenue north of $1 billion, which is above the top end of our guidance range, reflective of continued momentum over the past four quarters. This was a result of strong execution and continued expansion in gain on sale margin. In the third quarter, we turned a corner and achieved positive adjusted net income. And for the second quarter, we achieved positive adjusted EBITDA and GAAP net income. We feel good about these results, but we're even more excited about disrupting the industry as we work to write the next chapter of this great company's story. I look forward to updating you on our progress on our next call. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian. Kevin, thank you for your question. Great to have you here. An amazing first couple of weeks here, I had the chance to really go deep into our business and immerse myself. I have read and responded to hundreds of team members. And I spent countless hours just going deep into the business, into the product, talking to our clients and just understanding every aspect of all that is that we do. I can just tell you that I'm very impressed with the leadership, our team members, our culture, and it's early days. I think there are some opportunities as well, how we can increase our focus, our prioritization. How big we can bet big on technology as a key part of our future strategy. And we're in the midst of writing that next chapter with the leadership team. So I look forward to sharing more with you but it's been super exciting, and we're just getting started. Yes. Thank you for the question, Ryan. Great to have you. I would just start by saying that I think that fintech in general, and in particular, the homeownership market is very ripe for disruption with artificial intelligence. And there are a couple of things that make Rocket in particular, unique. It's -- whether it's the vast amount of data that we have for personalization, the 50 million call logs, the thousands of attributes of data that we have on our clients. And I think what's compelling is that we have an opportunity to really transform every aspect of the home buying process, whether it's lead generation, allocation, underwriting, closing, servicing. And I think really, almost every aspect of the home buying experience can, should and will be transformed with AI. We have made some progress in this space, and I'm really excited about the foundation, but I think we're just scratching the surface. We've made some investments here in capabilities like Rocket Logic and our data platform. When you think about the role of knowledge engineering, machine learning, natural language processing, automation workflow this is a perfect fit problem for Artificial Intelligence to solve. And so I'm really excited about the foundation, but we're just scratching the surface. Yeah. Thank you for the question, Derek. Great to have you, I would just start by saying that from a Rocket perspective, I like our position. The market is going to be the market, meaning that rates will go up and down, inventory will go up and down, and there's sort of a cyclical nature to the business, but we believe our strategy is incredibly durable, meaning that there's a huge fragmented market, and we are very underpenetrated. And what is a headwind for the industry, we believe, is a tailwind for Rocket in particular. It is a dynamic where it may be tougher for small players to compete, but we are incredibly well capitalized. We have liquidity. And we have a huge opportunity to accelerate growth and take share, especially when you think about the opportunity to create a more disruptive experience, leveraging technology. So, I'll ask Brian, if there's anything that he would add to that, but we're very excited about our position, given the size of the market, the level of under-penetration sort of independent of rates and inventory. Thank you for the question. I'll start and then maybe, Brian, you can add any perspective. I'd just start by saying that our primary focus is on growth. You have a $5 trillion home buying TAM. You have a fragmented market. The mortgage market is $1.5 to $2 trillion. And we have this crazy opportunity to be very disruptive with AI. Now we're always looking for efficiency. We think we're in a good place. But as Brian shared earlier, I mean we're well capitalized. And our perspective is we're in a position to actually invest. And we're looking for ways to increase our focus, our prioritization, but we are being very opportunistic given where we are in the market. Thank you for the question, Arren. I'll start and then Brian can add any perspective. Just start by saying that our purchase products just continue to be relevant and resonate with our clients. A few examples. We have our BUY+ program. And since the launch, we've seen the attachment rate double our One+ program, which is a 1% down program. We've seen the units triple between June and September. We also have our home equity loan program, and we've seen loan units and net rate lock volume double just in the Q3 alone. And so I think the goal for us is to ensure that the programs that we're putting out are innovative. And more importantly, that they're relevant and that they resonate with the clients. And so we're excited to see that progress, and we're also excited to continue to innovate. And Brian, anything that you would add? Yes. I'll take this one. Thank you, Don, for your question. I think the first thing I would just point to, again, as Brian alluded to, is one of the great things about Rocket is, we have a very robust capitalization structure. We have what we call a fortress balance sheet and high levels of liquidity. And I think that gives us a lot of flexibility and it affords us the chance to be opportunistic, especially in this market where you think like valuations being down. So, what I would share is just we are actively in the process of writing the next chapter of our strategy with our leadership team, and we're going to be pursuing ways to accelerate that strategy, whether it's organic or inorganic. And so I look forward to sharing more as we write that next chapter. And so more to come. We are going to have an Investor Day in the coming quarters. And so we'll have an opportunity to go very deep on our strategy with all of our folks in the investor community. And I'd also just say with Rocket Money, we're pleased with the progress that we're making, and I look forward to sharing more with you in the quarters ahead. All right. Thank you, everybody, for joining us today. We appreciate you, and we look forward to connecting again next quarter."

Good afternoon and welcome to the Rocket Companies Earnings Call for the second quarter of 2023. At Rocket, we are dedicated to serving our clients through innovation and we're focused on delivering the best experience to them on every step of their homeownership journey. On behalf of the Board, I'm excited to announce the appointment of Varun Krishna as Rocket Company's new CEO. Varun, who is currently the Executive Vice President and General Manager of Intuit's Consumer Group working on products like TurboTax and TurboTax Live brings a wealth of Fintech leadership experience that will be instrumental in driving Rocket's future success. I look forward to working with Varun in the months ahead to ensure a smooth transition. Before we go any further, I'd like to pause and take a moment to thank our team members for their passion and commitment that drives our achievements. This hasn't been an easy time in our industry and we have made crucial but difficult decisions to better align resources with the needs of our business in today's mortgage market. As part of our ongoing company-wide focus on efficiency, we recently implemented a voluntary career transition program in July, along with other prioritization and cost reduction measures. Brian will share more details on that in a bit. Now, turning to our Q2 results. We reported strong results in the second quarter. Adjusted revenue came in at $1 billion, above the high point of our guidance range, reflecting continued momentum over the past 3 quarters. We also achieved positive adjusted EBITDA of $18 million and GAAP net income of $139 million and GAAP diluted EPS of $0.05, reflecting both our strong execution and ongoing focus on operating an efficient company. We are also very pleased to see our purchase market share grow on both a year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter basis. Our focus on servicing clients through innovation in this challenging market is working. Now I'd like to share some thoughts on the current market. We remain encouraged by the fact that consumer demand for homes continues to be robust and we're seeing a healthy purchase pipeline. People just want to buy homes. That said, at the macro level, the inventory and affordability challenges consumers experienced in the first quarter persists. According to the National Association of Realtors, May 2023 home inventory is roughly 1/4 that of May of 2007. Let that sink in for a second. While there are no quick fixes to low inventory and affordability issues in the industry, we see these market challenges as an opportunity to offer innovative solutions to help our clients during this time. For example, our Buy Plus and One Plus initiative which will talk more about in a few minutes, help increase access to homeownership and address home affordability challenges. These unique products, along with our focus on delivering a great client experience, have driven the growth we've seen in purchase approval letters which are up nearly 20% in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter, far outpacing historical trends. We believe the increases we're seeing in this important metric are the result of the investments we've made in the purchase experience for both our clients and real estate agents that work with them. In the 4 months since launch, our Buy plus initiative has resonated strongly with first-time homebuyers, home sellers and real estate agents. This unique rocket exclusive collaboration between Rocket Mortgage, the largest retail mortgage company in the United States and Rocket Homes, our 50-state home search platform and real estate agent referral network has far surpassed our initial expectations on lead generation. With Buy Plus, purchase clients can save thousands of dollars in upfront costs if they work with the Rocket Homes partner real estate agent and obtained financing with Rocket Mortgage. The homeowner can further increase their savings by buying, selling and financing through Rocket. Real estate agents are excited about working with Rocket and with high intent clients and these initiatives have proven that out as we've seen agent referrals continue to trend higher. In May, we also introduced One plus, a new 1% downhole loan program that aims to increase access to homeownership for millions of low to moderate income Americas. One Plus is available to homebuyers purchasing single-family homes, including manufactured homes, whose income is equal to or less than 80% of their area median income. Open clients with financial wellness and home buying readiness is just as important as providing an excellent experience for those who are ready to purchase now. This is why we laid the groundwork for our client engagement program in 2022 which includes Rocket money, Rocket Rewards, Rocket Visa Signature Card and the home buying plan. Solutions such as home buying plan, our guided digital experience that keeps our clients on track as they prepare for purchase and Rocket Rewards, our loyalty program which gives our clients tangible value for staying engage with Rocket, are crucial, particularly as clients in today's environment are confronted with a much longer home-buying cycle compared to historical periods. And as we have shared previously, our client engagement program can meaningfully change our business model, broadening rockets acquisition channels, lowering client acquisition costs and lifting conversion through the data insights we get. Rocket Visa Signature Cardholders began accruing rocket reward points in the second quarter on purchases. Rocket Rewards also expanded the activities eligible for banking points to home search, including adding a home to a favorites list and saving a home search alert on Rocket Homes. We are already observing a meaningfully higher conversion rate from lead to close among mortgage clients who are rewards members compared to those who are not. As we expand the activities for clients to accrue points across the Rocket ecosystem, we believe we have an opportunity to gain valuable insights, personalize our offering and further lift our conversion. We are further encouraged by this progress when we consider the large and growing number of Rocket accounts. As of June 30, the number of Rocket accounts grew to 29.3 million, an increase of nearly 2 million from the prior quarter with Rocket money continuing to lead the way. Rocket account gives us valuable signals of home buying readiness and intent and we believe Rocket account holders are more open to transacting with Rocket now and in the future. Finally, I'd like to acknowledge a recent achievement that is a symbol of our enduring commitment to the client experience. Just last week, Rocket Mortgage was named the number one in the nation in J.D. Power's [ph] 2023 study for client satisfaction and mortgage servicing. The ninth year Rocket Mortgage has earned the accolade. Rocket is among a short list of companies with a comprehensive home buying ecosystem who can offer a breadth of products and services from financial wellness, personal loans and home search to first lien mortgages, home equity loans, servicing and title and closing. In the 2 months since I've been back at the company, one thing is abundantly clear. Rocket has a tremendous opportunity in the large and fragmented mortgage market and we're changing the game. We're up pending the traditional mortgage business model by diversifying client acquisition channels, lowering client acquisition costs and engaging our clients throughout their lifetime, thereby lifting conversion from lead to close. We are dedicated to growing the business by significantly elevating the client experience through our comprehensive ecosystem. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\nBrian Brown: Thank you, Bill and good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, I'll cover our financial results for the second quarter and our outlook for the third quarter. I will also discuss our innovative offerings and how we help our clients in this challenging market and I'll provide an update on our ongoing efficiency efforts. In the second quarter, we were profitable on an adjusted EBITDA and GAAP net income basis. And once again, we exceeded the top end of our guidance range. We are pleased to see that our purchase focus initiatives are working. Rocket gained purchase market share in the quarter, both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. Our client-first approach and the efforts we have taken to run a leaner business are paying off. Rocket reported strong second quarter results, reflecting sequential growth in volume, revenue and profitability. In Q2, we generated adjusted revenue just north of $1 billion, surpassing the high end of our guidance range. Adjusted revenue is now up in consecutive quarters since Q4 of last year, with Q2 up 14% from Q1 and up 47% from Q4. Turning to profitability; we have made significant strides over the last year to improve our profitability profile even in what has been a historically depressed market. In the second quarter, we returned to positive adjusted EBITDA. Q2 adjusted EBITDA of $18 million improved considerably relative to losses of $79 million and $204 million in Q1 and Q4, respectively. We reported GAAP diluted EPS of $0.05 and an adjusted diluted EPS loss of $0.02 per share. We're encouraged by the improving trend in our results and we're excited to be back in a position of growth and profitability. We have been diligent in prioritizing our resources, focusing on operational efficiency and trimming our cost structure. Our efforts to streamline our costs have been ongoing and span across expense categories, including our recently executed voluntary career transition plan in addition to other third-party related cost reduction efforts. As I've shared before, we invest with discipline and track our progress closely. We are constantly evaluating and making capital allocation and prioritization decisions and we take action to pivot or sunset projects that are not meeting our expectations. For example, most recently, we pivoted from investing in a sales platform for solar to only offering solar financing through the Rocket Loans platform. We also recently wound down Rocket Auto operations. As a result of these actions, we anticipate cost savings in the range of $150 million to $200 million on an annualized basis with the full quarter of cost savings set to begin in the fourth quarter. In addition, we expect to incur a onetime charge of approximately $50 million to $60 million related to the voluntary career transition program, primarily in the third quarter. Looking at current market conditions, we continue to see healthy client purchase demand. People want to buy homes. That said, inventory and affordability challenges are resulting in a much longer homebuying process than we've seen historically. For example, one of the things we monitor internally is the amount of time between when a client shows intent to transact and when they actually find and purchase a home. A measure that we refer to as approval letter to application; this metric has been steadily increasing since February of this year and has recently hit a record high. This is not surprising when you consider that in May, inventory was at its lowest level in 2 decades according to the National Association of Realtors. We're helping our clients stay on track while navigating the longer home buying life cycle in an inventory-constrained market with products like our home buying plan which provides a guided digital experience to help prepare for home purchase. For those even earlier in their journey, Rocket Money helps clients improve their credit score, budget and reach their savings goals. We're giving our clients tangible benefits to stay with Rocket throughout the process with programs such as Rocket Rewards, our loyalty program, whereby clients can grow rewards through engagement across the Rocket ecosystem. We're addressing affordability concerns and expanding accessibility to homeownership through recent initiatives such as Buy Plus, with Buy Plus, purchase clients can save thousands of dollars in upfront costs if they work with the Rocket Homes partner real estate agent and obtained financing with Rocket Mortgage. This is something that only Rocket can offer scale through our integrated real estate and mortgage experience. In addition, because of our ability to capture the economics from both the real estate side and the mortgage side of the transaction, Rocket is uniquely positioned to provide consumers with meaningful savings on their closing costs. With this increased engagement, we're gathering valuable signals and insights, enabling us to personalize our offerings across financial wellness, home search, personal loan, first lien mortgages, home equity loans and more, regardless of where the client is in their home buying journey or when they are ready to transact. Our scale and unique approach to client acquisition, engagement and lead conversion continues to distinguish us from other mortgage lenders particularly in this challenging fragmented market. From a capital allocation perspective, we have always prioritized maintaining a well-capitalized balance sheet with substantial liquidity capable of navigating different market cycles, while remaining opportunistic. Rocket's financial strength continues to be an important strategic advantage for us, especially in today's market. We closed the second quarter with $3.8 billion of available cash and $6.4 billion of mortgage servicing rights. Together, these assets represent a total of $10.2 billion of value on our balance sheet. Our $3.8 billion of available cash consists of $883 million of cash on the balance sheet and an additional $2.9 billion of corporate cash used to self-fund loan originations. Total liquidity stood at approximately $8.6 billion as of June 30, including available cash plus undrawn lines of credit and our undrawn MSR lines. As of June 30, our mortgage servicing portfolio included more than 2.4 million loans serviced with approximately $500 billion in unpaid principal balance. Q2 unpaid principal balance was lower compared to Q1 due to the sale of MSRs in the quarter. We also drive considerable recurring revenue from mortgage servicing. During the second quarter, we generated $343 million of cash revenue from our servicing book which represents approximately $1.4 billion on an annualized basis. Net client retention remained over 90% in the second quarter, well above the industry average. Moving on to our outlook for the third quarter. We expect adjusted revenue to be in the range of $850 million to $1 billion. This guidance takes into account current market conditions, including challenges presented by the historically low housing inventory levels. We expect Q3 expenses to be roughly flat compared to Q2, excluding the $50 million to $60 million in onetime charges. As we have consistently demonstrated over the last 18 months, we are committed to operating an efficient business with continued focus on profitability. As always, our forward-looking guidance is based on our current outlook and visibility. Despite the continued uncertainty at the macro level, we are very well positioned in the current environment. We remain focused on serving our clients and investing with the discipline to drive long-term growth and shareholder value. Before we turn the call over to the operator, I'd like to share with you that our 2022 ESG report can be found on the social impact tab of our Investor Relations website. Our second ESG report highlights Rocket's for more than profit philosophy and approach and the positive impact Rocket has made on our community and our environment. With that, we're ready to turn it back over to the operator for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Kevin Barker with Piper Sandler.\nKevin Barker: First of all, I'd like to thank -- congratulate Bob Walter for his retirement. I also like to dig into what happened with the CEO search process and try to understand any color you can provide on the background on the search process and -- one of the reasons why Varun was chosen to become the next CEO starting in September?\nBill Emerson: Sure, Kevin. Thanks for the question. This is Bill. And thanks for acknowledging Bob. So obviously, we went through an extensive search, that search process started back in February. As soon as we announced that I was the interim CEO because we were diligent about wanting to make sure that we could find someone. We employed a national search firm. And as you can imagine, with a job like this, we've got quite a bit of response and a number of great candidates that we have the opportunity as a Board of -- and in going through that process, we were looking for somebody who had great business acting in, somebody who had consumer product skill sets, somebody who was really good with people and as we have the chance to evaluate Varun and all of the other candidates that we looked at; he clearly rose to the top as far as someone that would be able to come in here and paint a great strategic vision for the organization. Someone who had alignment with us in the Fintech space and the abilities that we have and the things that we're looking to do as it relates to expanding our business and our platform and our ecosystem. So as we went through that process, it was not surprising to see that the Board was unanimous in making the decision to bring Varun on Board.\nKevin Barker: Great. And then just shifting gears, you obviously put a lot of focus on attracting new originations, particularly in the origination -- particularly in the purchase market. I was hoping you could provide a little more color behind some of the progress that you've made with these initiatives, particularly Rocket Rewards, the inflation buster and then the new programs you guys announced in May as well?\nBill Emerson: Yes, sure. I'm sure Brian will have some thoughts on this as well. But you're talking about Buy Plus, One Plus, 2 programs that we rolled out here in the second quarter. Inflation buster was last year. And so -- when you think about the problems in the market today, all kinds of inventory challenges, right? I mean, we just talked about the fact that inventory levels are 1/4 of what they were in 2007 which was the last time we went to a great recession. I mean the inventory levels are incredibly low. People want to buy but it's really hard. Our Buy Plus program gives people the opportunity to save money on the transaction, especially if they're working with us from a mortgage perspective but also because of Rocket Homes, if they're able to work with both [indiscernible] Rocket Homes, it's real money that they can save on the transaction and I think that really gave us an opportunity to drive lead flow that we hadn't seen in the second quarter and allowed us to grow our market share, not only year-over-year but quarter-over-quarter as well which are very, very important metrics that we keep an eye on. So -- we're excited about what -- the way that worked. We're looking forward to that continuing as we move forward.\nBrian Brown: Yes. The only other thing I'd add, Bill, is exactly what you said that these products are designed for this market. The 2 challenges are affordability and inventory and Buy Plus is a good example of an innovative product, just to dive a little deeper into the metrics, it's exceeded our expectations on driving traffic to our sites. Consumer engagement on the product is beating all of our internal metrics. The real challenge is just getting people into homes with the inventory levels that Bill just discussed.\nKevin Barker: Yes. It's obviously a challenging environment and a lot of these programs are relatively new. Are you able to provide just some metrics behind some of the incremental market share that you've taken, particularly around the purchase market?\nBrian Brown: Yes. The way I'd comment on that, Kevin, is I think we've talked about this before but it's a challenge to report market share just if you use the industry forecast. And when I say the industry forecast, I mean, the [indiscernible] and we know that because, one, there's -- it's like any other forecast. It's usually not correct but the actuals change frequently and get updated. So this is how we look at it. We look at securitization data which is, of course, publicly available and you can get your hands on that. And that shows us taking purchase market share quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Now that's about 70% of the overall mortgage market but it's a great sample size in a great indication. We also look at other sources like Optimal Blue and CoreLogic data and that helps us get more real-time information and up to date, again, maybe not capturing the entire market. But when you look at every source and even if you do the math on [indiscernible] they all point in one direction which is us taking share in the purchase market.\nOperator: The next question is from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.\nRyan Nash: Maybe I'll start off looking at the current quarter's results and digging into a little bit on the third quarter guide. So results came in just above the high end of the expectations. Can you maybe just talk about what you saw throughout the quarter on the competitive side that led to the better results? And then when you think about the 3Q guide, maybe just talk a little bit about what's driving the sequential decline at the midpoint of the range. Obviously, there's some seasonality with the spring selling in the second quarter. But maybe just flesh out some of the moving pieces in terms of volumes and margins? And is there some conservatism similar to what we saw in the second quarter? And I have a follow-up.\nBrian Brown: Yes. Thanks, Ryan. I'll take the first shot. But let me start with the Q2 performance. And even just -- I'll talk about the revenue which is obviously exciting. But -- let me just take a step back and say, we're very pleased with the execution in the second quarter. Profitable on an adjusted EBITDA basis profitable on a GAAP basis. This isn't a backdrop of a market that shrunk over 60%, almost overnight. So we're very -- this is an execution quarter from the leadership team and our team members and we're very proud of that. And here's the good news. The profitability was driven by an increase in revenue in the second quarter. And that makes 3 quarters of back-to-back increases on the revenue side, on the gain on sale margin side. And the outperformance was really simple. It was driven by purchase. We talked about some of these Buy plus metrics. They're absolutely resonating with consumers. And then we've got a little cooperation from margins as well. The margin print is very healthy. So that drove the outperformance. And then as we think about Q3, I can tell you we're 1/3 of the way through the quarter as we sit here and talk to you today and the trends are very consistent, particularly on the purchase side with what we saw in Q2. So that's the good news. The challenge comes back to the inventory levels. If you want to believe that Q3 is going to be a healthy purchase quarter, you need to believe that Homes are going to sell and you need to believe that inventory is going to come online. The guide is consistent with Q2, $850 million to $1 billion. We're very confident in our execution and our internal performance but the inventory levels do give us pause as we look into the third quarter.\nRyan Nash: Got it. And then maybe as a follow-up, you talked about expenses being flat next quarter but then you also talked about the $150 million to $200 million cost saves that you bring on. Can you maybe just talk about -- over how much of that is going to be in the run rate for the second quarter over and over what time frame you see it making it in? Does this lead to absolute expenses declining over time? And Brian, you talked about the progress you made on revenues and improving, getting to positive adjusted EBITDA, does this cost saving initiative that you're putting in allow you to move back to sustained profitability?\nBrian Brown: Yes. So I want to be clear that the cost savings that we're talking about, the $150 million to $200 million, we'll really start seeing the effects of those in the fourth quarter. They're executed in the third quarter. They'll work their way through the system. There might be a small benefit in the third quarter but they'll sort of be a full quarter of realization in that fourth quarter which, again, just to touch on the profitability metric, again, this is the $18 million in EBITDA and the $140 million in positive GAAP income is before any of these cost savings take effect. But if you think about what we've done and we've said this before but we're committed to running an efficient business and looking over the cost structure has to be a part of that. Just as a quick reminder for the group. Last year, we took out $3 billion of cost, over 40% of the cost structure came out. This round was really about focusing on efficiency and focusing on prioritization. Those two things we've committed to and we know how important they are and they can make or break a business. So these are the result of being efficient in terms of how we think about our team structure and our organizational structure and our prioritization. So this $150 million to $200 million range should start being a full effect in the fourth quarter and of course, if you just pro forma that and layer that on to the Q2 profitability results, they would have been even better had these cost savings been in place.\nOperator: The next question is from Kyle Joseph with Jefferies.\nKyle Joseph: Sorry one more on the expenses. On the $150 million to $200 million of savings, does that factor in the changes you guys made in solar and auto that you addressed on the call?\nBrian Brown: Yes, that was part of it, for sure. That's what I was alluding to on the prioritization front. There are certain things that, like Bill mentioned, Buy Plus, Rocket Rewards, things that are working that we'll continue to double down on and invest in. Then there's some other things such as the solar sales arm in the Rocket Auto business which were good things at the time and showed some success but aren't meeting our return threshold. So part of that is inclusive of winding down those businesses.\nKyle Joseph: Got it. And then just one quick follow-up on the -- in terms of margin kind of by channel, if you could give us a sense, is 2Q kind of a good run rate at this point where you've had enough supply come out of the industry that we're kind of getting towards an equilibrium in terms of supply and demand? Or just any sort of outlook by channel on your margins?\nBrian Brown: Yes. The way I'd answer it is both channels performed well. Gain on sale margins are now up for 3 quarters in a row. There's no question that, that's a component of capacity coming out and competition easing. But I would go on to just say that they're still well below historical norms. So there's still room to grow there for sure. Capacity has come out of the system. Competition is eased a bit but we're not all the way through that, in our view. Some of that will depend on where mortgage volumes fall out, of course. But if you just look at the amount of mortgages being produced in the second quarter, there's still more capacity that can come out and gain on sale margins are an indication of that, still below historical norms. But yes, the sequential improvement is definitely a positive sign.\nOperator: The next question is from Ryan McKeveny with Zelman & Associates.\nRyan McKeveny: Nice job on the quarter. So you've hit on the purchase dynamics which is helpful and good to see. I guess, looking forward, the midpoint of the adjusted revenue, as you referenced, was referenced previously, down a bit from the 2Q results. I guess maybe help us think about the guidance in relation to the comments you made about purchase. I believe you said pre-approvals were much stronger than historical in 2Q, maybe up 20%. I guess that sounded to me like that was an indication kind of a leading indicator of what's happening in 2Q that may lead into 3Q. So, maybe if you could just square that dynamic with the guidance would be helpful.\nBill Emerson: Yes, I'm happy to take that. I mean, the guidance, if you look forward to the third quarter, I mean, similar guidance in the second quarter and the third quarter typically is not going to be a purchase -- as heavy purchase season just normally than the second quarter. So -- we actually think that's a pretty good guide. And what Brian talked about is the length of time it's actually taking now to make it all the way through the process. So the fact that our fee approval letters are up, it's a great indicator and we look forward to that making its way through our pipeline in the next 3 to 6 months. But it's taking much longer for a client to be able to think about getting a home going through the process, finding at the home, finding a mortgage, negotiating the deal, everything associated with that is just extended. So I think that bodes well for what the third and the fourth quarter can look like. We still have to deal with the fact that the third quarter is typically and historically a little bit less robust as it comes to the purchase market.\nRyan McKeveny: That's helpful. That makes sense. And then second question on Buy Plus and Sell Plus. So you called out the strong consumer engagement there. I guess can you dig in a bit on the reception from real estate agents? It seems like it's a very compelling offering not just to consumers but also to your partner agents with Rocket Homes. So yes, any thoughts there just high level on the reception of agents? And is that program helping drive interest maybe more generally from real estate agents out there to partner with you either on the mortgage side or with Rocket Homes?\nBill Emerson: Yes, that's a great question. I mean we believe it is. We believe we're seeing referral numbers to Rocket Homes up significantly. So that indicates to us that realtors are interested in what we have to offer and passing that on to their client, right? At the end of the day, you know that realtors care deeply about what happens for their client and how well they can be [indiscernible] through the process. So I mean we have been excited to see that increase. I know Rocket Homes has been happy to see it. So it seems like to us that the real estate community is reacting positively to this particular program.\nOperator: The next question is from Doug Harter with Credit Suisse.\nDoug Harter: You mentioned that the MSR -- the servicing portfolio was down at then. I was just wondering how you're currently looking at the servicing portfolio and the split between lower coupon borrowers that have less incentive to [indiscernible] and newer production, higher coupon mortgages that you can see an easier path towards refinancing?\nBrian Brown: Yes. Thanks, Doug. So our views on the MSR asset haven't changed our superpower there are the retention rates. And that's really where we exceed anyone else in this space. The asset is a great cash flow asset and obviously brings a little bit of volatility to the balance sheet. But overall, for us, it's a lifetime value equation. What I think you might be referring to, we did have some sales of servicing assets in the third quarter. The one I'll touch on which is probably the more unique one for us is the sale of the Excess Strip [ph]. We did sell some excess strip off. If you think about our business, we take enough interest rate risk every single day by originating mortgages and servicing mortgages. So where we have an opportunity to unload a bit of that excess at a really nice exit multiple, that can make all the sense in the world for us. We'll trade that for cash. But the most important part is we'll retain the client and that client relationship through the primary servicing asset is obviously, again, our superpower. So that's probably what you saw come through in the third quarter but no change in the overall strategies. We're a buyer of servicing asset every day by the loans that we originate. We do a lot of looking, the client demographics fit our profile and we can make an LTV argument, we'll acquire that portfolio. In terms of clients or portfolios that we sell, again, it's really through that LTV lens. If there's inability to remarket to them or if there's another reason that we don't have the confidence in the recapture, those are the ones we'd look to trade.\nDoug Harter: Is there any way you would -- can give us a breakdown, kind of by coupon? How much of your servicing portfolio would say be above a 5% coupon now or 6%, just to get a sense of what -- if rates came down a moderate amount, where you could start to see more refinance demand?\nBrian Brown: Yes, the financial disclosures always include a weighted average coupon. So you'll see that when we file the Q here. But I mean it's not a surprise that we've been servicing now for a long time in 2020 and 2021 with big origination years, that's going to be a big percentage of your book and that's going to be lower coupon. But I think you bring up a good question because something I feel like folks do underestimate is, this year, there'll be $1.5 trillion or $1.7 trillion of mortgages produced and all those mortgages will be at a higher coupon. And at some point, all those mortgages will be back in the money. And people, I think, underestimate how much rates have to move to make that beneficial for the clients. So when you look at the weighted average coupon, of course, that's going to be low in the book but we're originating mortgages every day at these prevailing rates and higher coupons that it only takes a few basis point move -- to be back in the money and make it beneficial for those clients.\nOperator: The next question is from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.\nJames Faucette: Just a quick question on your prepared remarks, inventories of existing Homes are obviously there historically versus 2007 was particularly striking. And from the lock-in effects -- but it seems like new homebuilders have been filling in the gap in many markets. What are you doing to capture in that market? I didn't know you touched on it a little bit but are there opportunities for Rocket to lean into the space and develop more expansive partnership with homebuilders.\nBill Emerson: That's actually -- that's a great question. I mean we work with homebuilders on a regular basis. So we're constantly interacting with them. But again, as you know, that's a very long life cycle, right? When you start from scratch and signing a purchase agreement to building a home and the gestation period associated with that. I mean I remember what I used to do it a year ago, it was about 9 months and these days, it's probably closer to 15 to 18 months, right? So while we are always encouraged by a little bit of increase in the new construction, it's still relatively small in the grand scheme of life and where it's been historically. So we're constantly working with builders on that but that's not going to show any short-term positive impact for us from a closed loan perspective along the line.\nBrian Brown: I think that's right, Bill. I mean we've been looking at those stats very closely, James and it's a good question. But just keep in mind, the vast majority of homes that will be sold are still existing homes. So that's still where the biggest TAM is. And then also, keep in mind, eventually the market will be efficient, the homebuilders are doing great and they're striking while the iron is hot which is great for them. But existing home sales in every market still are going to be the lion's share of all home sales.\nJames Faucette: Great perspective there. And then I wanted to ask things a little bit, I don't know, it seems a little presumptive to be asking this question, given the expense that you've already made and newly announced plan. But where are you in terms of how much more you could cut if needed but still maintain kind of all the key things that make Rocket, Rocket? Just trying to get a sense for where the bottom may be or it could be, if necessary.\nBill Emerson: That's a great question. But I think at the end of the day, where we are right now and the work that we've gotten so we feel good about where we are from a cost structure. We're going to constantly look at it. We'll be efficient in evaluating our business. But we've done a lot of work to get to the place that we're at. And we feel pretty good about what the future looks like from that perspective.\nOperator: The next question is from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America.\nMihir Bhatia: Let me also add my congratulations to Bob on -- do -- and I just have a two-part question. I'll just ask both parts since the related upfront -- so you've talked a little bit about the -- I appreciate the comments on the product innovation, introduction of new programs and how that's helping drive purchase volume. But I was curious if you could comment a little bit more on just where the market share gains are coming from, where you're seeing them, in what channels, between the partner or the direct business where that's coming from? And also relatedly, there's been some press reports about you all hiring local offices. Maybe talk a little bit about that. And just big picture, maybe -- as the rate backdrop has gotten more challenging and has become more of a purchase-driven origination market, how is Rocket changes? What is staying -- similar to the last question, what is staying true to Rocket that grew into this [indiscernible] in the industry -- mortgage industry? And what has changed? How have you adapted? And what should we expect over the next year or two?\nBill Emerson: That's a mouthful right there. So what I would tell you is I think we've seen growth in both channels. So it's not specific or exclusive to one or the other and we're actually happy about the growth in both. As it relates to your question on local loan officers, we've had remote local loan officers for a long time in our organization. We've always tried to leverage talent where the talent exists. And we probably saw more of that during COVID, right which opened up our eyes to a little bit of the fact that some folks can work from home and do a good job in a local market, that would add value to the organization. So our strategy going forward is the same. We're going to continue to push our direct-to-consumer business and we've got our third-party origination channel I think we're -- as we look at our direct-to-consumer business, there's a way to get more local and more regional with that out of a centralized location that I think is beneficial to the interactions that we would have with realtors and builders. And that's something that we're constantly working on and evaluating. But I think what you're seeing is an organization that's committed to a direct-to-consumer model, the digitization of the process. I think hiring of our new CEO indicates that in a big, big way because of his experience and where he's been. So, we still look at this marketplace as a massive opportunity. It's still very fragmented and there's still a lot to be accomplished by our organization even in a purchase heavy market.\nOperator: The next question is from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo.\nDonald Fandetti: There have been a lot of changes to bank regulation. I didn't know if there were any potential benefits to your business even if it's around the edges?\nBill Emerson: Well, I mean, I think there's a lot of talk about what's going on with banks as it relates to the SBB [ph] regional bank situation that took place. And I know there's some discussions about increased capital rules and things of that nature. But at this point, that stuff is still a proposed in rulemaking state. So it's really kind of hard to determine what that's going to look like in the marketplace. On one hand, if you see capital requirements go up, you've already started to see some regional banks that have pulled away from the warehouse lending space and that could bode poorly for a lot of our brethren in the industry for us. I mean we work with the largest financial institutions. So we don't see an impact there but I think the devil is in the details and we have to see where this -- where the new regulations and the new rules come out and how that might affect things. I mean on one hand, you could argue that by doing that, it might help the non-depository mortgage lender. On the other hand, until we really know the reality of life and what those rules are going to do, it's hard to say. It could ultimately have an impact on some of the non-depository space for folks who don't quite have the balance sheet that we have.\nOperator: That will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'll turn it over to Bill Emerson for any closing comments.\nBill Emerson: So first of all, thank you all for joining us. And I just want to make sure that I state this for the record, how much we appreciate Bob Walters, all the work he's done for this organization over the last 26 years of his leadership. I've known Bob that entire time. And while I am very happy for him and the next steps that he's going to take, he will be missed at this organization greatly. So, thank you, sir. I appreciate you and thank you all for being on listening, asking questions and until next time.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Brian Brown",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill and good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, I'll cover our financial results for the second quarter and our outlook for the third quarter. I will also discuss our innovative offerings and how we help our clients in this challenging market and I'll provide an update on our ongoing efficiency efforts. In the second quarter, we were profitable on an adjusted EBITDA and GAAP net income basis. And once again, we exceeded the top end of our guidance range. We are pleased to see that our purchase focus initiatives are working. Rocket gained purchase market share in the quarter, both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. Our client-first approach and the efforts we have taken to run a leaner business are paying off. Rocket reported strong second quarter results, reflecting sequential growth in volume, revenue and profitability. In Q2, we generated adjusted revenue just north of $1 billion, surpassing the high end of our guidance range. Adjusted revenue is now up in consecutive quarters since Q4 of last year, with Q2 up 14% from Q1 and up 47% from Q4. Turning to profitability; we have made significant strides over the last year to improve our profitability profile even in what has been a historically depressed market. In the second quarter, we returned to positive adjusted EBITDA. Q2 adjusted EBITDA of $18 million improved considerably relative to losses of $79 million and $204 million in Q1 and Q4, respectively. We reported GAAP diluted EPS of $0.05 and an adjusted diluted EPS loss of $0.02 per share. We're encouraged by the improving trend in our results and we're excited to be back in a position of growth and profitability. We have been diligent in prioritizing our resources, focusing on operational efficiency and trimming our cost structure. Our efforts to streamline our costs have been ongoing and span across expense categories, including our recently executed voluntary career transition plan in addition to other third-party related cost reduction efforts. As I've shared before, we invest with discipline and track our progress closely. We are constantly evaluating and making capital allocation and prioritization decisions and we take action to pivot or sunset projects that are not meeting our expectations. For example, most recently, we pivoted from investing in a sales platform for solar to only offering solar financing through the Rocket Loans platform. We also recently wound down Rocket Auto operations. As a result of these actions, we anticipate cost savings in the range of $150 million to $200 million on an annualized basis with the full quarter of cost savings set to begin in the fourth quarter. In addition, we expect to incur a onetime charge of approximately $50 million to $60 million related to the voluntary career transition program, primarily in the third quarter. Looking at current market conditions, we continue to see healthy client purchase demand. People want to buy homes. That said, inventory and affordability challenges are resulting in a much longer homebuying process than we've seen historically. For example, one of the things we monitor internally is the amount of time between when a client shows intent to transact and when they actually find and purchase a home. A measure that we refer to as approval letter to application; this metric has been steadily increasing since February of this year and has recently hit a record high. This is not surprising when you consider that in May, inventory was at its lowest level in 2 decades according to the National Association of Realtors. We're helping our clients stay on track while navigating the longer home buying life cycle in an inventory-constrained market with products like our home buying plan which provides a guided digital experience to help prepare for home purchase. For those even earlier in their journey, Rocket Money helps clients improve their credit score, budget and reach their savings goals. We're giving our clients tangible benefits to stay with Rocket throughout the process with programs such as Rocket Rewards, our loyalty program, whereby clients can grow rewards through engagement across the Rocket ecosystem. We're addressing affordability concerns and expanding accessibility to homeownership through recent initiatives such as Buy Plus, with Buy Plus, purchase clients can save thousands of dollars in upfront costs if they work with the Rocket Homes partner real estate agent and obtained financing with Rocket Mortgage. This is something that only Rocket can offer scale through our integrated real estate and mortgage experience. In addition, because of our ability to capture the economics from both the real estate side and the mortgage side of the transaction, Rocket is uniquely positioned to provide consumers with meaningful savings on their closing costs. With this increased engagement, we're gathering valuable signals and insights, enabling us to personalize our offerings across financial wellness, home search, personal loan, first lien mortgages, home equity loans and more, regardless of where the client is in their home buying journey or when they are ready to transact. Our scale and unique approach to client acquisition, engagement and lead conversion continues to distinguish us from other mortgage lenders particularly in this challenging fragmented market. From a capital allocation perspective, we have always prioritized maintaining a well-capitalized balance sheet with substantial liquidity capable of navigating different market cycles, while remaining opportunistic. Rocket's financial strength continues to be an important strategic advantage for us, especially in today's market. We closed the second quarter with $3.8 billion of available cash and $6.4 billion of mortgage servicing rights. Together, these assets represent a total of $10.2 billion of value on our balance sheet. Our $3.8 billion of available cash consists of $883 million of cash on the balance sheet and an additional $2.9 billion of corporate cash used to self-fund loan originations. Total liquidity stood at approximately $8.6 billion as of June 30, including available cash plus undrawn lines of credit and our undrawn MSR lines. As of June 30, our mortgage servicing portfolio included more than 2.4 million loans serviced with approximately $500 billion in unpaid principal balance. Q2 unpaid principal balance was lower compared to Q1 due to the sale of MSRs in the quarter. We also drive considerable recurring revenue from mortgage servicing. During the second quarter, we generated $343 million of cash revenue from our servicing book which represents approximately $1.4 billion on an annualized basis. Net client retention remained over 90% in the second quarter, well above the industry average. Moving on to our outlook for the third quarter. We expect adjusted revenue to be in the range of $850 million to $1 billion. This guidance takes into account current market conditions, including challenges presented by the historically low housing inventory levels. We expect Q3 expenses to be roughly flat compared to Q2, excluding the $50 million to $60 million in onetime charges. As we have consistently demonstrated over the last 18 months, we are committed to operating an efficient business with continued focus on profitability. As always, our forward-looking guidance is based on our current outlook and visibility. Despite the continued uncertainty at the macro level, we are very well positioned in the current environment. We remain focused on serving our clients and investing with the discipline to drive long-term growth and shareholder value. Before we turn the call over to the operator, I'd like to share with you that our 2022 ESG report can be found on the social impact tab of our Investor Relations website. Our second ESG report highlights Rocket's for more than profit philosophy and approach and the positive impact Rocket has made on our community and our environment. With that, we're ready to turn it back over to the operator for questions. Yes. The only other thing I'd add, Bill, is exactly what you said that these products are designed for this market. The 2 challenges are affordability and inventory and Buy Plus is a good example of an innovative product, just to dive a little deeper into the metrics, it's exceeded our expectations on driving traffic to our sites. Consumer engagement on the product is beating all of our internal metrics. The real challenge is just getting people into homes with the inventory levels that Bill just discussed. Yes. The way I'd comment on that, Kevin, is I think we've talked about this before but it's a challenge to report market share just if you use the industry forecast. And when I say the industry forecast, I mean, the [indiscernible] and we know that because, one, there's -- it's like any other forecast. It's usually not correct but the actuals change frequently and get updated. So this is how we look at it. We look at securitization data which is, of course, publicly available and you can get your hands on that. And that shows us taking purchase market share quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Now that's about 70% of the overall mortgage market but it's a great sample size in a great indication. We also look at other sources like Optimal Blue and CoreLogic data and that helps us get more real-time information and up to date, again, maybe not capturing the entire market. But when you look at every source and even if you do the math on [indiscernible] they all point in one direction which is us taking share in the purchase market. Yes. Thanks, Ryan. I'll take the first shot. But let me start with the Q2 performance. And even just -- I'll talk about the revenue which is obviously exciting. But -- let me just take a step back and say, we're very pleased with the execution in the second quarter. Profitable on an adjusted EBITDA basis profitable on a GAAP basis. This isn't a backdrop of a market that shrunk over 60%, almost overnight. So we're very -- this is an execution quarter from the leadership team and our team members and we're very proud of that. And here's the good news. The profitability was driven by an increase in revenue in the second quarter. And that makes 3 quarters of back-to-back increases on the revenue side, on the gain on sale margin side. And the outperformance was really simple. It was driven by purchase. We talked about some of these Buy plus metrics. They're absolutely resonating with consumers. And then we've got a little cooperation from margins as well. The margin print is very healthy. So that drove the outperformance. And then as we think about Q3, I can tell you we're 1/3 of the way through the quarter as we sit here and talk to you today and the trends are very consistent, particularly on the purchase side with what we saw in Q2. So that's the good news. The challenge comes back to the inventory levels. If you want to believe that Q3 is going to be a healthy purchase quarter, you need to believe that Homes are going to sell and you need to believe that inventory is going to come online. The guide is consistent with Q2, $850 million to $1 billion. We're very confident in our execution and our internal performance but the inventory levels do give us pause as we look into the third quarter. Yes. So I want to be clear that the cost savings that we're talking about, the $150 million to $200 million, we'll really start seeing the effects of those in the fourth quarter. They're executed in the third quarter. They'll work their way through the system. There might be a small benefit in the third quarter but they'll sort of be a full quarter of realization in that fourth quarter which, again, just to touch on the profitability metric, again, this is the $18 million in EBITDA and the $140 million in positive GAAP income is before any of these cost savings take effect. But if you think about what we've done and we've said this before but we're committed to running an efficient business and looking over the cost structure has to be a part of that. Just as a quick reminder for the group. Last year, we took out $3 billion of cost, over 40% of the cost structure came out. This round was really about focusing on efficiency and focusing on prioritization. Those two things we've committed to and we know how important they are and they can make or break a business. So these are the result of being efficient in terms of how we think about our team structure and our organizational structure and our prioritization. So this $150 million to $200 million range should start being a full effect in the fourth quarter and of course, if you just pro forma that and layer that on to the Q2 profitability results, they would have been even better had these cost savings been in place. Yes, that was part of it, for sure. That's what I was alluding to on the prioritization front. There are certain things that, like Bill mentioned, Buy Plus, Rocket Rewards, things that are working that we'll continue to double down on and invest in. Then there's some other things such as the solar sales arm in the Rocket Auto business which were good things at the time and showed some success but aren't meeting our return threshold. So part of that is inclusive of winding down those businesses. Yes. The way I'd answer it is both channels performed well. Gain on sale margins are now up for 3 quarters in a row. There's no question that, that's a component of capacity coming out and competition easing. But I would go on to just say that they're still well below historical norms. So there's still room to grow there for sure. Capacity has come out of the system. Competition is eased a bit but we're not all the way through that, in our view. Some of that will depend on where mortgage volumes fall out, of course. But if you just look at the amount of mortgages being produced in the second quarter, there's still more capacity that can come out and gain on sale margins are an indication of that, still below historical norms. But yes, the sequential improvement is definitely a positive sign. Yes. Thanks, Doug. So our views on the MSR asset haven't changed our superpower there are the retention rates. And that's really where we exceed anyone else in this space. The asset is a great cash flow asset and obviously brings a little bit of volatility to the balance sheet. But overall, for us, it's a lifetime value equation. What I think you might be referring to, we did have some sales of servicing assets in the third quarter. The one I'll touch on which is probably the more unique one for us is the sale of the Excess Strip [ph]. We did sell some excess strip off. If you think about our business, we take enough interest rate risk every single day by originating mortgages and servicing mortgages. So where we have an opportunity to unload a bit of that excess at a really nice exit multiple, that can make all the sense in the world for us. We'll trade that for cash. But the most important part is we'll retain the client and that client relationship through the primary servicing asset is obviously, again, our superpower. So that's probably what you saw come through in the third quarter but no change in the overall strategies. We're a buyer of servicing asset every day by the loans that we originate. We do a lot of looking, the client demographics fit our profile and we can make an LTV argument, we'll acquire that portfolio. In terms of clients or portfolios that we sell, again, it's really through that LTV lens. If there's inability to remarket to them or if there's another reason that we don't have the confidence in the recapture, those are the ones we'd look to trade. Yes, the financial disclosures always include a weighted average coupon. So you'll see that when we file the Q here. But I mean it's not a surprise that we've been servicing now for a long time in 2020 and 2021 with big origination years, that's going to be a big percentage of your book and that's going to be lower coupon. But I think you bring up a good question because something I feel like folks do underestimate is, this year, there'll be $1.5 trillion or $1.7 trillion of mortgages produced and all those mortgages will be at a higher coupon. And at some point, all those mortgages will be back in the money. And people, I think, underestimate how much rates have to move to make that beneficial for the clients. So when you look at the weighted average coupon, of course, that's going to be low in the book but we're originating mortgages every day at these prevailing rates and higher coupons that it only takes a few basis point move -- to be back in the money and make it beneficial for those clients. I think that's right, Bill. I mean we've been looking at those stats very closely, James and it's a good question. But just keep in mind, the vast majority of homes that will be sold are still existing homes. So that's still where the biggest TAM is. And then also, keep in mind, eventually the market will be efficient, the homebuilders are doing great and they're striking while the iron is hot which is great for them. But existing home sales in every market still are going to be the lion's share of all home sales."

            "name": "Bill Emerson",
            "content": "Thanks, Sharon. Good afternoon and welcome to the Rocket Companies Earnings Call for the second quarter of 2023. At Rocket, we are dedicated to serving our clients through innovation and we're focused on delivering the best experience to them on every step of their homeownership journey. On behalf of the Board, I'm excited to announce the appointment of Varun Krishna as Rocket Company's new CEO. Varun, who is currently the Executive Vice President and General Manager of Intuit's Consumer Group working on products like TurboTax and TurboTax Live brings a wealth of Fintech leadership experience that will be instrumental in driving Rocket's future success. I look forward to working with Varun in the months ahead to ensure a smooth transition. Before we go any further, I'd like to pause and take a moment to thank our team members for their passion and commitment that drives our achievements. This hasn't been an easy time in our industry and we have made crucial but difficult decisions to better align resources with the needs of our business in today's mortgage market. As part of our ongoing company-wide focus on efficiency, we recently implemented a voluntary career transition program in July, along with other prioritization and cost reduction measures. Brian will share more details on that in a bit. Now, turning to our Q2 results. We reported strong results in the second quarter. Adjusted revenue came in at $1 billion, above the high point of our guidance range, reflecting continued momentum over the past 3 quarters. We also achieved positive adjusted EBITDA of $18 million and GAAP net income of $139 million and GAAP diluted EPS of $0.05, reflecting both our strong execution and ongoing focus on operating an efficient company. We are also very pleased to see our purchase market share grow on both a year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter basis. Our focus on servicing clients through innovation in this challenging market is working. Now I'd like to share some thoughts on the current market. We remain encouraged by the fact that consumer demand for homes continues to be robust and we're seeing a healthy purchase pipeline. People just want to buy homes. That said, at the macro level, the inventory and affordability challenges consumers experienced in the first quarter persists. According to the National Association of Realtors, May 2023 home inventory is roughly 1/4 that of May of 2007. Let that sink in for a second. While there are no quick fixes to low inventory and affordability issues in the industry, we see these market challenges as an opportunity to offer innovative solutions to help our clients during this time. For example, our Buy Plus and One Plus initiative which will talk more about in a few minutes, help increase access to homeownership and address home affordability challenges. These unique products, along with our focus on delivering a great client experience, have driven the growth we've seen in purchase approval letters which are up nearly 20% in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter, far outpacing historical trends. We believe the increases we're seeing in this important metric are the result of the investments we've made in the purchase experience for both our clients and real estate agents that work with them. In the 4 months since launch, our Buy plus initiative has resonated strongly with first-time homebuyers, home sellers and real estate agents. This unique rocket exclusive collaboration between Rocket Mortgage, the largest retail mortgage company in the United States and Rocket Homes, our 50-state home search platform and real estate agent referral network has far surpassed our initial expectations on lead generation. With Buy Plus, purchase clients can save thousands of dollars in upfront costs if they work with the Rocket Homes partner real estate agent and obtained financing with Rocket Mortgage. The homeowner can further increase their savings by buying, selling and financing through Rocket. Real estate agents are excited about working with Rocket and with high intent clients and these initiatives have proven that out as we've seen agent referrals continue to trend higher. In May, we also introduced One plus, a new 1% downhole loan program that aims to increase access to homeownership for millions of low to moderate income Americas. One Plus is available to homebuyers purchasing single-family homes, including manufactured homes, whose income is equal to or less than 80% of their area median income. Open clients with financial wellness and home buying readiness is just as important as providing an excellent experience for those who are ready to purchase now. This is why we laid the groundwork for our client engagement program in 2022 which includes Rocket money, Rocket Rewards, Rocket Visa Signature Card and the home buying plan. Solutions such as home buying plan, our guided digital experience that keeps our clients on track as they prepare for purchase and Rocket Rewards, our loyalty program which gives our clients tangible value for staying engage with Rocket, are crucial, particularly as clients in today's environment are confronted with a much longer home-buying cycle compared to historical periods. And as we have shared previously, our client engagement program can meaningfully change our business model, broadening rockets acquisition channels, lowering client acquisition costs and lifting conversion through the data insights we get. Rocket Visa Signature Cardholders began accruing rocket reward points in the second quarter on purchases. Rocket Rewards also expanded the activities eligible for banking points to home search, including adding a home to a favorites list and saving a home search alert on Rocket Homes. We are already observing a meaningfully higher conversion rate from lead to close among mortgage clients who are rewards members compared to those who are not. As we expand the activities for clients to accrue points across the Rocket ecosystem, we believe we have an opportunity to gain valuable insights, personalize our offering and further lift our conversion. We are further encouraged by this progress when we consider the large and growing number of Rocket accounts. As of June 30, the number of Rocket accounts grew to 29.3 million, an increase of nearly 2 million from the prior quarter with Rocket money continuing to lead the way. Rocket account gives us valuable signals of home buying readiness and intent and we believe Rocket account holders are more open to transacting with Rocket now and in the future. Finally, I'd like to acknowledge a recent achievement that is a symbol of our enduring commitment to the client experience. Just last week, Rocket Mortgage was named the number one in the nation in J.D. Power's [ph] 2023 study for client satisfaction and mortgage servicing. The ninth year Rocket Mortgage has earned the accolade. Rocket is among a short list of companies with a comprehensive home buying ecosystem who can offer a breadth of products and services from financial wellness, personal loans and home search to first lien mortgages, home equity loans, servicing and title and closing. In the 2 months since I've been back at the company, one thing is abundantly clear. Rocket has a tremendous opportunity in the large and fragmented mortgage market and we're changing the game. We're up pending the traditional mortgage business model by diversifying client acquisition channels, lowering client acquisition costs and engaging our clients throughout their lifetime, thereby lifting conversion from lead to close. We are dedicated to growing the business by significantly elevating the client experience through our comprehensive ecosystem. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian. Sure, Kevin. Thanks for the question. This is Bill. And thanks for acknowledging Bob. So obviously, we went through an extensive search, that search process started back in February. As soon as we announced that I was the interim CEO because we were diligent about wanting to make sure that we could find someone. We employed a national search firm. And as you can imagine, with a job like this, we've got quite a bit of response and a number of great candidates that we have the opportunity as a Board of -- and in going through that process, we were looking for somebody who had great business acting in, somebody who had consumer product skill sets, somebody who was really good with people and as we have the chance to evaluate Varun and all of the other candidates that we looked at; he clearly rose to the top as far as someone that would be able to come in here and paint a great strategic vision for the organization. Someone who had alignment with us in the Fintech space and the abilities that we have and the things that we're looking to do as it relates to expanding our business and our platform and our ecosystem. So as we went through that process, it was not surprising to see that the Board was unanimous in making the decision to bring Varun on Board. Yes, sure. I'm sure Brian will have some thoughts on this as well. But you're talking about Buy Plus, One Plus, 2 programs that we rolled out here in the second quarter. Inflation buster was last year. And so -- when you think about the problems in the market today, all kinds of inventory challenges, right? I mean, we just talked about the fact that inventory levels are 1/4 of what they were in 2007 which was the last time we went to a great recession. I mean the inventory levels are incredibly low. People want to buy but it's really hard. Our Buy Plus program gives people the opportunity to save money on the transaction, especially if they're working with us from a mortgage perspective but also because of Rocket Homes, if they're able to work with both [indiscernible] Rocket Homes, it's real money that they can save on the transaction and I think that really gave us an opportunity to drive lead flow that we hadn't seen in the second quarter and allowed us to grow our market share, not only year-over-year but quarter-over-quarter as well which are very, very important metrics that we keep an eye on. So -- we're excited about what -- the way that worked. We're looking forward to that continuing as we move forward. Yes, I'm happy to take that. I mean, the guidance, if you look forward to the third quarter, I mean, similar guidance in the second quarter and the third quarter typically is not going to be a purchase -- as heavy purchase season just normally than the second quarter. So -- we actually think that's a pretty good guide. And what Brian talked about is the length of time it's actually taking now to make it all the way through the process. So the fact that our fee approval letters are up, it's a great indicator and we look forward to that making its way through our pipeline in the next 3 to 6 months. But it's taking much longer for a client to be able to think about getting a home going through the process, finding at the home, finding a mortgage, negotiating the deal, everything associated with that is just extended. So I think that bodes well for what the third and the fourth quarter can look like. We still have to deal with the fact that the third quarter is typically and historically a little bit less robust as it comes to the purchase market. Yes, that's a great question. I mean we believe it is. We believe we're seeing referral numbers to Rocket Homes up significantly. So that indicates to us that realtors are interested in what we have to offer and passing that on to their client, right? At the end of the day, you know that realtors care deeply about what happens for their client and how well they can be [indiscernible] through the process. So I mean we have been excited to see that increase. I know Rocket Homes has been happy to see it. So it seems like to us that the real estate community is reacting positively to this particular program. That's actually -- that's a great question. I mean we work with homebuilders on a regular basis. So we're constantly interacting with them. But again, as you know, that's a very long life cycle, right? When you start from scratch and signing a purchase agreement to building a home and the gestation period associated with that. I mean I remember what I used to do it a year ago, it was about 9 months and these days, it's probably closer to 15 to 18 months, right? So while we are always encouraged by a little bit of increase in the new construction, it's still relatively small in the grand scheme of life and where it's been historically. So we're constantly working with builders on that but that's not going to show any short-term positive impact for us from a closed loan perspective along the line. That's a great question. But I think at the end of the day, where we are right now and the work that we've gotten so we feel good about where we are from a cost structure. We're going to constantly look at it. We'll be efficient in evaluating our business. But we've done a lot of work to get to the place that we're at. And we feel pretty good about what the future looks like from that perspective. That's a mouthful right there. So what I would tell you is I think we've seen growth in both channels. So it's not specific or exclusive to one or the other and we're actually happy about the growth in both. As it relates to your question on local loan officers, we've had remote local loan officers for a long time in our organization. We've always tried to leverage talent where the talent exists. And we probably saw more of that during COVID, right which opened up our eyes to a little bit of the fact that some folks can work from home and do a good job in a local market, that would add value to the organization. So our strategy going forward is the same. We're going to continue to push our direct-to-consumer business and we've got our third-party origination channel I think we're -- as we look at our direct-to-consumer business, there's a way to get more local and more regional with that out of a centralized location that I think is beneficial to the interactions that we would have with realtors and builders. And that's something that we're constantly working on and evaluating. But I think what you're seeing is an organization that's committed to a direct-to-consumer model, the digitization of the process. I think hiring of our new CEO indicates that in a big, big way because of his experience and where he's been. So, we still look at this marketplace as a massive opportunity. It's still very fragmented and there's still a lot to be accomplished by our organization even in a purchase heavy market. Well, I mean, I think there's a lot of talk about what's going on with banks as it relates to the SBB [ph] regional bank situation that took place. And I know there's some discussions about increased capital rules and things of that nature. But at this point, that stuff is still a proposed in rulemaking state. So it's really kind of hard to determine what that's going to look like in the marketplace. On one hand, if you see capital requirements go up, you've already started to see some regional banks that have pulled away from the warehouse lending space and that could bode poorly for a lot of our brethren in the industry for us. I mean we work with the largest financial institutions. So we don't see an impact there but I think the devil is in the details and we have to see where this -- where the new regulations and the new rules come out and how that might affect things. I mean on one hand, you could argue that by doing that, it might help the non-depository mortgage lender. On the other hand, until we really know the reality of life and what those rules are going to do, it's hard to say. It could ultimately have an impact on some of the non-depository space for folks who don't quite have the balance sheet that we have. So first of all, thank you all for joining us. And I just want to make sure that I state this for the record, how much we appreciate Bob Walters, all the work he's done for this organization over the last 26 years of his leadership. I've known Bob that entire time. And while I am very happy for him and the next steps that he's going to take, he will be missed at this organization greatly. So, thank you, sir. I appreciate you and thank you all for being on listening, asking questions and until next time."

And with that, I'll turn things over to Jay Farner to get us started. Jay?\nJay Farner: Thanks, Sharon. Good afternoon and welcome to the Rocket Companies earnings call for the first quarter of 2023. I'm joined today by Bill Emerson, who will be stepping in as Rocket's interim CEO on June 1. Bill has been diving into the business over the last few months, and he'll be sharing some of his thoughts in just a moment.  I'd like to begin with some thoughts on the market. We're encouraged by the fact that consumer demand for homes is robust. And we're seeing a healthy purchase pipeline as we enter the spring home buying season. From March to April of this year, purchase approval letters are up 11% and are also trending much higher from March to April this year compared to the same timeframe last year.  We believe that the increases we're seeing in this very important metric is primarily attributable to the investments we've made in the client and real estate agent purchase experience and innovative consumer focused solutions, such as BUY+, which we'll talk more about in a few minutes. That said, we're still seeing challenges in home inventory levels, and existing home sales have declined to levels not seen since 2008. We will need home inventory levels to cooperate in order to have a successful home buying season.  Over the past several quarters, we've seen a consistent upward trend in our Net Promoter Score for both clients and real estate agents. In fact, in the first quarter of this year, our purchase NPS reached an all-time high of 75 for retail clients and 53 for real estate agents, meaning clients and agents highly recommend Rocket as a lender. And NPS score above 50 is generally considered excellent. So we're excited that the investments that we've made in technology and data, as well as our continuous process improvements have led to these high marks and the positive trend that we're experiencing.  With this backdrop, we reported a strong first quarter. Adjusted revenue came in at $882 million, above the high end of our guidance range. We reported an adjusted EBITDA loss of $79 million and an adjusted loss of $0.06 per diluted share, both metrics showing an improvement over the prior quarter. We've recently unveiled several important initiatives that help our clients in this uncertain time and lower barriers to transact.  In April, we introduced BUY+ and SELL+, a collaboration between Rocket Homes, our home search platform and real estate agent referral network business, and Rocket Mortgage. With BUY+, purchase clients can save thousands of dollars in upfront costs if they work with Rocket Homes partner real estate agents, and obtain financing with Rocket Mortgage.  With SELL+, sellers listing their homes for sale with Rocket Holmes verified partner agent will receive a rebate check for 1% of the sale price from Rocket Homes after closing. If a homeowner is buying and selling, they can use BUY+ and SELL+ to increase their savings. We also recently unveiled the Rocket Visa Signature Credit Card, the first credit card that makes home buying more accessible and homeownership easier through everyday spending.  With a Rocket Signature Card, our clients can earn 5% back, which can reduce closing costs by thousands of dollars, helping to address one of the most significant hurdles in purchasing a home. The Rocket Signature Card is designed to appeal to first-time homebuyers, as well as existing homeowners who are in the market to buy, and helps us reach them earlier on in the purchase lifecycle.  Along with Rocket Money, our credit card provides us with another way to reach our clients much earlier in the process and at a significantly lower client acquisition costs compared to traditional mortgage methods. What's even more meaningful is that the points earned through the Rocket Signature Card can be used in conjunction with our Rocket Rewards loyalty program. When we surveyed our clients, nearly 90% of them told us they would value a Rocket affiliated rewards program in a way that would promote a long-term relationship with our brand. Now with our loyalty program credit card, our clients can further accelerate their path to homeownership. Clients with loans already serviced by Rocket Mortgage have even more flexibility and can choose to use their points to reduce their unpaid principal balance, helping drive even higher retention and client lifetime value.  Rocket Rewards enrollment has continued to show impressive growth and the early results on Rocket Rewards have been very encouraging. With our test group seeing more than 2x the conversion rate from lead to close compared to those who are not enrolled in the rewards program. As of March 31, we grew the number of Rocket Accounts to 27.6 million, up more than 2 million from our prior quarter, driven largely by Rocket Money.  Rocket Accounts is an important metric, as it represents clients who have taken the action to create an account with us and with whom we may have visibility on credit worthiness, spending behavior, finances, home buying intent, and more. We believe that these clients are more open to transacting with Rocket.  Through our full end-to-end home buying ecosystem, we can help our clients at every step of the homeownership journey, from the financial planning and educational process well before they apply for a mortgage to searching for and ultimately the financing of their new home. With our client engagement program, which includes Rocket Money, Rocket Rewards, Rocket Signature Card, and the home buying plan, we now have multiple ways to acquire and engage our clients. This provides us with valuable data insights earlier in the process.  Indicators of home buying intent that are particularly valuable given the high client acquisition costs and the lengthy off to complex nature of a purchase transaction, helping us personalized the right offering at the right time. We believe this engagement will help grow our market share in purchase, as well as lower our client acquisition costs, meaningfully lift conversion from lead to close, increase retention, and extend client lifetime value. All these initiatives set Rocket up for a bright future.  This being my last earnings call, I'd like to thank the amazing team members that I've worked with for the past 27 years for their passion and commitment. Having worked alongside Bill now for many years, I'm certain there is no one more qualified to take the interim CEO role while the company searches for a permanent successor. Bill and I will continue to work together over the next month, helping to ensure a smooth transition.  With that I'll turn it over to Bill.\nBill Emerson: Thanks, Jay. Great to be here today. Over the past few months, I've had a chance to work closely with Jay and the phenomenal team members across our organization. I'm excited about Rocket's future as we continue to execute on our strategy. We have an intimate Rocket; innovation is rewarded, execution is worshipped. We laid important groundwork last year and now is the time for us to execute and continue to grow our purchase market share in a purchase heavy market. Rocket's opportunity is significant. The mortgage industry is large and fragmented, and the traditional mortgage experience is complex, frustrating and difficult for clients to navigate. With our end-to-end ecosystem, Rocket strives to make the home buying and home ownership experience simpler and more accessible for our clients. We are dedicated to delivering the best client service, leveraging our unique resources and the breadth of our offerings.  BUY+ and SELL+, our collaboration between Rocket Homes and Rocket Mortgage is a clear example of this. With Rocket Money, Rocket Card, Rocket Rewards and Rocket Loans, we have the unique ability to serve our clients in more moments throughout their lives, all while dramatically lowering our cost to acquire.  Rocket Loans, our personal loans business had their biggest month of origination in the company's history in March. And they are just getting started as they continue to build out their product agnostic lending platform, driven by AI decisioning that will help power financial transactions from everything ranging from personal loans to financing solar installations.  Our client-first lifetime value approach flips the script entirely on what a great experience is in mortgage and beyond. We are helping our clients prepare for home ownership and several other financial transactions, and we are providing tangible value and an experience that can only be realized through Rocket. We are taking a new innovative approach to client acquisition, retention and lifetime value that we believe will be a game changer for the industry and drive our continued growth in purchase.  Over time, we believe this will translate into substantial and sustainable growth in market share, revenue and profitability. I am excited to continue the work that Jay and our team members started and fulfill our mission to be the best at creating certainty in life's most complex moments, so that our clients can live their dreams.  With that, Brian will take us through the numbers.\nBrian Brown: Thank you, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, I'll cover the financial results for the first quarter of 2023. I'll also share our outlook for the second quarter, discuss what we're seeing in the current environment and walk through how our unique and innovative approach to client acquisition and engagement is positioning Rocket to lead the way in a purchase-heavy market. Rocket is executing well in an uncertain macro environment. In today's market, we're seeing strong client demand to purchase homes and we're entering the second quarter with a healthy approval letter pipeline. However, on the supply side, the market is still constrained by limited housing inventory.  To put this in perspective, March existing home sales came in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.4 million homes, well below the 20-year average of over 5.3 million existing home sales per year. Looking at it differently, there was 2.6 months of housing inventory available in March, which is less than half of what we would expect based on the 20-year average. Housing inventory is something we're watching closely as we enter the spring home buying season.  The challenging inventory levels and persistent affordability concerns that our clients are facing require unique solutions. Take the BUY+ and SELL+ campaign that we launched in early April. This program addresses affordability concerns by providing clients that use both Rocket Holmes and Rocket Mortgage, a discount on their mortgage. This is something that only Rocket can offer at scale through our integrated real estate and mortgage experience.  Also, because of our ability to capture the economics of the transaction from both the real estate side and the mortgage side, Rocket is uniquely positioned to provide consumers with meaningful savings on their closing costs. The low levels of inventory are also contributing to a much longer home buying lifecycle compared to historical periods.  While these dynamics present a challenge for most lenders because it provides clients with more chances to switch during the process, at Rocket we view it as an opportunity with programs such as Rocket Rewards, which incentivize clients with growing rewards as engagement increases, there is a distinct and measurable benefit to staying with Rocket throughout the process.  Moving on to the results, Rocket Companies reported a solid first quarter against a difficult market backdrop. Adjusted revenue came in at $882 million, above the high end of our guided range driven by strong client demand and solid execution. In the first quarter, we generated net rate locks of $19.5 billion, a 30% increase from the fourth quarter. Our gain on sale margin for the quarter was 239 basis points, 22 basis points higher than the fourth quarter.  Regarding profitability, operating losses in Q1 narrowed meaningfully relative to the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusted revenue increased by nearly $200 million quarter-over-quarter, while total expenses grew less than half that amount. As a result, Q1 adjusted EBITDA loss of $79 million improved significantly compared to a $204 million loss in Q4.  Adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter also showed relative improvement coming in at a loss of $0.06 per share. We continue to execute a disciplined approach to managing our expenses in light of current volume levels, and we remain focused on making the right long-term investments.  I'd like to take a moment and talk about the positive impact we expect from our recent launches. Our client engagement program, which includes Rocket Money, Rocket Rewards, Rocket Signature Card and home buying plan provides us with multiple avenues for client acquisition, better engagement levels and improved lead conversion.  As we've mentioned on prior calls, the largest direct and variable expense in a mortgage transaction is the cost to acquire. This cost can run in the thousands of dollars per client. And that's not even including the costs associated with potentially reacquiring at a different time or down the road for another transaction.  In contrast, Rocket Money's cost to acquire is less than $100. And we see significant opportunity to lower our overall blended CAC by expanding our acquisition channels, keeping clients in our ecosystem and providing a best-in-class experience. Since our acquisition, Rocket Money has played a meaningful role in expanding our client base. We reached 27.6 million Rocket Accounts in the quarter, representing an increase of more than 2 million sequentially, largely driven by Rocket Money.  Rocket Signature Card further diversifies our acquisition channels, attracting clients who have high intent to buy a home. The Signature Card also provides us with valuable insights that help us understand when our clients are ready to transact, thereby lifting conversion in the process.  I'd like to clarify that our intent with the Signature Card is not to compete with large credit card companies at scale. We launched our card to give our clients something of value, capturing them earlier in their purchase journey and getting stronger signals on home buying intent.  But beyond acquisition, we now have even more reasons to engage with our clients in more ways to deliver tangible value. Banking rewards points to save on closing costs or providing financial wellness and education to make them more confident homebuyers well before they are ready to transact. Along the way, we're able to gather data insights throughout the process, helping us to personalize the right offering at the right time, with indicators of home buying intent that are particularly valuable given the high client acquisition costs and the lengthy often complex nature of a purchase transaction.  As Jay mentioned, early signs of conversion lift are very encouraging. The Rocket Rewards test group is seeing more than 2x the conversion rate from lead to close compared to those who are not enrolled in the rewards program. We believe these higher conversion rates for Rocket Rewards applied to a larger client base could have a significant impact on our unit economics. When considering the multiple client engagement initiatives we have in place, we believe the impact can be even greater.  We believe these innovative methods of client acquisition, engagement and lead conversion will help drive our success in purchase and highlight our unique business model compared to other mortgage lending companies through superior unit economics, even higher retention rates and extended client lifetime value.  Turning to our balance sheet, Rocket's financial strength continues to be an important strategic advantage for us. We ended the first quarter with $3.3 billion of available cash and $6.7 billion of mortgage servicing rights. Together, these assets represent a total of $9.9 billion on our balance sheet.  Our $3.3 billion of available cash consists of $900 million of cash on the balance sheet and an additional $2.4 billion of corporate cash used to self fund loan originations. Total liquidity stood at approximately $8.1 billion as of March 31, including available cash plus undrawn lines of credit and our undrawn MSR lines.  As of March 31, our mortgage servicing portfolio included more than 2.5 million clients with approximately $525 billion in unpaid principal. We also drive considerable recurring revenue from mortgage servicing. During the first quarter, we generated $366 million of cash revenue from our servicing book, which represents approximately $1.5 billion on an annualized basis. Net client retention remained over 90% in the first quarter, well above the industry average. Turning to our outlook for the second quarter, we expect adjusted revenue to be in the range of $850 million to $1 billion. We remain diligent in managing our expenses as we continue to monitor the broader environment with an eye towards profitability. On an absolute dollar basis, we expect Q2 expenses to be modestly higher than Q1, driven by an increase in variable expenses due to higher production and investments in marketing spend related to the launch of our Signature Credit Card and nationwide BUY+ campaign. We are monitoring these marketing investments closely, and we will adjust swiftly if they do not meet our expectations or if the housing market does not cooperate.  As always, our forward-looking guidance is based on our current outlook in visibility. Despite the continued uncertainty in the macro environment, we remain focused on serving our clients better and we are leading the way in bringing innovative products and solutions to market. We are well positioned in the current environment and will continue to execute on our strategy to deliver results and drive long-term growth.  With that, we're ready to turn it back over to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nRyan Nash: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.\nJay Farner: Hi, Ryan.\nRyan Nash: So Jay and Bill, you both referenced the success you're having in purchase. Can you maybe just talk about whether it's driving -- what's driving it, whether it's some of these newer programs? And can you maybe just talk about what you think this could mean for overall market share as we think about this next period of time here?\nJay Farner: Well, certainly. Yes, I think we touched on this a lot throughout our prepared remarks. To differentiate -- especially for us, direct to consumer in many ways, to differentiate we have to have experiences that allow our clients to come in the top of the funnel and remain with us as they search for homes. As Brian pointed out in his remarks, with inventory levels down, that lifecycle may be a bit longer. I think it's encouraging to see approval letters up, because that's telling us that that top of the funnel is growing the way that we want it to grow. And I want to pay compliments to our team, because I think when you look across the entire industry, it's hard to find a lender outside of Rocket that has a very unique marketing strategy with our BUY+, SELL+ campaign, combined with the technology, the rewards program, the new Signature Card, all of these things meant to contain and increase conversion. So as you can tell, our focus is very strong on making sure that we can be a leader in purchase. And again, very proud of the team and the work that they've done these last seven or eight months to roll out all these programs. Really, the foundation was Rocket Money, and that team there that allowed us to get going. So critically important for us. It's going to be important for all lenders in the coming years. And we're very, very focused on it. I'll let Bill make any additional comments.\nBill Emerson: He got it covered there, Jay I mean. There's been so much great work has been done inside of the organization, a lot of this stuff has just rolled out. And so there's a lot of learning that's happening and a lot of adjusting. And I think that will continue over the foreseeable months.\nRyan Nash: Got it. And maybe as a follow up, Brian, you made a reference to an eye on profitability. Do you see a near-term return to profitability? And what are some of the drivers? Is this more about volumes and revenues improving? Are you actually seeing capacity coming out that could help margins over time? Maybe if you could just flush out some of those comments you made? Thanks.\nBrian Brown: Yes, sure, Ryan. So looking at Q4 to Q1, we cut the operating loss in half. Margins have improved from Q4 to Q1 fairly substantially, gain on sale margins that is. And then we guided up revenue from Q1 levels to Q2 levels. Why did we guide up revenue, because of some of the comments that Jay mentioned that consumer demand is coming in very strong and we're very happy to see that. That's helping the value numbers. On the gain on sale margin numbers, to your point, yes, the price competition is lessening a bit. And we're starting to see that translate in the gain on sale numbers. So if you think about what we've done over the past quarters and of course you know this, but we've gone hard on the expense side as well, I think we're headed in exactly the right direction. We need a little cooperation from the housing inventory in the backdrop of the market, but I think we're doing everything right. And we're absolutely within striking distance.\nJay Farner: Yes. And the final thing that I don't want to have missed, our banking groups, our operations groups, the NPS scores we talked about are very meaningful to excel in purchase our clients and realtors have to have confidence that we're going to deliver an amazing client experience. It's what we've built the company on for 37 plus years. And to see those NPS scores with our retail clients at I think 75 and with realtors now north of 50, anything north of 50 is excellent, just kudos to our teams that are delivering that service.\nBill Emerson: Absolutely.\nRyan Nash: All right. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Kevin Barker with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nKevin Barker: Thank you. So with these new programs, particularly BUY+, SELL+ and you also -- you had the Inflation Buster come out late last year. It requires buyers to be motivated either by a relationship and trust or some type of monetary incentive. Now, obviously, Inflation Buster and the BUY+ seem like they provide that monetary incentive. But could you describe your expectations for why you think these are going to be successful in driving more purchase volume? And if you're going to be able to make up some of the monetary, partly subsidizing the loan on the other side via either higher margins or potentially higher revenue down the road by refinancing these newer customers? Thank you.\nJay Farner: Yes, good question here. I think Brian touched on the fact that margins were good in Q1 and we're feeling good about the revenue number we're projecting in Q2. We're in a very fortunate place that through our BUY+ and SELL+, not only do we have Rocket Mortgage, we've got Rocket Homes. We've got a title company. And so our ability to capture revenue through multiple areas of the transaction differs from our competitors. And so even if and in this case you pointed out, we're providing an incentive to clients to move forward. That BUY+ program and SELL+ program allows us to capture broader revenue across the entire transaction. And I think there are three elements if you're going to grow purchase right now. Element number one is, certainly you've got a good message that resonates with buyers. That's why we're out on the airwaves. Our marketing teams did a great job of putting out that message, so people are aware that we're here as a purchase setter. Number two, you've got to deliver a great client experience. We just touched on those NPS scores that we're delivering. Number three, you got to have an offer that's compelling. And right now, when you talk to clients, as rates have moved up, they're watching their buying power shrink, and nothing is making me more aware of that than we are cutting a check at the closing table. And so we're offering significant dollars back for our clients, thousands and thousands of dollars back, it's meaningful, it's getting their attention. And so once you have that type of message, my firm belief is that you will cut through -- you'll have awareness, you'll have engagement. Now the only question is, how do you stay engaged with that client till they find the home, because with inventory levels a bit low, we've got to keep that relationship going for three, four, five, six months, who knows? That's why we've made the investment in our home buying plan, in the credit card, in the rewards program. These are critical tools that allow us once we've had that client join our funnel allow us to have a right to keep interacting with that client till it's time to convert. And so seeing all of these elements come together is I think what gives us great confidence that we can be a very strong purchase lender here in the United States of America.\nKevin Barker: Okay. And then just a follow up on the expense guide. I realize you have marketing spend and then higher volumes. How much of the operating expense would you consider maybe transitory in nature due to investments that you're making, relative to what your core run rate would typically be, given all the expense costs that you've made over the last year? It would seem that you probably would continue to see a drift lower, particularly in the back half the year after unveiling some of these marketing spending that you talked about.\nBrian Brown: Yes, I think -- so Kevin, here's how I think about it. First of all, just because you mentioned it, we took $3 billion out of the cost structure last year, that was over 40% of the total cost. So it was not the fun work to do, but it was the important work to do. And you can clearly see that setting us up for success this year. The North Stars that we use to guide us on that front are revenue, share growth and profitability. It's that simple. And to break it down further how I think about it in terms of two categories, one is capacity. We clearly stay very close to the capacity, very close to the loan production. The good news is that's cooperating right now. So that makes us feel good about the expense side of the house on that side. And then, of course, the other, which you mentioned is the investment side. Here's the good news on that. A lot of these products are launched now. So we're getting real data and real data information. Before, it's a lot of monitoring the cost side and making sure we launch things on time and sticking to our milestones. Now we're actually getting to evaluate the return on those investments. And the returns have been better than we've expected in most cases. But to the extent they're not, we'll reprioritize and we'll reallocate those resources. And to the extent that doesn't work, we'll keep a close eye on them and we'll make changes if needed.\nJay Farner: The other thing I'll add is a lot of folks will talk about the dollars invested in technology, changing experience, those sorts of things. What I'm most proud of the team is actual execution delivery. We talked about the fact we were going to do these things. And here we are, again, seven, eight, nine months later and the rolls are out the door, our clients are experiencing them. And so as Brian talks about investments we're making, I think it's important to be able to tie that to actual delivery of product that's out in the wild.\nBrian Brown: Yes, Jay, the only other thing I'd add to that is anybody who's run a business knows rolling something out is step one, right? Then there's the constant monitoring, following up tweaking, and there's resources necessary to make sure that you refine it. So they're just giving you exactly what you want to get. And we have a lot of work still to go there.\nKevin Barker: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to [indiscernible] with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. Good evening, everyone. Could you talk about what investments and initiatives you have planned for the rest of '23, both for the core mortgage business and the Rocket Reward side of the house? I know you mentioned the marketing campaign. But could you go into a little bit more detail or shed some light on other initiatives?\nJay Farner: I think as Bill just touched on, step one was rolling all these initiatives out. Step two is the integration of these initiatives in all the appropriate places, understanding where we have to provide additional support marketing. As we built Quicken Loans and then Rocket over many, many years, once you get something out there, there's so many different adjustments you can make; tweaking of the dials, changing of the messaging. And we're just in the early stages of that. So there'll be a lot of effort pointed towards that. And Bill can touch on this as well. But we're always making investments in how the operations of the business occurs from our bankers and how they work with our clients as you roll out new products for the clients, that's got to get integrated into the banker process. So to really see success at a full level, it's a full integration from banking to operations to capital markets; learn, rinse, repeat. And so I think that's where you'll see a lot of our efforts as we continue forward in the year. Bill?\nBill Emerson: Yes, and I think that's right, Jay. And that's just the reality of how things work. We're constantly working on our internal platform systems and some of our mortgage operation technology to make that more effective. There's still lots of work that can be done to cut cycle time out of transactions. And so we continue to work out stuff, we always have stuff in the Q that we're thinking about. But the reality of life is some of that's still being baked. So we're excited about where we are, what we've rolled out, the initial indications, and we're always thinking about what's next and what's new.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Richard Shane with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nRichard Shane: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Bill, congratulations. Jay, I hope you miss us as much as we're going to miss you, but I suspect you probably won't.\nJay Farner: Thank you for that. I will miss you guys. That was fun.\nRichard Shane: Thank you. Look, one of the things that I would observe is it looks like the drag from repurchases, from loan repurchases seems to be abating as you sort of anniversary the larger volumes. Should we assume that there is convergence between the stated gain on sale, margin revenue and the actual revenue as we move through 2023?\nBrian Brown: Yes, Rick, I'll take a shot at it. We saw the biggest difference there in Q4. And that was really due to the rate environment. The number one thing that we fair value those repurchased assets on our balance sheet, and the note rate or the 10-year treasury rate at the end of that period goes into that fair value assumption. So for us, anything that ran through there was not because of necessarily an increase in the number of loans we're repurchasing, just a fair value adjustment at the end of the period. So I don't have a crystal ball and I can't predict where rates will be at any particular time, of course, but what I do know is the volume of repurchases is still in a very, very low level and something we're very comfortable with.\nRichard Shane: Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then just one housekeeping thing. I didn't see it in the press release, and we're waiting for the supplement. What was the UTB [ph] on the servicing book at the end of the quarter?\nBrian Brown: 550 billion-ish. It's in the -- Rick, I think it's in one of the bullets towards the end of the earnings release.\nRichard Shane: Okay, terrific. Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks. This is [indiscernible] on for James. I want to quickly touch on capital position, how you're thinking about the balance sheet, but more specifically, opportunities to deploy excess capital, strategic M&A, bolt-on acquisitions, anything in the pipeline that's particularly exciting?\nBrian Brown: Yes, so starting with your question on the balance sheet, very strong credit profile, very robust balance sheet, worth noting at least from a rating agency perspective, two to four notches above where anyone else in the mortgage space is rated. From a liquidity position, very solid, over $8 billion of liquidity in the organization, which includes over $3 billion of cash, so well capitalized in definitely puts us in a position to be opportunistic. There's no doubt about that. In terms of the M&A front, look, in the mortgage space, there's no shortage of inbounds. But the same thing we've said here many times, we'd have to ask ourselves what would we be buying? On the positive side, valuations have come down, but we're not interested in buying loan officers or shells with loan officers in it. That's not interesting to us. Of course, we could take a look at the technology. But in almost all cases, we find out that our technology is much more advanced than what we'd be buying. Some things that could be interesting could be MSR portfolios. And we're active in that space. We're not necessarily willing to pay any type of premium just through an M&A transaction rather than just buying in the open market. But the balance sheet and capital position of this company allows us to be opportunistic,\nJay Farner: I think what Brian points out is important. When you're thinking about purchasing an MSR, you've got to think about your cost to originate it. And that's what we spent the bulk of this phone call talking about over the course of many, many years, we became experts at producing a refinance transaction at a cost that was always more advantageous, almost in all cases than buying an MSR. Now you've heard us talk about that same investment in generating a purchase transaction. Whether it's 4.5 or 5 million purchase transactions out there, very few have found a way to market to consumers to drive that business. And so if you think about where you might put your dollars, as you keep cracking that code and you start seeing wins much like I think we saw with refinance over the years, a strong place we will look is leveraging those wins that we find and being able to generate our own growing MSRs through the origination of purchase transactions.\nBrian Brown: That's right.\nUnidentified Analyst: Perfect. Thank you. That's super helpful. And then I'll just ask one follow up on capacity. Interested in where you think the industry stands today. So obviously working through what inning we're in, headcount, of course, but general capacity as well, and where Rocket fits within that framework and perspective?\nJay Farner: Yes, I'll take the first shot and then Bill might have comments too. But look, we're all reading the headlines. Capacity is coming out of the system. There's no doubt about that. I look at it in a couple of different buckets. One is the banks, of course. Banks are absolutely exiting the space either trying to slow down or getting out completely. There's no doubt about that. When it comes to the retail lenders, the few direct to consumer lenders that are left in this space, they have a cost of acquisition problem. Right now, it's very expensive to acquire a purchase transaction, especially if you're doing it right at the time the clients found a property, which is why it's so important of all the things we launched, building relationships with a client much earlier in the client's lifecycle and keeping them here and keeping them incubated. And then the third bucket is brokers, of course. And for the brokers that have been in business a while, for the brokers that have a book of business, that have a strong local presence, that have done purchase business before, there'll be fine. There'll be great through this cycle and there'll be very successful. But for the brokers that may have entered the space more recently and had focused on refinance transactions, which didn't necessarily require relationships with realtors and a big presence in the local community, I think they'll struggle. So from my perspective, capacity is coming out, albeit maybe not as fast as we'd like it to, particularly on the loan officer front. But even on sale margins are a good indication of capacity. And they've been going up and the guide for Q2 says that we would expect them to go up as well.\nUnidentified Analyst: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Doug Harter with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nDoug Harter: Thanks. Sticking on the topic of kind of customer acquisition costs. When you think about the credit card, are you thinking about that as kind of generating new leads for the top of the funnel or are you thinking about that more of kind of keeping the existing customers engaged?\nJay Farner: Yes, it's both. And I'm glad you brought that up, because -- and Brian talks about this a lot. When you look at the traditional cost to acquire a client in the mortgage space, you're going to see thousands of dollars at this point in time for closed loan. When you think about what our cost to acquire someone's Rocket Money where the credit card is, it's far less. So it gives our marketing group a much wider opportunity to reach a broader audience at lower cost. Now that credit card does two things. If you're a first time homebuyer, it allows us to bring those clients in, they can build credit towards the closing of their mortgage, reduce the expenses, et cetera. But it also allows people in our servicing book to benefit from using the credit card. So we kind of think of it as a mechanism to acquire new clients, to incubate our lead flow and keep existing clients that are already in our book.\nDoug Harter: Great. Thank you, Jay.\nOperator: Okay. Next, we'll go to a Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Your line is open?\nDonald Fandetti: Hi. Good evening. Looks like you've got some pretty good momentum with your client engagement programs. Can you talk about how you're thinking about market share going forward?\nJay Farner: Well, I know that we don't typically specify specific market share. I can tell you the important thing that's happening in our entire organization is thinking about it separately by product, and to ensure that we are building ways to increase that market share. And you've heard us talk a lot about purchase, both first time homebuyers and repeat buyers. And so that's kind of our focus not getting caught in the broader market share. But in the areas where we're dialing in, do we see a path to grow that market share?\nBrian Brown: Yes, I think that's right, Jay. To me, it's about growing -- the market has shifted from heavy refinance to heavy purchase. So that's going to affect the overall market share. That's a mathematical problem. But where we focus is ensuring that we're growing purchase market share and ensuring that we're growing refinance market share individually, and we believe that's happening. When we think about how we measure market share internally, we look at a couple of different metrics. We, of course, take the industry forecast, the MBA and the Fannie's and Freddie's but as we all know, the difficulty with that is not only do they have different forecasts, they have different actual numbers too, which makes it hard to be very precise there. But we also look at the MBA application index and securitization data is a great way to get at market share too. It doesn't necessarily include all the mortgages, because banks will balance sheet loans, but it does include most of the mortgages. And when we look at those three data points, we believe we're gaining market share, both in purchase and refinance individually.\nDonald Fandetti: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Kevin Kaczmarek with Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.\nKevin Kaczmarek: Hi, guys. This is Kevin on for Ryan. Can you talk about how your purchase volumes break down between new home sales and existing home sales and how your market share within the new home portion has been trending recently and how might it look going forward? And I figure with the low inventory and people locked into lower rates, the new home market in some ways gets around some of that. So that's why we're asking.\nBrian Brown: Yes, it's growing in both. There's not probably a noteworthy difference in either, but I think you do make a good point. When we study the inventory levels, and I'm sure many of you have read the homebuilder reports recently, they're doing well because of the low levels of existing inventory. So that's pushing people more towards the new builds. And to your point, that can be actually a very helpful thing for us. So it is something that we focus on. There's not a big difference in both, but the outperformance has been driven by I would say all purchase categories at this point.\nJay Farner: It's always encouraging -- when we built for the Rocket experience years ago, it was for first time homebuyers who wanted to be able to control this transaction and do it anytime of the day or night on their phone. If you think about that experience, if you think about our BUY+, if you think about the credit card, all of these things engage or allow us to engage a first time homebuyer, which is important in a market like this because individuals who have purchased a home last few years are probably sitting in a situation which is a little harder to move up. And so someone who leads in first time homebuyer I think will have an advantage in continuing to grow their purchase market share.\nBrian Brown: That's right, Jay. First time homebuyer isn't exchanging a 3% no rate for a 6% no rate. So there is definitely a distinct advantage there.\nKevin Kaczmarek: Right, understood. And as a follow up, we saw the press release you guys put out at the start of the banking turmoil, but can you give us an update on incremental impacts you've seen so far regarding things like credit availability to borrowers, mortgage rate spreads, gain on sale margins, emerging market opportunities, or any other notable areas?\nJay Farner: Yes, the first thing that still holds true from when we put out the 8-K is we don't have any direct exposure to any of the banks that failed, or really any regional banks. Most of our banking partners are global, the big banks that you would, of course, recognize the brand names. So that's the first thing. The second thing is no, we haven't seen much impact at all. One of the things we're watching closely is due to the banking crisis, banks were already hesitant to be in the mortgage space and already pulling back from the mortgage space. So this is something we view more as an opportunity in terms of banks not participating in mortgage as much and potentially giving us an opportunity to take share.\nKevin Kaczmarek: And how does it impact the mortgage as a service offering and how you think about that going forward?\nJay Farner: Well, like we said, mortgage as a service is a service for banks to help banks get the cost structure of a mortgage and provide J.D. Power winning level experience to these banks to keep them in the game. But let us do the work for them. And it turns out to great unit economics, both for us and them. So the way I look at it is it should only increase that opportunity.\nKevin Kaczmarek: All right. Thank you for taking my question.\nOperator: And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks.\nJay Farner: Thank you, everybody. It's Jay Farner here. I appreciate you joining the call and always asking great questions. As this is my last call, I want to make sure I think Dan Gilbert, all of our team members, our clients, our shareholders. This has been an amazing experience for me the last 27 years. And it's because of everybody's passion, support, excitement for what we're doing here at the company, in the city of Detroit, and other places across the country. And as Dan always says, I firmly believe the best here at Rocket is yet to come. And we'll sign off. Have a good day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brian Brown",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, I'll cover the financial results for the first quarter of 2023. I'll also share our outlook for the second quarter, discuss what we're seeing in the current environment and walk through how our unique and innovative approach to client acquisition and engagement is positioning Rocket to lead the way in a purchase-heavy market. Rocket is executing well in an uncertain macro environment. In today's market, we're seeing strong client demand to purchase homes and we're entering the second quarter with a healthy approval letter pipeline. However, on the supply side, the market is still constrained by limited housing inventory.  To put this in perspective, March existing home sales came in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.4 million homes, well below the 20-year average of over 5.3 million existing home sales per year. Looking at it differently, there was 2.6 months of housing inventory available in March, which is less than half of what we would expect based on the 20-year average. Housing inventory is something we're watching closely as we enter the spring home buying season.  The challenging inventory levels and persistent affordability concerns that our clients are facing require unique solutions. Take the BUY+ and SELL+ campaign that we launched in early April. This program addresses affordability concerns by providing clients that use both Rocket Holmes and Rocket Mortgage, a discount on their mortgage. This is something that only Rocket can offer at scale through our integrated real estate and mortgage experience.  Also, because of our ability to capture the economics of the transaction from both the real estate side and the mortgage side, Rocket is uniquely positioned to provide consumers with meaningful savings on their closing costs. The low levels of inventory are also contributing to a much longer home buying lifecycle compared to historical periods.  While these dynamics present a challenge for most lenders because it provides clients with more chances to switch during the process, at Rocket we view it as an opportunity with programs such as Rocket Rewards, which incentivize clients with growing rewards as engagement increases, there is a distinct and measurable benefit to staying with Rocket throughout the process.  Moving on to the results, Rocket Companies reported a solid first quarter against a difficult market backdrop. Adjusted revenue came in at $882 million, above the high end of our guided range driven by strong client demand and solid execution. In the first quarter, we generated net rate locks of $19.5 billion, a 30% increase from the fourth quarter. Our gain on sale margin for the quarter was 239 basis points, 22 basis points higher than the fourth quarter.  Regarding profitability, operating losses in Q1 narrowed meaningfully relative to the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusted revenue increased by nearly $200 million quarter-over-quarter, while total expenses grew less than half that amount. As a result, Q1 adjusted EBITDA loss of $79 million improved significantly compared to a $204 million loss in Q4.  Adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter also showed relative improvement coming in at a loss of $0.06 per share. We continue to execute a disciplined approach to managing our expenses in light of current volume levels, and we remain focused on making the right long-term investments.  I'd like to take a moment and talk about the positive impact we expect from our recent launches. Our client engagement program, which includes Rocket Money, Rocket Rewards, Rocket Signature Card and home buying plan provides us with multiple avenues for client acquisition, better engagement levels and improved lead conversion.  As we've mentioned on prior calls, the largest direct and variable expense in a mortgage transaction is the cost to acquire. This cost can run in the thousands of dollars per client. And that's not even including the costs associated with potentially reacquiring at a different time or down the road for another transaction.  In contrast, Rocket Money's cost to acquire is less than $100. And we see significant opportunity to lower our overall blended CAC by expanding our acquisition channels, keeping clients in our ecosystem and providing a best-in-class experience. Since our acquisition, Rocket Money has played a meaningful role in expanding our client base. We reached 27.6 million Rocket Accounts in the quarter, representing an increase of more than 2 million sequentially, largely driven by Rocket Money.  Rocket Signature Card further diversifies our acquisition channels, attracting clients who have high intent to buy a home. The Signature Card also provides us with valuable insights that help us understand when our clients are ready to transact, thereby lifting conversion in the process.  I'd like to clarify that our intent with the Signature Card is not to compete with large credit card companies at scale. We launched our card to give our clients something of value, capturing them earlier in their purchase journey and getting stronger signals on home buying intent.  But beyond acquisition, we now have even more reasons to engage with our clients in more ways to deliver tangible value. Banking rewards points to save on closing costs or providing financial wellness and education to make them more confident homebuyers well before they are ready to transact. Along the way, we're able to gather data insights throughout the process, helping us to personalize the right offering at the right time, with indicators of home buying intent that are particularly valuable given the high client acquisition costs and the lengthy often complex nature of a purchase transaction.  As Jay mentioned, early signs of conversion lift are very encouraging. The Rocket Rewards test group is seeing more than 2x the conversion rate from lead to close compared to those who are not enrolled in the rewards program. We believe these higher conversion rates for Rocket Rewards applied to a larger client base could have a significant impact on our unit economics. When considering the multiple client engagement initiatives we have in place, we believe the impact can be even greater.  We believe these innovative methods of client acquisition, engagement and lead conversion will help drive our success in purchase and highlight our unique business model compared to other mortgage lending companies through superior unit economics, even higher retention rates and extended client lifetime value.  Turning to our balance sheet, Rocket's financial strength continues to be an important strategic advantage for us. We ended the first quarter with $3.3 billion of available cash and $6.7 billion of mortgage servicing rights. Together, these assets represent a total of $9.9 billion on our balance sheet.  Our $3.3 billion of available cash consists of $900 million of cash on the balance sheet and an additional $2.4 billion of corporate cash used to self fund loan originations. Total liquidity stood at approximately $8.1 billion as of March 31, including available cash plus undrawn lines of credit and our undrawn MSR lines.  As of March 31, our mortgage servicing portfolio included more than 2.5 million clients with approximately $525 billion in unpaid principal. We also drive considerable recurring revenue from mortgage servicing. During the first quarter, we generated $366 million of cash revenue from our servicing book, which represents approximately $1.5 billion on an annualized basis. Net client retention remained over 90% in the first quarter, well above the industry average. Turning to our outlook for the second quarter, we expect adjusted revenue to be in the range of $850 million to $1 billion. We remain diligent in managing our expenses as we continue to monitor the broader environment with an eye towards profitability. On an absolute dollar basis, we expect Q2 expenses to be modestly higher than Q1, driven by an increase in variable expenses due to higher production and investments in marketing spend related to the launch of our Signature Credit Card and nationwide BUY+ campaign. We are monitoring these marketing investments closely, and we will adjust swiftly if they do not meet our expectations or if the housing market does not cooperate.  As always, our forward-looking guidance is based on our current outlook in visibility. Despite the continued uncertainty in the macro environment, we remain focused on serving our clients better and we are leading the way in bringing innovative products and solutions to market. We are well positioned in the current environment and will continue to execute on our strategy to deliver results and drive long-term growth.  With that, we're ready to turn it back over to the operator for questions. Yes, sure, Ryan. So looking at Q4 to Q1, we cut the operating loss in half. Margins have improved from Q4 to Q1 fairly substantially, gain on sale margins that is. And then we guided up revenue from Q1 levels to Q2 levels. Why did we guide up revenue, because of some of the comments that Jay mentioned that consumer demand is coming in very strong and we're very happy to see that. That's helping the value numbers. On the gain on sale margin numbers, to your point, yes, the price competition is lessening a bit. And we're starting to see that translate in the gain on sale numbers. So if you think about what we've done over the past quarters and of course you know this, but we've gone hard on the expense side as well, I think we're headed in exactly the right direction. We need a little cooperation from the housing inventory in the backdrop of the market, but I think we're doing everything right. And we're absolutely within striking distance. Yes, I think -- so Kevin, here's how I think about it. First of all, just because you mentioned it, we took $3 billion out of the cost structure last year, that was over 40% of the total cost. So it was not the fun work to do, but it was the important work to do. And you can clearly see that setting us up for success this year. The North Stars that we use to guide us on that front are revenue, share growth and profitability. It's that simple. And to break it down further how I think about it in terms of two categories, one is capacity. We clearly stay very close to the capacity, very close to the loan production. The good news is that's cooperating right now. So that makes us feel good about the expense side of the house on that side. And then, of course, the other, which you mentioned is the investment side. Here's the good news on that. A lot of these products are launched now. So we're getting real data and real data information. Before, it's a lot of monitoring the cost side and making sure we launch things on time and sticking to our milestones. Now we're actually getting to evaluate the return on those investments. And the returns have been better than we've expected in most cases. But to the extent they're not, we'll reprioritize and we'll reallocate those resources. And to the extent that doesn't work, we'll keep a close eye on them and we'll make changes if needed. Yes, Jay, the only other thing I'd add to that is anybody who's run a business knows rolling something out is step one, right? Then there's the constant monitoring, following up tweaking, and there's resources necessary to make sure that you refine it. So they're just giving you exactly what you want to get. And we have a lot of work still to go there. Yes, Rick, I'll take a shot at it. We saw the biggest difference there in Q4. And that was really due to the rate environment. The number one thing that we fair value those repurchased assets on our balance sheet, and the note rate or the 10-year treasury rate at the end of that period goes into that fair value assumption. So for us, anything that ran through there was not because of necessarily an increase in the number of loans we're repurchasing, just a fair value adjustment at the end of the period. So I don't have a crystal ball and I can't predict where rates will be at any particular time, of course, but what I do know is the volume of repurchases is still in a very, very low level and something we're very comfortable with. 550 billion-ish. It's in the -- Rick, I think it's in one of the bullets towards the end of the earnings release. Yes, so starting with your question on the balance sheet, very strong credit profile, very robust balance sheet, worth noting at least from a rating agency perspective, two to four notches above where anyone else in the mortgage space is rated. From a liquidity position, very solid, over $8 billion of liquidity in the organization, which includes over $3 billion of cash, so well capitalized in definitely puts us in a position to be opportunistic. There's no doubt about that. In terms of the M&A front, look, in the mortgage space, there's no shortage of inbounds.

Some things that could be interesting could be MSR portfolios. And we're active in that space. We're not necessarily willing to pay any type of premium just through an M&A transaction rather than just buying in the open market. But the balance sheet and capital position of this company allows us to be opportunistic, That's right. Yes, I think that's right, Jay. To me, it's about growing -- the market has shifted from heavy refinance to heavy purchase. So that's going to affect the overall market share. That's a mathematical problem. But where we focus is ensuring that we're growing purchase market share and ensuring that we're growing refinance market share individually, and we believe that's happening.

It doesn't necessarily include all the mortgages, because banks will balance sheet loans, but it does include most of the mortgages.

            "name": "Jay Farner",
            "content": "Thanks, Sharon. Good afternoon and welcome to the Rocket Companies earnings call for the first quarter of 2023. I'm joined today by Bill Emerson, who will be stepping in as Rocket's interim CEO on June 1. Bill has been diving into the business over the last few months, and he'll be sharing some of his thoughts in just a moment.  I'd like to begin with some thoughts on the market. We're encouraged by the fact that consumer demand for homes is robust. And we're seeing a healthy purchase pipeline as we enter the spring home buying season. From March to April of this year, purchase approval letters are up 11% and are also trending much higher from March to April this year compared to the same timeframe last year.  We believe that the increases we're seeing in this very important metric is primarily attributable to the investments we've made in the client and real estate agent purchase experience and innovative consumer focused solutions, such as BUY+, which we'll talk more about in a few minutes. That said, we're still seeing challenges in home inventory levels, and existing home sales have declined to levels not seen since 2008. We will need home inventory levels to cooperate in order to have a successful home buying season.  Over the past several quarters, we've seen a consistent upward trend in our Net Promoter Score for both clients and real estate agents. In fact, in the first quarter of this year, our purchase NPS reached an all-time high of 75 for retail clients and 53 for real estate agents, meaning clients and agents highly recommend Rocket as a lender. And NPS score above 50 is generally considered excellent. So we're excited that the investments that we've made in technology and data, as well as our continuous process improvements have led to these high marks and the positive trend that we're experiencing.  With this backdrop, we reported a strong first quarter. Adjusted revenue came in at $882 million, above the high end of our guidance range. We reported an adjusted EBITDA loss of $79 million and an adjusted loss of $0.06 per diluted share, both metrics showing an improvement over the prior quarter. We've recently unveiled several important initiatives that help our clients in this uncertain time and lower barriers to transact.  In April, we introduced BUY+ and SELL+, a collaboration between Rocket Homes, our home search platform and real estate agent referral network business, and Rocket Mortgage. With BUY+, purchase clients can save thousands of dollars in upfront costs if they work with Rocket Homes partner real estate agents, and obtain financing with Rocket Mortgage.  With SELL+, sellers listing their homes for sale with Rocket Holmes verified partner agent will receive a rebate check for 1% of the sale price from Rocket Homes after closing. If a homeowner is buying and selling, they can use BUY+ and SELL+ to increase their savings. We also recently unveiled the Rocket Visa Signature Credit Card, the first credit card that makes home buying more accessible and homeownership easier through everyday spending.  With a Rocket Signature Card, our clients can earn 5% back, which can reduce closing costs by thousands of dollars, helping to address one of the most significant hurdles in purchasing a home. The Rocket Signature Card is designed to appeal to first-time homebuyers, as well as existing homeowners who are in the market to buy, and helps us reach them earlier on in the purchase lifecycle.  Along with Rocket Money, our credit card provides us with another way to reach our clients much earlier in the process and at a significantly lower client acquisition costs compared to traditional mortgage methods. What's even more meaningful is that the points earned through the Rocket Signature Card can be used in conjunction with our Rocket Rewards loyalty program. When we surveyed our clients, nearly 90% of them told us they would value a Rocket affiliated rewards program in a way that would promote a long-term relationship with our brand. Now with our loyalty program credit card, our clients can further accelerate their path to homeownership. Clients with loans already serviced by Rocket Mortgage have even more flexibility and can choose to use their points to reduce their unpaid principal balance, helping drive even higher retention and client lifetime value.  Rocket Rewards enrollment has continued to show impressive growth and the early results on Rocket Rewards have been very encouraging. With our test group seeing more than 2x the conversion rate from lead to close compared to those who are not enrolled in the rewards program. As of March 31, we grew the number of Rocket Accounts to 27.6 million, up more than 2 million from our prior quarter, driven largely by Rocket Money.  Rocket Accounts is an important metric, as it represents clients who have taken the action to create an account with us and with whom we may have visibility on credit worthiness, spending behavior, finances, home buying intent, and more. We believe that these clients are more open to transacting with Rocket.  Through our full end-to-end home buying ecosystem, we can help our clients at every step of the homeownership journey, from the financial planning and educational process well before they apply for a mortgage to searching for and ultimately the financing of their new home. With our client engagement program, which includes Rocket Money, Rocket Rewards, Rocket Signature Card, and the home buying plan, we now have multiple ways to acquire and engage our clients. This provides us with valuable data insights earlier in the process.  Indicators of home buying intent that are particularly valuable given the high client acquisition costs and the lengthy off to complex nature of a purchase transaction, helping us personalized the right offering at the right time. We believe this engagement will help grow our market share in purchase, as well as lower our client acquisition costs, meaningfully lift conversion from lead to close, increase retention, and extend client lifetime value. All these initiatives set Rocket up for a bright future.  This being my last earnings call, I'd like to thank the amazing team members that I've worked with for the past 27 years for their passion and commitment. Having worked alongside Bill now for many years, I'm certain there is no one more qualified to take the interim CEO role while the company searches for a permanent successor. Bill and I will continue to work together over the next month, helping to ensure a smooth transition.  With that I'll turn it over to Bill. Hi, Ryan. Well, certainly. Yes, I think we touched on this a lot throughout our prepared remarks. To differentiate -- especially for us, direct to consumer in many ways, to differentiate we have to have experiences that allow our clients to come in the top of the funnel and remain with us as they search for homes. As Brian pointed out in his remarks, with inventory levels down, that lifecycle may be a bit longer. I think it's encouraging to see approval letters up, because that's telling us that that top of the funnel is growing the way that we want it to grow. And I want to pay compliments to our team, because I think when you look across the entire industry, it's hard to find a lender outside of Rocket that has a very unique marketing strategy with our BUY+, SELL+ campaign, combined with the technology, the rewards program, the new Signature Card, all of these things meant to contain and increase conversion. So as you can tell, our focus is very strong on making sure that we can be a leader in purchase. And again, very proud of the team and the work that they've done these last seven or eight months to roll out all these programs. Really, the foundation was Rocket Money, and that team there that allowed us to get going. So critically important for us. It's going to be important for all lenders in the coming years. And we're very, very focused on it. I'll let Bill make any additional comments. Yes. And the final thing that I don't want to have missed, our banking groups, our operations groups, the NPS scores we talked about are very meaningful to excel in purchase our clients and realtors have to have confidence that we're going to deliver an amazing client experience. It's what we've built the company on for 37 plus years. And to see those NPS scores with our retail clients at I think 75 and with realtors now north of 50, anything north of 50 is excellent, just kudos to our teams that are delivering that service. Yes, good question here. I think Brian touched on the fact that margins were good in Q1 and we're feeling good about the revenue number we're projecting in Q2. We're in a very fortunate place that through our BUY+ and SELL+, not only do we have Rocket Mortgage, we've got Rocket Homes. We've got a title company. And so our ability to capture revenue through multiple areas of the transaction differs from our competitors. And so even if and in this case you pointed out, we're providing an incentive to clients to move forward. That BUY+ program and SELL+ program allows us to capture broader revenue across the entire transaction. And I think there are three elements if you're going to grow purchase right now. Element number one is, certainly you've got a good message that resonates with buyers. That's why we're out on the airwaves. Our marketing teams did a great job of putting out that message, so people are aware that we're here as a purchase setter. Number two, you've got to deliver a great client experience. We just touched on those NPS scores that we're delivering. Number three, you got to have an offer that's compelling. And right now, when you talk to clients, as rates have moved up, they're watching their buying power shrink, and nothing is making me more aware of that than we are cutting a check at the closing table. And so we're offering significant dollars back for our clients, thousands and thousands of dollars back, it's meaningful, it's getting their attention. And so once you have that type of message, my firm belief is that you will cut through -- you'll have awareness, you'll have engagement. Now the only question is, how do you stay engaged with that client till they find the home, because with inventory levels a bit low, we've got to keep that relationship going for three, four, five, six months, who knows? That's why we've made the investment in our home buying plan, in the credit card, in the rewards program. These are critical tools that allow us once we've had that client join our funnel allow us to have a right to keep interacting with that client till it's time to convert. And so seeing all of these elements come together is I think what gives us great confidence that we can be a very strong purchase lender here in the United States of America. The other thing I'll add is a lot of folks will talk about the dollars invested in technology, changing experience, those sorts of things. What I'm most proud of the team is actual execution delivery. We talked about the fact we were going to do these things. And here we are, again, seven, eight, nine months later and the rolls are out the door, our clients are experiencing them. And so as Brian talks about investments we're making, I think it's important to be able to tie that to actual delivery of product that's out in the wild. I think as Bill just touched on, step one was rolling all these initiatives out. Step two is the integration of these initiatives in all the appropriate places, understanding where we have to provide additional support marketing. As we built Quicken Loans and then Rocket over many, many years, once you get something out there, there's so many different adjustments you can make; tweaking of the dials, changing of the messaging. And we're just in the early stages of that. So there'll be a lot of effort pointed towards that. And Bill can touch on this as well. But we're always making investments in how the operations of the business occurs from our bankers and how they work with our clients as you roll out new products for the clients, that's got to get integrated into the banker process. So to really see success at a full level, it's a full integration from banking to operations to capital markets; learn, rinse, repeat. And so I think that's where you'll see a lot of our efforts as we continue forward in the year. Bill? Thank you for that. I will miss you guys. That was fun. I think what Brian points out is important. When you're thinking about purchasing an MSR, you've got to think about your cost to originate it. And that's what we spent the bulk of this phone call talking about over the course of many, many years, we became experts at producing a refinance transaction at a cost that was always more advantageous, almost in all cases than buying an MSR. Now you've heard us talk about that same investment in generating a purchase transaction. Whether it's 4.5 or 5 million purchase transactions out there, very few have found a way to market to consumers to drive that business. And so if you think about where you might put your dollars, as you keep cracking that code and you start seeing wins much like I think we saw with refinance over the years, a strong place we will look is leveraging those wins that we find and being able to generate our own growing MSRs through the origination of purchase transactions. Yes, I'll take the first shot and then Bill might have comments too. But look, we're all reading the headlines. Capacity is coming out of the system. There's no doubt about that. I look at it in a couple of different buckets. One is the banks, of course. Banks are absolutely exiting the space either trying to slow down or getting out completely. There's no doubt about that. When it comes to the retail lenders, the few direct to consumer lenders that are left in this space, they have a cost of acquisition problem. Right now, it's very expensive to acquire a purchase transaction, especially if you're doing it right at the time the clients found a property, which is why it's so important of all the things we launched, building relationships with a client much earlier in the client's lifecycle and keeping them here and keeping them incubated. And then the third bucket is brokers, of course. And for the brokers that have been in business a while, for the brokers that have a book of business, that have a strong local presence, that have done purchase business before, there'll be fine. There'll be great through this cycle and there'll be very successful. But for the brokers that may have entered the space more recently and had focused on refinance transactions, which didn't necessarily require relationships with realtors and a big presence in the local community, I think they'll struggle. So from my perspective, capacity is coming out, albeit maybe not as fast as we'd like it to, particularly on the loan officer front. But even on sale margins are a good indication of capacity. And they've been going up and the guide for Q2 says that we would expect them to go up as well. Yes, it's both. And I'm glad you brought that up, because -- and Brian talks about this a lot. When you look at the traditional cost to acquire a client in the mortgage space, you're going to see thousands of dollars at this point in time for closed loan. When you think about what our cost to acquire someone's Rocket Money where the credit card is, it's far less. So it gives our marketing group a much wider opportunity to reach a broader audience at lower cost. Now that credit card does two things. If you're a first time homebuyer, it allows us to bring those clients in, they can build credit towards the closing of their mortgage, reduce the expenses, et cetera. But it also allows people in our servicing book to benefit from using the credit card. So we kind of think of it as a mechanism to acquire new clients, to incubate our lead flow and keep existing clients that are already in our book. Well, I know that we don't typically specify specific market share. I can tell you the important thing that's happening in our entire organization is thinking about it separately by product, and to ensure that we are building ways to increase that market share. And you've heard us talk a lot about purchase, both first time homebuyers and repeat buyers. And so that's kind of our focus not getting caught in the broader market share. But in the areas where we're dialing in, do we see a path to grow that market share? It's always encouraging -- when we built for the Rocket experience years ago, it was for first time homebuyers who wanted to be able to control this transaction and do it anytime of the day or night on their phone. If you think about that experience, if you think about our BUY+, if you think about the credit card, all of these things engage or allow us to engage a first time homebuyer, which is important in a market like this because individuals who have purchased a home last few years are probably sitting in a situation which is a little harder to move up. And so someone who leads in first time homebuyer I think will have an advantage in continuing to grow their purchase market share. Yes, the first thing that still holds true from when we put out the 8-K is we don't have any direct exposure to any of the banks that failed, or really any regional banks. Most of our banking partners are global, the big banks that you would, of course, recognize the brand names. So that's the first thing. The second thing is no, we haven't seen much impact at all. One of the things we're watching closely is due to the banking crisis, banks were already hesitant to be in the mortgage space and already pulling back from the mortgage space. So this is something we view more as an opportunity in terms of banks not participating in mortgage as much and potentially giving us an opportunity to take share. Well, like we said, mortgage as a service is a service for banks to help banks get the cost structure of a mortgage and provide J.D. Power winning level experience to these banks to keep them in the game. But let us do the work for them. And it turns out to great unit economics, both for us and them. So the way I look at it is it should only increase that opportunity. Thank you, everybody. It's Jay Farner here. I appreciate you joining the call and always asking great questions. As this is my last call, I want to make sure I think Dan Gilbert, all of our team members, our clients, our shareholders. This has been an amazing experience for me the last 27 years. And it's because of everybody's passion, support, excitement for what we're doing here at the company, in the city of Detroit, and other places across the country. And as Dan always says, I firmly believe the best here at Rocket is yet to come. And we'll sign off. Have a good day."

            "content": "Thanks, Jay. Great to be here today. Over the past few months, I've had a chance to work closely with Jay and the phenomenal team members across our organization. I'm excited about Rocket's future as we continue to execute on our strategy. We have an intimate Rocket; innovation is rewarded, execution is worshipped. We laid important groundwork last year and now is the time for us to execute and continue to grow our purchase market share in a purchase heavy market. Rocket's opportunity is significant. The mortgage industry is large and fragmented, and the traditional mortgage experience is complex, frustrating and difficult for clients to navigate. With our end-to-end ecosystem, Rocket strives to make the home buying and home ownership experience simpler and more accessible for our clients. We are dedicated to delivering the best client service, leveraging our unique resources and the breadth of our offerings.  BUY+ and SELL+, our collaboration between Rocket Homes and Rocket Mortgage is a clear example of this. With Rocket Money, Rocket Card, Rocket Rewards and Rocket Loans, we have the unique ability to serve our clients in more moments throughout their lives, all while dramatically lowering our cost to acquire.  Rocket Loans, our personal loans business had their biggest month of origination in the company's history in March. And they are just getting started as they continue to build out their product agnostic lending platform, driven by AI decisioning that will help power financial transactions from everything ranging from personal loans to financing solar installations.  Our client-first lifetime value approach flips the script entirely on what a great experience is in mortgage and beyond. We are helping our clients prepare for home ownership and several other financial transactions, and we are providing tangible value and an experience that can only be realized through Rocket. We are taking a new innovative approach to client acquisition, retention and lifetime value that we believe will be a game changer for the industry and drive our continued growth in purchase.  Over time, we believe this will translate into substantial and sustainable growth in market share, revenue and profitability. I am excited to continue the work that Jay and our team members started and fulfill our mission to be the best at creating certainty in life's most complex moments, so that our clients can live their dreams.  With that, Brian will take us through the numbers. He got it covered there, Jay I mean. There's been so much great work has been done inside of the organization, a lot of this stuff has just rolled out. And so there's a lot of learning that's happening and a lot of adjusting. And I think that will continue over the foreseeable months. Absolutely. Yes, and I think that's right, Jay. And that's just the reality of how things work. We're constantly working on our internal platform systems and some of our mortgage operation technology to make that more effective. There's still lots of work that can be done to cut cycle time out of transactions. And so we continue to work out stuff, we always have stuff in the Q that we're thinking about. But the reality of life is some of that's still being baked. So we're excited about where we are, what we've rolled out, the initial indications, and we're always thinking about what's next and what's new."

And with that, I'll turn things over to Varun Krishna to get us started. Varun?\nVarun Krishna: Thanks, Sharon. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Rocket Companies third quarter 2024 earnings call. Two months ago, at our first ever Investor Day, we unveiled our vision for Rocket's future. Today, I want to kick off our call by emphasizing and extending one key theme, optimism. Optimism is the ability to see the glass as half full. Over the past few months, the market has thrown our industry almost every curveball imaginable, with inflation easing, the Fed cut rates for the first time in four years, but in an interesting twist, while the Fed lowered rates, mortgage rates did not follow suit. Instead, both the 10-year treasury yield and the 30-year fixed mortgage rate actually increased. In my experience, it's always important to take the long view and put things in perspective. Despite the housing market being challenging, we are seeing signs of rejuvenation. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate has declined from nearly 8% a year ago. This is helping improve purchase affordability and opening up refinancing opportunities to lower monthly payments. Plus, housing inventory has increased from 3.4 months to 4.3 months, showing a 26% improvement. We're still below the five-month to six-month range, that's considered a balanced, healthy market, but inventory is moving in the right direction. While affordability and inventory are certainly still challenges, the market is showing signs of improvement compared to last year and we're right there with consumers navigating their needs together and in service of our mission to help everyone home. Our mindset reflects the importance of optimism in a world that continues to be riddled with uncertainty. That is because home ownership is and always will be the cornerstone of the American dream. Every day, we make 30-year bets on clients who are betting on themselves. Our role in opening the door to that dream is what makes us proud to be Rocket. Let me take a minute to reflect on the results of the quarter. At Investor Day, we announced our bold 2027 market share goals to double our purchase market share from 4% to 8% and increase our refinance market share from 12% to 20%. This quarter was a solid step toward these goals. I am so pleased to share that we expanded both our purchase and refinance market share year-over-year in the third quarter. We delivered $1.323 billion in adjusted revenue, surpassing the high end of our guidance and accelerating growth compared to Q2. Net rate lock volume surged 43% year-over-year, driven by significant refinance activity alongside growth in purchase volume. Our adjusted EBITDA margins came in at 22%, 3x higher than Q3 of 2023. We also reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.08. These numbers are a direct result of one basic thing, execution. Our team members continuously refine every aspect of our sales and operational processes, marketing, and product technology to fight for every inch of progress. That execution excellence is built on decades of investment and toward a durable competitive advantage, which we call the Rocket Superstack. This is the key to the strong short-term results we're seeing today and is also the foundation for long-term value creation and growth. Our Superstack is comprised of four layers, a robust end-to-end ecosystem, multi-channel experiences we create for clients, team members and partners, proprietary AI-driven technology, and lastly our iconic brand. The integration of these four layers serves as the engine that drives growth, scale and efficiency. Let's dive into each layer and unpack a few highlights from the quarter. First up is the power of our unique ecosystem, a system that connects each step of the journey from finding and financing a home to servicing to title and closing and the journey beyond. At the very heart of our ecosystem lies our origination servicing flywheel. Once a client enters the flywheel, we provide them with outstanding origination and servicing experiences and we earn the privilege of becoming their lender for life. Last month, we announced a strategic sub servicing partnership with Annaly. This partnership allows us to expand our servicing portfolio in a capital efficient manner. We're excited to onboard these clients into the Rocket ecosystem this December and provide them with an amazing origination and servicing experience that sets Rocket apart. Our industry-leading 85% recapture rate speaks to the client experience that people love that keeps them coming back to Rocket establishing a long-term relationship. There's no additional acquisition costs for clients in our ecosystem, creating even more operating leverage. This very same ecosystem brings innovative mortgage products tailored to today's market to our clients, with home affordability top of mind; our affordable product suite is helping clients get a leg up or bringing the dream of homeownership closer. These products have struck a chord, making up a quarter of our purchase volume since the beginning of this year. Our recently launched Welcome Home Rate Break is a great example. We reduced rates by 2 points in the first year and 1 point in the second, providing meaningful affordability relief for homebuyers. Since its launch in late August, we've seen our ONE+ and Welcome Home Rate Break product groups grow by more than 20%. Now, on top of our ecosystem sits our experience layer, where we're breaking new ground and delivering delight to our clients. We have made tremendous strides this quarter in expanding our GenAI-powered chat functionality. Our generative and live chat is now fully integrated across all our digital platforms, handling everything from purchase, refinancing and servicing 24/7 whether clients are logged in or not. This round the clock access is key with 20% of our clients contacting us outside of regular business hours. We're seeing significant growth here as chat interactions with our bankers have more than doubled quarter-over-quarter. Beyond just the literal growth in the number of interactions, chat is driving real results. Every chat is a chance to deliver personalized insightful experiences that deepen client engagement, which in turn leads to higher conversion. Clients who use chat are converting 3x higher compared to those who don't from first interaction to credit poll. We often talk about letting technology do what it does best, freeing our team members to focus on what they do best helping our clients, responding with urgency when our clients need us most is the any to play. I can't think of a better example where this was put to the test than most recently during the hurricanes that hit the Southeast. While dealing with a devastating situation, I couldn't be prouder of our team's quick technology enabled response to support and be there for our clients. We tracked the storm paths in real-time. We activated our emergency playbook. We customized our digital tools before landfall. Self-service options like our website, AI-powered chat and IVR allowed nearly 70% of affected servicing clients to get immediate answers on credit suppression, late fee waivers, and forbearance, seamlessly connecting them to our team when they needed personal support. We also saw a significant three-fold increase in disaster inspection reports for affected counties compared to the weekly average in the months before. This process can often be delayed at the collateral underwriter review stage where workloads are already substantial. Quickly reviewing these reports is critical to getting our clients loans back on track. Thanks to automation efforts we put in place months ago, we cut review times by 71%, allowing us to push through this bottleneck and quickly provide next steps to help our clients move toward closing. Let's move to the third layer that powers our ecosystem and experience technology. The ability to leverage technology is crucial to scale, drive profitable growth, and adapt to market shifts. Let me share just two quick examples. In our business, constantly we're asking and answering complex questions like which loans are in the money in Wayne County, Michigan? Or is this loan compliant with regulations in Nevada? For many lenders, answering these questions takes intense research. It can take many hours or even days, involving multiple data analysts or engineers pulling data from various sources. This is just the industry norm, but not at Rocket. Rocket is changing the game with a new technology called Navigator, our internal AI-driven knowledge and workflow platform that puts answers to questions within reach in seconds. Navigator empowers our team members to create no code apps, experiment with AI securely, summarize documents, analyze sentiment and even role play scenarios. Navigator's AI automates complex queries, empowering more people to drive innovation on their own without involving support from a data analyst or engineer. With Navigators conversational AI interface, our team now has the answers they need at their fingertips. And the results are impressive. In just a few months, over 2,000 team members have logged more than 52,000 LLM interactions and they love it. Daily active users have been climbing steadily since launch, nearly doubling from August to October. By automating complex queries, Navigator is multiplying the number of innovators at Rocket by an order of magnitude. That is the power of AI in a nutshell. We've also continued to build out our proprietary AI-powered loan origination system, Rocket Logic. We recently expanded Synopsis to handle all inbound calls and the results have skyrocketed. In early November, we reached a major milestone, processing nearly 1 million calls in a single week. The power of processing these calls through AI results in transformative insights to our business. Each call provides semantic data that lets us extract names, sentiment, call purpose, pain points, and more. These tags create metadata that helps us strategically allocate resources, equip our bankers with valuable real-time insights, and address specific needs, ultimately driving higher conversion rates. With Synopsis, we have insight into a client's purchase journey, whether they have a home in mind, have submitted an offer or had it accepted. This allows us to connect high intent clients with the right bankers, creating more meaningful interactions, and driving purchase conversion. The last layer of the stack is the icing on the cake our iconic brand. The Rocket brand is one of our greatest superpowers. While Rocket is already an admired brand, this coming year, we will significantly amplify its identity, purpose, and impact in homeownership. Over the past few months, we've zeroed in on the growth audiences that are set to reshape the home buying landscape. Female heads of households, Hispanics, and aging first time buyers, just to name a few. By 2030, over half of first time homebuyers will be Hispanic. Meanwhile, the economic influence of women will continue to surge. With women managing two-thirds of household wealth, our brand will evolve to meet these clients exactly where they are. In February of 2025, we will unveil the new Rocket brand identity. The transformation began with our recent acquisition of rocket.com a site that will unify the homeownership experience across home search and mortgage. In the coming months, we will share a greater ambition with the country and establish a brand that represents the ability for our clients to own the elusive American dream once more. Let me quickly summarize, each layer of our Superstack accelerates our execution and propels us forward. The stack is a durable advantage that empowers us to set bold goals and establishes clarity on how we will achieve them. Each layer is unique to Rocket and combines to create a whole that is greater than the sum of parts. What truly excites me isn't just the, what of our strategy, but the how and most importantly, the who. We've built a world class leadership team, bringing in key executives with deep expertise in AI and technology to work hand in hand with the best homeownership, mortgage and finance leadership team in the industry. Together, we are poised to drive needed change in modernization in the industry and I am so proud to work alongside them every single day. I'm going to close where I started. Our mission is to help everyone home, a mission that reflects the optimism we have toward our future growth, forecast for the mortgage origination market indicate a 20 to 30% year-over-year growth in 2025 that gets us excited and creates an opportunity to capture share. And no matter how the market evolves in the coming years, our $5 trillion market opportunity reflects our potential and our ambition. We firmly believe Rocket is well-positioned to drive disruption and transform the industry to benefit millions of homeowners. Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\nBrian Brown: Thank you, Varun, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start by setting the stage and framing how we're responding to market realities and seizing opportunities as they come and why we are uniquely positioned to capture a bigger slice of the homeownership market. It's been an interesting couple of months for the industry. For most of the third quarter, 30-year fixed mortgage rates have trended lower from nearly 7% in July to touching 6% during a two-week window mid-September. However, stronger than expected economic indicators, caused the 10-year yield in 30-year fixed mortgage rates to quickly jump back to 7%. In short, the market's been anything but predictable. Since interest rates are impossible to predict with any certainty, the key is scaling up quickly to capture the market opportunity when it presents itself. The third quarter was a perfect example of this. When rates briefly dipped to near 6%, clients who had financed homes in the past two years jumped at the chance to lower their payments. We also saw a lift in our purchase pipeline as affordability improved, reaching our highest daily production volumes in the past 24 months during that brief window. It was a game on moment and we scaled up quickly to capture this volume surge. Every layer of our Rocket Superstack, our ecosystem experience, technology, and brand played a role in powering execution across the board. We captured more top of funnel leads through all of our channels, including direct-to-consumer, broker, partnerships and of course, our service clients. We launched innovative mortgage products like our Welcome Home Rate Break promotion to meet the moment, supercharged our bankers with tools to serve more clients, and boosted conversion throughout the funnel. Altogether, this meant we captured and converted more leads with speed and scale. Without adding headcount or increasing fixed costs, we flexed up our capacity seamlessly through our technology platform. That's the power of what we're building at Rocket. When these windows of opportunity open, we're ready to act. This lightning fast execution is unique to us and hard for others in the industry to replicate. To take advantage of the brief 6% rate opportunity in the quarter, most mortgage companies would have needed to hire train licensed loan officers and underwriters months in advance. Relying on human capital to drive capacity likely means missing the opportunity entirely. Equally important to seizing the market opportunity is staying resilient when the market contracts. Thanks to our tech platform, we can flex our capacity up or down without the whiplash of hiring and layoffs typical in traditional mortgage models. No matter what the market throws at us, we stay focused on our goal to capture profitable market share in any environment. When we zoom out, as Varun shared, we see reasons for optimism. Compared to a year ago, the 30-year fixed rate has trended lower. Housing inventory measured in months of supply has increased by nearly 30%. Active home listings have grown for 12 consecutive months, and the share of homes sold above the listing price is down 10% year-over-year, signaling a cooling in the competitive bidding for homes. While there's still affordability challenges, these are promising signs and we anticipate even more momentum as we head into the New Year. Now with that backdrop, I'll take you through our strong Q3 financial performance, talk more about how AI is unlocking value for our business, and the critical role that our origination servicing flywheel plays in fueling our financial success. I'll also touch on our new investment grade credit rating, and I'll wrap up with our outlook for the fourth quarter. Let's jump in. If I had to sum up this quarter in one phrase, it's lights out execution. We grew purchase and refinance market share, revenue, and profitability on a year-over-year basis. Adjusted revenue came in at $1.323 billion above the high end of our guidance range. This represents a 32% increase from the third quarter of last year and our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. We generated $30 billion in net rate lock volume, marking a 43% increase year-over-year in our highest volume since the first quarter of 2022. This year-over-year growth included double-digit increases in both purchase and refinance. Our home equity product posted another record high. Gain on sale margin held steady at 278 basis points, roughly flat with the same period last year. From a channel perspective, our direct-to-consumer sold loan gain on sale margins have climbed to over 400 basis points, while our partner network margins have increased to roughly 150 basis points. Our continued focus on driving top-line growth, operational leverage, and efficiency combined to make the third quarter our most profitable quarter in two years. Adjusted EBITDA was $286 million, representing a margin of 22%. We reported adjusted net income of $166 million and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.08. When we talk about profitability, it's driven not only by our top-line growth, but also by creating operating leverage powered by our investment in technology. Our scalable tech platform is what empowers us to navigate dynamic markets with agility. From my perspective, the most powerful benefit of AI is the boost it gives to operational efficiency and productivity. Simply put, it's about achieving more with the same resources. The increase we're seeing in team member productivity translates directly into greater capacity. We unlock this capacity through technology, while others in the industry try to grow it by adding headcount, which is inefficient and has a long runway. And when the market contracts, you're left with excess capacity and inflated costs. Today, we have the capacity to support $150 billion in origination volume without adding a single dollar of fixed costs. We proved that this quarter. Not only did we handle more volume, net rate lock volume was up 43% percent but we did so with 7% fewer production team members year-over-year. Our AI tools are driving these gains from automating income verification and collateral review to enabling multiple client chats and insights that boost conversion. Rocket Logic, our proprietary loan origination system is driving massive efficiency improvements. With recent updates, we're saving over 800,000 team member hours annually, a 14% increase from just two months ago, resulting in more than $30 million in annual savings. But it's more than just cost savings. AI is giving us greater speed, accuracy, and personalization, boosting conversion rates, and fueling growth. Operational efficiency is a top priority for us and we're constantly evolving to keep ourselves lean, agile, and competitive. Another key part of our business model is our origination servicing flywheel. As we've discussed on previous calls, and at Investor Day, MSRs are an attractive way to acquire future origination clients. Together, our origination and servicing businesses form a powerful homeownership flywheel that allows us to source new clients and organically create new MSRs while positioning us to help clients with future transactions, be it their next purchase, refinance or even home equity loan. Earning repeat business is what we refer to as our recapture rate. Our goal is to provide a client experience that is so exceptional that we become the client's go to for all future home financing needs. Our industry-leading 85% recapture rate is a testament to the client experience. When you excel at something, you earn the opportunity to extend that value beyond your own ecosystem and offer it to your partners; our high recapture rate is a win-win for both Rocket and our partners. It is a powerful advantage for MSR owners without in-house origination capabilities as it offsets the prepayment risk inherent to owning MSRs. This also makes cash flows more predictable for our partners, reducing the need for complex, costly hedging strategies. In October, we proudly announced a partnership to subservice a portion of Annaly's MSR portfolio. This strategic subservicing partnership complements our strategy of growing servicing through organic new originations as well as bulk acquisitions. Across bulk acquisitions and subservicing, year-to-date we've acquired or committed to add over $70 billion of unpaid principal balance to our service portfolio. That's a 15% increase compared to the 2023 year-end balance. This growth represents 220,000 new clients who represent prime candidates for future purchases, home equity loans and rate and term refinances. As of September 30, our mortgage servicing portfolio included 2.6 million loans with $546 billion of unpaid principal balance. In the quarter, we generated $374 million of cash revenue from our servicing book, which represents approximately $1.5 billion on an annualized basis. We ended the third quarter with $3 billion of available cash and $6.8 billion of mortgage servicing rights. Together, these assets represent a total of $9.8 billion of value on the balance sheet. Our $3 billion of available cash consisted of $1.2 billion of cash on the balance sheet and an additional $1.8 billion of corporate cash used to self-fund loan originations. And as of September 30, total liquidity stood at approximately $8.3 billion including available cash plus undrawn lines of credit. As a testament to our sustained financial strength, I'm proud to share that Fitch recently upgraded Rocket Mortgage to investment grade. This makes Rocket Mortgage the first non-bank mortgage company to receive investment grade status from one of the three big rating agencies in almost two decades. This achievement highlights our strong balance sheet and financial profile and paves the way to access a wider range of funding sources at a much more favorable cost of funds. This added flexibility positions us to continue to allocate capital in service of our growth strategy. Turning to our fourth quarter outlook. Based on typical seasonality, we anticipate the mortgage market in the fourth quarter to be smaller than the third quarter. We expect adjusted revenue to be in the range of $1.50 billion to $1.200 billion. The mid-point of this range represents 27% year-over-year growth and reflects continued market share gains. We expect expenses in the fourth quarter to be in line with the third quarter. The fourth quarter includes marketing spend related to our brand restage and the annual renewal of banker licenses. As always, our forward-looking guidance is based on our current outlook and visibility. As we look ahead, we're excited and optimistic about what's to come. Over the years, I've seen us navigate a wide range of markets, consistently proving our ability to thrive through both highs and lows. What excites me most is that Rocket is now better positioned than ever before. This optimism isn't just mine; it's shared across our entire organization. Rocket has what it takes to disrupt, capture, and grow at scale in an industry where only the strongest thrive. We're making bold investments, setting ambitious goals, and accelerating execution, all with a clear focus on creating long-term value for our shareholders. With that, we're ready to turn it back over to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of Jeff Adelson from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJeff Adelson: Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe Brian, you could start with the drivers behind the revenue outlook for the fourth quarter. It looks like you're looking for roughly a 10% to 20% decline in the range there sequentially. Can you just break out maybe what you're seeing on volume versus gain on sale margin there or what other assumptions are sort of embedded in that guide? Thanks.\nVarun Krishna: Jeff, thanks for your question. Let me start and then I'll ask Brian to chime in on the gain on sale margins. And I'd start by just saying that we feel very good about our guide and there's a few things that I think are important to just keep in mind when it comes to Q4, you typically expect the fourth quarter to be a little bit smaller than Q3. And when you really think about why that is, primarily it's due to just home buying slowing down a little bit post Labor Day. You've got kids going back to school, you've got the holiday season. So mortgage financing is just not typically as top of mind. The second thing that I would share is you've seen interest rates tick up a little bit and that has obviously an impact on mortgage applications. And so these two factors can compound and just have an effect on the quarter. But at the end of the day, the market size is going to be whatever it is; it's still a big market. And our big focus is really just on growing our share with great execution. And when you just put that together, we definitely believe, we have a strong and confident guide. And I'll also just callout that the guide is 27% higher year-over-year for this quarter. And that guide reflects obviously our continued focus on market share gains and just our resilience to be able to grow in any market. And then let me ask Brian to comment further.\nBrian Brown: Sure. Thanks, Varun. Yes, I'll touch on the gain on sale margin piece. We do expect a slight expansion in gain on sale margin in Q4 compared to the third quarter. There's a little bit of conservatism built in there and that's just typically because we see some competitors do some pricing plays around the holidays. If you think about it and you're in their shoes, they have about the same amount of capacity either way. And this volume ticks down to Varun's point every once in a while, we see some pricing pressure there. So we've considered that in the guide. And if you kind of just zoom out, we've said for a long time now that we expect gain on sale margins to expand. That doesn't happen in an exactly linear basis, but we are getting back to levels, particularly on a channel. If I look at direct-to-consumer and partner individually that are really close to the historical healthy levels that we've seen pre-pandemic.\nJeff Adelson: And just on the volume assumption for the quarter, are you maybe just sort of embedding that the level of refi or just the current level of interest rates holds for the rest of the quarter? I know the app index for refi is down about 50% and total is down about 35% since quarter end last quarter. So just curious, are you assuming things maybe get a little bit better or just hold where they are right now?\nBrian Brown: Yes. I mean, Jeff, if we think about what we do when we set the guide, we obviously take into consideration all the information we have up to this point in the quarter. There's no question about that. It has been a volatile start to the quarter. To Varun's comments, rates have sort of moved in the opposite direction. So all of that is baked in the MBA applications and we look at that, we look at optimal blue. But the most important thing, if I were to leave you with a takeaway is, we truly believe this guide is taking share in the fourth quarter.\nJeff Adelson: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nRyan Nash: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. So maybe as we look ahead, industry forecasts are obviously calling for a nice pickup next year in originations, call it up to 30% and so I wanted to drill in a little bit on your expectations into 2025, obviously I'm sure things are fluid given how rates are moving around, but maybe just curious how you think about the size of the market, how much progress you can make on your market share goals? And then, just given your comments about the $150 billion and not needing to any fixed cost, how do you think about the relationship between revenue and cost growth in an improving mortgage market? Thanks.\nVarun Krishna: Thanks for the question, Ryan. I'd start by saying that the mortgage market obviously is not easy to predict. But in general, when you look at multiple factors, our outlook is optimistic. And there's a few factors that I'll just comment on, then I'll ask Brian to jump in as well. And I think the first thing to start with obviously is the rate environment. And there's a multitude of things that go into that, obviously things like an unemployment, CPI, consumer confidence, and in general, those things signal economic health. But the reality is inflation is still a part of the system. And until it's clear that it's working its way out of the system, you can expect that there's going to be a little bit of pressure on the 10-year treasury and then correspondingly the 30-year fixed rate mortgage. The next thing we look at is the housing market. Obviously, the housing market is a big part of the GDP. And the good thing there is that we're seeing definitely some signs of rejuvenation. You've got more inventory. You've got more homes that are selling at or below list. You've got equity at an all-time high. And when you look at housing inventory, we went from 3.4 months to 4.3 months. The number of homes listed for sale, that's up 29%. Affordability is up 5%. So some really good things happening there that gives us confidence in 2025. And then, we look at the size of the market. To your point, good things happening there. The forecasts are expecting that the market will be up over $2 trillion, that's up 28% compared to this past year. And that's still a huge market, right? And so regardless of conditions, there's plenty of share up for grabs. And then, what I would also say is the most important thing we really look at is just our execution, our ability to execute in any market. And that's something that we feel tremendously confident in. And a big part of that is our Superstack and what we believe is a tailwind to be able to execute against our Superstack relative to competitors. And so putting all that together, that gives us a lot of optimism for 2025, being better than 2024. And we know that 2024 was certainly better than 2023. And that's kind of how we think about our outlook. And then on the expense side, I'll ask Brian to jump in.\nBrian Brown: Yes, sure. Thanks, Ryan, for the question. I mean, when it comes to operating leverage, I think the first starting point is think about what we've done this year. To Varun's point, I do think 2024 will be a bit better than 2023. But I still think if you look back, we're five years ahead and you look back at 2024, I still think it's going to be looked at as a pretty down market in the big scheme of things. We'll see how the fourth quarter shakes out. So all that being said, in every single quarter, this year we printed double-digit EBITDA margins. If I take the kind of year-to-date, three quarters in margin, that's about 20%. And we've done the good work on the cost side over the past couple of years. We've talked a lot about that. But what I'm most proud of is the expansion in EBITDA margins is really through top-line growth. It's been taking share and doing the things that we said we'd do. So to Varun's point, if you look ahead to 2025, and you believe that it's going to be healthier, which we do than 2024, by 20% to 30% a $2 trillion, market is a really healthy market. So you believe in some expansion there. And then of course, our share gain goals that we shared at Investor Day are exactly what we're seeking to achieve. The third quarter is another example of that. The guide in the fourth quarter keeps us right on track to achieving those share gain. So if I say, hey, the EBITDA margins this year in 2024 in a pretty tough market were 20%. A little bit of help from the market and taking share gets us very excited about the opportunity to increase operating leverage next year.\nRyan Nash: Got it. Maybe as a follow-up, just thinking about opportunities, Brian, you talked about $70 billion of bulk MSR and flow year-to-date. Maybe just talk as you look ahead to 2025, what do you think the bulk purchase market for MSRs look like? And maybe just talk about how much more capacity you have and what is the appetite to continue to add in this area of the business? Thank you.\nBrian Brown: Yes. Thanks, Ryan. So I'll start here. Varun you may want to add in, but it's definitely an area that we're very excited about. When we talked about our capital waterfall and we talked about being interested in deploying capital MSRs still remain right at the top. It's right in our bread and butter. You mentioned the $70 billion. One of the things I'm most excited about and you guys have all seen the news. We're very proud of this Annaly deal. Annaly is a world class asset manager and in our business this flywheel effect that we have been driving for decades now is really impressive. 85% recapture rates, we're collecting the servicing cash flows very efficiently. But when you really think about the revenue opportunity of the next loan compared to the cash flows you're collecting, it's 20x that. So I expect us to continue to double down there on those opportunities, both from the bulk acquisition market. But I think the subservicing aspect is also very interesting to us because if you were in a seat where you didn't have an in-house origination capability, but you were a really good asset manager, protecting those cash flows has to be your number one priority. And if you're thinking about choosing between subservicers, you have one sitting here that has a J.D. Power multiple year winning experience and does it really good. And then you also have something that I don't think others can offer, which is this recapture rate. And recapture rate is the thing that allows an asset manager to protect against CPR or protect against prepayment risk. So I expect it to be a big part of our strategy going into 2025.\nVarun Krishna: I would just add that this example with MSRs and extensibility is just showcasing the power of the platform. And it's just something that really illustrates in a cool way how we scale beyond our four walls because we've earned the right to take these capabilities to benefit others like Annaly. You'll also see us doing the same thing with integrating our technology as a platform to serve as the mortgage platform for banks. The same platform is being extended to create value for brokers via TPO. And then on top of that, as Brian talked about, these recapture capabilities are only going to get better with investments in technology, AI, insights, notifications, CRM capabilities, mobile, data-driven personalization. And as we invest in our platform, each of the parties that we extend the capabilities to become beneficiaries of that innovation. And so really the power of that platform really lies in its extensibility. And the idea that you can write something once you can run it anywhere, benefit multiple parties is something that we're very excited about.\nRyan Nash: Thanks for the color guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMark DeVries: Yes. Thanks. Brian, touched on this at a high level, but was hoping to get a little more detail on how your rate locks moved during the period in the quarter when mortgage rates were down closer to 6%, both purchase and refi? And how they moved as rates headed back up? And also, any context around kind of how gain on sale margins compared in the busier period versus slower periods.\nBrian Brown: Yes. Thanks Mark. Appreciate the question. So I think there was a two-week window in the month of September and I think that's what you're referring to where mortgage rates came down to the low-6s. And I think it's such a good case study into our strategy at work. There were two really notable things. One, first is when rates get down into the low-6s, it proved that we are off to the races. You have about two years of mortgage production north of that. So there's definitely a bunch of consumers that can benefit from a rate and term refinance. And we saw that. So that's the first thing to note is that your -- that's your sort of Mendoza line, there is you get into those low-6s and it's -- you're off to the races. But the second thing is, if you think about how to capture that opportunity that gives us a bunch of proof points into what we're building and how impactful it is. Because in this case, you had a very, very short window with very high intent consumers and a ton of consumer demand. So the ability to scale up very quickly and capture that is exactly what differentiates us between us and our competitors. If you think about it, it's not just about being able to handle it from a processing, underwriting and closing perspective. But obviously that's very important because the client coming in with high demand and a client coming in with low demand expects the same level of service, the same closing time. So that is important. But it's also just about taking that demand and effectively allocating it to your bankers and keeping your bankers very, very efficient and productive. Because the more clients they can interact with and engage with during that very short window to take advantage of it, the better off the client's going to be because they're going to be saving money and also the better off we are because we're going to capture more share during that period. So it was actually very interesting. Of course, we didn't plan on it. It was sort of leading up to the Fed meeting. And we know what happened after that. The Fed cut 50 basis points and then rates went up. But it did prove to us that one; there are a ton of consumers in the money at that rate. And the last thing I'll sort of leave you with there, Mark is, I think just the change in the consumer is interesting because if the pandemic taught us one thing, there were clients that refinanced multiple times over a couple year period. So today, fast-forward, when consumers are getting a mortgage, they're truly in the mindset of I'm not going to have, I may have this house for a long time, but I'm not going to have this rate for a long time. And so the interesting part about it is during that couple of week window, there was a lot of headlines around the 10-year treasury and how mortgage rates were moving. And we got a ton of inbounds from our clients, both of course from our service clients, which you'd expect, but just from clients that had mortgages from other companies, because the propensity for clients to transact now and their sensitivity to rates I would argue is at an all-time high.\nVarun Krishna: The only thing I would just add is that you asked a little bit about capacity, Mark, and this is why we're so obsessed with AI and the investments that we've made in Rocket Logic, which is our proprietary LOS is driving big efficiency gains. We're on track to save our team members 800,000 hours annually. That's up 14% in just two months. So -- and it's almost $30 million in savings. And we're achieving that while keeping obviously our fixed costs roughly the same. And so just the reason we're obsessed with AI is because when you think about all the bread and butter aspects of our business, analyzing client interactions, automating underwriting, applying models to capital market infrastructure, automating document processing, credit modeling, appraisal reviews, these are all the capabilities that make the mortgage business work. And they're all benefiting from the implementation of AI. And so just continuing to invest in that, I mean this is why we've spent upwards of $0.5 billion over the past five years on this investment. And we've made progress. We will continue to do so and we think there's significantly more gains to be had in the future as well.\nMark DeVries: Got it. Thank you.\nBrian Brown: Thanks, Mark.\nOperator: Your next question comes from a line of Derek Sommers from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nDerek Sommers: Hi, good afternoon, everyone. I was wondering if you could share any incremental detail on the Annaly partnership, maybe portfolio characteristics or how the recapture economic share is going to work.\nBrian Brown: Yes. Thanks for the question, Derek. We don't disclose obviously the economics of our partnerships, but I think it's safe to say, when you look at the things that Annaly is good at being a great world class asset manager, protecting against prepayments is very important to us and that's where we come in. So clearly there's a subservicing agreement, as you'd expect. We hope we do that very efficiently if you just look at our own servicing. But I think the more interesting part about this deal is really the recapture opportunities and we think that's the superpower that we can offer. So we're happy to do that for Annaly. It truly makes a win-win with the partnerships. And if you think about it, there's economics on the subservicing side and then of course, there's economics on the recapture side. So it's really bringing two great firms together and sort of solving our challenge of hey, we need more servicing and it's a great capital light way to do it. And their challenge of hey, we have a lot of servicing but we have to protect against it. So it's truly a win-win.\nDerek Sommers: Got it. Thank you. And then just to change gears for a second, on second lien products, what kind of behavior are you seeing with the consumer there? Are you viewing this product as potentially interest rate agnostic?\nBrian Brown: I'll start and then Varun you want to add too. Yes, I think there's a lot of room to run in that product. There's no question about it. If you just kind of study the note rates of all the mortgages outstanding, there is definitely a chunk that's north of 6 and as we just kind of touched on is available for rate and term refinance with just a little bit of rate movement. But of course, there's another big chunk that's, 3%, 3.5% out there, and likely will remain out there for quite some time unless the homeowners is planning on moving. So if you think about it for them, the home equity product is a great product, it's going to make a lot of sense for a long time. I do think we saw in that couple week period during the quarter where rate and term refinances become back in favor and even to some extent cash out can start making more sense as rates start touching 6%. So -- and again, we're sort of happy to do that product for a client where it makes sense as well. But generally speaking, we think the client makes sense for a lot of consumers out there, particularly those consumers that are sitting on those very low rates. And by the way, the thing we talk about a lot internally is by layering on that second makes a ton of sense for the client, but it does bring up the weighted average note rate of the two loans. And then if and when rates do move a little bit, you have an interesting refinance opportunity in terms of the consolidation of those two liens.\nVarun Krishna: Yes. I would just add that in general, our approach is to innovate and meet our clients where they are. And so if we see a market opportunity, we will build products and services to meet our clients there. And so there's room to grow there. But this is an example of where we just really focus on delivering value to our clients. And then the other thing I would also call out is that it's important that we build products not just for our existing client base, but also for our new client base. What we've seen is for products like this, this actually attracts clients to the Rocket brand and to the Rocket franchise. And so by bringing them in, we can then offer them additional products and services that allow us to become their lender for life and that's a really great thing about this product offering.\nDerek Sommers: Got it. Thank you for taking my question.\nOperator: And your final question comes from a line of Doug Harter from UBS. Your line is open.\nDoug Harter: Thanks. Just hoping we could talk about expenses and just take it from a different angle. Given the capacity you said of about $150 billion, is there opportunity given the outlook for volumes to take out fixed costs, even if that means, that that capacity comes down somewhat?\nBrian Brown: Hey, thanks for the question, Doug. I mean, the way I'd answer that is our primary focus is capturing share and growing into the market. We just talked about our views on 2025 and admittedly Q4 has been a bit more volatile than anyone would like, but still very bullish on the 2025 outlook being higher. So right now our focus is being able to continue to capture share, grow into a larger market and do it with a relatively flat fixed cost base. And what that does is it really just increases operating leverage. Even if I look at just the numbers from Q2 to Q3, I think Q2 or, excuse me, Q3 expenses were up mid-3% from Q2. But if I just look at on a rate lock basis, volume was up 20%. So you can see us doing exactly what we said we'd do in terms of building that operating leverage. Of course, it provides option value. There's no question for different markets. But our goal in life here is to avoid the traditional yo-yo effect of the mortgage market. And if you think about how most people grow capacity, they do it through hiring. And we will hire some people too. We have the best team members in the business and the best loan officers in the business. But that being said, hiring is not always the most efficient way for anything. It takes a long time. You have to recruit people. You have to train people. You have to license people. So you need a very long runway. That two-week period in the third quarter was such a good example of where you couldn't hire someone, there was no chance. So if that was your only way to increase capacity, maybe that with a little bit of overtime, you were going to miss out on a really big opportunity. So I think the simplest way I can say it is our focus is growth and our focus is increasing operating leverage. The good news is the most folks believe 2025 is going to be better and we absolutely believe we'll take share. So we expect growth from both of those angles.\nDoug Harter: Appreciate that, Brian. I guess, how do you think about recognizing the importance of having capacity to take advantage of those pockets like you saw in 3Q? How do you think about what is the right level of kind of spare capacity versus kind of having too much capacity for the market opportunity, even factoring in the growth ambitions?\nVarun Krishna: I would just say, Doug that I think what we have right now is the perfect capacity and we're not looking to sort of expand or detract. And at the end of the day, it's a huge market. Our team members provide incredible value and they're going to become very scaled and successful as a result of the investments that we're making in technology. And so we feel really good about our capacity. We think that it will allow us to take share. We think it will allow us to grow, especially as the impact of technology continues to make our team members more and more efficient. It's a big market. We're very ambitious about our growth aspirations, and so we feel really good about where we are.\nDoug Harter: Great. I appreciate the answers. Thank you.\nBrian Brown: Thanks.\nOperator: And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Varun Krishna for closing remarks.\nVarun Krishna: Well, thank you, everyone for listening to our call. We're excited and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brian Brown",
            "content": "Thank you, Varun, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start by setting the stage and framing how we're responding to market realities and seizing opportunities as they come and why we are uniquely positioned to capture a bigger slice of the homeownership market. It's been an interesting couple of months for the industry. For most of the third quarter, 30-year fixed mortgage rates have trended lower from nearly 7% in July to touching 6% during a two-week window mid-September. However, stronger than expected economic indicators, caused the 10-year yield in 30-year fixed mortgage rates to quickly jump back to 7%. In short, the market's been anything but predictable. Since interest rates are impossible to predict with any certainty, the key is scaling up quickly to capture the market opportunity when it presents itself. The third quarter was a perfect example of this. When rates briefly dipped to near 6%, clients who had financed homes in the past two years jumped at the chance to lower their payments. We also saw a lift in our purchase pipeline as affordability improved, reaching our highest daily production volumes in the past 24 months during that brief window. It was a game on moment and we scaled up quickly to capture this volume surge. Every layer of our Rocket Superstack, our ecosystem experience, technology, and brand played a role in powering execution across the board. We captured more top of funnel leads through all of our channels, including direct-to-consumer, broker, partnerships and of course, our service clients. We launched innovative mortgage products like our Welcome Home Rate Break promotion to meet the moment, supercharged our bankers with tools to serve more clients, and boosted conversion throughout the funnel. Altogether, this meant we captured and converted more leads with speed and scale. Without adding headcount or increasing fixed costs, we flexed up our capacity seamlessly through our technology platform. That's the power of what we're building at Rocket. When these windows of opportunity open, we're ready to act. This lightning fast execution is unique to us and hard for others in the industry to replicate. To take advantage of the brief 6% rate opportunity in the quarter, most mortgage companies would have needed to hire train licensed loan officers and underwriters months in advance. Relying on human capital to drive capacity likely means missing the opportunity entirely. Equally important to seizing the market opportunity is staying resilient when the market contracts. Thanks to our tech platform, we can flex our capacity up or down without the whiplash of hiring and layoffs typical in traditional mortgage models. No matter what the market throws at us, we stay focused on our goal to capture profitable market share in any environment. When we zoom out, as Varun shared, we see reasons for optimism. Compared to a year ago, the 30-year fixed rate has trended lower. Housing inventory measured in months of supply has increased by nearly 30%. Active home listings have grown for 12 consecutive months, and the share of homes sold above the listing price is down 10% year-over-year, signaling a cooling in the competitive bidding for homes. While there's still affordability challenges, these are promising signs and we anticipate even more momentum as we head into the New Year. Now with that backdrop, I'll take you through our strong Q3 financial performance, talk more about how AI is unlocking value for our business, and the critical role that our origination servicing flywheel plays in fueling our financial success. I'll also touch on our new investment grade credit rating, and I'll wrap up with our outlook for the fourth quarter. Let's jump in. If I had to sum up this quarter in one phrase, it's lights out execution. We grew purchase and refinance market share, revenue, and profitability on a year-over-year basis. Adjusted revenue came in at $1.323 billion above the high end of our guidance range. This represents a 32% increase from the third quarter of last year and our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. We generated $30 billion in net rate lock volume, marking a 43% increase year-over-year in our highest volume since the first quarter of 2022. This year-over-year growth included double-digit increases in both purchase and refinance. Our home equity product posted another record high. Gain on sale margin held steady at 278 basis points, roughly flat with the same period last year. From a channel perspective, our direct-to-consumer sold loan gain on sale margins have climbed to over 400 basis points, while our partner network margins have increased to roughly 150 basis points. Our continued focus on driving top-line growth, operational leverage, and efficiency combined to make the third quarter our most profitable quarter in two years. Adjusted EBITDA was $286 million, representing a margin of 22%. We reported adjusted net income of $166 million and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.08. When we talk about profitability, it's driven not only by our top-line growth, but also by creating operating leverage powered by our investment in technology. Our scalable tech platform is what empowers us to navigate dynamic markets with agility. From my perspective, the most powerful benefit of AI is the boost it gives to operational efficiency and productivity. Simply put, it's about achieving more with the same resources. The increase we're seeing in team member productivity translates directly into greater capacity. We unlock this capacity through technology, while others in the industry try to grow it by adding headcount, which is inefficient and has a long runway. And when the market contracts, you're left with excess capacity and inflated costs. Today, we have the capacity to support $150 billion in origination volume without adding a single dollar of fixed costs. We proved that this quarter. Not only did we handle more volume, net rate lock volume was up 43% percent but we did so with 7% fewer production team members year-over-year. Our AI tools are driving these gains from automating income verification and collateral review to enabling multiple client chats and insights that boost conversion. Rocket Logic, our proprietary loan origination system is driving massive efficiency improvements. With recent updates, we're saving over 800,000 team member hours annually, a 14% increase from just two months ago, resulting in more than $30 million in annual savings. But it's more than just cost savings. AI is giving us greater speed, accuracy, and personalization, boosting conversion rates, and fueling growth. Operational efficiency is a top priority for us and we're constantly evolving to keep ourselves lean, agile, and competitive. Another key part of our business model is our origination servicing flywheel. As we've discussed on previous calls, and at Investor Day, MSRs are an attractive way to acquire future origination clients. Together, our origination and servicing businesses form a powerful homeownership flywheel that allows us to source new clients and organically create new MSRs while positioning us to help clients with future transactions, be it their next purchase, refinance or even home equity loan. Earning repeat business is what we refer to as our recapture rate. Our goal is to provide a client experience that is so exceptional that we become the client's go to for all future home financing needs. Our industry-leading 85% recapture rate is a testament to the client experience. When you excel at something, you earn the opportunity to extend that value beyond your own ecosystem and offer it to your partners; our high recapture rate is a win-win for both Rocket and our partners. It is a powerful advantage for MSR owners without in-house origination capabilities as it offsets the prepayment risk inherent to owning MSRs. This also makes cash flows more predictable for our partners, reducing the need for complex, costly hedging strategies. In October, we proudly announced a partnership to subservice a portion of Annaly's MSR portfolio. This strategic subservicing partnership complements our strategy of growing servicing through organic new originations as well as bulk acquisitions. Across bulk acquisitions and subservicing, year-to-date we've acquired or committed to add over $70 billion of unpaid principal balance to our service portfolio. That's a 15% increase compared to the 2023 year-end balance. This growth represents 220,000 new clients who represent prime candidates for future purchases, home equity loans and rate and term refinances. As of September 30, our mortgage servicing portfolio included 2.6 million loans with $546 billion of unpaid principal balance. In the quarter, we generated $374 million of cash revenue from our servicing book, which represents approximately $1.5 billion on an annualized basis. We ended the third quarter with $3 billion of available cash and $6.8 billion of mortgage servicing rights. Together, these assets represent a total of $9.8 billion of value on the balance sheet. Our $3 billion of available cash consisted of $1.2 billion of cash on the balance sheet and an additional $1.8 billion of corporate cash used to self-fund loan originations. And as of September 30, total liquidity stood at approximately $8.3 billion including available cash plus undrawn lines of credit. As a testament to our sustained financial strength, I'm proud to share that Fitch recently upgraded Rocket Mortgage to investment grade. This makes Rocket Mortgage the first non-bank mortgage company to receive investment grade status from one of the three big rating agencies in almost two decades. This achievement highlights our strong balance sheet and financial profile and paves the way to access a wider range of funding sources at a much more favorable cost of funds. This added flexibility positions us to continue to allocate capital in service of our growth strategy. Turning to our fourth quarter outlook. Based on typical seasonality, we anticipate the mortgage market in the fourth quarter to be smaller than the third quarter. We expect adjusted revenue to be in the range of $1.50 billion to $1.200 billion. The mid-point of this range represents 27% year-over-year growth and reflects continued market share gains. We expect expenses in the fourth quarter to be in line with the third quarter. The fourth quarter includes marketing spend related to our brand restage and the annual renewal of banker licenses. As always, our forward-looking guidance is based on our current outlook and visibility. As we look ahead, we're excited and optimistic about what's to come. Over the years, I've seen us navigate a wide range of markets, consistently proving our ability to thrive through both highs and lows. What excites me most is that Rocket is now better positioned than ever before. This optimism isn't just mine; it's shared across our entire organization. Rocket has what it takes to disrupt, capture, and grow at scale in an industry where only the strongest thrive. We're making bold investments, setting ambitious goals, and accelerating execution, all with a clear focus on creating long-term value for our shareholders. With that, we're ready to turn it back over to the operator for questions. Sure. Thanks, Varun. Yes, I'll touch on the gain on sale margin piece. We do expect a slight expansion in gain on sale margin in Q4 compared to the third quarter. There's a little bit of conservatism built in there and that's just typically because we see some competitors do some pricing plays around the holidays. If you think about it and you're in their shoes, they have about the same amount of capacity either way. And this volume ticks down to Varun's point every once in a while, we see some pricing pressure there. So we've considered that in the guide. And if you kind of just zoom out, we've said for a long time now that we expect gain on sale margins to expand. That doesn't happen in an exactly linear basis, but we are getting back to levels, particularly on a channel. If I look at direct-to-consumer and partner individually that are really close to the historical healthy levels that we've seen pre-pandemic. Yes. I mean, Jeff, if we think about what we do when we set the guide, we obviously take into consideration all the information we have up to this point in the quarter. There's no question about that. It has been a volatile start to the quarter. To Varun's comments, rates have sort of moved in the opposite direction. So all of that is baked in the MBA applications and we look at that, we look at optimal blue. But the most important thing, if I were to leave you with a takeaway is, we truly believe this guide is taking share in the fourth quarter. Yes, sure. Thanks, Ryan, for the question. I mean, when it comes to operating leverage, I think the first starting point is think about what we've done this year. To Varun's point, I do think 2024 will be a bit better than 2023. But I still think if you look back, we're five years ahead and you look back at 2024, I still think it's going to be looked at as a pretty down market in the big scheme of things. We'll see how the fourth quarter shakes out. So all that being said, in every single quarter, this year we printed double-digit EBITDA margins. If I take the kind of year-to-date, three quarters in margin, that's about 20%. And we've done the good work on the cost side over the past couple of years. We've talked a lot about that. But what I'm most proud of is the expansion in EBITDA margins is really through top-line growth. It's been taking share and doing the things that we said we'd do. So to Varun's point, if you look ahead to 2025, and you believe that it's going to be healthier, which we do than 2024, by 20% to 30% a $2 trillion, market is a really healthy market. So you believe in some expansion there. And then of course, our share gain goals that we shared at Investor Day are exactly what we're seeking to achieve. The third quarter is another example of that. The guide in the fourth quarter keeps us right on track to achieving those share gain. So if I say, hey, the EBITDA margins this year in 2024 in a pretty tough market were 20%. A little bit of help from the market and taking share gets us very excited about the opportunity to increase operating leverage next year. Yes. Thanks, Ryan. So I'll start here. Varun you may want to add in, but it's definitely an area that we're very excited about. When we talked about our capital waterfall and we talked about being interested in deploying capital MSRs still remain right at the top. It's right in our bread and butter. You mentioned the $70 billion. One of the things I'm most excited about and you guys have all seen the news. We're very proud of this Annaly deal. Annaly is a world class asset manager and in our business this flywheel effect that we have been driving for decades now is really impressive. 85% recapture rates, we're collecting the servicing cash flows very efficiently. But when you really think about the revenue opportunity of the next loan compared to the cash flows you're collecting, it's 20x that. So I expect us to continue to double down there on those opportunities, both from the bulk acquisition market. But I think the subservicing aspect is also very interesting to us because if you were in a seat where you didn't have an in-house origination capability, but you were a really good asset manager, protecting those cash flows has to be your number one priority. And if you're thinking about choosing between subservicers, you have one sitting here that has a J.D. Power multiple year winning experience and does it really good. And then you also have something that I don't think others can offer, which is this recapture rate. And recapture rate is the thing that allows an asset manager to protect against CPR or protect against prepayment risk. So I expect it to be a big part of our strategy going into 2025. Yes. Thanks Mark. Appreciate the question. So I think there was a two-week window in the month of September and I think that's what you're referring to where mortgage rates came down to the low-6s. And I think it's such a good case study into our strategy at work. There were two really notable things. One, first is when rates get down into the low-6s, it proved that we are off to the races. You have about two years of mortgage production north of that. So there's definitely a bunch of consumers that can benefit from a rate and term refinance. And we saw that. So that's the first thing to note is that your -- that's your sort of Mendoza line, there is you get into those low-6s and it's -- you're off to the races. But the second thing is, if you think about how to capture that opportunity that gives us a bunch of proof points into what we're building and how impactful it is. Because in this case, you had a very, very short window with very high intent consumers and a ton of consumer demand. So the ability to scale up very quickly and capture that is exactly what differentiates us between us and our competitors. If you think about it, it's not just about being able to handle it from a processing, underwriting and closing perspective. But obviously that's very important because the client coming in with high demand and a client coming in with low demand expects the same level of service, the same closing time. So that is important. But it's also just about taking that demand and effectively allocating it to your bankers and keeping your bankers very, very efficient and productive. Because the more clients they can interact with and engage with during that very short window to take advantage of it, the better off the client's going to be because they're going to be saving money and also the better off we are because we're going to capture more share during that period. So it was actually very interesting. Of course, we didn't plan on it. It was sort of leading up to the Fed meeting. And we know what happened after that. The Fed cut 50 basis points and then rates went up. But it did prove to us that one; there are a ton of consumers in the money at that rate. And the last thing I'll sort of leave you with there, Mark is, I think just the change in the consumer is interesting because if the pandemic taught us one thing, there were clients that refinanced multiple times over a couple year period. So today, fast-forward, when consumers are getting a mortgage, they're truly in the mindset of I'm not going to have, I may have this house for a long time, but I'm not going to have this rate for a long time. And so the interesting part about it is during that couple of week window, there was a lot of headlines around the 10-year treasury and how mortgage rates were moving. And we got a ton of inbounds from our clients, both of course from our service clients, which you'd expect, but just from clients that had mortgages from other companies, because the propensity for clients to transact now and their sensitivity to rates I would argue is at an all-time high. Thanks, Mark. Yes. Thanks for the question, Derek. We don't disclose obviously the economics of our partnerships, but I think it's safe to say, when you look at the things that Annaly is good at being a great world class asset manager, protecting against prepayments is very important to us and that's where we come in. So clearly there's a subservicing agreement, as you'd expect. We hope we do that very efficiently if you just look at our own servicing. But I think the more interesting part about this deal is really the recapture opportunities and we think that's the superpower that we can offer. So we're happy to do that for Annaly. It truly makes a win-win with the partnerships. And if you think about it, there's economics on the subservicing side and then of course, there's economics on the recapture side. So it's really bringing two great firms together and sort of solving our challenge of hey, we need more servicing and it's a great capital light way to do it. And their challenge of hey, we have a lot of servicing but we have to protect against it. So it's truly a win-win. I'll start and then Varun you want to add too. Yes, I think there's a lot of room to run in that product. There's no question about it. If you just kind of study the note rates of all the mortgages outstanding, there is definitely a chunk that's north of 6 and as we just kind of touched on is available for rate and term refinance with just a little bit of rate movement. But of course, there's another big chunk that's, 3%, 3.5% out there, and likely will remain out there for quite some time unless the homeowners is planning on moving. So if you think about it for them, the home equity product is a great product, it's going to make a lot of sense for a long time. I do think we saw in that couple week period during the quarter where rate and term refinances become back in favor and even to some extent cash out can start making more sense as rates start touching 6%. So -- and again, we're sort of happy to do that product for a client where it makes sense as well. But generally speaking, we think the client makes sense for a lot of consumers out there, particularly those consumers that are sitting on those very low rates. And by the way, the thing we talk about a lot internally is by layering on that second makes a ton of sense for the client, but it does bring up the weighted average note rate of the two loans. And then if and when rates do move a little bit, you have an interesting refinance opportunity in terms of the consolidation of those two liens. Hey, thanks for the question, Doug. I mean, the way I'd answer that is our primary focus is capturing share and growing into the market. We just talked about our views on 2025 and admittedly Q4 has been a bit more volatile than anyone would like, but still very bullish on the 2025 outlook being higher. So right now our focus is being able to continue to capture share, grow into a larger market and do it with a relatively flat fixed cost base. And what that does is it really just increases operating leverage. Even if I look at just the numbers from Q2 to Q3, I think Q2 or, excuse me, Q3 expenses were up mid-3% from Q2. But if I just look at on a rate lock basis, volume was up 20%. So you can see us doing exactly what we said we'd do in terms of building that operating leverage. Of course, it provides option value. There's no question for different markets. But our goal in life here is to avoid the traditional yo-yo effect of the mortgage market. And if you think about how most people grow capacity, they do it through hiring. And we will hire some people too. We have the best team members in the business and the best loan officers in the business. But that being said, hiring is not always the most efficient way for anything. It takes a long time. You have to recruit people. You have to train people. You have to license people. So you need a very long runway. That two-week period in the third quarter was such a good example of where you couldn't hire someone, there was no chance. So if that was your only way to increase capacity, maybe that with a little bit of overtime, you were going to miss out on a really big opportunity. So I think the simplest way I can say it is our focus is growth and our focus is increasing operating leverage. The good news is the most folks believe 2025 is going to be better and we absolutely believe we'll take share. So we expect growth from both of those angles. Thanks."

            "name": "Varun Krishna",
            "content": "Thanks, Sharon. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Rocket Companies third quarter 2024 earnings call. Two months ago, at our first ever Investor Day, we unveiled our vision for Rocket's future. Today, I want to kick off our call by emphasizing and extending one key theme, optimism. Optimism is the ability to see the glass as half full. Over the past few months, the market has thrown our industry almost every curveball imaginable, with inflation easing, the Fed cut rates for the first time in four years, but in an interesting twist, while the Fed lowered rates, mortgage rates did not follow suit. Instead, both the 10-year treasury yield and the 30-year fixed mortgage rate actually increased. In my experience, it's always important to take the long view and put things in perspective. Despite the housing market being challenging, we are seeing signs of rejuvenation. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate has declined from nearly 8% a year ago. This is helping improve purchase affordability and opening up refinancing opportunities to lower monthly payments. Plus, housing inventory has increased from 3.4 months to 4.3 months, showing a 26% improvement. We're still below the five-month to six-month range, that's considered a balanced, healthy market, but inventory is moving in the right direction. While affordability and inventory are certainly still challenges, the market is showing signs of improvement compared to last year and we're right there with consumers navigating their needs together and in service of our mission to help everyone home. Our mindset reflects the importance of optimism in a world that continues to be riddled with uncertainty. That is because home ownership is and always will be the cornerstone of the American dream. Every day, we make 30-year bets on clients who are betting on themselves. Our role in opening the door to that dream is what makes us proud to be Rocket. Let me take a minute to reflect on the results of the quarter. At Investor Day, we announced our bold 2027 market share goals to double our purchase market share from 4% to 8% and increase our refinance market share from 12% to 20%. This quarter was a solid step toward these goals. I am so pleased to share that we expanded both our purchase and refinance market share year-over-year in the third quarter. We delivered $1.323 billion in adjusted revenue, surpassing the high end of our guidance and accelerating growth compared to Q2. Net rate lock volume surged 43% year-over-year, driven by significant refinance activity alongside growth in purchase volume. Our adjusted EBITDA margins came in at 22%, 3x higher than Q3 of 2023. We also reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.08. These numbers are a direct result of one basic thing, execution. Our team members continuously refine every aspect of our sales and operational processes, marketing, and product technology to fight for every inch of progress. That execution excellence is built on decades of investment and toward a durable competitive advantage, which we call the Rocket Superstack. This is the key to the strong short-term results we're seeing today and is also the foundation for long-term value creation and growth. Our Superstack is comprised of four layers, a robust end-to-end ecosystem, multi-channel experiences we create for clients, team members and partners, proprietary AI-driven technology, and lastly our iconic brand. The integration of these four layers serves as the engine that drives growth, scale and efficiency. Let's dive into each layer and unpack a few highlights from the quarter. First up is the power of our unique ecosystem, a system that connects each step of the journey from finding and financing a home to servicing to title and closing and the journey beyond. At the very heart of our ecosystem lies our origination servicing flywheel. Once a client enters the flywheel, we provide them with outstanding origination and servicing experiences and we earn the privilege of becoming their lender for life. Last month, we announced a strategic sub servicing partnership with Annaly. This partnership allows us to expand our servicing portfolio in a capital efficient manner. We're excited to onboard these clients into the Rocket ecosystem this December and provide them with an amazing origination and servicing experience that sets Rocket apart. Our industry-leading 85% recapture rate speaks to the client experience that people love that keeps them coming back to Rocket establishing a long-term relationship. There's no additional acquisition costs for clients in our ecosystem, creating even more operating leverage. This very same ecosystem brings innovative mortgage products tailored to today's market to our clients, with home affordability top of mind; our affordable product suite is helping clients get a leg up or bringing the dream of homeownership closer. These products have struck a chord, making up a quarter of our purchase volume since the beginning of this year. Our recently launched Welcome Home Rate Break is a great example. We reduced rates by 2 points in the first year and 1 point in the second, providing meaningful affordability relief for homebuyers. Since its launch in late August, we've seen our ONE+ and Welcome Home Rate Break product groups grow by more than 20%. Now, on top of our ecosystem sits our experience layer, where we're breaking new ground and delivering delight to our clients. We have made tremendous strides this quarter in expanding our GenAI-powered chat functionality. Our generative and live chat is now fully integrated across all our digital platforms, handling everything from purchase, refinancing and servicing 24/7 whether clients are logged in or not. This round the clock access is key with 20% of our clients contacting us outside of regular business hours. We're seeing significant growth here as chat interactions with our bankers have more than doubled quarter-over-quarter. Beyond just the literal growth in the number of interactions, chat is driving real results. Every chat is a chance to deliver personalized insightful experiences that deepen client engagement, which in turn leads to higher conversion. Clients who use chat are converting 3x higher compared to those who don't from first interaction to credit poll. We often talk about letting technology do what it does best, freeing our team members to focus on what they do best helping our clients, responding with urgency when our clients need us most is the any to play. I can't think of a better example where this was put to the test than most recently during the hurricanes that hit the Southeast. While dealing with a devastating situation, I couldn't be prouder of our team's quick technology enabled response to support and be there for our clients. We tracked the storm paths in real-time. We activated our emergency playbook. We customized our digital tools before landfall. Self-service options like our website, AI-powered chat and IVR allowed nearly 70% of affected servicing clients to get immediate answers on credit suppression, late fee waivers, and forbearance, seamlessly connecting them to our team when they needed personal support. We also saw a significant three-fold increase in disaster inspection reports for affected counties compared to the weekly average in the months before. This process can often be delayed at the collateral underwriter review stage where workloads are already substantial. Quickly reviewing these reports is critical to getting our clients loans back on track. Thanks to automation efforts we put in place months ago, we cut review times by 71%, allowing us to push through this bottleneck and quickly provide next steps to help our clients move toward closing. Let's move to the third layer that powers our ecosystem and experience technology. The ability to leverage technology is crucial to scale, drive profitable growth, and adapt to market shifts. Let me share just two quick examples. In our business, constantly we're asking and answering complex questions like which loans are in the money in Wayne County, Michigan? Or is this loan compliant with regulations in Nevada? For many lenders, answering these questions takes intense research. It can take many hours or even days, involving multiple data analysts or engineers pulling data from various sources. This is just the industry norm, but not at Rocket. Rocket is changing the game with a new technology called Navigator, our internal AI-driven knowledge and workflow platform that puts answers to questions within reach in seconds. Navigator empowers our team members to create no code apps, experiment with AI securely, summarize documents, analyze sentiment and even role play scenarios. Navigator's AI automates complex queries, empowering more people to drive innovation on their own without involving support from a data analyst or engineer. With Navigators conversational AI interface, our team now has the answers they need at their fingertips. And the results are impressive. In just a few months, over 2,000 team members have logged more than 52,000 LLM interactions and they love it. Daily active users have been climbing steadily since launch, nearly doubling from August to October. By automating complex queries, Navigator is multiplying the number of innovators at Rocket by an order of magnitude. That is the power of AI in a nutshell. We've also continued to build out our proprietary AI-powered loan origination system, Rocket Logic. We recently expanded Synopsis to handle all inbound calls and the results have skyrocketed. In early November, we reached a major milestone, processing nearly 1 million calls in a single week. The power of processing these calls through AI results in transformative insights to our business. Each call provides semantic data that lets us extract names, sentiment, call purpose, pain points, and more. These tags create metadata that helps us strategically allocate resources, equip our bankers with valuable real-time insights, and address specific needs, ultimately driving higher conversion rates. With Synopsis, we have insight into a client's purchase journey, whether they have a home in mind, have submitted an offer or had it accepted. This allows us to connect high intent clients with the right bankers, creating more meaningful interactions, and driving purchase conversion. The last layer of the stack is the icing on the cake our iconic brand. The Rocket brand is one of our greatest superpowers. While Rocket is already an admired brand, this coming year, we will significantly amplify its identity, purpose, and impact in homeownership. Over the past few months, we've zeroed in on the growth audiences that are set to reshape the home buying landscape. Female heads of households, Hispanics, and aging first time buyers, just to name a few. By 2030, over half of first time homebuyers will be Hispanic. Meanwhile, the economic influence of women will continue to surge. With women managing two-thirds of household wealth, our brand will evolve to meet these clients exactly where they are. In February of 2025, we will unveil the new Rocket brand identity. The transformation began with our recent acquisition of rocket.com a site that will unify the homeownership experience across home search and mortgage. In the coming months, we will share a greater ambition with the country and establish a brand that represents the ability for our clients to own the elusive American dream once more. Let me quickly summarize, each layer of our Superstack accelerates our execution and propels us forward. The stack is a durable advantage that empowers us to set bold goals and establishes clarity on how we will achieve them. Each layer is unique to Rocket and combines to create a whole that is greater than the sum of parts. What truly excites me isn't just the, what of our strategy, but the how and most importantly, the who. We've built a world class leadership team, bringing in key executives with deep expertise in AI and technology to work hand in hand with the best homeownership, mortgage and finance leadership team in the industry. Together, we are poised to drive needed change in modernization in the industry and I am so proud to work alongside them every single day. I'm going to close where I started. Our mission is to help everyone home, a mission that reflects the optimism we have toward our future growth, forecast for the mortgage origination market indicate a 20 to 30% year-over-year growth in 2025 that gets us excited and creates an opportunity to capture share. And no matter how the market evolves in the coming years, our $5 trillion market opportunity reflects our potential and our ambition. We firmly believe Rocket is well-positioned to drive disruption and transform the industry to benefit millions of homeowners. Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian. Jeff, thanks for your question. Let me start and then I'll ask Brian to chime in on the gain on sale margins. And I'd start by just saying that we feel very good about our guide and there's a few things that I think are important to just keep in mind when it comes to Q4, you typically expect the fourth quarter to be a little bit smaller than Q3. And when you really think about why that is, primarily it's due to just home buying slowing down a little bit post Labor Day. You've got kids going back to school, you've got the holiday season. So mortgage financing is just not typically as top of mind. The second thing that I would share is you've seen interest rates tick up a little bit and that has obviously an impact on mortgage applications. And so these two factors can compound and just have an effect on the quarter. But at the end of the day, the market size is going to be whatever it is; it's still a big market. And our big focus is really just on growing our share with great execution. And when you just put that together, we definitely believe, we have a strong and confident guide. And I'll also just callout that the guide is 27% higher year-over-year for this quarter. And that guide reflects obviously our continued focus on market share gains and just our resilience to be able to grow in any market. And then let me ask Brian to comment further. Thanks for the question, Ryan. I'd start by saying that the mortgage market obviously is not easy to predict. But in general, when you look at multiple factors, our outlook is optimistic. And there's a few factors that I'll just comment on, then I'll ask Brian to jump in as well. And I think the first thing to start with obviously is the rate environment. And there's a multitude of things that go into that, obviously things like an unemployment, CPI, consumer confidence, and in general, those things signal economic health. But the reality is inflation is still a part of the system. And until it's clear that it's working its way out of the system, you can expect that there's going to be a little bit of pressure on the 10-year treasury and then correspondingly the 30-year fixed rate mortgage. The next thing we look at is the housing market. Obviously, the housing market is a big part of the GDP. And the good thing there is that we're seeing definitely some signs of rejuvenation. You've got more inventory. You've got more homes that are selling at or below list. You've got equity at an all-time high. And when you look at housing inventory, we went from 3.4 months to 4.3 months. The number of homes listed for sale, that's up 29%. Affordability is up 5%. So some really good things happening there that gives us confidence in 2025. And then, we look at the size of the market. To your point, good things happening there. The forecasts are expecting that the market will be up over $2 trillion, that's up 28% compared to this past year. And that's still a huge market, right? And so regardless of conditions, there's plenty of share up for grabs. And then, what I would also say is the most important thing we really look at is just our execution, our ability to execute in any market. And that's something that we feel tremendously confident in. And a big part of that is our Superstack and what we believe is a tailwind to be able to execute against our Superstack relative to competitors. And so putting all that together, that gives us a lot of optimism for 2025, being better than 2024. And we know that 2024 was certainly better than 2023. And that's kind of how we think about our outlook. And then on the expense side, I'll ask Brian to jump in. I would just add that this example with MSRs and extensibility is just showcasing the power of the platform. And it's just something that really illustrates in a cool way how we scale beyond our four walls because we've earned the right to take these capabilities to benefit others like Annaly. You'll also see us doing the same thing with integrating our technology as a platform to serve as the mortgage platform for banks. The same platform is being extended to create value for brokers via TPO. And then on top of that, as Brian talked about, these recapture capabilities are only going to get better with investments in technology, AI, insights, notifications, CRM capabilities, mobile, data-driven personalization. And as we invest in our platform, each of the parties that we extend the capabilities to become beneficiaries of that innovation. And so really the power of that platform really lies in its extensibility. And the idea that you can write something once you can run it anywhere, benefit multiple parties is something that we're very excited about. The only thing I would just add is that you asked a little bit about capacity, Mark, and this is why we're so obsessed with AI and the investments that we've made in Rocket Logic, which is our proprietary LOS is driving big efficiency gains. We're on track to save our team members 800,000 hours annually. That's up 14% in just two months. So -- and it's almost $30 million in savings. And we're achieving that while keeping obviously our fixed costs roughly the same. And so just the reason we're obsessed with AI is because when you think about all the bread and butter aspects of our business, analyzing client interactions, automating underwriting, applying models to capital market infrastructure, automating document processing, credit modeling, appraisal reviews, these are all the capabilities that make the mortgage business work. And they're all benefiting from the implementation of AI. And so just continuing to invest in that, I mean this is why we've spent upwards of $0.5 billion over the past five years on this investment. And we've made progress. We will continue to do so and we think there's significantly more gains to be had in the future as well. Yes. I would just add that in general, our approach is to innovate and meet our clients where they are. And so if we see a market opportunity, we will build products and services to meet our clients there. And so there's room to grow there. But this is an example of where we just really focus on delivering value to our clients. And then the other thing I would also call out is that it's important that we build products not just for our existing client base, but also for our new client base. What we've seen is for products like this, this actually attracts clients to the Rocket brand and to the Rocket franchise. And so by bringing them in, we can then offer them additional products and services that allow us to become their lender for life and that's a really great thing about this product offering. I would just say, Doug that I think what we have right now is the perfect capacity and we're not looking to sort of expand or detract. And at the end of the day, it's a huge market. Our team members provide incredible value and they're going to become very scaled and successful as a result of the investments that we're making in technology. And so we feel really good about our capacity. We think that it will allow us to take share. We think it will allow us to grow, especially as the impact of technology continues to make our team members more and more efficient. It's a big market. We're very ambitious about our growth aspirations, and so we feel really good about where we are. Well, thank you, everyone for listening to our call. We're excited and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you."

And with that, I'll turn things over to Brian Krishna to get us started. Varun?\nVarun Krishna: Thanks, Sharon. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to the Rocket Companies Q2 2024 earnings call. As I reflect, it is hard to believe that it's been almost a year since I joined Rocket and what an accelerating journey it has been. This Rocket is fueled by the passion of our team members who are the driving force behind everything that we do. They are led and inspired by an unrivaled leadership team, each bringing decades of experience and knowledge, ranging from fintech and mortgage capital markets and AI, the marketing, product, operations, sales and so much more. Together, we're blazing new trails pioneering experiences that will redefine how consumers experience the homeownership journey now and into the future. Our mission is to help everyone home. That means we are obsessed with making homeownership easier and more accessible for everyone. It's not just a business goal. It's our higher calling. We consider ourselves the most optimistic company in America because every day, we make 30-year bets on people who make 30-year bets on themselves. The need for hope and optimism has never been greater in our country. We're navigating through challenging times and unpredictability is the new normal. Despite some signs of gradual recovery in home listings and sales, affordability remains at historic lows due to persistently high mortgage rates and rising home prices. This past spring, the industry experienced a weak home buying activity with purchase applications dropping to their lowest levels in over 3 decades. Macro uncertainty and affordability issues are keeping potential buyers on the sidelines while consolidation continues with smaller players being acquired or exiting the market. Mortgage employment has decreased by 36% from its peak. Yet in the face of these challenges, optimism remains our mantra and higher calling. While others are faltering or retreating, we're mobilizing our immense resources, capabilities and talent to innovate and serve our clients like never before. It is our moment to show our unshakable resilience grow from strength and redefine our leadership role in the homeownership category as the most optimistic company in America. On that backdrop, let's go a little deeper on the second quarter when we demonstrated growth despite industry challenges. Most importantly, we achieved profitable market share growth, our north star metric and expanded purchase share year-over-year through numerous optimizations in our processes, teams, marketing and technology capabilities. This quarter, we delivered strong financial results, generating $1.228 billion in adjusted revenue, above the high end of our guidance range and grew year-over-year for the fourth straight quarter. We expanded adjusted EBITDA margins quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year through both top line growth and our continued focus on operational efficiency. We reported $0.06 of adjusted earnings per diluted share for the quarter. Solid execution is the lifeblood of our business and our AI-powered initiatives stand at the forefront. I'd like to spend just a few minutes highlighting 4 key achievements this quarter. Our AI-powered live chat for clients Rocket Logic Assistant for banking, growth in home equity loans and automation and servicing. I'll start with our AI-powered live chat experience. We have expanded this interface throughout the client journey from early inquiries using tools like the mortgage calculator to live help with applications and servicing questions on escrow and payments. Chat is an absolute game changer for us. Our live chat interface is so much more than just the communication tool. It's a strategic advantage that enhances engagement with deep personalization drives efficiency and ultimately improve outcomes for our clients and business at scale. Chat is the asynchronous communication mode of choice in today's SaaS-based world favored by both, older and newer generations, 80% of our clients prefer chat. They love the instant responses and 24/7 availability that allow them to manage their mortgage based on their individual preferences and needs. The beauty of chat lies in its scalability and versatility which seamlessly complements our traditional phone interactions. We're not just responding faster with Chat. We're providing an experience that is more personalized and tailored. We can quickly gauge client intent and direct them to the best solutions, whether they need immediate answers or deeper discussions with the right expert team member. And by leveraging generative AI, we can deliver great client experiences at scale by handling more interactions and keeping more clients engaged with better automation. The result of AI-powered chat is a resounding win, win, win, happier clients, satisfied team members and clear business value. Recent data shows that clients using chat had conversion rates 3x higher compared to those who didn't leverage chat. Building on these successes, we are expanding chat across more client and journey touch points including purchase which we launched 2 weeks ago. The next example is the rollout of Rocket Logic Assistant to our entire banking force, helping our clients navigate the home buying journey. This AI-powered personal assistant transcribes client calls and automatically completes mortgage applications in real time, supercharging our banker productivity. Gone are the days of manual note taking with hands on keyboard or pen and paper which would fatigue our bankers and leave gaps in client conversations. Now the Rocket Logic Assistant seamlessly generates over 300,000 detailed transcripts every week from outbound calls. It supports over 100 data points on mortgage applications saving our bankers from inputting tens of millions of data fields each week. This enhances efficiency allows us to closely monitor calls and extract valuable client insights while also creating recursive models and feedback loops to continuously improve our bankers' performance and more effectively train each new generation of the best bankers in the country. Next, our home equity loan origination volume reached an all-time high in Q2, more than doubling from a year ago. Home equity loans continue to resonate with our clients as we help them unlock record levels of home equity while still being able to keep their favorable rates on their first lien mortgages. Additionally, we enhanced the speed and efficiency of our home equity loan process through the launch of an automated valuation model or AVM. AVM represents a major upgrade, providing a cost-efficient digital alternative to traditional in-person appraisals. This innovation allows us to deliver cash from home equity loans in as little as 7 days meeting our clients' needs with unprecedented speed and accuracy. Finally, we've made significant strides in expanding our servicing portfolio, a strategic asset that complements our origination business. We're retaining clients for the next transaction at rates 3x higher than the industry average, positioning ourselves as their lender for life and generating recurring cash flow without additional acquisition costs. Our advantage lies in providing technology-powered class-leading service to 2.6 million clients and leveraging rich data profiles to continuously understand their needs for life. In the second quarter, we acquired 5 MSR portfolios, adding 67,000 new clients and approximately $21 billion in unpaid principal balance. The loans in these acquired MSRs have a blended weighted average coupon higher than our current portfolio, opening up a range of products and services for these new clients. From refinance options that capitalize on declining rates to home equity loans for those looking to leverage their home equity and new purchase loans for clients ready for their next home, we offer a comprehensive suite of solutions to meet diverse client needs across the spectrum. We've also become more operationally efficient in this space. Traditionally, MSR trailing document audits required manually sifting through extensive documents to verify data for each loan which could take months for a single portfolio. With our upgraded workflow automation, our capital markets team can now complete MSR audits in half the time. This enhancement allows us to onboard MSR portfolios more quickly, efficiently and accurately which is essential as we expand our portfolio. We've built a powerhouse technology suite for servicing that enables us to scale and deliver outstanding client service. The recent launch of MSR audit automation streamlines the first step of the loan onboarding process. Our AI-powered self-serve phone and chat tool drive efficiency and provide exceptional service to millions of clients. Additionally, Rocket Synopsis, a tool leveraging generative AI listens to transcribe and search as client calls, analyzing sentiment and reporting client patterns and preferences. Furthermore, features like live chat, real-time transcription and tagging are enhancing the value of our data lake and AI-powered solutions. This infrastructure supports recursive feedback loops that continuously refine and train our models. Our structured data lake aggregates and organizes information, making it readily accessible to our data scientists and technology teams. And from this repository, our models extract deep insights and analytics, enabling us to deliver exceptional client experiences and maximize team effectiveness. As we roll out new solutions and increase the usage of existing ones, we gather more data, creating an AI flywheel that accelerates velocity, enhances accuracy, personalizes interactions and optimizes operational efficiency across our business. As a former software engineer, I'm going to keep breaking out for the next minute and talk about some of the deeper technology that powers our rocket ship, leveraging our data and modeling tools like TensorFlow, faster region convolutional neural network models and efficient net V2 L CARES [ph] models, our technology fully automates high-volume tasks such as document processing, appraisal reviews and income verification. With ground-breaking methods like this, we've already been able to bypass human intervention on nearly 10% of all appraisals in April 2024, saving 1,701 hours for collateral underwriting alone. Hopefully, you're still with me. Let's talk about another AI concept called Retrieval Augmented Generation or REG. REG is a way to supercharge the utility of GenAI by adding your own data into the conversation. We're using this technique in our Rocket Logic platform, allowing team members to dive deep into all facets of a loan and provide in-the-moment insights and assistance. We're also able to leverage our own data and best practice documentation to assist our engineering teams and to provide an easily accessible natural language interface over our data analytics platform. This provides all of our teams with the context and data they need to make the best decisions for our clients where and when they need it. We work closely with amazing partners like AWS, Entropic, OpenAI and others to stay on a cutting edge of research and techniques to make the most out of GenAI and this will only increase going into the future. As I conclude, I want to give a huge shout out to our amazing servicing team for winning our tenth J.D. Power award for servicing just last week. This achievement further cements Rocket Mortgage as the most awarded company for mortgage servicing and the most awarded mortgage company overall, something we will continue to work hard to earn day after day and year after year. In closing, I am so proud of our strong execution in the second quarter but this is just the beginning. The 4 examples we've discussed all share a common theme. They illustrate how AI both enhances client experiences and boost team productivity through improved velocity, accuracy, personalization and operational efficiency. While many companies aspire to be AI-centric you have the right blend of talent, assets and mist to succeed. I believe that Rocket is exceptionally well positioned to execute on our AI-fueled homeownership strategy and I look forward to sharing our continued progress with you each quarter. Lastly, we are thrilled to invite you to Detroit on September 10 for Rocket's first ever Investor Day. This is your opportunity to go behind the scenes, meet our leadership experience our company culture and innovation first-hand and discover what makes Rocket rock. We're also excited to showcase our beautiful city of Detroit and I look forward to seeing all of you there. And with that, I will turn it over to Brian.\nBrian Brown: Thank you, Varun and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll cover our financial performance and provide an update on our investments in growth, particularly in technology and servicing. I'll close with our outlook and guidance for the third quarter. You heard Varun share the passion behind executing our AI-powered homeownership strategy, all in service of our mission to help everyone home. Our mission is so important because we bring people the pride and joy that only homeownership can offer. In pursuit of this mission, we're breaking new ground. We're transforming the homeownership experience from one traditionally filled with stress and complexity into a radically easier and simpler process for everyone. Rocket has a unique opportunity to transform the fragmented $5 trillion homeownership market. We have all the ingredients for success, an unrivaled combination of talent, assets, capabilities and culture. We're just getting started and I couldn't be more excited for the opportunity ahead of us. We are not just imagining the future of homeownership we are building it. Now on to the second quarter results. We delivered a strong second quarter, growing purchase market share, revenue and profitability year-over-year. Our growth was particularly impressive against the backdrop of a contracting market. as industry purchase applications declined to their lowest second quarter in 30 years. Adjusted revenue came in at $1.228 billion, above the high end of our guidance range. This represents a 23% increase from the second quarter of 2023 and our fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. Reflecting on our performance this past quarter, several wins come to mind, a double-digit lift in purchase conversions due to marketing optimization, record volume for home equity product and a 30% increase in our agent network attachment rates, driven by demand for buys. We generated $25.1 billion in net rate lock volume, a 13% increase year-over-year. Gain on sale margin was 299 basis points or an increase of 32 basis points compared to the same period last year. Our continued focus on driving top line growth and improvements in operational efficiency combined to make the second quarter our most profitable quarter in 2 years. Adjusted EBITDA increased year-over-year for the fifth straight quarter to $225 million or a margin of 18%. We also reported adjusted net income of $121 million and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.06. In the first half of 2024, we generated nearly $0.5 billion more in adjusted EBITDA than the same period in 2023. While we are pleased with the progress we have made over the past year we believe our true long-term earnings potential is much greater. We see significant room for more top line growth and higher operating leverage as our AI investments gain even more traction. Varun took us through some examples of how AI drives velocity, accuracy, personalization and operational efficiency for our business. One of the breakthroughs that I'm particularly excited about is our AI-powered live chat which will pave the way for further scale and operational efficiency. AI-powered live chat is a prime example of delivering personalized and fast client experiences while supercharging our team members at scale. Chat is the clear choice for our clients, a quick way to get personalized answers. Chat empowers our team members to support multiple clients at the same time, freeing up their capacity. Through chat, we identified client intent upfront and guide our clients to the right resource which can include connecting them with one of our expert mortgage bankers. With client intent and call purpose match to the right banker, these live conversations are more personalized and engaging. We're seeing these benefits pay off in our business. Chat helps us scale up to a better client experience leading to higher conversion in operational efficiency. In fact, we're seeing clients who use chat convert 3x better than those who don't. There is much more potential to unleash. AI enables us to do significantly more without adding more resources which unlocks capacity. When the market inflects, we believe AI will help us drive growth at scale while keeping fixed cost flat. Now turning to our servicing portfolio, a strategic asset that's worth much more than the $7 billion on our balance sheet. Our servicing asset plays an important role in growing our mortgage origination business. Let me impact this a little more. Clients choose Rocket for the convenience and J.D. Power award-winning service, experiencing how easy it is to get a mortgage with us. Once they get their mortgage, they move to our servicing platform where they continue to enjoy J.D. Power award-winning service. So it's no surprise that when they're ready to buy their next home, lower their mortgage rate or tap into their homes equity, they come back to Rocket at a rate 3x higher than the industry average. Our servicing and origination businesses work together, creating a powerful cycle of attracting new clients, organically creating new MSRs and keeping them for their next mortgage. This cycle creates lifelong clients multiplies future origination and profitability growth. As we've discussed before, we're actively investing to reinforce this growth cycle. In the second quarter, we acquired $21 billion of unpaid principal balance and 67,000 new service clients for $315 million. These clients are immediate candidates for a new purchase mortgage, home equity loan or even a rate in term refinance. Looking at the broader market, around 6 million purchase mortgages have been originated since 2022 at current rates or higher. We expect many of these buyers will be highly motivated to pursue a refinance even with a small drop in rate. In the past, consumers may have looked for a 60 to 75 basis point rate reduction to make the benefit worthwhile. Traditionally, getting a mortgage was a painful process for clients that could take up to 90 days before they start to see monthly savings. Today, at Rocket Mortgage, we're seeing clients refinance for less than a 50 basis point rate benefit, thanks to our fast and easy process with the majority of clients closing in 2 weeks or less. Consider a borrower with a $400,000 mortgage, a 40 basis point rate reduction translates to a monthly savings of nearly $150. This difference is significant, especially as households feel the pinch of inflation. That money is a week's worth of groceries for the average household. From a capital perspective, Rocket's strong balance sheet and substantial liquidity continued to serve as a major competitive advantage and provide us with tremendous flexibility to invest for growth. We ended the second quarter with $3.2 billion of available cash and $7.2 billion of mortgage servicing rights. Together, these assets represent a total of approximately $10.4 billion of value on our balance sheet. Our $3.2 billion of available cash consists of $1.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet an additional $1.9 billion of corporate cash used to self-fund loan originations. As of June 30, total liquidity stood at approximately $8.6 billion including available cash plus undrawn lines of credit. Subsequent to June 30, we renewed our 3-year $1.150 billion revolving credit facility with more than 10 major banking partners participating. This fully committed facility which is typically reserved for investment-grade institutions and is unmatched by any of our peers further underscores our creditworthiness and strong financial standing. Having access to a range of diverse funding sources offers us great optionality to allocate capital and be opportunistic about investing for growth. whether through the acquisition of MSRs or other strategic options. For the third quarter of 2024, our guidance reflects trends observed to date with 1 month of actual performance. Although housing inventory is gradually recovering, high home prices and challenging affordability persists, an uncertain macroeconomic environment and a subdued spring home buying season have capped potential buyers on the sidelines. We anticipate the mortgage market in Q3 will mirror the conditions of Q2. We expect adjusted revenue to be in the range of $1.150 billion to $1.300 billion. Regarding operating expenses, we expect Q3 to be flat compared to Q2. As always, our forward-looking guidance is based on our current outlook and visibility. We are fired up in executing with momentum to achieve our mission to help everyone home. Our assets and financial strength provide us with a competitive advantage to transform the homeownership market. I'm so excited to host everyone at our first Investor Day in Detroit on September 10. We have some fantastic immersive experiences in store that will showcase what we've launched to make homeownership easier and simpler. With that, we are ready to turn it back over to the operator for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark DeVries from Deutsche Bank.\nMark DeVries: Yes. Thanks for the comments on your 3Q outlook. I was hoping you could give us a little bit of additional context for kind of your overall market view an outlook in the Q3 guidance? And how might that change if we start to get Fed easing and the long end of the curve moves down some?\nVarun Krishna: Mark, thank you for the question. I appreciate it. I'll start by just sharing a couple of thoughts and ask Brian to jump in. I think the first thing is just I think the operative question is really not if the market will rebound. It's really when and how. And while we might not know exactly when we do know that '24 is better than '23 and we believe that '25 is going to be better than 24%. And if you look at the data, whether it's Fannie or the MBA, et cetera, we roughly believe that the mortgage market is going to be around $1.7 trillion. Now the good news is that's up 8% versus '23. So it's still well below the average but we're starting to see some signs of gradual improvement. But that said, we're not seeing exactly the same upswing that you would typically associate with the spring buying season. But with that said and when you look at homeownership overall, it's still a huge market. It's still a $5 trillion overall category and it's an industry that's existed with basically no modernization. So regardless, our philosophical view is that we're determined to take share and we have a track record of taking share in essentially any market. I do just want to share 3 things that give me confidence that Rocket will be accelerated uniquely within our outlook and what gives us optimism. And I think the first one is just quite simply our focus and our track record. I mean there's a reason why we're the number 2 player in purchase, excluding correspondent. And if you look at the results of our execution and hard work this quarter and consistency quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year and those are important proof points. The second is just there are industry tailwinds that are just realities in which we operate that are going to be headwinds for others and tailwinds for us, whether it's the capacity that's coming out of the industry by gains whether it's the increased regulation of things like Basel III, whether it's just kind of the dynamic of fragmentation and consolidation and this AI paradigm shift that we're all going through, these are important dynamics that will determine winners and losers in this space. And we feel confident that they will benefit us disproportionately. And then the last thing I would just say before I turn it over to Brian to talk a little more about the guide and some of the external macro is that we have very unique assets. We have assets that will disrupt every aspect of the homeownership journey. It's not just our core businesses like home search, purchase, servicing, refinance, title, personal finance [ph]. It's the fact that these business lines are underpinned by significant data, talent culture, scale and an iconic brand. And so when you put all of that together, it reflects a company that's looking to grow share in a large market. And so when we talk about optimism in our market outlook, this is for me, what reinforces that.\nBrian Brown: Yes, Mark, I'll touch on the guidance piece. As usual, we include all the information, all the data leading right up to the call. I'm thinking about where to set the guide. But we're still only a month in so you got 2/3 to go. But I think there's a couple of points just worth noting. One is you may have seen the MBA purchase application data in the month of July. The MBA study was down 10% when you compare it to June. I mean I'll say that's a bit unexpected to Varun's point around what the traditional home buying season looks like July is usually a pretty robust month. And then secondly, it's just worth noting that September is traditionally the lowest month kids get back to school, usually want to have the home or be in the home by that period of time. So September is when you start to see it trailing off. So I think when you put all that together, there's a view you could get to where Q3 is probably going to be flat to Q2 or perhaps even a little bit down. Now of course, we saw some rate relief come through today which is always good. But nonetheless, I don't think there's a little bit of uncertainty. I'll just touch on the gain on sale margin piece. We've said a lot that we expected gain on sale margin expansion from 2022 levels. And the 299 basis points in Q2 was really healthy. And when we lumped into the third quarter, I feel good about those levels being relatively consistent. So I think if I had to summarize it, you look at the guide and it's, of course, a bit tempered because of some of the uncertainty with how the home buying season will shake out. But to be clear, it definitely includes the confidence in our belief to take share through the quarter and beyond.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan McKeveny from Zelman & Associates.\nRyan McKeveny: Varun and Brian, nice job in the quarter. I wanted to dig in a little bit on the share gains you're seeing on the purchase side of things. I guess I'm curious if you're seeing any mix changes in the types of buyers that you're originating, whether it's first-time buyers, move-up and kind of weather the share gains you're seeing are being driven by a certain cohort or type of buyer? And secondarily, I guess a 2-part question on the purchase side. Are the share gains apparent in both DTC and partner or any differences in the purchase trends between those segments?\nVarun Krishna: Thank you for the question, Ryan. I would just start by saying that profitable market share growth is our defining North Star metric. That is something that strategically across the company is a top line imperative. And I would just highlight a couple of control points that we've really focused on in a durable way to achieve this metric. The first thing I would just highlight is innovation. Across the board, we're innovating faster than ever. We're building deeper, better experiences and we've increased the velocity of high-impact innovation by releasing at a higher cadence. In fact, we're doing product and digital and experience releases almost weekly now. The second thing I would just say is we have increased our focus. We have restructured the way that we execute and we have operationalized against a new, what we call, a mission-based autonomous structure. That means that we have autonomous teams that are gold driven, that are working hard to execute against clearly defined metrics. And then the third thing I would highlight is that we've taken what we call a full funnel approach to every aspect of the business which means that we consider every single element of funnel, whether it's how we deliberately engaged with our massive servicing portfolio, improvements to performance marketing, whether that's better targeting, better creative, better channel mix optimization, tuning our front doors. And then all the way through the digital experience, making that more streamlined and then obviously, optimizing our sales and operations motion against specific workflows, whether it's purchase, refi servicing. And this is just to name a few of the things that we've done. Specific to purchase, one of the things I would just highlight is that we're really doubling down on our focus on purchase as a top line strategic imperative. And so you're going to start to see us innovate further and faster here. whether it's existing product innovation like buys or the new AI-based verified approval letter adjustments that we're starting to see major traction because we're meeting our clients where they are, through to the development of new purchase offerings that are more focused on our retained based better segmentation of our clients, understanding our clients, whether they are first-time homebuyers, female head of household, Latino, understanding demographics, segmentation and then leveraging our data to connect deeper with home search, optimizing the top of funnel for our purchase. So lots and lots of images across the board. But bit by bit, these interests start to stack up and that really reflects on some of the improvements that we started to see and we're still just scratching the surface of what is really possible. And then I'll ask Brian to maybe comment a little bit further.\nBrian Brown: Sure. Yes, Ryan. Good to hear from you. Just 2 things for me. One, on your channel question, where the share gains are coming from. The answer is it's definitely both. It's definitely the direct-to-consumer and TPO. And then just lastly, on sort of the demographic attributes in terms of where the share gains are coming to. One of the things we've talked a lot about in this market is the first-time homebuyers. While they're not immune to some of the affordability challenges and down payments can be tough. They're also not trading a 3% or low or no rate for a higher rate. So we've talked a lot about this but we skew very high in terms of share, in terms of first-time homebuyers, given our digital experience and the way we interact with clients through chat. So we think that's a big piece of share gains as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley.\nJeff Adelson: This is Jeff Adelson. I was curious if you could maybe just dive in a little bit on the gain on sale dynamic this quarter? And it seems like it held up a little bit better. I'm just wondering if you're seeing some more excess capacity come out, just kind of feeding into the broader dynamic of you taking share, maybe a little bit less competition there? And why you feel that should be stable from here?\nBrian Brown: Yes. Thanks, Jeff. I can comment on that. Yes, we've been really happy with the progress and gain on sale margins. If you were to chart it over the past 2 years, you've seen some pretty decent growth. We've always said and I believe at that the number 1 thing, there's a number of things that can impact gain on sale margins but is capacity in the price competitive nature of this business. So it's absolutely contributing to that. We talked a lot about the consolidation and the capacity coming out of the system but it's probably worth noting, too, that we traditionally had higher gain on sale margins and it's also just because of great execution. We have a best-in-class capital markets team. And when you operate in all 50 states and 3,000 counties, you can create very diversified pools of loans and bond holders are willing to pay a premium for that diversification and scale. So that always helps as well.\nJeff Adelson: Okay. Could you just maybe -- as my follow-up, could you maybe just comment a little bit on the outlook for profitability from here? You've got 2 consecutive quarters of double-digit EBITDA margin. I don't think you've been there since late 2021, early '22. Your contribution margins are holding up nicely in the different segments. Just curious if you think that can continue to expand from here or if you're a little bit more reliant on the volumes continuing to increase for that to happen?\nVarun Krishna: I'll just add a couple of quick thoughts towards profitability. At the end of the day, philosophically, profitability is going to be driven by a couple of key things: how well you execute, how efficient you are and then the big swings that you choose to intentionally take. And so in service to that, at the end of the day, market share, top line growth is our number 1 priority. Now of course, we're going to run an efficient business. And that's a strategic imperative as well. And there's always room to go. And we definitely think we can scale up significantly while keeping our fixed costs roughly the same. And philosophically, the reason we believe in that is because that's how you build a durable growth business for the long run. Now I think as you know, we made $225 million of adjusted EBITDA in Q2. That's an 18% margin and we believe we can grow that further. And we are leaning seriously into AI because we believe that will increase our operating leverage significantly. And so that capacity will come from AI investments and allow us to be more productive. And so in summary, investing in operational efficiency, driving major innovation that's in AI. Making our organization orders of magnitude more productive is how we believe we will accelerate our normalized profitability.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Derek Sommers from Jefferies.\nDerek Sommers: Now that we've had volume bounce off trough levels from seasonality and the 30-year mortgage rate seems to be cooperating a bit. Can you talk about -- a little bit about Rocket's incremental capacity for originations? Will recent investments in and Rocket Logic alleviate any of the typical operational bottlenecks?\nVarun Krishna: Sure. Let me comment on AR and then I'll ask Brian to just jump into some of what we're seeing in terms of capacity. And I'll just start by saying that from a resource perspective, AI is our most strategic imperative and we are resourcing this to win. And there are real reasons that we're so vested in this because we see tangible concrete metric-driven benefits of efficiency, velocity and, most importantly, a better experience. And so Rocket Logic continues to advance. It's not built into every part of our experience whether it's the data workflow to document management to the tools that are actually powering our team members end to end in terms of how they drive the client experience. As we shared earlier, we're now generating 300,000 transcripts every week. That is a massive data set and that data is actually automating 113 fields on a mortgage application that would have to be entered manually. As we talked about already, we've seen a multitude of benefits from the earliest days of our generative AI-powered chat experience and we're just starting to lean in much more heavily there. And then we're using all this data to actually refine and train our models and our workflows further. So more volume results in a better AI system that we'll continue to learn and improve and make us better. So I would just say for us, this AI thing is not hype, right? Like we see concrete tangible benefits. We see our safe, we see faster call resolution. We see faster turn times. We see 100% accuracy on verification. And these are the earliest stages. And then the other thing I would add before I pass it over to Brian is we're also investing deeply in talent, like we're not standing still. We've recently hired a CTO. We're making significant investments in data leadership and infrastructure. We brought AI talent to our Board. And we're also being very deliberate in terms of being strategic and what we build where we have strength which is how we partner with the best in the industry, whether that's OpenAI, AWS and Entropic, just name a few. So it's early days but we're very encouraged by some of the key improvements in metrics and so we're continuing to lean in there. Let me ask Brian to just talk a little more on capacity.\nBrian Brown: Yes. Sure, Varun. Thanks. And good to hear from you, Derek. The question we get asked a lot is like how do you think about the fixed cost structure. And we talked a lot about really keeping it flat. And I think there's 2 things that are worth noting there. One is like when you think about these AI investments, this is where we're deploying capital and resources. So that means we have to be really diligent and tough on the other side and looking for efficiencies and taking any slack out of the system so that we can continue to allocate capital to these very strategic initiatives. And then to your point on capacity, I mean, that's everything right now. We're happy with the fixed cost structure, 18% EBITDA margins in a quarter where I think we're going to look back and still say, yes, things may be getting better but this is still going to be a very low quarter in terms of the history of mortgages produced. So everything we're focused on right now is adding capacity to the system and doing it through efficient means in keeping the cost structure relatively similar.\nDerek Sommers: Got it. And then just to kind of follow up on the fixed cost structure there. I'm seeing an increase of $2.7 billion of net rate lock volume and only $23 million of incremental expense that ratio is going to hold up over time? Or any other color there would be helpful.\nBrian Brown: Yes. I mean, like we kind of look at it in 2 buckets, the fix and variable side. And the beauty about this business is once you clear those fixed costs, a really healthy chunk of that top line revenue drops to the bottom line and you have a nice compounding effect. And if you think about 18% EBITDA margins in this quarter, that means we, at some point, didn't clear that fixed cost hurdle. So the cost to produce, as we've talked about, has some -- you pay a commission to your loan officers, you incur some costs along the way. But in the big scheme of things, it's pretty small. So you got great leverage on your fixed cost base on the way up.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brad Capuzzi from Piper Sandler.\nBrad Capuzzi: Varun, Brian, you've been asking acquirers of higher coupon servicing portfolios which strategically does make sense to Rocket. Can you just give us color on these transactions and conversations? I know you mentioned a lot of demand and a little bit of supply last quarter. Have these dynamics changed over the recent months? And then what are the retention rates you assume on your MSR purchases? And how does this affect the prices paid on those purchases?\nVarun Krishna: Yes. Great. Thank you so much for the question. I wanted to start by talking a little bit about our strategy when it comes to servicing. And I'd start by saying that our servicing portfolio is an incredibly strategic asset because it allows us to play both offense and defense at the same time. So our approach to servicing and origination is very unique to Rocket in the sense that servicing is actually a source of future origination. And so the 2 things actually work as a flywheel where you create a cycle where you can attract a new client, you can organically create a new MSR and then you can actually support and build a relationship with that client as their lender for life. So computationally, our MSR includes not just the servicing cash flow but it also includes the future gain on sale from additional services and products that we can deliver to that client in an awesome way. And so when you add to that, we have very strong in-market recapture capability that's 3x higher than the industry. And so for that reason, we are investing strategically. We're going to keep growing our servicing portfolio, we're going to try our tranches strategically and we can provide new experiences to those clients, whether it's refinancing on falling rates, second lien loans for those who are looking to utilize equity and then, of course, originating new purchase loans as well. And underlying that, obviously, is our technology infrastructure and our client experience that allows us to do all of this with speed, with the light and ultimately value for our clients which is what we care about at the end of the day. And it's just very exciting to me that as of June 30, we had around $535 billion of unpaid balance in servicing. I have to just give a shout out again to our servicing team who is the best in the business, who recently won just last week, the tenth J.D. Power recognition for servicing. Let me ask Bryan to comment a little bit more on your question.\nBrian Brown: Brad, I think the key part of your question which is far the recapture and we talked a lot about to Varun's point, the 3x industry recapture rate. But I think honestly, the more exciting piece is that we're starting to learn through these acquisitions that we have a really nice recaptured on the acquired books. And if you think about what that does for us in terms of the market opportunity, it allows us to pay a premium in the sense of acquiring these because we're going to realize value that others in the space likely aren't going to realize. And it opens up a really exciting acquisition channel because we have our regular direct-to-consumer business, you have your TPO business and then now you have this acquisition channel via servicing from an inorganic perspective. So part of the hypothesis that need to be proven out was, hey, we know we do good on the clients that we originate and go through our J.D. Power winning origination experience and we know they love our service and to Varun's point, with our J.D. Power winning servicing experience. But when you're acquiring clients and you start to become their service or they haven't gone through your origination business and they haven't gotten to know you the same way. So there was a hypothesis that we would outperform the market there. And for a while, that's exactly what it was. But now that we've been acquiring and we have some actual historical data, it's only building our confidence in that space.\nBrad Capuzzi: And then just on expenses. Can you just give us an update on your expense management, both near term and long term and into 2025? I know you mentioned relatively flat quarter-over-quarter in 3Q but kind of how you're prioritizing investing for growth and driving operational efficiencies, both near and long term?\nBrian Brown: Yes. I think probably the only thing more I can say on that is it's operational efficiency and expense management is really part of our DNA and it's just part of running efficient and diligent business and we'll continue to do it. We've been really tough on the stuff that isn't key. In prior calls, I talked a lot about our relentless prioritization. So if things don't have the ROI that we expect in demand, we won't do them. We'll leave room for experimentation and the things that are working, we're going to put more capital to them as anyone would expect us to do. But on one hand, we're being really tough and looking for all the operational efficiencies we can. And then as we're freeing up some space, we're putting capital towards things like tech and AI and data, all the things that we believe will change the game here.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harter from UBS.\nDoug Harter: I was hoping you could talk about the -- how you're seeing the durability of demand for home equity and kind of what you see as the limiting factors for continuing to grow that, whether that be consumer demand or investor appetite to purchase the loans?\nVarun Krishna: Thank you for the question, Doug. I'll just start by saying that this is a great example of product market set. It's the perfect product for the current market. And we've seen strong demand. The product volume has more than doubled year-over-year. That's because it's an offering that's incredibly valuable to our clients, right? They're using that money to fund a remodel, they're using it to consolidate debt. They're using it to pay for the inevitable life events that we may experience. And they're able to do that without affecting their favorable rates. And that's because they have $32 trillion of equity to tap into. And I'm incredibly proud that Rocket is now amongst the top players in the entire market. We've essentially created a market here. And by adding in the second lien, we're able to increase the weighted average coupon which then leads to potential refinance as well. And what I love about this is that this is just the beginning. I think we can go significantly further here because, as Brian said, it underscores the strength of our capital markets team and infrastructure which is second to none in the business. And we're continuing to improve it. We launched in what's called an AVM or automated valuation model in Q2 which means clients can actually get cash in as little as 7 days and they can actually close 7 days faster than a traditional rate in term refi. We can consolidate their first and second lien mortgages. So when interest rates inevitably decline, they're able to unlock additional value. And then I think perhaps best of all, in my opinion, is that the vast majority of clients who come to us are actually new to rocket. So it's a great business. It's a healthy business and we're just continuing to improve continuously.\nOperator: And we have time for one more question. That question comes from the line of Rick Shane from JPMorgan.\nRick Shane: The commentary on technology is fascinating. And one of the things that's always been the big opportunity for Rocket is the push into purchase and realistically, I think there's going to be a generational shift in terms of how consumers interact with financial institutions. Are you finding that the penetration or market share for first-time homebuyers who represent that emerging generation of buyers is actually higher than purchase penetration for existing homebuyers or second-time homebuyers, I should say?\nVarun Krishna: Thank you for the question, Rick. I'll just start by saying that purchase is a strategically elevated priority for us compared to the past. And there's a lot that you have to do to really make sure that you understand how to build a profitable, successful growing purchase funnel. The starting point of purchase is really understanding your client and meeting them where they are. And for that reason, we're investing significantly in segmenting our clients and really understanding that the dynamics of a first-time homebuyer are different from a second-time home buyer. The way that we engage with our service base to understand how to help them find a new purchase loan is different. The way that we engage with home search and really nurture and build intent with our clients, the way that we create an optimized funnel end to end and introduce new products and services and be able to bet on AI-based experiences and leverage things like chat and generative AI are all a big part of our purchase strategy. One of the things that I think is really important is how we think about servicing as a source of purchase origination. Another area of investment is really doubling down on our broker platform end to end. And that's a big part of our purchase strategy as well and that's a very important client that we want to continue to serve. So I would say that across the board, we're really resurrecting an end-to-end view of how to build a profitable, successful growing purchase business. That includes segmenting our clients, building experiences that meet them where they are, investing big in technology and automation, understanding how to nurture them and their intent throughout the home buying journey which can often be complex and long. And by sort of achieving all of these things is how we think we're going to grow and purchase and then obviously, resourcing this as a strategic priority from the top down is something that we're really, really excited about.\nRick Shane: Got it. It makes sense. Look, I think you guys will benefit from a generational shift. I just think about how my kids interact with financial institutions versus how I do and I think that will be transformative in terms of the purchase market.\nVarun Krishna: We agree.\nOperator: That concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Varun Krishna for some closing remarks.\nVarun Krishna: Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We're really excited about Investor Day on September 10. We hope to see all of you there. And we look forward to connecting with you next quarter. Thank you again for listening to the call.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brian Brown",
            "content": "Thank you, Varun and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll cover our financial performance and provide an update on our investments in growth, particularly in technology and servicing. I'll close with our outlook and guidance for the third quarter. You heard Varun share the passion behind executing our AI-powered homeownership strategy, all in service of our mission to help everyone home. Our mission is so important because we bring people the pride and joy that only homeownership can offer. In pursuit of this mission, we're breaking new ground. We're transforming the homeownership experience from one traditionally filled with stress and complexity into a radically easier and simpler process for everyone. Rocket has a unique opportunity to transform the fragmented $5 trillion homeownership market. We have all the ingredients for success, an unrivaled combination of talent, assets, capabilities and culture. We're just getting started and I couldn't be more excited for the opportunity ahead of us. We are not just imagining the future of homeownership we are building it. Now on to the second quarter results. We delivered a strong second quarter, growing purchase market share, revenue and profitability year-over-year. Our growth was particularly impressive against the backdrop of a contracting market. as industry purchase applications declined to their lowest second quarter in 30 years. Adjusted revenue came in at $1.228 billion, above the high end of our guidance range. This represents a 23% increase from the second quarter of 2023 and our fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. Reflecting on our performance this past quarter, several wins come to mind, a double-digit lift in purchase conversions due to marketing optimization, record volume for home equity product and a 30% increase in our agent network attachment rates, driven by demand for buys. We generated $25.1 billion in net rate lock volume, a 13% increase year-over-year. Gain on sale margin was 299 basis points or an increase of 32 basis points compared to the same period last year. Our continued focus on driving top line growth and improvements in operational efficiency combined to make the second quarter our most profitable quarter in 2 years. Adjusted EBITDA increased year-over-year for the fifth straight quarter to $225 million or a margin of 18%. We also reported adjusted net income of $121 million and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.06. In the first half of 2024, we generated nearly $0.5 billion more in adjusted EBITDA than the same period in 2023. While we are pleased with the progress we have made over the past year we believe our true long-term earnings potential is much greater. We see significant room for more top line growth and higher operating leverage as our AI investments gain even more traction. Varun took us through some examples of how AI drives velocity, accuracy, personalization and operational efficiency for our business. One of the breakthroughs that I'm particularly excited about is our AI-powered live chat which will pave the way for further scale and operational efficiency. AI-powered live chat is a prime example of delivering personalized and fast client experiences while supercharging our team members at scale. Chat is the clear choice for our clients, a quick way to get personalized answers. Chat empowers our team members to support multiple clients at the same time, freeing up their capacity. Through chat, we identified client intent upfront and guide our clients to the right resource which can include connecting them with one of our expert mortgage bankers. With client intent and call purpose match to the right banker, these live conversations are more personalized and engaging. We're seeing these benefits pay off in our business. Chat helps us scale up to a better client experience leading to higher conversion in operational efficiency. In fact, we're seeing clients who use chat convert 3x better than those who don't. There is much more potential to unleash. AI enables us to do significantly more without adding more resources which unlocks capacity. When the market inflects, we believe AI will help us drive growth at scale while keeping fixed cost flat. Now turning to our servicing portfolio, a strategic asset that's worth much more than the $7 billion on our balance sheet. Our servicing asset plays an important role in growing our mortgage origination business. Let me impact this a little more. Clients choose Rocket for the convenience and J.D. Power award-winning service, experiencing how easy it is to get a mortgage with us. Once they get their mortgage, they move to our servicing platform where they continue to enjoy J.D. Power award-winning service. So it's no surprise that when they're ready to buy their next home, lower their mortgage rate or tap into their homes equity, they come back to Rocket at a rate 3x higher than the industry average. Our servicing and origination businesses work together, creating a powerful cycle of attracting new clients, organically creating new MSRs and keeping them for their next mortgage. This cycle creates lifelong clients multiplies future origination and profitability growth. As we've discussed before, we're actively investing to reinforce this growth cycle. In the second quarter, we acquired $21 billion of unpaid principal balance and 67,000 new service clients for $315 million. These clients are immediate candidates for a new purchase mortgage, home equity loan or even a rate in term refinance. Looking at the broader market, around 6 million purchase mortgages have been originated since 2022 at current rates or higher. We expect many of these buyers will be highly motivated to pursue a refinance even with a small drop in rate. In the past, consumers may have looked for a 60 to 75 basis point rate reduction to make the benefit worthwhile. Traditionally, getting a mortgage was a painful process for clients that could take up to 90 days before they start to see monthly savings. Today, at Rocket Mortgage, we're seeing clients refinance for less than a 50 basis point rate benefit, thanks to our fast and easy process with the majority of clients closing in 2 weeks or less. Consider a borrower with a $400,000 mortgage, a 40 basis point rate reduction translates to a monthly savings of nearly $150. This difference is significant, especially as households feel the pinch of inflation. That money is a week's worth of groceries for the average household. From a capital perspective, Rocket's strong balance sheet and substantial liquidity continued to serve as a major competitive advantage and provide us with tremendous flexibility to invest for growth. We ended the second quarter with $3.2 billion of available cash and $7.2 billion of mortgage servicing rights. Together, these assets represent a total of approximately $10.4 billion of value on our balance sheet. Our $3.2 billion of available cash consists of $1.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet an additional $1.9 billion of corporate cash used to self-fund loan originations. As of June 30, total liquidity stood at approximately $8.6 billion including available cash plus undrawn lines of credit. Subsequent to June 30, we renewed our 3-year $1.150 billion revolving credit facility with more than 10 major banking partners participating. This fully committed facility which is typically reserved for investment-grade institutions and is unmatched by any of our peers further underscores our creditworthiness and strong financial standing. Having access to a range of diverse funding sources offers us great optionality to allocate capital and be opportunistic about investing for growth. whether through the acquisition of MSRs or other strategic options. For the third quarter of 2024, our guidance reflects trends observed to date with 1 month of actual performance. Although housing inventory is gradually recovering, high home prices and challenging affordability persists, an uncertain macroeconomic environment and a subdued spring home buying season have capped potential buyers on the sidelines. We anticipate the mortgage market in Q3 will mirror the conditions of Q2. We expect adjusted revenue to be in the range of $1.150 billion to $1.300 billion. Regarding operating expenses, we expect Q3 to be flat compared to Q2. As always, our forward-looking guidance is based on our current outlook and visibility. We are fired up in executing with momentum to achieve our mission to help everyone home. Our assets and financial strength provide us with a competitive advantage to transform the homeownership market. I'm so excited to host everyone at our first Investor Day in Detroit on September 10. We have some fantastic immersive experiences in store that will showcase what we've launched to make homeownership easier and simpler. With that, we are ready to turn it back over to the operator for questions. Yes, Mark, I'll touch on the guidance piece. As usual, we include all the information, all the data leading right up to the call. I'm thinking about where to set the guide. But we're still only a month in so you got 2/3 to go. But I think there's a couple of points just worth noting. One is you may have seen the MBA purchase application data in the month of July. The MBA study was down 10% when you compare it to June. I mean I'll say that's a bit unexpected to Varun's point around what the traditional home buying season looks like July is usually a pretty robust month. And then secondly, it's just worth noting that September is traditionally the lowest month kids get back to school, usually want to have the home or be in the home by that period of time. So September is when you start to see it trailing off. So I think when you put all that together, there's a view you could get to where Q3 is probably going to be flat to Q2 or perhaps even a little bit down. Now of course, we saw some rate relief come through today which is always good. But nonetheless, I don't think there's a little bit of uncertainty. I'll just touch on the gain on sale margin piece. We've said a lot that we expected gain on sale margin expansion from 2022 levels. And the 299 basis points in Q2 was really healthy. And when we lumped into the third quarter, I feel good about those levels being relatively consistent. So I think if I had to summarize it, you look at the guide and it's, of course, a bit tempered because of some of the uncertainty with how the home buying season will shake out. But to be clear, it definitely includes the confidence in our belief to take share through the quarter and beyond. Sure. Yes, Ryan. Good to hear from you. Just 2 things for me. One, on your channel question, where the share gains are coming from. The answer is it's definitely both. It's definitely the direct-to-consumer and TPO. And then just lastly, on sort of the demographic attributes in terms of where the share gains are coming to. One of the things we've talked a lot about in this market is the first-time homebuyers. While they're not immune to some of the affordability challenges and down payments can be tough. They're also not trading a 3% or low or no rate for a higher rate. So we've talked a lot about this but we skew very high in terms of share, in terms of first-time homebuyers, given our digital experience and the way we interact with clients through chat. So we think that's a big piece of share gains as well. Yes. Thanks, Jeff. I can comment on that. Yes, we've been really happy with the progress and gain on sale margins. If you were to chart it over the past 2 years, you've seen some pretty decent growth. We've always said and I believe at that the number 1 thing, there's a number of things that can impact gain on sale margins but is capacity in the price competitive nature of this business. So it's absolutely contributing to that. We talked a lot about the consolidation and the capacity coming out of the system but it's probably worth noting, too, that we traditionally had higher gain on sale margins and it's also just because of great execution. We have a best-in-class capital markets team. And when you operate in all 50 states and 3,000 counties, you can create very diversified pools of loans and bond holders are willing to pay a premium for that diversification and scale. So that always helps as well. Yes. Sure, Varun. Thanks. And good to hear from you, Derek. The question we get asked a lot is like how do you think about the fixed cost structure. And we talked a lot about really keeping it flat. And I think there's 2 things that are worth noting there. One is like when you think about these AI investments, this is where we're deploying capital and resources. So that means we have to be really diligent and tough on the other side and looking for efficiencies and taking any slack out of the system so that we can continue to allocate capital to these very strategic initiatives. And then to your point on capacity, I mean, that's everything right now. We're happy with the fixed cost structure, 18% EBITDA margins in a quarter where I think we're going to look back and still say, yes, things may be getting better but this is still going to be a very low quarter in terms of the history of mortgages produced. So everything we're focused on right now is adding capacity to the system and doing it through efficient means in keeping the cost structure relatively similar. Yes. I mean, like we kind of look at it in 2 buckets, the fix and variable side. And the beauty about this business is once you clear those fixed costs, a really healthy chunk of that top line revenue drops to the bottom line and you have a nice compounding effect. And if you think about 18% EBITDA margins in this quarter, that means we, at some point, didn't clear that fixed cost hurdle. So the cost to produce, as we've talked about, has some -- you pay a commission to your loan officers, you incur some costs along the way. But in the big scheme of things, it's pretty small. So you got great leverage on your fixed cost base on the way up. Brad, I think the key part of your question which is far the recapture and we talked a lot about to Varun's point, the 3x industry recapture rate. But I think honestly, the more exciting piece is that we're starting to learn through these acquisitions that we have a really nice recaptured on the acquired books. And if you think about what that does for us in terms of the market opportunity, it allows us to pay a premium in the sense of acquiring these because we're going to realize value that others in the space likely aren't going to realize. And it opens up a really exciting acquisition channel because we have our regular direct-to-consumer business, you have your TPO business and then now you have this acquisition channel via servicing from an inorganic perspective. So part of the hypothesis that need to be proven out was, hey, we know we do good on the clients that we originate and go through our J.D. Power winning origination experience and we know they love our service and to Varun's point, with our J.D. Power winning servicing experience. But when you're acquiring clients and you start to become their service or they haven't gone through your origination business and they haven't gotten to know you the same way. So there was a hypothesis that we would outperform the market there. And for a while, that's exactly what it was. But now that we've been acquiring and we have some actual historical data, it's only building our confidence in that space. Yes. I think probably the only thing more I can say on that is it's operational efficiency and expense management is really part of our DNA and it's just part of running efficient and diligent business and we'll continue to do it. We've been really tough on the stuff that isn't key. In prior calls, I talked a lot about our relentless prioritization. So if things don't have the ROI that we expect in demand, we won't do them. We'll leave room for experimentation and the things that are working, we're going to put more capital to them as anyone would expect us to do. But on one hand, we're being really tough and looking for all the operational efficiencies we can. And then as we're freeing up some space, we're putting capital towards things like tech and AI and data, all the things that we believe will change the game here."

            "content": "Thanks, Sharon. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to the Rocket Companies Q2 2024 earnings call. As I reflect, it is hard to believe that it's been almost a year since I joined Rocket and what an accelerating journey it has been. This Rocket is fueled by the passion of our team members who are the driving force behind everything that we do. They are led and inspired by an unrivaled leadership team, each bringing decades of experience and knowledge, ranging from fintech and mortgage capital markets and AI, the marketing, product, operations, sales and so much more. Together, we're blazing new trails pioneering experiences that will redefine how consumers experience the homeownership journey now and into the future. Our mission is to help everyone home. That means we are obsessed with making homeownership easier and more accessible for everyone. It's not just a business goal. It's our higher calling. We consider ourselves the most optimistic company in America because every day, we make 30-year bets on people who make 30-year bets on themselves. The need for hope and optimism has never been greater in our country. We're navigating through challenging times and unpredictability is the new normal. Despite some signs of gradual recovery in home listings and sales, affordability remains at historic lows due to persistently high mortgage rates and rising home prices. This past spring, the industry experienced a weak home buying activity with purchase applications dropping to their lowest levels in over 3 decades. Macro uncertainty and affordability issues are keeping potential buyers on the sidelines while consolidation continues with smaller players being acquired or exiting the market. Mortgage employment has decreased by 36% from its peak. Yet in the face of these challenges, optimism remains our mantra and higher calling. While others are faltering or retreating, we're mobilizing our immense resources, capabilities and talent to innovate and serve our clients like never before. It is our moment to show our unshakable resilience grow from strength and redefine our leadership role in the homeownership category as the most optimistic company in America. On that backdrop, let's go a little deeper on the second quarter when we demonstrated growth despite industry challenges. Most importantly, we achieved profitable market share growth, our north star metric and expanded purchase share year-over-year through numerous optimizations in our processes, teams, marketing and technology capabilities. This quarter, we delivered strong financial results, generating $1.228 billion in adjusted revenue, above the high end of our guidance range and grew year-over-year for the fourth straight quarter. We expanded adjusted EBITDA margins quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year through both top line growth and our continued focus on operational efficiency. We reported $0.06 of adjusted earnings per diluted share for the quarter. Solid execution is the lifeblood of our business and our AI-powered initiatives stand at the forefront. I'd like to spend just a few minutes highlighting 4 key achievements this quarter. Our AI-powered live chat for clients Rocket Logic Assistant for banking, growth in home equity loans and automation and servicing. I'll start with our AI-powered live chat experience. We have expanded this interface throughout the client journey from early inquiries using tools like the mortgage calculator to live help with applications and servicing questions on escrow and payments. Chat is an absolute game changer for us. Our live chat interface is so much more than just the communication tool. It's a strategic advantage that enhances engagement with deep personalization drives efficiency and ultimately improve outcomes for our clients and business at scale. Chat is the asynchronous communication mode of choice in today's SaaS-based world favored by both, older and newer generations, 80% of our clients prefer chat. They love the instant responses and 24/7 availability that allow them to manage their mortgage based on their individual preferences and needs. The beauty of chat lies in its scalability and versatility which seamlessly complements our traditional phone interactions. We're not just responding faster with Chat. We're providing an experience that is more personalized and tailored. We can quickly gauge client intent and direct them to the best solutions, whether they need immediate answers or deeper discussions with the right expert team member. And by leveraging generative AI, we can deliver great client experiences at scale by handling more interactions and keeping more clients engaged with better automation. The result of AI-powered chat is a resounding win, win, win, happier clients, satisfied team members and clear business value. Recent data shows that clients using chat had conversion rates 3x higher compared to those who didn't leverage chat. Building on these successes, we are expanding chat across more client and journey touch points including purchase which we launched 2 weeks ago. The next example is the rollout of Rocket Logic Assistant to our entire banking force, helping our clients navigate the home buying journey. This AI-powered personal assistant transcribes client calls and automatically completes mortgage applications in real time, supercharging our banker productivity. Gone are the days of manual note taking with hands on keyboard or pen and paper which would fatigue our bankers and leave gaps in client conversations. Now the Rocket Logic Assistant seamlessly generates over 300,000 detailed transcripts every week from outbound calls. It supports over 100 data points on mortgage applications saving our bankers from inputting tens of millions of data fields each week. This enhances efficiency allows us to closely monitor calls and extract valuable client insights while also creating recursive models and feedback loops to continuously improve our bankers' performance and more effectively train each new generation of the best bankers in the country. Next, our home equity loan origination volume reached an all-time high in Q2, more than doubling from a year ago. Home equity loans continue to resonate with our clients as we help them unlock record levels of home equity while still being able to keep their favorable rates on their first lien mortgages. Additionally, we enhanced the speed and efficiency of our home equity loan process through the launch of an automated valuation model or AVM. AVM represents a major upgrade, providing a cost-efficient digital alternative to traditional in-person appraisals. This innovation allows us to deliver cash from home equity loans in as little as 7 days meeting our clients' needs with unprecedented speed and accuracy. Finally, we've made significant strides in expanding our servicing portfolio, a strategic asset that complements our origination business. We're retaining clients for the next transaction at rates 3x higher than the industry average, positioning ourselves as their lender for life and generating recurring cash flow without additional acquisition costs. Our advantage lies in providing technology-powered class-leading service to 2.6 million clients and leveraging rich data profiles to continuously understand their needs for life. In the second quarter, we acquired 5 MSR portfolios, adding 67,000 new clients and approximately $21 billion in unpaid principal balance. The loans in these acquired MSRs have a blended weighted average coupon higher than our current portfolio, opening up a range of products and services for these new clients. From refinance options that capitalize on declining rates to home equity loans for those looking to leverage their home equity and new purchase loans for clients ready for their next home, we offer a comprehensive suite of solutions to meet diverse client needs across the spectrum. We've also become more operationally efficient in this space. Traditionally, MSR trailing document audits required manually sifting through extensive documents to verify data for each loan which could take months for a single portfolio. With our upgraded workflow automation, our capital markets team can now complete MSR audits in half the time. This enhancement allows us to onboard MSR portfolios more quickly, efficiently and accurately which is essential as we expand our portfolio. We've built a powerhouse technology suite for servicing that enables us to scale and deliver outstanding client service. The recent launch of MSR audit automation streamlines the first step of the loan onboarding process. Our AI-powered self-serve phone and chat tool drive efficiency and provide exceptional service to millions of clients. Additionally, Rocket Synopsis, a tool leveraging generative AI listens to transcribe and search as client calls, analyzing sentiment and reporting client patterns and preferences. Furthermore, features like live chat, real-time transcription and tagging are enhancing the value of our data lake and AI-powered solutions. This infrastructure supports recursive feedback loops that continuously refine and train our models. Our structured data lake aggregates and organizes information, making it readily accessible to our data scientists and technology teams. And from this repository, our models extract deep insights and analytics, enabling us to deliver exceptional client experiences and maximize team effectiveness. As we roll out new solutions and increase the usage of existing ones, we gather more data, creating an AI flywheel that accelerates velocity, enhances accuracy, personalizes interactions and optimizes operational efficiency across our business. As a former software engineer, I'm going to keep breaking out for the next minute and talk about some of the deeper technology that powers our rocket ship, leveraging our data and modeling tools like TensorFlow, faster region convolutional neural network models and efficient net V2 L CARES [ph] models, our technology fully automates high-volume tasks such as document processing, appraisal reviews and income verification. With ground-breaking methods like this, we've already been able to bypass human intervention on nearly 10% of all appraisals in April 2024, saving 1,701 hours for collateral underwriting alone. Hopefully, you're still with me. Let's talk about another AI concept called Retrieval Augmented Generation or REG. REG is a way to supercharge the utility of GenAI by adding your own data into the conversation. We're using this technique in our Rocket Logic platform, allowing team members to dive deep into all facets of a loan and provide in-the-moment insights and assistance. We're also able to leverage our own data and best practice documentation to assist our engineering teams and to provide an easily accessible natural language interface over our data analytics platform. This provides all of our teams with the context and data they need to make the best decisions for our clients where and when they need it. We work closely with amazing partners like AWS, Entropic, OpenAI and others to stay on a cutting edge of research and techniques to make the most out of GenAI and this will only increase going into the future. As I conclude, I want to give a huge shout out to our amazing servicing team for winning our tenth J.D. Power award for servicing just last week. This achievement further cements Rocket Mortgage as the most awarded company for mortgage servicing and the most awarded mortgage company overall, something we will continue to work hard to earn day after day and year after year. In closing, I am so proud of our strong execution in the second quarter but this is just the beginning. The 4 examples we've discussed all share a common theme. They illustrate how AI both enhances client experiences and boost team productivity through improved velocity, accuracy, personalization and operational efficiency. While many companies aspire to be AI-centric you have the right blend of talent, assets and mist to succeed. I believe that Rocket is exceptionally well positioned to execute on our AI-fueled homeownership strategy and I look forward to sharing our continued progress with you each quarter. Lastly, we are thrilled to invite you to Detroit on September 10 for Rocket's first ever Investor Day. This is your opportunity to go behind the scenes, meet our leadership experience our company culture and innovation first-hand and discover what makes Rocket rock. We're also excited to showcase our beautiful city of Detroit and I look forward to seeing all of you there. And with that, I will turn it over to Brian. Mark, thank you for the question. I appreciate it. I'll start by just sharing a couple of thoughts and ask Brian to jump in. I think the first thing is just I think the operative question is really not if the market will rebound. It's really when and how. And while we might not know exactly when we do know that '24 is better than '23 and we believe that '25 is going to be better than 24%. And if you look at the data, whether it's Fannie or the MBA, et cetera, we roughly believe that the mortgage market is going to be around $1.7 trillion. Now the good news is that's up 8% versus '23. So it's still well below the average but we're starting to see some signs of gradual improvement. But that said, we're not seeing exactly the same upswing that you would typically associate with the spring buying season. But with that said and when you look at homeownership overall, it's still a huge market. It's still a $5 trillion overall category and it's an industry that's existed with basically no modernization. So regardless, our philosophical view is that we're determined to take share and we have a track record of taking share in essentially any market. I do just want to share 3 things that give me confidence that Rocket will be accelerated uniquely within our outlook and what gives us optimism. And I think the first one is just quite simply our focus and our track record. I mean there's a reason why we're the number 2 player in purchase, excluding correspondent. And if you look at the results of our execution and hard work this quarter and consistency quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year and those are important proof points. The second is just there are industry tailwinds that are just realities in which we operate that are going to be headwinds for others and tailwinds for us, whether it's the capacity that's coming out of the industry by gains whether it's the increased regulation of things like Basel III, whether it's just kind of the dynamic of fragmentation and consolidation and this AI paradigm shift that we're all going through, these are important dynamics that will determine winners and losers in this space. And we feel confident that they will benefit us disproportionately. And then the last thing I would just say before I turn it over to Brian to talk a little more about the guide and some of the external macro is that we have very unique assets. We have assets that will disrupt every aspect of the homeownership journey. It's not just our core businesses like home search, purchase, servicing, refinance, title, personal finance [ph]. It's the fact that these business lines are underpinned by significant data, talent culture, scale and an iconic brand. And so when you put all of that together, it reflects a company that's looking to grow share in a large market. And so when we talk about optimism in our market outlook, this is for me, what reinforces that. Thank you for the question, Ryan. I would just start by saying that profitable market share growth is our defining North Star metric. That is something that strategically across the company is a top line imperative. And I would just highlight a couple of control points that we've really focused on in a durable way to achieve this metric. The first thing I would just highlight is innovation. Across the board, we're innovating faster than ever. We're building deeper, better experiences and we've increased the velocity of high-impact innovation by releasing at a higher cadence. In fact, we're doing product and digital and experience releases almost weekly now. The second thing I would just say is we have increased our focus. We have restructured the way that we execute and we have operationalized against a new, what we call, a mission-based autonomous structure. That means that we have autonomous teams that are gold driven, that are working hard to execute against clearly defined metrics. And then the third thing I would highlight is that we've taken what we call a full funnel approach to every aspect of the business which means that we consider every single element of funnel, whether it's how we deliberately engaged with our massive servicing portfolio, improvements to performance marketing, whether that's better targeting, better creative, better channel mix optimization, tuning our front doors. And then all the way through the digital experience, making that more streamlined and then obviously, optimizing our sales and operations motion against specific workflows, whether it's purchase, refi servicing. And this is just to name a few of the things that we've done. Specific to purchase, one of the things I would just highlight is that we're really doubling down on our focus on purchase as a top line strategic imperative. And so you're going to start to see us innovate further and faster here. whether it's existing product innovation like buys or the new AI-based verified approval letter adjustments that we're starting to see major traction because we're meeting our clients where they are, through to the development of new purchase offerings that are more focused on our retained based better segmentation of our clients, understanding our clients, whether they are first-time homebuyers, female head of household, Latino, understanding demographics, segmentation and then leveraging our data to connect deeper with home search, optimizing the top of funnel for our purchase. So lots and lots of images across the board. But bit by bit, these interests start to stack up and that really reflects on some of the improvements that we started to see and we're still just scratching the surface of what is really possible. And then I'll ask Brian to maybe comment a little bit further. I'll just add a couple of quick thoughts towards profitability. At the end of the day, philosophically, profitability is going to be driven by a couple of key things: how well you execute, how efficient you are and then the big swings that you choose to intentionally take. And so in service to that, at the end of the day, market share, top line growth is our number 1 priority. Now of course, we're going to run an efficient business. And that's a strategic imperative as well. And there's always room to go. And we definitely think we can scale up significantly while keeping our fixed costs roughly the same. And philosophically, the reason we believe in that is because that's how you build a durable growth business for the long run. Now I think as you know, we made $225 million of adjusted EBITDA in Q2. That's an 18% margin and we believe we can grow that further. And we are leaning seriously into AI because we believe that will increase our operating leverage significantly. And so that capacity will come from AI investments and allow us to be more productive. And so in summary, investing in operational efficiency, driving major innovation that's in AI. Making our organization orders of magnitude more productive is how we believe we will accelerate our normalized profitability. Sure. Let me comment on AR and then I'll ask Brian to just jump into some of what we're seeing in terms of capacity. And I'll just start by saying that from a resource perspective, AI is our most strategic imperative and we are resourcing this to win. And there are real reasons that we're so vested in this because we see tangible concrete metric-driven benefits of efficiency, velocity and, most importantly, a better experience. And so Rocket Logic continues to advance. It's not built into every part of our experience whether it's the data workflow to document management to the tools that are actually powering our team members end to end in terms of how they drive the client experience. As we shared earlier, we're now generating 300,000 transcripts every week. That is a massive data set and that data is actually automating 113 fields on a mortgage application that would have to be entered manually. As we talked about already, we've seen a multitude of benefits from the earliest days of our generative AI-powered chat experience and we're just starting to lean in much more heavily there. And then we're using all this data to actually refine and train our models and our workflows further. So more volume results in a better AI system that we'll continue to learn and improve and make us better. So I would just say for us, this AI thing is not hype, right? Like we see concrete tangible benefits. We see our safe, we see faster call resolution. We see faster turn times. We see 100% accuracy on verification. And these are the earliest stages. And then the other thing I would add before I pass it over to Brian is we're also investing deeply in talent, like we're not standing still. We've recently hired a CTO. We're making significant investments in data leadership and infrastructure. We brought AI talent to our Board. And we're also being very deliberate in terms of being strategic and what we build where we have strength which is how we partner with the best in the industry, whether that's OpenAI, AWS and Entropic, just name a few. So it's early days but we're very encouraged by some of the key improvements in metrics and so we're continuing to lean in there. Let me ask Brian to just talk a little more on capacity. Yes. Great. Thank you so much for the question. I wanted to start by talking a little bit about our strategy when it comes to servicing. And I'd start by saying that our servicing portfolio is an incredibly strategic asset because it allows us to play both offense and defense at the same time. So our approach to servicing and origination is very unique to Rocket in the sense that servicing is actually a source of future origination. And so the 2 things actually work as a flywheel where you create a cycle where you can attract a new client, you can organically create a new MSR and then you can actually support and build a relationship with that client as their lender for life. So computationally, our MSR includes not just the servicing cash flow but it also includes the future gain on sale from additional services and products that we can deliver to that client in an awesome way. And so when you add to that, we have very strong in-market recapture capability that's 3x higher than the industry. And so for that reason, we are investing strategically. We're going to keep growing our servicing portfolio, we're going to try our tranches strategically and we can provide new experiences to those clients, whether it's refinancing on falling rates, second lien loans for those who are looking to utilize equity and then, of course, originating new purchase loans as well. And underlying that, obviously, is our technology infrastructure and our client experience that allows us to do all of this with speed, with the light and ultimately value for our clients which is what we care about at the end of the day. And it's just very exciting to me that as of June 30, we had around $535 billion of unpaid balance in servicing. I have to just give a shout out again to our servicing team who is the best in the business, who recently won just last week, the tenth J.D. Power recognition for servicing. Let me ask Bryan to comment a little bit more on your question. Thank you for the question, Doug. I'll just start by saying that this is a great example of product market set. It's the perfect product for the current market. And we've seen strong demand. The product volume has more than doubled year-over-year. That's because it's an offering that's incredibly valuable to our clients, right? They're using that money to fund a remodel, they're using it to consolidate debt. They're using it to pay for the inevitable life events that we may experience. And they're able to do that without affecting their favorable rates. And that's because they have $32 trillion of equity to tap into. And I'm incredibly proud that Rocket is now amongst the top players in the entire market. We've essentially created a market here. And by adding in the second lien, we're able to increase the weighted average coupon which then leads to potential refinance as well. And what I love about this is that this is just the beginning. I think we can go significantly further here because, as Brian said, it underscores the strength of our capital markets team and infrastructure which is second to none in the business. And we're continuing to improve it. We launched in what's called an AVM or automated valuation model in Q2 which means clients can actually get cash in as little as 7 days and they can actually close 7 days faster than a traditional rate in term refi. We can consolidate their first and second lien mortgages. So when interest rates inevitably decline, they're able to unlock additional value. And then I think perhaps best of all, in my opinion, is that the vast majority of clients who come to us are actually new to rocket. So it's a great business. It's a healthy business and we're just continuing to improve continuously. Thank you for the question, Rick. I'll just start by saying that purchase is a strategically elevated priority for us compared to the past. And there's a lot that you have to do to really make sure that you understand how to build a profitable, successful growing purchase funnel. The starting point of purchase is really understanding your client and meeting them where they are. And for that reason, we're investing significantly in segmenting our clients and really understanding that the dynamics of a first-time homebuyer are different from a second-time home buyer. The way that we engage with our service base to understand how to help them find a new purchase loan is different. The way that we engage with home search and really nurture and build intent with our clients, the way that we create an optimized funnel end to end and introduce new products and services and be able to bet on AI-based experiences and leverage things like chat and generative AI are all a big part of our purchase strategy. One of the things that I think is really important is how we think about servicing as a source of purchase origination. Another area of investment is really doubling down on our broker platform end to end. And that's a big part of our purchase strategy as well and that's a very important client that we want to continue to serve. So I would say that across the board, we're really resurrecting an end-to-end view of how to build a profitable, successful growing purchase business. That includes segmenting our clients, building experiences that meet them where they are, investing big in technology and automation, understanding how to nurture them and their intent throughout the home buying journey which can often be complex and long. And by sort of achieving all of these things is how we think we're going to grow and purchase and then obviously, resourcing this as a strategic priority from the top down is something that we're really, really excited about. We agree. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We're really excited about Investor Day on September 10. We hope to see all of you there. And we look forward to connecting with you next quarter. Thank you again for listening to the call."

Varun? \nVarun Krishna: Thank you, Sharon. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining the Rocket Companies Earnings Call for the First Quarter of 2024. \n This is my third earnings call since joining the company in September. As I reflect on the last 8 months, I am filled with gratitude to be part of a company with a clear and noble mission of helping everyone home. Never has this mission been more important, more relevant than it is right now. I am so proud of what our team has achieved together in this short time, and it's evident you're only at the beginning of our journey.  \n As an organization, we are driven to execute and win and our determination is absolute. We're playing both the short and the long game, gaining momentum and achieving success, while strategically planning and executing for the long term, and this has already led to some impressive results for Rocket.  \n Let's start with our Q1 business results where our Rocket blasted off as we entered the new year. I'll start by sharing just a few of the highlights that I'm especially proud of from the first quarter. We reported $0.04 of adjusted diluted EPS and delivered adjusted revenue of $1.163 billion in the first quarter, once again, far exceeding the high end of our guidance range. In addition, we returned to double-digit adjusted EBITDA margin. \n Alongside these solid results, we also continued to capture market share. In Q1, both purchase and refinance market share expanded showing double-digit percentage growth on a year-over-year basis. Our analysis shows that we took that market share from large industry players and big banks in particular.  \n Market share growth while maintaining healthy gain on sale margins is our North Star metric, and it's a yardstick that objectively measures our performance compared to the rest of the industry, independent of the inevitable ebbs and flows in the market. While we cannot control market movements, we can direct our efforts to delivering world-class service for our clients and focus on growing our share.  \n We are currently the #2 player in purchase, excluding correspondent lending, and we won't stop there as we continue our upward march. With our strategy and capabilities, we believe we can and will continue to grow market share in both purchase and refinance and drive consolidation in this fragmented winner-takes-all market.  \n I'd like to drill deeper into a few areas of our business that outperformed in Q1. Our home equity loan product has continued to expand significantly as we've seen volume grow more than 3.5x from Q1 of 2023 to Q1 this year. Since our launch, just under 2 years ago, Rocket is now among the top players across the entire home equity loan market. This achievement underscores the strength of our capital markets infrastructure and our team's ability to introduce and quickly scale innovative products that resonate with our clients.  \n Home equity loans are particularly relevant in today's market, as they present a great option for clients looking to tap into their home equity, whether to fund remodeling projects, consolidate debt or pay for a life event without affecting a favorable rate on their primary mortgage. Home equity loans close 7 days faster than our traditional refinance transactions, and importantly, they provide us with a springboard to consolidate a client's first and second lien mortgages when interest rates decline in the future.   \n Servicing is a key part of our business that enables us to play offense and defense at the same time. We acquired 4 MSR portfolios in March and April at a weighted average coupon well above that of our existing book. Rocket's recapture rate of service loans is more than 2x the industry average, which is why we see our servicing portfolio as such a strategic asset. It represents a future origination opportunity on nearly 2.5 million clients without additional marketing costs while paying a recurring cash flow until the next transaction. These are just a few examples of where strategic thinking and solid execution have driven tangible business results and outcomes.  \n Now let's shift forward. I'd like to transition and talk about some of the trends and themes that we're seeing at the industry level. Despite recent market volatility, we are steadfast in our belief that there is tremendous opportunity ahead for Rocket. In fact, when we widen the aperture, we believe Rocket is well-positioned to capitalize on the current trends shaping the industry over the long run.  \n Let me take just a minute to unpack 3 market-changing dynamics that create a perfect storm for Rocket to ride, execute and win. First, let's dive into industry capacity. Undoubtedly, the most challenging market conditions in 4 decades have catalyzed industry consolidation and capacity rationalization over the past couple of years. Mortgage employment has declined by 36% from its peak in April 2021, resulting in nearly 150,000 loan officers and mortgage brokers exiting the industry. The months to come are expected to put further pressure on smaller players already struggling with capacity and liquidity.  \n Secondly, if we look at banks, we can clearly see there has been a secular trend of banks feeding mortgage origination market share since the global financial crisis. In fact, their share has declined by nearly half from roughly 75% in 2008 to approximately 40% according to the most recently available data. Even still, banks hold top positions and comprise 6 of the top 20 spots in the industry rankings.  \n In recent years, banks have faced profitability challenges with their mortgage operations made more apparent against the backdrop of difficult market conditions. Looking ahead, Basel III capital requirements, which placed a higher risk weighting on mortgage capital, are likely to further deter banks from expanding their home lending operations. In fact, we believe many banks are reevaluating their mortgage lending operations altogether.  \n Lastly, the landmark National Association of Realtors Settlement has the potential to upend the home buying and selling realtor commission model that has remained unchanged for nearly 100 years. The traditional home buying and selling experience is fragmented, inefficient, costly and ripe for disruption. This settlement has the opportunity to change the home value equation and to pave the way for a better experience for both buyers and sellers of homes.  \n Rocket strategy capitalizes on these 3 seismic ships. We have a fortress balance sheet that gives us the flexibility to not only survive, but to thrive through the inevitable ups and downs of the market. While others are buying for survival, we are strategically investing in top-tier talent, cutting-edge technology and the enhancement of our brand to build a durable and growing business for the long term.  \n Our comprehensive suite of integrated end-to-end services squarely addresses every aspect of the home buying opportunity from every side of the equation. We are poised to lead and revolutionize how homes are bought, sold and financed.  \n As I shared earlier, at Rocket, our mission is to help everyone home. This is our grand challenge. We stand for every aspect of the homeownership journey from buying, selling and listing homes to purchase, refinance and servicing. That is what help everyone home means. We aim to transform the homeownership experience end to end, and our market opportunity is the entirety of the homeownership category.  \n The foundation that underpins this mission is a strategy that we call AI-fueled homeownership. That means we are committed to delivering industry-leading experiences powered by AI, benefiting our clients, mortgage brokers, real estate agents, financial institution partners and our team members alike. In a short amount of time, Rocket has already positioned itself as the industry leader in AI, continually pioneering client experiences that are unmatched by others.\n  Let me just share a handful of recent examples of how our innovation is accelerating. Our Rocket Homes team recently launched Explore Spaces visual search, the first of its kind in the industry. This innovation enables users to discover their next stream home by displaying photos based on features that are important to them such as kitchens with marble countertops or backyards with lush lawns. This is made possible by leveraging computer vision AI for image recognition and processing. This technology enables listing images to be quickly identified in text descriptions to be automatically generated, removing the need for manually tagging or writing content from scratch. Since launch, we've seen some very compelling early stocks. Users who engage with the Explore Spaces experience spend almost twice as long on the site per visit, and they returned 6x more often.  \n As part of the Explore Spaces experience, Rocket Homes also launched auditory search, which makes home search inclusive and accessible for the nearly 10% of the U.S. population that experiences visual impairment. AI automatically generates detailed captions for each photo that can actually be read aloud through AI-powered voice transcription.  \n Continuing our incredible pace of innovation, just last week, we launched a new pilot that uses voice-based generative AI to allow clients to update their verified approval letter simply by using their voice. Typically, when a client needs to modify their approval letter to make an offer on a house, a need that has only increased in today's dynamic and competitive home buying environment, they have to call their mortgage banker who then makes modification. Our bankers and underwriters handle those adjustment requests nearly 300,000 times a year. This is an incredibly manual process, which can take hours or days and not only takes our bankers away from prospecting for new business, but it is prone to errors and delays.  \n In an industry-first, our clients can use natural language to easily make modifications over the phone in just a minute. And their realtors are kept up to date through automated notifications 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This new feature is great for clients because the speed gives them an extra edge to make winning offers in their dream home. Every second counts in a competitive market. It's great for realtors to be kept in the loop and great for our bankers who can use time previously spent on this administrative task to work with more clients.  \n This is just one of many industry-first client-facing features in our pipeline that leverage AI to deliver great experiences. No matter the modality, whether through chat, phone, our website or our mobile app. There are many use cases for AI, but the most significant and immediately impactful application at our company is supercharging our team members. AI eliminates the drudgery of burdensome time-consuming manual tasks so that our team members can spend more time on making human connections and producing higher-value work. Ultimately, with AI, we are driving operational efficiency, speed, accuracy and personalization at massive scale. \n Rocket Logic, our proprietary patented AI technology platform and where the majority of our engineering resources are directed, powers both our client-facing interactions and back-end processing. Rocket Logic continues to add new capabilities and expand full automation of mundane tasks, bringing up team member capacity to serve many more clients and drive growth.  \n Rocket Logic utilizes collaborative intelligence to help our team members complete work more seamlessly. Here are just a few recent additions to our Rocket Logic platform. Rocket Logic Assistant, which seamlessly and accurately follows the conversation with a client in real time, populates hundreds of crucial application fields hands-free. We believe we have the best mortgage bankers in the business, and now we're providing them with the tools to be even more productive. As a result, they're able to devote their time and full attention to where it matters most to our clients.  \n Rocket Logic Docs, our intelligent document processing platform automates document upload, classification, loan association and field extraction, enabling fast and accurate processing at scale like never before. Rocket Logic Docs automatically identifies nearly 70% of the more than 1.5 million documents we received monthly resulting in a savings of more than 5,000 hours of manual work for our underwriters in February 2024 alone. Of the 4.3 million data points extracted from documents, including W-2s and bank statements in February, nearly 90% were automatically processed, saving an additional 4,000 hours of manual work for our team members. And we're continuously building upon and adding new capabilities to Rocket Logic.  \n Just last month, we announced Rocket Logic Synopsis. A new feature used by our client-facing team members across mortgage banking, TPO, mortgage operations and servicing. Each year, our teams participate in 65 million calls with our clients, and Synopsis works behind the scenes, transcribing and tagging client interactions, logging client preferences for communication method, time to be contacted, call purpose, sentiments and more.  \n The key to AI is continuous training of models with recursive feedback loops and data. We are organizing this invaluable data to construct unified client profiles in a centralized repository. From this repository, we train models to gain deeper insights and analytics to personalize all future interactions with our clients. The ultimate objective is to deliver industry-best client experiences that translates into better conversion rates and higher client lifetime value and to just get continuously better and better at it. \n Rocket Logic's automation has already reduced the number of times a team member interacts with a loan by nearly 25% year-over-year. This, in turn, has shaved several days off the time it takes Rocket's clients to close on a home purchase, reducing turn times by 25% from August 2022 to February 2024. These efficiencies are key in helping Rocket close loans nearly 2.5x faster than the industry average.  \n Great companies succeed with exceptional execution. At Rocket, we are driving better and faster execution across the board, and it's only going to continue and get even better from here. We are excited to share more examples of how AI is being deployed and the value it brings to our core businesses. We've recently solidified our road map and established objectives and key results to support our AI-driven homeownership strategy, and prioritize key strategic objectives. Consequently, we're operating with a heightened sense of focus and accountability.  \n Through this process, we've also streamlined how we interact internally and significantly reduced the number of meetings we conduct while sharpening the focus of those that we do have. As a result, I'm excited that our engineers are spending less time in meetings and roughly 30% more time coding and creating great experiences for our clients. In fact, just last month, I attended our Hack Week event, and I was just blown away. It was an amazing experience that highlighted our incredibly talented technology team members working rapidly to build that next game-changing innovation. From this Hack Week, dozens of the best ideas have gone from ideation to production in a matter of weeks.  \n In closing, we are laser-focused on our mission to help everyone home, and we are executing with velocity. We believe we're in the perfect position to take advantage of the opportunities presented by multiple once-in-a-generation tailwinds and we are poised to transform the home buying category, building upon our established refinance and servicing business and also continuing to grow and take share in purchase. All of this is underpinned by AI which enables us to accelerate our pace of execution and grow our market share, revenue and profitability at scale. \n And with that, I will turn it over to Brian. \nBrian Brown: Thank you, Varun, and good afternoon, everyone. \n On today's call, I'll cover our strong financial results for the first quarter of 2024, including achieving another quarter of profitable market share growth. I'll share some insights on the tangible value we are seeing from leveraging AI to drive efficiency, velocity and accuracy across our business, and I'll close with our perspectives on the current market environment and outlook for the second quarter.  \n But before I get started, on a personal note, I'm approaching my 10-year anniversary with Rocket, and I have never been more excited about the course we are charting ahead. As Varun mentioned, we have the strategy and resources necessary to capitalize on a once-in-a-generation tailwind in this huge fragmented home-buying space. We are executing with speed, and we are incredibly well-positioned to be the leader in home ownership.  \n Over the past few months, we have realigned the entire company around our strategy of AI-fueled home ownership. The energy and engagement from our team members have been electric. And I'm confident we are going to accomplish great things together as we execute on our mission to help everyone home.  \n Turning to the first quarter. We once again achieved strong results. We gained market share, accelerated revenue growth and achieved our highest profitability in 2 years. We delivered these results against a backdrop of higher for longer interest rates in a mortgage market that remains well below historical levels. Our exceptional performance is a testament to the hard work and focused execution of our team members.  \n Diving further into Q1 results, we generated $22.4 billion in net rate lock volume and $20.2 billion in closed loan volume. Once again, we have made significant strides in both refinance and purchase market share, delivering meaningful growth on both fronts during the period. Our differentiated solutions like our home equity loan product, attracting new refinance clients who want to access the equity in their home while preserving an already low rate on their existing mortgage. \n And then from a purchase perspective, Rocket's integrated end-to-end ecosystem across real estate and mortgage makes for unbeatable offerings like our Buy Plus program, which is directly geared towards addressing the historic affordability challenges that today's buyers face. Like home equity loans, the majority of Buy Plus clients are new to Rocket, and helped drive our purchase market share gains over the past year while continuing to organically grow our servicing portfolio.  \n Looking at industry forecasts and other more real-time data sources, the total industry volume was roughly flat on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter. By comparison, our first quarter loan volume was up 19% on a year-over-year basis.  \n Turning to revenue. We generated adjusted revenue of $1.163 billion in the first quarter, well above the high end of our guidance range. This represents a 32% increase from the first quarter of 2023 and marks the third consecutive quarter of accelerating growth year-over-year. \n Gain on sale margin for the first quarter was 311 basis points, which compares favorably to the 268 basis points in Q4 and the 239 basis points in the first quarter of 2023. This upward trend in gain on sale margins over the past year has been driven in part by capacity continuing to come out of the system. I'll elaborate further on gain on sale margins in a moment.  \n In addition to posting strong top line growth, we also meaningfully increased profitability. Adjusted EBITDA was $174 million, an improvement of more than $250 million from the first quarter of last year. Adjusted diluted EPS came in at $0.04 per share in the first quarter.  \n While we are pleased to return to double-digit adjusted EBITDA margin in the first quarter, this is only a glimmer of Rocket's true earnings potential. The past few years have been a tale of peaks and valleys in the market. We have done the difficult but necessary work to rightsize the company and respond to market realities. More importantly, though, with our robust financial profile, we have continued to invest heavily in crucial areas such as talent and technology to seize the future market opportunities.  \n Now let's take a look at our operating expenses. Total expenses in the first quarter were $1.085 billion, roughly flat year-over-year, which is particularly notable when compared to the 32% increase in adjusted revenue over the same period. Thanks to the operational efficiency measures we implemented last year, we realized full quarter cost savings in Q1, which we then chose to direct towards ROI-driven performance marketing spend to drive the additional production. We also incurred higher variable costs related to higher volumes, which included industry-wide credit cost increases.  \n Earlier, you heard Varun talk about how AI is powering great client experiences and unlocking team member productivity. I'd like to share even more perspective on how AI is bringing tangible business value through enhanced operational efficiency, velocity and accuracy at scale. The most apparent and significant value add that I've seen is augmenting team member capacity through operational efficiency. With AI, we are unlocking significant productivity by supercharging our team members in the most critical functions.  \n Take our team member-intensive areas such as mortgage banking, operations and servicing, which make up the majority of our total team members. Every day, team members in these areas are using AI tools to handle routine tasks, such as Rocket Logic Synopsis to transcribe calls, Rocket Logic Assistant to populate mortgage applications and Rocket Logic Docs to classify documents and extract data fields. With AI handling this work, our team members have more time to provide tailored advice and engage in higher-value conversations with our clients. Rocket Logic is reducing manual tasks by nearly 25% year-over-year, directly translating into tangible operational efficiencies.  \n With AI, we are also serving our clients with greater velocity. Rocket Logic's automation has shaved days off of our purchase turn times, improving closing time by 25% from August 2022 to February 2024. Turn times are an important factor. First and foremost, because the more quickly we can close a loan, the better experience we can offer clients, especially in a competitive home-buying market.  \n AI is also helping us reduce risk and strengthen compliance by driving never-before-seen accuracy. For example, income verification is a critical step in the underwriting process. And income verification issues are among the top reasons behind GSE repurchase requests. AI is helping to drive significantly higher accuracy rates, which has the potential to reduce financial losses on previously originated loans repurchased from the GSEs.  \n Turning to our balance sheet. Rocket's strong financial position continues to be a strategic advantage. Amidst the shifting industry landscape, our financial position increasingly serves as a competitive moat, affording us the flexibility to be opportunistic when others may be fighting just to stay alive. Our financial profile allows us to continue investing in top talent as well as technology and AI capabilities to build a durable business to position our organization for growth.  \n Looking ahead, our robust liquidity will be an even greater advantage as new capital requirements begin to take effect in the industry. With respect to the FHFA liquidity 2.0 requirements, that went into effect in late 2023 and Ginnie Mae's new risk-based capital standards that to take effect later this year, Rocket is well in excess of both of the capital and liquidity levels. This is a regulatory requirement that many of our competitors are actively having to manage rather than being able to invest in technology and programs that will deliver long-term growth.  \n We ended the first quarter with $3.5 billion of available cash and $6.7 billion of mortgage servicing rights. Together, these assets represent a total of approximately $10.2 billion of value on our balance sheet. Our $3.5 billion of available cash consists of $900 million of cash on the balance sheet, an additional $2.6 billion of corporate cash used to self-fund loan originations. Total liquidity stood at approximately $8.9 billion as of March 31, including available cash, undrawn lines of credit in our undrawn MSR lines. \n As of March 31st, our mortgage servicing portfolio included nearly 2.5 million loans, that's $511 billion of unpaid principal balance. Our net client retention rate in the first quarter was 96%, which continues to be multiples higher than the industry average. Retention rate serves as a key metric engaging client satisfaction and is the primary indicator of client lifetime value. We also drive significant recurring revenue from mortgage servicing. During the first quarter, we generated $346 million of cash revenue from our servicing book, which represents approximately $1.4 billion on an annualized basis.  \n Servicing is a strategic area of growth and we see strong synergy between our Servicing portfolio and our Origination business. With our industry-leading recapture rate, we take a different approach to servicing than others, viewing it through the lens of client lifetime value. \n In March and April, we acquired over $8 billion of unpaid principal balance with a blended weighted average note rate above that of our current portfolio. These higher note rate MSRs enable us to capitalize on our industry-leading recapture rate and set us up for future refinance opportunities.  \n Turning to our outlook for the second quarter. Our guidance on today's call is based on trends we've observed quarter-to-date and 1 month of actual performance. April is typically the lowest month of the quarter from a volume perspective and market conditions in April were challenging. The 10-year treasury yield has increased roughly 70 basis points since the start of the year in response to persistent inflation and strong macroeconomic data. Despite some gradual improvements, home inventory levels remain well below their historical average, while higher mortgage rates further compound affordability challenges.  \n The traditional spring purchase season is off to a slow start. Across the industry, 2024 has turned in the worst March and April for purchase applications in the last 30 years. Despite the challenging rate and inventory environment, our Q2 guidance reflects our expectation of higher volume and positions us to take share again in the second quarter. It's worth noting that our strong gain on sale margins in Q1 benefited from 2 market-driven factors that may not reoccur. One factor was a lower interest rate environment when compared to Q2. Another factor was our extremely strong execution in the securitization markets for our home equity loan product. Therefore, our expectation is that the second quarter gain on sale margins will return to levels closer to those observed in the second half of last year.  \n In Q2, we expect adjusted revenue to be in the range of $1.075 billion to $1.225 billion. In summary, we are confident that we will drive top line growth, take share and our guidance reflects exactly this.  \n Regarding operating expenses, we expect the second quarter to be roughly flat on a year-over-year basis, as the savings from last year's operational efficiency initiatives are expected to be mostly offset by increased variable costs related to higher volumes, which includes the industry-wide credit cost increases.  \n As always, our forward-looking guidance is based on our current outlook and visibility, which should come across clearly from our remarks today is our conviction to grow purchase and transform the massive, fragmented homeownership category. Through our strategy and with our capabilities, we believe we are well-positioned to navigate and thrive regardless of market conditions. With AI, we are unlocking capacity and enhancing operational efficiency, velocity and accuracy.  We are just getting started, and we're fired up to execute on our mission to help everyone home. \n With that, we are ready to turn it back over to the operator for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs. \nRyan Nash: So I wanted to dig a little bit further into the outlook across a handful of areas, the originations, revenues and profitability. Maybe to just sort of dig into each of them, Brian, you give a little bit of color on 2Q saying continued market share gains, revenues. Obviously, we had the guide, and this is the first quarter I think we had net income profitability. So can you maybe just talk about how you think all of these things together will evolve into the outlook for '24, given you guys are obviously talking about growing originations, the industry might end up being relatively steady. How do you see all these things working together and now we're back to a sustained level of profitability? \nVarun Krishna: Yes. Ryan, thank you for the question. I'll start, and then I'll ask Brian to jump in if there's anything that he would add. And I think the first thing I would just say is it's a tough market out there. You've got rates that are kind of moving a little bit in the wrong direction. You've got MBA data that's showing that mortgage applications are lower than expected. But when you step back from that, we firmly believe that the dynamics of the market are going to be favorable to Rocket. And that's regardless of the size of the market, whether it's a $1.5 trillion TAM or a $2 trillion TAM.  \n And I want to just highlight a few indicators that reinforce my confidence in this. I think the first one is just our focus and track record. When you look at the TAM, regardless of what it is, and you sort of throw in real estate and financial services, that's a $5 trillion TAM. And we have proven that we have the ability to take share in any market purely as a function of our execution and persistence.  \n The second thing I'd highlight is just you've got so many tailwinds that are going to be benefiting Rocket that may be headwinds for industry, whether that's the rate environment that's putting pressure on smaller players, whether it's the capacity that's coming out of the industry, whether it's things like Basel III, disruptive dynamics like the recent NAR ruling that are going to create new opportunities to redefine the experience. These are all things that are tailwinds for Rocket that may be headwinds for the broader industry.  \n And then the third thing I'd highlight is just again, strategy and execution. We have assets that uniquely span the entirety of the homeownership journey. Purchase, refinance, servicing, personal finance, we're making significant investments in technology and talent. We've narrowed our focus. And so the bottom line is fortune really favors those who are built for storms, and there's tremendous share that's up for grabs, and that reflects our sort of tenacity in going after the market and playing to win and grow our share.  \n Brian, is there anything you would add? \nBrian Brown: Yes. The only thing just to build on that, Ryan, when we look -- sit here today and we look at some of the industry forecasts, a few of them are triangulating around about $1.8 trillion, that feels high from what we've seen to Varun's point in terms of the rate moves. But regardless of that, we've shown, because the first quarter was also a challenged market, that we can drive significant profitability through our system and take share.  \n So to Varun's point, it's a really good case study into us doing -- executing on our strategies. And it's worth noting, too, that if rates are to stay higher for longer, and let's say it's not a $1.8 trillion market, it's something less than that, there's a view you can get to pretty easily that, that actually benefits us even more given our capitalization levels, given our liquidity and some of the investments we've made over the past few years in terms of technology to increase capacity. We think that actually bodes really well for us. \nRyan Nash: Got it. If I can ask a follow-up sort of 2-part question on margins and market share? So first, maybe just thinking about market share, Varun, you outlined capacity rationalization, banks being secular share shutters. And then you talked about the national retailer settlement. Do you think these things in and of itself are enough to drive accelerating share growth for Rocket and how do you think about it over an intermediate time frame? \n And I guess related to that, Brian, you talked about a couple of idiosyncratic factors that elevated the margin in the near term. But if I look today, margins are still below 2018, 2019 levels. And given these favorable dynamics, do you still see the opportunity for margins over an intermediate time frame to expand back to historical levels? \nVarun Krishna: Yes. I mean I'll just cover a little bit on share and the NAR settlement. I think the first thing I would just say is there are 3 strategic levers that really come together in a durable way to enable our growth and share now and in the future. The first one is just innovation. We're betting big on AI experiences. We've simplified our funnel. We've got better personalization, more automation. The second thing is just our internal focus. We've streamlined our execution. We've got more dedicated autonomous teams with clear goals. So we've just improved our process. \n The third thing is just our top of funnel. We're meeting clients where they are. We've improved performance marketing. We've got better optimizations to improve our creative, our lead flow. We've got better engagement with our servicing portfolio. We've got better search and engagement experiences to nurture relationships with Rocket Homes and Rocket Money. So the bottom line is, I mean, what you see is in our results, and you see it in the market dynamics. So we definitely see that as an accelerator. So to your question, my answer is yes. \n And I think for the NAR settlement, the only thing I would just say is just -- it's been too long that the cost of buying and selling a home is too high and it's been too long that the transparency of the process has been opaque. And transparency in value is just what we believe, and it's what we've always believed in. And there are some folks in the industry that are going to fight this tooth and nail. There's others that are going to look past it and seize the opportunity. And we definitely choose to be the latter to the bigger picture, be on the consumer side and just leverage this to take cost and efficiency out of the -- take cost out of the equation, introduce efficiency into the equation and just create more value. So we've been experimenting this space already with things like Buy Plus and we're really going to continue to do so. \nBrian Brown: Ryan, I can double-click on the -- your guide question, but we've shared this before. But of course, we take into account all the information we have really leading up to the call right here. It's worth pointing out that it's a 15% year-over-year improvement on adjusted revenue, if you take the midpoint of the range. I won't belabor the rate comments. But clearly, April has seen a different rate environment than what we saw in the first quarter. \n As it relates to inventory, we are seeing modest improvement. We are seeing a little bit of an uptick in listings, but in our view, that's largely offset by some of these affordability challenges. But we want to be clear that the guide does assume volume is up in the second quarter from the first quarter, and we believe that, that's really from us continuing to take share. Our purchase pipeline remains very strong. Consumer demand for home buying is also very high. It's just the affordability aspect that we have to get over. \n And then to your point on gain on sale margins, we've said before that we generally expect gain on sale margins to continue to expand from last year's levels. And that is definitely proving out. There's no question about it. The 311 basis point print in Q1 is obviously extremely healthy. But that did exceed even our expectations. And that was really for 2 reasons, both which are positive. But the first is the closed and second product. The consumer demand for those closed and second is very high. But what we also found in the first quarter is the investment, the private space demand to buy the product given people that are chasing yields right now is also extremely high. So we just had better-than-expected secondary execution. All the secondary execution has been good, but this was especially rich. \n So to your point, that's just something I wouldn't -- I can't count on for future quarters, though I do expect the demand for the product to be rich. And then the first quarter just had a -- even though rates were rising, the rate of change was a little bit less so what we saw in April. So the first quarter had a little bit better interest rate environment. So -- but nothing has changed in our view on gain on sale margins. We still -- we do believe there's expansion that's happening, and that's largely because of capacity coming out. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Adelson of Morgan Stanley. \nJeffrey Adelson: So just to maybe dig into the outlook a little bit for the second quarter. Is there any chance to the degree of conservatism built into the number? I mean this quarter, you'd beat a little bit on the outlook here. And Fannie still out there with the 40% sequential increase. I know you're kind of commenting that you think the $1.8 trillion is a little bit unrealistic at this point. I guess I'm just wondering is there some opportunity for upside to that number.\n And then just in terms of the share gain, last year, you commented on, I think, the 14% and 10% increase in the gain, double-digit this quarter. Are you seeing a share gain accelerate as you kind of go into this quarter and the rest of the year? Or just how do you see that evolving? \nBrian Brown: Yes. Let me start with the outlook and just to touch on the market view again. We're not trying to pin down a number, but the problem with those $1.8 trillion numbers is they're outdated, right? Even the published dates if you look at where rates were when they published and you look at the forward curve, we were just in a different spot. So the other interesting thing about the $1.8 trillion is you kind of 3 or 4 of them get there, but they all get there in different ways. To your point, Fannie has a big step-up, but MBA step-up is actually much less. So, I think, only like 16%. But the things that we're seeing in terms of real-time data, both macro and micro would tell us that, that's probably not as likely, though we do still think it will be a healthy market. \n So the only way I could answer your question is we take all that into account. This quarter is always the quarter that will tell the story of home buying as we enter this home-buying season. But the data that Varun highlighted that we saw in April does give us a bit of pause, but we're still very bullish on being able to grow our volume in the second quarter, largely through taking share, which leads me to your next point. Yes, we are seeing an acceleration of share gains. Varun mentioned this in his prepared remarks, but the banks continue to see share for all practical purposes, most retail or other type of online lenders are really not doing anything in the client acquisition space. If clients are inbounding to them, they'll do loans, but they're not out there marketing or spending marketing dollars. And so that bodes really well for our ability to accelerate share gains. \nJeffrey Adelson: And you guys have done a pretty good job with the home equity loan offering it sounds like. Just wondering if you had any early thoughts on Freddie's proposed program out there in the agency side for the second lien. Do you guys view this as a growth opportunity now that you could maybe do a little bit more of that business? Do you have any view of maybe how their program price is. ?How should we maybe be thinking of the trade-off of maybe less cash out refi, now the averages are really high right now, so maybe there's not as much of that, but how do we think of the trade-off of that versus moving some volume to doing more of this agency second lien program? \nBrian Brown: Yes. Let me start, and I'm sure Varun will add, too. But I think on the proposal side, we'll see where that ends up. Generally, more liquidity is better in the mortgage space. So -- of course, we do support more liquidity. But I would say sort of different than others in the space. We kind of created this market. If you look at securitization data and you look at what we've done, we sort of made the closed and second market, at least for this go through. So finding the liquidity already. \n As I mentioned, that was a big component of the gain on sale margins over performance, I guess, you could say, in the first quarter. So for us, we don't need to count or rely on a proposal like that. I'm not sure where that will end up. But generally, the more liquidity is better. What I'll say though is we've already developed a really nice program. We have a bunch of capital. We have underwriting standards that people are buying into. I'm not sure where Freddie will end up on that spectrum. But like all GSE products, they'll have pretty tight rules. I think private capital will still be important in closed and seconds. \nVarun Krishna: The only thing I would just add is this is just a great example of how we're building products that are relevant for the current market, which is evidenced also just, by the way, with our history, I mean, whether it's Buy Plus, One Plus or Inflation Buster, anticipating our client's needs and meeting them where they are and solving a meaningful problem. I'm just very proud of our team for continuing to set the standard of being ahead of the curve. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries of Deutsche Bank. \nMark DeVries: Notwithstanding the efforts you've already made to rightsize your expense base, I was hoping to hear your updated thoughts on expense management, just given the latest backup in rates as well as any thoughts on product focus to help generate more revenue in an environment where rates remain higher for longer. \nVarun Krishna: Yes. Thank you for the question, Mark. I'll just start by saying that profitability and efficiency are 2 sides of the same coin, right? And they both matter significantly. Our main focus is market share and top line growth. And the way you do that smartly is you leverage your savings to invest in growth. That's going to happen through accelerated execution. That's going to happen through big swings on innovation. It's also going to happen through focus on efficiency, which is a constant strategic imperative. \n The thing I'm excited about is our AI strategy is specifically designed to create and unlock operating leverage. So it will allow us to grow our capacity without increasing head count. And it will allow us to actually build our company and grow durably. So we don't look at this AI investment as a head count reducer. I mean that's not how you build a growth company durably. But the combination of being able to invest in technology and have an ongoing principle around efficiency is how we think we're going to create a durable flywheel. And of course, continuous investment in product innovation and create new-to-the-world offerings that will be able to create value for clients is something that represents our brand, who we are, who we've always been and who we will be. \n Anything, Brian, you would add? \nBrian Brown: The only thing I would say, which is just piggybacking on what Varun said is it's -- at this point, it's a capacity gain, right? We've talked a lot about we did $79 billion in originations last year, and we believe we can put a significant more amount of capacity through the system. We're really starting to see these benefits come to fruition. So that's our focus right now. That capacity will be used either when rates go down and the TAM increases and/or if rates stay higher and it's more difficult and it accelerates our share gains, we think keeping that capacity, removing friction and serving more clients is, first and foremost, our focus right now. . \nMark DeVries: Okay. Great. Just one more for me. There's been a lot of talk about banks share in this environment. Just wondering if there's anything you could discuss with us about ongoing conversations you may be having with banks to either white label an origination offering or even a branded offering to help either take their share or help access their customer base. \nVarun Krishna: Yes. We can't comment on the specific conversations that we're having, but I would just say that, I mean, I think we see there's an opportunity to create value. And so those conversations are ongoing, and we'll share more as we make progress. \nBrian Brown: Yes. Mark, the thing we know is the banks were trying to really hard not to mortgages, and that was even before the Basel III standard. We don't know where it will end up. But we do, to Varun's point, can't comment specifically, but we think there's some interesting plays there. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Derek Sommers of Jefferies. \nDerek Sommers: On Rocket Logic, how should we think about the improvement to the origination side of the business there? I'm imagining it would marginally widen the top of the funnel through processing client leads faster and then drive some more meaningful improvement on funnel pull-through. Feel free to correct me if I'm thinking about that the wrong way. \nVarun Krishna: Yes. No, thank you for the question, Derek. I'll just start by saying the reason that we're obsessed with AI is because it brings a number of transformative benefits to our business. And that's really grounded in the Rocket Logic platform and what it represents for the next chapter in the company. The first one is just efficiency. It allows us to serve more clients by simply just automating the mundane. And the second one is speed and velocity, just because our clients value speed and certainty, they have to be competitive. They have to be able to operate and execute offers and things like that at speed. \n And then the third one is experience, just creating more personalization, more delight on what is a very emotional journey that millions of people go through when it comes to homeownership on every side of the equation. And with Rocket Logic, we're in the earliest days of this revolution, and I firmly believe the best is yet to come. And this is our AI platform. It is our most strategic imperative and we've dramatically increased our investment as well as the velocity with which we're launching futures every week. \n The platform is now extended to every part of the journey from the digital experience that clients interact with to how we interact on the phone with mortgage banking or client services to the way we manage documents and extraction to income verification to underwriting to servicing. And we've started to see some pretty awesome benefits. We've seen hours saved. That's a metric that we track. We were up to 170,000 hours per year. We've seen improvements in resolution times. Our first call resolution has improved by 10% with the Synopsis experience that we just announced a few days ago. And then ultimately, just turn times, right, 2.5x faster than industry. \n And then last, but not least, accuracy, we've seen zero audit findings with our income verification experience. And so across the board, this platform is delivering a benefit to us, both in terms of the client experience that our end clients face, but also just supercharging our team members to be able to do more with less. And so we're very excited about this platform. We think it has tremendous benefits across the board, and we're just getting started. \nDerek Sommers: Great. And then just to pivot to the servicing portfolio acquisitions. Can you guys share -- shed any more light on those transactions? Were they coming from banks or nonbanks? And is there more supply this higher coupon product coming across your desk? \nBrian Brown: Yes. I think -- let me just -- that's a fair question. Thank you. Let me take one step back just to talk about how we think about the servicing asset. It's clearly a strategic asset. We really like the returns. Even if you just look at the cash flows right now, you're generally looking at double-digit returns. And then, of course, for us, where you add in our industry-leading recapture, and that's what really starts getting exciting in the return game. And we've always known that if a client goes through our J.D. Power winning origination experience and then we service them that we will recapture very well. But what is awesome to see is we're starting to prove to ourselves that we can also recapture well when we acquire a portfolio of servicing.\n Over the past couple of years, we've been doing that. It takes some time to prove out that hypothesis because you need data and information. And obviously, since the -- where rates have been, just the number of transactions might naturally be lower. But we're starting to have more and more confidence that on the acquired portfolios, our recapture rate will be very healthy as well. \n So to answer your question, what that means is that gives us even more confidence to be actively bidding in the market. To your point, we still are seeing supply a bit challenged. There is a lot of demand and a little bit of supply out there. So there are competitive bids. But here's the thing, and you kind of mentioned this in your question that is exciting for us, the asset that we're very interested in and bidding on is a different asset than some of the others in the space are. Some of the servicers that have come out with some pretty robust goals around growing their servicing portfolio are actually interested in the very low [ WACC ] stuff.  \n For us, to your point, the higher [ WACC ] stuff is actually a bit more interesting to us if you think about the closed and second opportunity there, if you think about a potential cash-out opportunity there. So in the proof point being these 4 pools that we just bought, that strategy is really being deployed. So they're higher [ WACC ] than the current portfolio, and we really like our chances in terms of recapture. So it will be something we -- I think you can expect us to continue to focus on and be active in the space. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brad Capuzzi of Piper Sandler. \nBradley Capuzzi: So you highlighted in your investor presentation, obviously, demonstrated in your results today, rocket's track record of continuing to grow market share. Kind of wanted to just hone in on your ability to grow purchase market share over the long term. I know there's been a lot of investment in tech and AI, along with the addition of other products. But with the mortgage market being inherently localized specifically for the purchase market, what are the steps you guys are taking to address this issue? \nVarun Krishna: Yes, I think -- thank you for the question, Brad. I think the first thing I would just say is purchase is a strategic focus area for the company more than it's ever been in the past. And that comes down to how we've organized, how we've structured our teams, how we've dedicated resources and how we've just invested the time to really understand the nature of what it takes to win. That includes dedicated teams. It includes understanding the funnel. It includes also understanding the nature of just how you help clients with every aspect of the journey from searching from a home to building relationships with the realtor and broker to going through the process of making an offer. We have just dedicated significantly more focused toward than ever before. That's kind of the first thing. \n I think the other thing I would just say is we've integrated our ecosystem assets like never before. The role of Rocket Money has never been more important. The role of our Home Search experience has never been more important. The role of our Servicing Portfolio and building engagement with our clients where we can collect data and we can help them with their next transaction has never been important. So this is -- it's a game of interest, but the interests are everywhere when you kind of think about all of them put together and they add up. And so when you put those interest together, you start to see that execution happen. And so there are bigger swings that we're thinking about when you think about the opportunity that AI actually affords us to take a giant leap forward. We're also obviously looking at both organic and inorganic opportunities. But we're serious about purchase, and you can expect to see us continue to invest and dedicate our focus on it and so we win. \nBradley Capuzzi: And then just the last question for me. I mean, obviously, Rocket is one of the leaders in technology across the mortgage market. And with your continued adoption of AI, can you just discuss how your investments and capabilities differ from industry competitors? Is AI been a hot topic issue on recent calls from peers thus far? \nVarun Krishna: Yes. I mean I think the thing I would just say is there's a certain activation energy that's required to be successful in AI. You have to have a large number of clients that you can engage with. You have to have a lot of data that you can build models around. And then you have to have resources that you can invest to kind of train, build and sort of continue to sort of improve these experiences that they're better. So this is one of those where it's difficult to be successful in AI if you don't have data at scale, if you don't have large engineering resources, if you don't invest in data science, algorithmic intelligence, talent. And so I think for us, it is a strategic imperative at every layer of the company. It's where we've dedicated the vast number of our resources, and we're continuing to grow our investment both with internal and external talent. \n And so for us, I mean, a good example I would give is just adding Alex Rampell to our Board, who is the industry leader in both fintech and AI, that's an example of just where the level of investment that we're making, the thought leadership and just the focus is only going to be increasing. I'd also just share that we're hiring a new Chief Technology Officer that will be joining the company in days to come. And so we're serious about this. We're investing, and we're playing to win. \nOperator: Thank you. That concludes the Q&A session. I will now turn the conference back over to Varun Krishna for closing remarks. \nVarun Krishna: Well, thank you, everyone, for our great conversation today. We look forward to the next earnings call. We also invite you to our Investor Day later in the fall. We appreciate it. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brian Brown",
            "content": "Thank you, Varun, and good afternoon, everyone. \n On today's call, I'll cover our strong financial results for the first quarter of 2024, including achieving another quarter of profitable market share growth. I'll share some insights on the tangible value we are seeing from leveraging AI to drive efficiency, velocity and accuracy across our business, and I'll close with our perspectives on the current market environment and outlook for the second quarter.  \n But before I get started, on a personal note, I'm approaching my 10-year anniversary with Rocket, and I have never been more excited about the course we are charting ahead. As Varun mentioned, we have the strategy and resources necessary to capitalize on a once-in-a-generation tailwind in this huge fragmented home-buying space. We are executing with speed, and we are incredibly well-positioned to be the leader in home ownership.  \n Over the past few months, we have realigned the entire company around our strategy of AI-fueled home ownership. The energy and engagement from our team members have been electric. And I'm confident we are going to accomplish great things together as we execute on our mission to help everyone home.  \n Turning to the first quarter. We once again achieved strong results. We gained market share, accelerated revenue growth and achieved our highest profitability in 2 years. We delivered these results against a backdrop of higher for longer interest rates in a mortgage market that remains well below historical levels. Our exceptional performance is a testament to the hard work and focused execution of our team members.  \n Diving further into Q1 results, we generated $22.4 billion in net rate lock volume and $20.2 billion in closed loan volume. Once again, we have made significant strides in both refinance and purchase market share, delivering meaningful growth on both fronts during the period. Our differentiated solutions like our home equity loan product, attracting new refinance clients who want to access the equity in their home while preserving an already low rate on their existing mortgage. \n And then from a purchase perspective, Rocket's integrated end-to-end ecosystem across real estate and mortgage makes for unbeatable offerings like our Buy Plus program, which is directly geared towards addressing the historic affordability challenges that today's buyers face. Like home equity loans, the majority of Buy Plus clients are new to Rocket, and helped drive our purchase market share gains over the past year while continuing to organically grow our servicing portfolio.  \n Looking at industry forecasts and other more real-time data sources, the total industry volume was roughly flat on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter. By comparison, our first quarter loan volume was up 19% on a year-over-year basis.  \n Turning to revenue. We generated adjusted revenue of $1.163 billion in the first quarter, well above the high end of our guidance range. This represents a 32% increase from the first quarter of 2023 and marks the third consecutive quarter of accelerating growth year-over-year. \n Gain on sale margin for the first quarter was 311 basis points, which compares favorably to the 268 basis points in Q4 and the 239 basis points in the first quarter of 2023. This upward trend in gain on sale margins over the past year has been driven in part by capacity continuing to come out of the system. I'll elaborate further on gain on sale margins in a moment.  \n In addition to posting strong top line growth, we also meaningfully increased profitability. Adjusted EBITDA was $174 million, an improvement of more than $250 million from the first quarter of last year. Adjusted diluted EPS came in at $0.04 per share in the first quarter.  \n While we are pleased to return to double-digit adjusted EBITDA margin in the first quarter, this is only a glimmer of Rocket's true earnings potential. The past few years have been a tale of peaks and valleys in the market. We have done the difficult but necessary work to rightsize the company and respond to market realities. More importantly, though, with our robust financial profile, we have continued to invest heavily in crucial areas such as talent and technology to seize the future market opportunities.  \n Now let's take a look at our operating expenses. Total expenses in the first quarter were $1.085 billion, roughly flat year-over-year, which is particularly notable when compared to the 32% increase in adjusted revenue over the same period. Thanks to the operational efficiency measures we implemented last year, we realized full quarter cost savings in Q1, which we then chose to direct towards ROI-driven performance marketing spend to drive the additional production. We also incurred higher variable costs related to higher volumes, which included industry-wide credit cost increases.  \n Earlier, you heard Varun talk about how AI is powering great client experiences and unlocking team member productivity. I'd like to share even more perspective on how AI is bringing tangible business value through enhanced operational efficiency, velocity and accuracy at scale. The most apparent and significant value add that I've seen is augmenting team member capacity through operational efficiency. With AI, we are unlocking significant productivity by supercharging our team members in the most critical functions.  \n Take our team member-intensive areas such as mortgage banking, operations and servicing, which make up the majority of our total team members. Every day, team members in these areas are using AI tools to handle routine tasks, such as Rocket Logic Synopsis to transcribe calls, Rocket Logic Assistant to populate mortgage applications and Rocket Logic Docs to classify documents and extract data fields. With AI handling this work, our team members have more time to provide tailored advice and engage in higher-value conversations with our clients. Rocket Logic is reducing manual tasks by nearly 25% year-over-year, directly translating into tangible operational efficiencies.  \n With AI, we are also serving our clients with greater velocity. Rocket Logic's automation has shaved days off of our purchase turn times, improving closing time by 25% from August 2022 to February 2024. Turn times are an important factor. First and foremost, because the more quickly we can close a loan, the better experience we can offer clients, especially in a competitive home-buying market.  \n AI is also helping us reduce risk and strengthen compliance by driving never-before-seen accuracy. For example, income verification is a critical step in the underwriting process. And income verification issues are among the top reasons behind GSE repurchase requests. AI is helping to drive significantly higher accuracy rates, which has the potential to reduce financial losses on previously originated loans repurchased from the GSEs.  \n Turning to our balance sheet. Rocket's strong financial position continues to be a strategic advantage. Amidst the shifting industry landscape, our financial position increasingly serves as a competitive moat, affording us the flexibility to be opportunistic when others may be fighting just to stay alive. Our financial profile allows us to continue investing in top talent as well as technology and AI capabilities to build a durable business to position our organization for growth.  \n Looking ahead, our robust liquidity will be an even greater advantage as new capital requirements begin to take effect in the industry. With respect to the FHFA liquidity 2.0 requirements, that went into effect in late 2023 and Ginnie Mae's new risk-based capital standards that to take effect later this year, Rocket is well in excess of both of the capital and liquidity levels. This is a regulatory requirement that many of our competitors are actively having to manage rather than being able to invest in technology and programs that will deliver long-term growth.  \n We ended the first quarter with $3.5 billion of available cash and $6.7 billion of mortgage servicing rights. Together, these assets represent a total of approximately $10.2 billion of value on our balance sheet. Our $3.5 billion of available cash consists of $900 million of cash on the balance sheet, an additional $2.6 billion of corporate cash used to self-fund loan originations. Total liquidity stood at approximately $8.9 billion as of March 31, including available cash, undrawn lines of credit in our undrawn MSR lines. \n As of March 31st, our mortgage servicing portfolio included nearly 2.5 million loans, that's $511 billion of unpaid principal balance. Our net client retention rate in the first quarter was 96%, which continues to be multiples higher than the industry average. Retention rate serves as a key metric engaging client satisfaction and is the primary indicator of client lifetime value. We also drive significant recurring revenue from mortgage servicing. During the first quarter, we generated $346 million of cash revenue from our servicing book, which represents approximately $1.4 billion on an annualized basis.  \n Servicing is a strategic area of growth and we see strong synergy between our Servicing portfolio and our Origination business. With our industry-leading recapture rate, we take a different approach to servicing than others, viewing it through the lens of client lifetime value. \n In March and April, we acquired over $8 billion of unpaid principal balance with a blended weighted average note rate above that of our current portfolio. These higher note rate MSRs enable us to capitalize on our industry-leading recapture rate and set us up for future refinance opportunities.  \n Turning to our outlook for the second quarter. Our guidance on today's call is based on trends we've observed quarter-to-date and 1 month of actual performance. April is typically the lowest month of the quarter from a volume perspective and market conditions in April were challenging. The 10-year treasury yield has increased roughly 70 basis points since the start of the year in response to persistent inflation and strong macroeconomic data. Despite some gradual improvements, home inventory levels remain well below their historical average, while higher mortgage rates further compound affordability challenges.  \n The traditional spring purchase season is off to a slow start. Across the industry, 2024 has turned in the worst March and April for purchase applications in the last 30 years. Despite the challenging rate and inventory environment, our Q2 guidance reflects our expectation of higher volume and positions us to take share again in the second quarter. It's worth noting that our strong gain on sale margins in Q1 benefited from 2 market-driven factors that may not reoccur. One factor was a lower interest rate environment when compared to Q2. Another factor was our extremely strong execution in the securitization markets for our home equity loan product. Therefore, our expectation is that the second quarter gain on sale margins will return to levels closer to those observed in the second half of last year.  \n In Q2, we expect adjusted revenue to be in the range of $1.075 billion to $1.225 billion. In summary, we are confident that we will drive top line growth, take share and our guidance reflects exactly this.  \n Regarding operating expenses, we expect the second quarter to be roughly flat on a year-over-year basis, as the savings from last year's operational efficiency initiatives are expected to be mostly offset by increased variable costs related to higher volumes, which includes the industry-wide credit cost increases.  \n As always, our forward-looking guidance is based on our current outlook and visibility, which should come across clearly from our remarks today is our conviction to grow purchase and transform the massive, fragmented homeownership category. Through our strategy and with our capabilities, we believe we are well-positioned to navigate and thrive regardless of market conditions. With AI, we are unlocking capacity and enhancing operational efficiency, velocity and accuracy.  We are just getting started, and we're fired up to execute on our mission to help everyone home. \n With that, we are ready to turn it back over to the operator for questions. Yes. The only thing just to build on that, Ryan, when we look -- sit here today and we look at some of the industry forecasts, a few of them are triangulating around about $1.8 trillion, that feels high from what we've seen to Varun's point in terms of the rate moves. But regardless of that, we've shown, because the first quarter was also a challenged market, that we can drive significant profitability through our system and take share.  \n So to Varun's point, it's a really good case study into us doing -- executing on our strategies. And it's worth noting, too, that if rates are to stay higher for longer, and let's say it's not a $1.8 trillion market, it's something less than that, there's a view you can get to pretty easily that, that actually benefits us even more given our capitalization levels, given our liquidity and some of the investments we've made over the past few years in terms of technology to increase capacity. We think that actually bodes really well for us. Ryan, I can double-click on the -- your guide question, but we've shared this before. But of course, we take into account all the information we have really leading up to the call right here. It's worth pointing out that it's a 15% year-over-year improvement on adjusted revenue, if you take the midpoint of the range. I won't belabor the rate comments. But clearly, April has seen a different rate environment than what we saw in the first quarter. \n As it relates to inventory, we are seeing modest improvement. We are seeing a little bit of an uptick in listings, but in our view, that's largely offset by some of these affordability challenges. But we want to be clear that the guide does assume volume is up in the second quarter from the first quarter, and we believe that, that's really from us continuing to take share. Our purchase pipeline remains very strong. Consumer demand for home buying is also very high. It's just the affordability aspect that we have to get over. \n And then to your point on gain on sale margins, we've said before that we generally expect gain on sale margins to continue to expand from last year's levels. And that is definitely proving out. There's no question about it. The 311 basis point print in Q1 is obviously extremely healthy. But that did exceed even our expectations. And that was really for 2 reasons, both which are positive. But the first is the closed and second product. The consumer demand for those closed and second is very high. But what we also found in the first quarter is the investment, the private space demand to buy the product given people that are chasing yields right now is also extremely high. So we just had better-than-expected secondary execution. All the secondary execution has been good, but this was especially rich. \n So to your point, that's just something I wouldn't -- I can't count on for future quarters, though I do expect the demand for the product to be rich. And then the first quarter just had a -- even though rates were rising, the rate of change was a little bit less so what we saw in April. So the first quarter had a little bit better interest rate environment. So -- but nothing has changed in our view on gain on sale margins. We still -- we do believe there's expansion that's happening, and that's largely because of capacity coming out. Yes. Let me start with the outlook and just to touch on the market view again. We're not trying to pin down a number, but the problem with those $1.8 trillion numbers is they're outdated, right? Even the published dates if you look at where rates were when they published and you look at the forward curve, we were just in a different spot. So the other interesting thing about the $1.8 trillion is you kind of 3 or 4 of them get there, but they all get there in different ways. To your point, Fannie has a big step-up, but MBA step-up is actually much less. So, I think, only like 16%. But the things that we're seeing in terms of real-time data, both macro and micro would tell us that, that's probably not as likely, though we do still think it will be a healthy market. \n So the only way I could answer your question is we take all that into account. This quarter is always the quarter that will tell the story of home buying as we enter this home-buying season. But the data that Varun highlighted that we saw in April does give us a bit of pause, but we're still very bullish on being able to grow our volume in the second quarter, largely through taking share, which leads me to your next point. Yes, we are seeing an acceleration of share gains. Varun mentioned this in his prepared remarks, but the banks continue to see share for all practical purposes, most retail or other type of online lenders are really not doing anything in the client acquisition space. If clients are inbounding to them, they'll do loans, but they're not out there marketing or spending marketing dollars. And so that bodes really well for our ability to accelerate share gains. Yes. Let me start, and I'm sure Varun will add, too. But I think on the proposal side, we'll see where that ends up. Generally, more liquidity is better in the mortgage space. So -- of course, we do support more liquidity. But I would say sort of different than others in the space. We kind of created this market. If you look at securitization data and you look at what we've done, we sort of made the closed and second market, at least for this go through. So finding the liquidity already. \n As I mentioned, that was a big component of the gain on sale margins over performance, I guess, you could say, in the first quarter. So for us, we don't need to count or rely on a proposal like that. I'm not sure where that will end up. But generally, the more liquidity is better. What I'll say though is we've already developed a really nice program. We have a bunch of capital. We have underwriting standards that people are buying into. I'm not sure where Freddie will end up on that spectrum. But like all GSE products, they'll have pretty tight rules. I think private capital will still be important in closed and seconds. The only thing I would say, which is just piggybacking on what Varun said is it's -- at this point, it's a capacity gain, right? We've talked a lot about we did $79 billion in originations last year, and we believe we can put a significant more amount of capacity through the system. We're really starting to see these benefits come to fruition. So that's our focus right now. That capacity will be used either when rates go down and the TAM increases and/or if rates stay higher and it's more difficult and it accelerates our share gains, we think keeping that capacity, removing friction and serving more clients is, first and foremost, our focus right now. . Yes. Mark, the thing we know is the banks were trying to really hard not to mortgages, and that was even before the Basel III standard. We don't know where it will end up. But we do, to Varun's point, can't comment specifically, but we think there's some interesting plays there. Yes. I think -- let me just -- that's a fair question. Thank you. Let me take one step back just to talk about how we think about the servicing asset. It's clearly a strategic asset. We really like the returns. Even if you just look at the cash flows right now, you're generally looking at double-digit returns. And then, of course, for us, where you add in our industry-leading recapture, and that's what really starts getting exciting in the return game. And we've always known that if a client goes through our J.D. Power winning origination experience and then we service them that we will recapture very well. But what is awesome to see is we're starting to prove to ourselves that we can also recapture well when we acquire a portfolio of servicing.\n Over the past couple of years, we've been doing that. It takes some time to prove out that hypothesis because you need data and information. And obviously, since the -- where rates have been, just the number of transactions might naturally be lower. But we're starting to have more and more confidence that on the acquired portfolios, our recapture rate will be very healthy as well. \n So to answer your question, what that means is that gives us even more confidence to be actively bidding in the market. To your point, we still are seeing supply a bit challenged. There is a lot of demand and a little bit of supply out there. So there are competitive bids. But here's the thing, and you kind of mentioned this in your question that is exciting for us, the asset that we're very interested in and bidding on is a different asset than some of the others in the space are. Some of the servicers that have come out with some pretty robust goals around growing their servicing portfolio are actually interested in the very low [ WACC ] stuff.  \n For us, to your point, the higher [ WACC ] stuff is actually a bit more interesting to us if you think about the closed and second opportunity there, if you think about a potential cash-out opportunity there. So in the proof point being these 4 pools that we just bought, that strategy is really being deployed.

So it will be something we -- I think you can expect us to continue to focus on and be active in the space."

            "name": "Varun Krishna",
            "content": "Thank you, Sharon. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining the Rocket Companies Earnings Call for the First Quarter of 2024. \n This is my third earnings call since joining the company in September. As I reflect on the last 8 months, I am filled with gratitude to be part of a company with a clear and noble mission of helping everyone home. Never has this mission been more important, more relevant than it is right now. I am so proud of what our team has achieved together in this short time, and it's evident you're only at the beginning of our journey.  \n As an organization, we are driven to execute and win and our determination is absolute. We're playing both the short and the long game, gaining momentum and achieving success, while strategically planning and executing for the long term, and this has already led to some impressive results for Rocket.  \n Let's start with our Q1 business results where our Rocket blasted off as we entered the new year. I'll start by sharing just a few of the highlights that I'm especially proud of from the first quarter. We reported $0.04 of adjusted diluted EPS and delivered adjusted revenue of $1.163 billion in the first quarter, once again, far exceeding the high end of our guidance range. In addition, we returned to double-digit adjusted EBITDA margin. \n Alongside these solid results, we also continued to capture market share. In Q1, both purchase and refinance market share expanded showing double-digit percentage growth on a year-over-year basis. Our analysis shows that we took that market share from large industry players and big banks in particular.  \n Market share growth while maintaining healthy gain on sale margins is our North Star metric, and it's a yardstick that objectively measures our performance compared to the rest of the industry, independent of the inevitable ebbs and flows in the market. While we cannot control market movements, we can direct our efforts to delivering world-class service for our clients and focus on growing our share.  \n We are currently the #2 player in purchase, excluding correspondent lending, and we won't stop there as we continue our upward march. With our strategy and capabilities, we believe we can and will continue to grow market share in both purchase and refinance and drive consolidation in this fragmented winner-takes-all market.  \n I'd like to drill deeper into a few areas of our business that outperformed in Q1. Our home equity loan product has continued to expand significantly as we've seen volume grow more than 3.5x from Q1 of 2023 to Q1 this year. Since our launch, just under 2 years ago, Rocket is now among the top players across the entire home equity loan market. This achievement underscores the strength of our capital markets infrastructure and our team's ability to introduce and quickly scale innovative products that resonate with our clients.  \n Home equity loans are particularly relevant in today's market, as they present a great option for clients looking to tap into their home equity, whether to fund remodeling projects, consolidate debt or pay for a life event without affecting a favorable rate on their primary mortgage. Home equity loans close 7 days faster than our traditional refinance transactions, and importantly, they provide us with a springboard to consolidate a client's first and second lien mortgages when interest rates decline in the future.   \n Servicing is a key part of our business that enables us to play offense and defense at the same time. We acquired 4 MSR portfolios in March and April at a weighted average coupon well above that of our existing book. Rocket's recapture rate of service loans is more than 2x the industry average, which is why we see our servicing portfolio as such a strategic asset. It represents a future origination opportunity on nearly 2.5 million clients without additional marketing costs while paying a recurring cash flow until the next transaction. These are just a few examples of where strategic thinking and solid execution have driven tangible business results and outcomes.  \n Now let's shift forward. I'd like to transition and talk about some of the trends and themes that we're seeing at the industry level. Despite recent market volatility, we are steadfast in our belief that there is tremendous opportunity ahead for Rocket. In fact, when we widen the aperture, we believe Rocket is well-positioned to capitalize on the current trends shaping the industry over the long run.  \n Let me take just a minute to unpack 3 market-changing dynamics that create a perfect storm for Rocket to ride, execute and win. First, let's dive into industry capacity. Undoubtedly, the most challenging market conditions in 4 decades have catalyzed industry consolidation and capacity rationalization over the past couple of years. Mortgage employment has declined by 36% from its peak in April 2021, resulting in nearly 150,000 loan officers and mortgage brokers exiting the industry. The months to come are expected to put further pressure on smaller players already struggling with capacity and liquidity.  \n Secondly, if we look at banks, we can clearly see there has been a secular trend of banks feeding mortgage origination market share since the global financial crisis. In fact, their share has declined by nearly half from roughly 75% in 2008 to approximately 40% according to the most recently available data. Even still, banks hold top positions and comprise 6 of the top 20 spots in the industry rankings.  \n In recent years, banks have faced profitability challenges with their mortgage operations made more apparent against the backdrop of difficult market conditions. Looking ahead, Basel III capital requirements, which placed a higher risk weighting on mortgage capital, are likely to further deter banks from expanding their home lending operations. In fact, we believe many banks are reevaluating their mortgage lending operations altogether.  \n Lastly, the landmark National Association of Realtors Settlement has the potential to upend the home buying and selling realtor commission model that has remained unchanged for nearly 100 years. The traditional home buying and selling experience is fragmented, inefficient, costly and ripe for disruption. This settlement has the opportunity to change the home value equation and to pave the way for a better experience for both buyers and sellers of homes.  \n Rocket strategy capitalizes on these 3 seismic ships. We have a fortress balance sheet that gives us the flexibility to not only survive, but to thrive through the inevitable ups and downs of the market. While others are buying for survival, we are strategically investing in top-tier talent, cutting-edge technology and the enhancement of our brand to build a durable and growing business for the long term.  \n Our comprehensive suite of integrated end-to-end services squarely addresses every aspect of the home buying opportunity from every side of the equation. We are poised to lead and revolutionize how homes are bought, sold and financed.  \n As I shared earlier, at Rocket, our mission is to help everyone home. This is our grand challenge. We stand for every aspect of the homeownership journey from buying, selling and listing homes to purchase, refinance and servicing. That is what help everyone home means. We aim to transform the homeownership experience end to end, and our market opportunity is the entirety of the homeownership category.  \n The foundation that underpins this mission is a strategy that we call AI-fueled homeownership. That means we are committed to delivering industry-leading experiences powered by AI, benefiting our clients, mortgage brokers, real estate agents, financial institution partners and our team members alike. In a short amount of time, Rocket has already positioned itself as the industry leader in AI, continually pioneering client experiences that are unmatched by others.\n  Let me just share a handful of recent examples of how our innovation is accelerating. Our Rocket Homes team recently launched Explore Spaces visual search, the first of its kind in the industry. This innovation enables users to discover their next stream home by displaying photos based on features that are important to them such as kitchens with marble countertops or backyards with lush lawns. This is made possible by leveraging computer vision AI for image recognition and processing. This technology enables listing images to be quickly identified in text descriptions to be automatically generated, removing the need for manually tagging or writing content from scratch. Since launch, we've seen some very compelling early stocks. Users who engage with the Explore Spaces experience spend almost twice as long on the site per visit, and they returned 6x more often.  \n As part of the Explore Spaces experience, Rocket Homes also launched auditory search, which makes home search inclusive and accessible for the nearly 10% of the U.S. population that experiences visual impairment. AI automatically generates detailed captions for each photo that can actually be read aloud through AI-powered voice transcription.  \n Continuing our incredible pace of innovation, just last week, we launched a new pilot that uses voice-based generative AI to allow clients to update their verified approval letter simply by using their voice. Typically, when a client needs to modify their approval letter to make an offer on a house, a need that has only increased in today's dynamic and competitive home buying environment, they have to call their mortgage banker who then makes modification. Our bankers and underwriters handle those adjustment requests nearly 300,000 times a year. This is an incredibly manual process, which can take hours or days and not only takes our bankers away from prospecting for new business, but it is prone to errors and delays.  \n In an industry-first, our clients can use natural language to easily make modifications over the phone in just a minute. And their realtors are kept up to date through automated notifications 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This new feature is great for clients because the speed gives them an extra edge to make winning offers in their dream home. Every second counts in a competitive market. It's great for realtors to be kept in the loop and great for our bankers who can use time previously spent on this administrative task to work with more clients.  \n This is just one of many industry-first client-facing features in our pipeline that leverage AI to deliver great experiences. No matter the modality, whether through chat, phone, our website or our mobile app. There are many use cases for AI, but the most significant and immediately impactful application at our company is supercharging our team members. AI eliminates the drudgery of burdensome time-consuming manual tasks so that our team members can spend more time on making human connections and producing higher-value work. Ultimately, with AI, we are driving operational efficiency, speed, accuracy and personalization at massive scale. \n Rocket Logic, our proprietary patented AI technology platform and where the majority of our engineering resources are directed, powers both our client-facing interactions and back-end processing. Rocket Logic continues to add new capabilities and expand full automation of mundane tasks, bringing up team member capacity to serve many more clients and drive growth.  \n Rocket Logic utilizes collaborative intelligence to help our team members complete work more seamlessly. Here are just a few recent additions to our Rocket Logic platform. Rocket Logic Assistant, which seamlessly and accurately follows the conversation with a client in real time, populates hundreds of crucial application fields hands-free. We believe we have the best mortgage bankers in the business, and now we're providing them with the tools to be even more productive. As a result, they're able to devote their time and full attention to where it matters most to our clients.  \n Rocket Logic Docs, our intelligent document processing platform automates document upload, classification, loan association and field extraction, enabling fast and accurate processing at scale like never before. Rocket Logic Docs automatically identifies nearly 70% of the more than 1.5 million documents we received monthly resulting in a savings of more than 5,000 hours of manual work for our underwriters in February 2024 alone. Of the 4.3 million data points extracted from documents, including W-2s and bank statements in February, nearly 90% were automatically processed, saving an additional 4,000 hours of manual work for our team members. And we're continuously building upon and adding new capabilities to Rocket Logic.  \n Just last month, we announced Rocket Logic Synopsis. A new feature used by our client-facing team members across mortgage banking, TPO, mortgage operations and servicing. Each year, our teams participate in 65 million calls with our clients, and Synopsis works behind the scenes, transcribing and tagging client interactions, logging client preferences for communication method, time to be contacted, call purpose, sentiments and more.  \n The key to AI is continuous training of models with recursive feedback loops and data. We are organizing this invaluable data to construct unified client profiles in a centralized repository. From this repository, we train models to gain deeper insights and analytics to personalize all future interactions with our clients. The ultimate objective is to deliver industry-best client experiences that translates into better conversion rates and higher client lifetime value and to just get continuously better and better at it. \n Rocket Logic's automation has already reduced the number of times a team member interacts with a loan by nearly 25% year-over-year. This, in turn, has shaved several days off the time it takes Rocket's clients to close on a home purchase, reducing turn times by 25% from August 2022 to February 2024. These efficiencies are key in helping Rocket close loans nearly 2.5x faster than the industry average.  \n Great companies succeed with exceptional execution. At Rocket, we are driving better and faster execution across the board, and it's only going to continue and get even better from here. We are excited to share more examples of how AI is being deployed and the value it brings to our core businesses. We've recently solidified our road map and established objectives and key results to support our AI-driven homeownership strategy, and prioritize key strategic objectives. Consequently, we're operating with a heightened sense of focus and accountability.  \n Through this process, we've also streamlined how we interact internally and significantly reduced the number of meetings we conduct while sharpening the focus of those that we do have. As a result, I'm excited that our engineers are spending less time in meetings and roughly 30% more time coding and creating great experiences for our clients. In fact, just last month, I attended our Hack Week event, and I was just blown away. It was an amazing experience that highlighted our incredibly talented technology team members working rapidly to build that next game-changing innovation. From this Hack Week, dozens of the best ideas have gone from ideation to production in a matter of weeks.  \n In closing, we are laser-focused on our mission to help everyone home, and we are executing with velocity. We believe we're in the perfect position to take advantage of the opportunities presented by multiple once-in-a-generation tailwinds and we are poised to transform the home buying category, building upon our established refinance and servicing business and also continuing to grow and take share in purchase. All of this is underpinned by AI which enables us to accelerate our pace of execution and grow our market share, revenue and profitability at scale. \n And with that, I will turn it over to Brian. Yes. Ryan, thank you for the question. I'll start, and then I'll ask Brian to jump in if there's anything that he would add. And I think the first thing I would just say is it's a tough market out there. You've got rates that are kind of moving a little bit in the wrong direction. You've got MBA data that's showing that mortgage applications are lower than expected. But when you step back from that, we firmly believe that the dynamics of the market are going to be favorable to Rocket. And that's regardless of the size of the market, whether it's a $1.5 trillion TAM or a $2 trillion TAM.  \n And I want to just highlight a few indicators that reinforce my confidence in this. I think the first one is just our focus and track record. When you look at the TAM, regardless of what it is, and you sort of throw in real estate and financial services, that's a $5 trillion TAM. And we have proven that we have the ability to take share in any market purely as a function of our execution and persistence.  \n The second thing I'd highlight is just you've got so many tailwinds that are going to be benefiting Rocket that may be headwinds for industry, whether that's the rate environment that's putting pressure on smaller players, whether it's the capacity that's coming out of the industry, whether it's things like Basel III, disruptive dynamics like the recent NAR ruling that are going to create new opportunities to redefine the experience. These are all things that are tailwinds for Rocket that may be headwinds for the broader industry.  \n And then the third thing I'd highlight is just again, strategy and execution. We have assets that uniquely span the entirety of the homeownership journey. Purchase, refinance, servicing, personal finance, we're making significant investments in technology and talent. We've narrowed our focus. And so the bottom line is fortune really favors those who are built for storms, and there's tremendous share that's up for grabs, and that reflects our sort of tenacity in going after the market and playing to win and grow our share.  \n Brian, is there anything you would add? Yes. I mean I'll just cover a little bit on share and the NAR settlement. I think the first thing I would just say is there are 3 strategic levers that really come together in a durable way to enable our growth and share now and in the future. The first one is just innovation. We're betting big on AI experiences. We've simplified our funnel. We've got better personalization, more automation. The second thing is just our internal focus. We've streamlined our execution. We've got more dedicated autonomous teams with clear goals. So we've just improved our process. \n The third thing is just our top of funnel. We're meeting clients where they are. We've improved performance marketing. We've got better optimizations to improve our creative, our lead flow. We've got better engagement with our servicing portfolio. We've got better search and engagement experiences to nurture relationships with Rocket Homes and Rocket Money. So the bottom line is, I mean, what you see is in our results, and you see it in the market dynamics. So we definitely see that as an accelerator. So to your question, my answer is yes. \n And I think for the NAR settlement, the only thing I would just say is just -- it's been too long that the cost of buying and selling a home is too high and it's been too long that the transparency of the process has been opaque. And transparency in value is just what we believe, and it's what we've always believed in. And there are some folks in the industry that are going to fight this tooth and nail. There's others that are going to look past it and seize the opportunity. And we definitely choose to be the latter to the bigger picture, be on the consumer side and just leverage this to take cost and efficiency out of the -- take cost out of the equation, introduce efficiency into the equation and just create more value. So we've been experimenting this space already with things like Buy Plus and we're really going to continue to do so. The only thing I would just add is this is just a great example of how we're building products that are relevant for the current market, which is evidenced also just, by the way, with our history, I mean, whether it's Buy Plus, One Plus or Inflation Buster, anticipating our client's needs and meeting them where they are and solving a meaningful problem. I'm just very proud of our team for continuing to set the standard of being ahead of the curve. Yes. Thank you for the question, Mark. I'll just start by saying that profitability and efficiency are 2 sides of the same coin, right? And they both matter significantly. Our main focus is market share and top line growth. And the way you do that smartly is you leverage your savings to invest in growth. That's going to happen through accelerated execution. That's going to happen through big swings on innovation. It's also going to happen through focus on efficiency, which is a constant strategic imperative. \n The thing I'm excited about is our AI strategy is specifically designed to create and unlock operating leverage. So it will allow us to grow our capacity without increasing head count. And it will allow us to actually build our company and grow durably. So we don't look at this AI investment as a head count reducer. I mean that's not how you build a growth company durably. But the combination of being able to invest in technology and have an ongoing principle around efficiency is how we think we're going to create a durable flywheel. And of course, continuous investment in product innovation and create new-to-the-world offerings that will be able to create value for clients is something that represents our brand, who we are, who we've always been and who we will be. \n Anything, Brian, you would add? Yes. We can't comment on the specific conversations that we're having, but I would just say that, I mean, I think we see there's an opportunity to create value. And so those conversations are ongoing, and we'll share more as we make progress. Yes. No, thank you for the question, Derek. I'll just start by saying the reason that we're obsessed with AI is because it brings a number of transformative benefits to our business. And that's really grounded in the Rocket Logic platform and what it represents for the next chapter in the company. The first one is just efficiency. It allows us to serve more clients by simply just automating the mundane. And the second one is speed and velocity, just because our clients value speed and certainty, they have to be competitive. They have to be able to operate and execute offers and things like that at speed. \n And then the third one is experience, just creating more personalization, more delight on what is a very emotional journey that millions of people go through when it comes to homeownership on every side of the equation. And with Rocket Logic, we're in the earliest days of this revolution, and I firmly believe the best is yet to come. And this is our AI platform. It is our most strategic imperative and we've dramatically increased our investment as well as the velocity with which we're launching futures every week. \n The platform is now extended to every part of the journey from the digital experience that clients interact with to how we interact on the phone with mortgage banking or client services to the way we manage documents and extraction to income verification to underwriting to servicing. And we've started to see some pretty awesome benefits. We've seen hours saved. That's a metric that we track. We were up to 170,000 hours per year. We've seen improvements in resolution times. Our first call resolution has improved by 10% with the Synopsis experience that we just announced a few days ago. And then ultimately, just turn times, right, 2.5x faster than industry. \n And then last, but not least, accuracy, we've seen zero audit findings with our income verification experience. And so across the board, this platform is delivering a benefit to us, both in terms of the client experience that our end clients face, but also just supercharging our team members to be able to do more with less. And so we're very excited about this platform. We think it has tremendous benefits across the board, and we're just getting started. Yes, I think -- thank you for the question, Brad. I think the first thing I would just say is purchase is a strategic focus area for the company more than it's ever been in the past. And that comes down to how we've organized, how we've structured our teams, how we've dedicated resources and how we've just invested the time to really understand the nature of what it takes to win. That includes dedicated teams. It includes understanding the funnel. It includes also understanding the nature of just how you help clients with every aspect of the journey from searching from a home to building relationships with the realtor and broker to going through the process of making an offer. We have just dedicated significantly more focused toward than ever before. That's kind of the first thing. \n I think the other thing I would just say is we've integrated our ecosystem assets like never before. The role of Rocket Money has never been more important. The role of our Home Search experience has never been more important. The role of our Servicing Portfolio and building engagement with our clients where we can collect data and we can help them with their next transaction has never been important. So this is -- it's a game of interest, but the interests are everywhere when you kind of think about all of them put together and they add up. And so when you put those interest together, you start to see that execution happen. And so there are bigger swings that we're thinking about when you think about the opportunity that AI actually affords us to take a giant leap forward. We're also obviously looking at both organic and inorganic opportunities. But we're serious about purchase, and you can expect to see us continue to invest and dedicate our focus on it and so we win. Yes. I mean I think the thing I would just say is there's a certain activation energy that's required to be successful in AI. You have to have a large number of clients that you can engage with. You have to have a lot of data that you can build models around. And then you have to have resources that you can invest to kind of train, build and sort of continue to sort of improve these experiences that they're better. So this is one of those where it's difficult to be successful in AI if you don't have data at scale, if you don't have large engineering resources, if you don't invest in data science, algorithmic intelligence, talent. And so I think for us, it is a strategic imperative at every layer of the company. It's where we've dedicated the vast number of our resources, and we're continuing to grow our investment both with internal and external talent. \n And so for us, I mean, a good example I would give is just adding Alex Rampell to our Board, who is the industry leader in both fintech and AI, that's an example of just where the level of investment that we're making, the thought leadership and just the focus is only going to be increasing. I'd also just share that we're hiring a new Chief Technology Officer that will be joining the company in days to come. And so we're serious about this. We're investing, and we're playing to win. Well, thank you, everyone, for our great conversation today. We look forward to the next earnings call. We also invite you to our Investor Day later in the fall. We appreciate it."
