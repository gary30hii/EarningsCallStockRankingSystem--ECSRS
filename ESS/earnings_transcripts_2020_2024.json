Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found on the company\u2019s filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall. You may begin.\nMichael Schall: Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. I am very pleased to acknowledge the promotions of Angela Kleiman and Barb Pak to their new roles at Essex and greatly appreciate their contributions for many years of dedicated service. Both Angela and Barb will follow me with prepared remarks; and Adam Berry, our Chief Investment Officer, is here for Q&A. At the end of last year, we announced John Burkart\u2019s retirement and we thank John for his tireless efforts and numerous contributions to the company\u2019s success over nearly three decades. As we reported last night, our fourth quarter and full-year 2020 results continue to be significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in lower same-property revenue and core FFO per share for both the quarter and the full-year. Similar to the last few quarters, pandemic-related regulations have had two primary consequences: first, shelter-in-place and related orders have resulted in unprecedented job losses; and second, anti-eviction and related laws prevent us from maximizing property performance. Government mandates are constantly changing and they intensified during the fourth quarter given surge in COVID-19 cases. Navigating the pandemic involves extraordinary efforts and I thank the Essex team for their tireless dedication amid these challenges. Overall, our fourth quarter results reflect stability and sequential net effective rents beginning in October and as discussed during our third quarter earnings call. Sequential revenues improved 30 basis points in the quarter, with market rents mostly flat in the cities and modestly positive in suburban locations. Therefore, we are cautiously optimistic that we have or will soon reach the bottom in market rent declines. As of December 2020, preliminary three-month trailing job losses in the Essex markets were 7.9% year-over-year, a 150 basis point improvement compared to minus 9.4% for September 2020 and outperforming the nation, which had a 100 basis point improvement from September to December. Even with the recovery of jobs in Q3 and Q4, the nation had 9.2 million fewer jobs year-over-year for the month of December, roughly equal to the number of jobs lost at the worst point of the financial crisis. Our data analytics team prepared S-17 to the supplemental, which is our base case scenario underlying our expectation that net effective rents will decline 1.9% in 2021. The range of potential outcomes is extraordinarily wide for 2021, given many unknowns that relate to the pandemic, including the pace of vaccine deployment and changes in regulation. Our modeling further assumes 4% GDP growth, which should lead to positive momentum in the second-half of 2021. Apartment supply will continue to be a challenge, especially in the downtown locations of Los Angeles and Seattle. Our data and analytics team expects approximately 34,000 apartment deliveries in 2021, a modest increase compared to last year. Also similar to 2020, we don\u2019t expect much for-sale housing production going forward. It\u2019s our experience that affordable for-sale housing competes directly with rentals, once rents rise to a level that approximates the monthly payment of an entry-level for-sale home, and there is little risk of that occurring in the Essex markets anytime soon. Page S-17.1 of the supplemental highlights 13 recent multibillion-dollar tech initial public offerings for companies headquartered in the Essex markets. Overall, 2020 was a great year for IPOs, with 147 tech sector offerings completed during the year. It\u2019s our view that the IPO market is essential to recharge the tech ecosystem, providing growth capital to early-stage investors and to generate liquidity for reinvestment. Page S-17.1 also illustrates the reacceleration in job openings for the top 10 tech companies, which has increased 38% since the August trough. Our analysis indicates that nearly 60% of the total job postings are located in California or Washington, with the next largest state, Texas, accounting for just 7%. The Page S-17.2 of the supplemental package demonstrates that venture capital investments continued on a record pace in 2020 with approximately $130 billion invested in the U.S. with the Essex markets continuing to receive the dominant share of VC investment. Success in the knowledge-based economy requires a critical mass of highly skilled workers, creating a network effect that draws companies to the Bay Area and Seattle. While only a limited number of venture-backed companies will go public, some will experience extraordinary growth similar to Snowflake, DoorDash, Airbnb and resulting in thousands of high-paying jobs. The environment today has many similarities to the previous recessionary periods, including the financial crisis and the bursting of the dot-com bubble. In both cases, migration out of California was often front page news. In 2020, we experienced higher out migration than normal, especially in our West Coast urban centers. In our experience, people make different housing choices during recessions and it\u2019s not surprising to see many in the large baby boomer cohort monetized the value of an expensive California home to move to less expensive areas as part of the retirement plan. This recession is unique with respect to the extraordinary loss of jobs that involve lower paid service workers, jobs that are concentrated in the city centers and effective employees often had only two choices: move immediately to find work or stay in their home shielded by eviction forbearance laws. As with previous recessions, we expect most of these trends to reverse. We expect that the demand for restaurants, services and travel will recover swiftly as vaccines are administered, bringing back related service jobs. Workers in the Essex markets earn more than in most parts of the country and the draw of higher-paying jobs, combined with lower recent rent levels makes rental housing down the West Coast, the most affordable it has been since 2013. Our recent McKinsey study estimates that only 22% of the American workforce can work from home without any productivity loss. We have been tracking many companies that have adopted work from home models during the pandemic, and we remain confident that the vast majority of companies will ask employees to return to the office when it is safe to do so, likely with increased work from home flexibility going forward. Google, Netflix and Apple are among the largest companies who have expressed their desire to return to the office, many others will follow. Turning to the regulatory environment, a third wave of COVID-19 cases beginning in November and related concerns about hospital availability led to the imposition of severe stay-at-home orders in all of our California markets. Some of these restrictions were eased last week, but all of the Essex markets remain in California\u2019s most restrictive category. Recently, with the passage of SB 91 last week, the state of California has extended COVID-19 related eviction protection from January 31 to June 30, 2021, including pushing back the requirement to pay at least 25% of pandemic-related rent. In addition, the law established a state rental assistance program to allocate $2.6 billion in Federal Stimulus Funds using income levels to prioritize payments and accepting related applications in March. As with similar laws, there are many related requirements and complexities, which we are evaluating. Turning to the apartment investment markets, during 2020, we sold 4 properties with a total of 670 apartment homes for $343 million, all of which were placed under contract subsequent to the implementation of shelter-in-place orders in March. Given the wide discount in valuation for public REITs compared to the private real estate markets, property sales remain our preferred source of funds for investment. Since the onset of the pandemic, a relatively small number of apartment sales support our belief that property values have not changed materially since the onset of the pandemic. However, extraordinary changes in rent increasing in the case of both suburban markets and decreasing sharply in some urban locations, makes it difficult to draw conclusions about cap rates. In the suburbs, where rents are generally at or above pre-pandemic levels, property values have modestly increased and cap rates are somewhat lower compared to the pre-pandemic period. Given lower rents and significant concessions in hard hit cities, recent price talk around possible sales indicate about a 5% reduction in value versus the pre-COVID period, resulting in cap rates for high-quality properties below 4%. As with previous recessions, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have continued to provide very attractive financing with 7-year fixed rate financing in the mid-2% range, potentially supporting lower cap rates. Vaccine distribution should remove uncertainty with respect to apartment operations and property values. As a result, we believe transaction volumes will begin to accelerate. As we have indicated before, improved cash flow from positive leverage in apartments has historically led to a robust transaction market. With that, I will turn the call over to Angela.\nAngela Kleiman: Thank you, Mike. First, I would like to express my appreciation to the Essex operations team for their diligent efforts to serve our customers amidst a challenging environment caused by the COVID pandemic. Thank you for all your hard work. As for my comments, I will begin by discussing our 2020 results, followed by our outlook for 2021. The overall, our market performed as we expected, despite the headwinds of new cohort related closures and seasonal decline in demand. Currently, the urban core particularly in tech-centric markets continued to remain more impacted by COVID-19 related job losses and office disclosures. In addition, the change in quality of life, resulting from the closures of restaurants and public amenities has driven a temporary shift in consumer preferences. High-rise buildings or communities located in the area with high walk scores have been the most impacted by this shift in demand. Conversely, communities with private outdoor space or more affordable residences outside the urban core continue to experience greater demand, which benefited many of our properties in Ventura, San Diego, Orange County and the East Bay in Northern California. This temporary shift in demand continued in the fourth quarter, where we experienced a 7.6% and 9.9% year-over-year increase in quarterly turnover in CBD, Seattle and San Francisco compared to the portfolio average turnover of only 1.3%. Furthermore, our CBD locations also had a greater concentration of apartment supply deliveries typically accompanied by very high concession levels. During the fourth quarter, we continued our leasing strategy of leveraging concessions on stabilized communities and building occupancy. There have been encouraging indicators from a sequential perspective in that more than half of our same-property portfolio grew revenues sequentially, driven in part by increases in occupancy and decreases in concessions. We have provided year-over-year net effect rent changes for our portfolio on Page S-16 of our supplemental. New lease rates were down 8.9% in the fourth quarter, stable in January, an improvement from the negative 12.2% achieved in the third quarter. Concessions on same-property approval improved from approximately $18 million in the third quarter to $13 million in the fourth quarter. This reduction in concessions is noteworthy, considering the fourth quarter has seasonally lower demand and historically, concessions increased during this period rather than decrease. Key highlights of the same-property performance of our major markets in the fourth quarter are as follows: in Seattle, 4.9% year-over-year revenue decline was primarily driven by Seattle CBD, which declined by 13%, while the remaining submarkets averaged a 3.2% decline, year-over-year job growth in Seattle declined by 7.3% in the fourth quarter. In Northern California, the 10.4% year-over-year revenue decline was led by CBD, San Francisco and Oakland, averaging an 18% decline, contrasted with a 4.2% decline in Contra Costa County, while Santa Clara County performed in line with the regional average of a 10% decline. Year-over-year job growth in Northern California declined by 8% with San Jose far better at a 6.4% decline. In Southern California, the 7.2% year-over-year decline was primarily driven by LACBD and West L.A. submarkets, averaging a 17% decline, offset by an average decline of 2.4% in our suburban markets of Ventura, Orange County and San Diego. Fourth quarter year-over-year job growth in Southern California declined by 8%. Moving on to our 2021 outlook, as indicated on S-17 of the supplemental, multifamily supply as a percentage of stock remained low at 0.9% for our portfolio. While we expect a percentage of the year-over-year growth to remain flat, new completions will once again be concentrated in the CBDs and urban submarkets where supply is projected to increase by 2.1% compared to just 0.7% across the rest of the portfolio. The confluence of minimal supply and extraordinary job losses remain a significant headwind in our urban markets. In Seattle, we expect multifamily supply as a percentage of stock to increase in 2021 by 1.6%, driven by 2.9% in the CBD, offset by a 1% increase in the suburbs, where we have the majority of our units. We have also seen positive office activities by major tech companies as they continue to push forward on expansion projects. In Seattle, Amazon received approval for a 1.1 million square foot project in Bellevue, Microsoft has continued with their campus expansion, and in , Google acquired a 10-acre site for a large campus. In Northern California, we project overall multifamily supply as a percentage of stock in 2021 to decrease by 10 basis points, although Oakland and San Jose CBD are expected to increase by 1.8% and 3%, respectively. Despite the impact of COVID, tech expansion plans have continued in the area. Amazon purchased a 6-acre site near downtown San Francisco. Facebook last month submitted an updated plan for its 1.25 million square foot campus expansion in Menlo Park, and Google continued to work with the city of San Jose for its major new campus at Diridon Station. In addition, the biotech sector continued to be a strong source of office demand highlighted by the recently approved expansion of Genentech\u2019s headquarter in South San Francisco, which would add up to 4.3 million square foot of new office space. In Southern California, we project overall multifamily supply as a percentage of stock to remain flat. The most notable increase is 4% LA CBD and deliveries in West LA will remain elevated once again this year. While many uncertainties remain as to legislation and the timing of the vaccine, based on current market conditions, we assume our scheduled rent for the same-property portfolio will trough in the second quarter this year. Because leases are typically 1 year in duration, our year-over-year revenue growth will be negative in the first half and positive in the second half, leading to our same-store full year guidance of 2.5% revenue decline at the midpoint. Lastly, our current same-store physical occupancy is 96.4%. Our availability 30 days out is 4.7%. Thank you. And I will now turn the call to Barb Pak.\nBarb Pak: Thank you, Angela. I will start with a few comments on our fourth quarter results, followed by key assumptions in our 2021 guidance and finally, an update on our recent capital markets activities and the balance sheet. As expected, the fourth quarter was a challenging period with core FFO declining 12.5% compared to 1 year ago. This was primarily driven by an 8% decline in same property revenues as a result of higher concessions and delinquencies. As we noted last quarter, we report concessions on a cash basis in our same-property results because we believe this is more indicative of true market conditions. However, we are required by GAAP to treat concessions on a straight-line basis in calculating consolidated revenue and FFO. As Angela mentioned, during the fourth quarter, we provided $5 million fewer concessions than the third quarter, which helped improve same-property revenue sequentially. However, core FFO declined by 4% or $0.13 per share compared to the third quarter, of which, $0.16 is attributable to lower straight-line rent concessions. We expect this line item to continue to be a headwind to core FFO growth in 2021, which I will discuss in a minute. Please note on Page S-8 of the supplemental, we have detailed the quarterly impact of non-cash straight line rents. Turning to delinquencies, we continue to take a conservative approach to reserving against uncollected rents, especially given the surge in COVID-19 cases in the fourth quarter, which resulted in extended lockdowns in our markets throughout much of the quarter. As such, we reserved against the entire net delinquency balance during this quarter. Our receivable balance currently stands at approximately $7 million, including joint ventures at pro rata share. Based on past collections, we feel this receivable balance is consistent with our ongoing conservative approach. We will continue to assess our delinquency reserve and our net receivable balance each quarter based on collection history and market conditions. Turning to our 2021 guidance, key assumptions are available on Page 5 of the earnings release and S-14 of the supplemental. We have provided a wider than normal range for same-property revenues and core FFO given the significant uncertainties that remain surrounding COVID and the recovery ahead, including vaccine distribution and eviction moratoriums that are outside our control but could swing guidance in a variety of ways. That said, we felt it was important to outline our key assumptions based on information we have today. For the full year, we expect core FFO per diluted share to decline by 5.1% at the midpoint. The key drivers of the decrease are primarily related to the following 2 items. First, we expect same-property revenues and NOI to decline by 2.5% and 4.6%, respectively, at the midpoint. While current operating fundamentals remain steady in our markets as compared to several months ago, we will continue to feel the negative effects of the 2020 rent declines throughout most of 2021. In addition, due to the eviction moratoriums and regulations that remain outside our control, we expect delinquencies will remain elevated in 2021 and will be a drag to core FFO by an estimated $0.45 per share at the midpoint. The company has a long history of excellent rent collections, and we expect this temporary delinquency headwind to become a tailwind to FFO growth once the various COVID-related restrictions are lifted. Second, we also faced significant headwinds from straight-line concessions. We expect this non-cash item will result in $0.41 to $0.56 per share decline in core FFO, representing about a 4% reduction in growth on a year-over-year basis. As it relates to concessions, we expect they will remain high in the first half of the year before moderating in the second half of the year as the economic recovery takes hold. As such, we expect the impact from straight-line rent concessions to be minimal in the first half of the year, with most of the negative impact we forecasted to fall in the last 2 quarters of 2021. Lastly, on the capital markets activities and the balance sheet, during the fourth quarter, we closed $206 million of new preferred equity investments and bought back $46 million of common stock at a significant discount to NAV. These investments are being funded with 3 asset sales totaling approximately $275 million that are under contract and expected to close in the first quarter. This is consistent with our guiding principles of match funding investments on a leverage-neutral basis. For the year, we were able to arbitrage the difference between public and private market pricing by selling $343 million of assets at prices generally consistent with pre-COVID levels and buying back 269 million of stock at an average price of $225 per share, all while maintaining our balance sheet strength and creating value for our shareholders. Our balance sheet remains strong with minimal near-term funding needs and sound financial metrics. While our net debt-to-EBITDA has increased this year, this is primarily the result of the significant decline in EBITDA caused by the pandemic. As the economic recovery takes hold and the West Coast economies continue to reopen, we expect our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio will improve. With ample liquidity and a well covered dividend, our balance sheet remains a source of strength. With that, I will turn the call back to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. I appreciate the commentary on kind of the dynamic nature of your markets as well as the slides in the supplemental. But I\u2019m just wondering, as you think about kind of post-COVID, right, if we are in a more flexible work environment, putting aside any kind of migration trends outside of the state. But just if there is more flexibility and commuting times change, how does that think \u2013 or how does that change how you think about your exposure within your markets, either urban, suburban or even further out? And could there be opportunities that you\u2019re exploring today?\nMichael Schall: Hi, Nick. Thanks for the question. It\u2019s a good one and this is Mike. We think that there will be more work from home flexibility, but at the same time, we think that employees will be tethered at some level to the office. As I think about the three other very capable people here today, knowing them and trusting them and all these things are a great team effort and teams are better when you really know the people and can trust the people. So I\u2019d say that is key factor that I think. And as noted in the prepared remarks, we\u2019ll keep employees relatively close to their jobs. So having said that, I would think the winners in this scenario will ultimately be the high-quality cities that are near the jobs, but also offer maybe a little bit more affordable housing and good schools, low crime rates, et cetera. So I think that, that will play itself out. And I think those areas we have a lot of cities that are among the major metros that qualify for that. So \u2013 and some of them have been pretty hard hit. So I would \u2013 I guess I would add to that, some of the cities that are high-quality cities, their rents have been highly impacted by COVID. Certainly, when I think about Northern California and the tech markets, the Peninsula, San Mateo, even suburban parts of San Jose would be major beneficiaries of that because we view that technology is going to continue to be a very strong economic driver. And the tech ecosystem in the Bay Area is incredibly unique. And therefore, we think it will do well.\nNick Joseph: Thanks.\nMichael Schall: Does that answer the question?\nNick Joseph: That did. That was very helpful. And then just one quick follow - or one quick question, I guess, on the rent relief programs. Is that helping residents who are behind kind of fill out or navigate the ability to get rent relief? And is there any kind of rent relief from the government assumed the guidance?\nMichael Schall: Yes. As noted on the call that last week, the state of California using federal stimulus dollars started a program or announced a program of $2.6 billion, potentially of rent relief. And the way it would work is the landlord would be required to forgive 20%. And so the reimbursement from these programs could be 80%. That will be predicated on percentages of median income, average median income, so it will provide the greatest benefit to those that are lower income levels. And it\u2019s hard to tell exactly what that means. We just haven\u2019t had enough time to evaluate that program. So I\u2019m guessing that we will have a pretty significant positive impact from it. But again, it\u2019s too early to evaluate.\nNick Joseph: Thank you.\nMichael Schall: Thanks, Nick.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.\nJeff Spector: Great. Thank you. First, I want to say congratulations to Angela and Barb. And we wish John a great retirement. Thanks for the time today. Mike, in your opening remarks, you commented that you have or soon will reach a bottom in market rents. And I know you\u2019re fairly conservative. And so I take that comment pretty serious. I guess what gives you comfort to say that can you just talk about that a little bit more, please?\nMichael Schall: Of course, Jeff, I think it\u2019s a good question, and it\u2019s, I think, probably maybe the most important question out there. So if we look at net effective rents, for the fourth quarter, sequentially, they were down under 1%. So net debt, that\u2019s all the markets. Now there is pretty significant variation between market to market. And part of that is even though we have high occupancy overall, there are parts of our portfolio that have lower occupancy. For example, San Francisco is still at 92.5%. Seattle Downtown is at about the same level. And so, there are areas that we are very highly occupied that are offsetting areas that don\u2019t have the same occupancy and actually below the average occupancy level. And most of that, as Angela alluded to, is related to the supply level. As you can imagine, if you\u2019ve got negative job growth equivalent to right now, still as of December, equivalent to the worst part of the great financial crisis, it is not a great time to be delivering apartment units. And therefore, and the cities are getting the bulk of the supply delivery. So you have this confluence that Angela spoke about, which is negative demand growth and loss of supply and the cities are understandably hit from that. Offsetting that is, we do have markets that are doing very well. For example, Ventura, where rents are up almost 10% year-over-year on a market basis. And so we\u2019re doing pretty well in a lot of these suburbs. Now that leads to this issue that I talked about many times, which is rent-to-income. And it\u2019s interesting that Ventura with its \u2013 I think it\u2019s more like 8.5% \u2013 8.5% to 10% rent increase is now about 17% above its long-term historical average of this ratio of rent-to-income, which is incredibly important to us. Whereas in Northern California were 7% below the long-term average of rent-to-income. So everyone looks at this like, hey, the suburbs is going to do a lot better. But when rents go up a long ways, I would question that. And conversely, when the rents are essentially hammered in the cities, it changes the consumer\u2019s view of where the opportunity is. And so our view is long \u2013 a little bit longer-term that you are going to see a very significant movement back towards the areas where rents are - high-quality cities where rents are pretty affordable.\nJeff Spector: Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful. And is that what ultimately led to Essex providing the full-year guidance, which is very much appreciated?\nMichael Schall: Well, it\u2019s \u2013 there is a number of things. We have a whole \u2013 I kind of have a philosophy on guidance being an ex-CFO. And if I weren\u2019t here, I\u2019m not sure that Barb and Angela wouldn\u2019t have come to a different decision to be perfectly candid. So \u2013 but yes, I mean, our preference is to always provide what we can and to be pretty open with the market. And then you all can disagree with us. But presumably, we have better information than you have, and therefore, it\u2019s up to us to sort of lead the way. So that\u2019s the philosophical position I took and it prevailed.\nJeff Spector: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nRich Hill: Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for all the transparency you provided in the release and in the prepared remarks. One of the things that struck us is that you guys did a really good job early on evaluating occupancy over rent. And I think that\u2019s one of the reasons that you are really starting to see some sequential growth. And you\u2019ve alluded to this a little bit. But I do want to maybe drill down a little bit more on the leases that are coming due in what\u2019s historically the peak leasing season and how you think you\u2019re going to manage through that? I recognize that you said 1Q is going to be tough, 2Q is going to be challenging as well, but how do you think through that? How do you think your occupancy sets you up to manage through the leases coming due, when demand is still not going to be back to where it is?\nAngela Kleiman: Yes, hey, it\u2019s Angela here. That\u2019s a good question, and it\u2019s certainly something we actively debate internally with the tactical strategy, right? Well, I don\u2019t think I want to go through our playbook in detail. I would just say that we focus on maximizing revenue, and we do so by optimizing occupancy whenever possible, and we meet the market. And so given where we are, you\u2019re right on point that we did in the third quarter focused on occupancy, which allowed us the fourth quarter to pull back on concessions as we see the market stabilize. And so as we continue to see the how the market performs, we will continue to use that strategy. And the goal at this point is really to try to pull back on concessions whenever possible. And of course, keep in mind, that\u2019s subject to, of course, the supply, which I mentioned in the CBDs will continue to be pretty heavy and assuming a recovery in the back half of the year. So, all those come into play.\nRich Hill: Okay. I think that \u2013 I have appreciation for you not wanting to give the playbook away. I would love for you too, but I appreciate why you might not want to. I wanted to \u2013 on the other side of the equation, just the job growth. One of the things that, believe it or not I think is misunderstood about your portfolio, is your class AB mix in urban versus suburban? I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s always appreciated by the investor base. So when you think about job growth, can you maybe break down those job growth views relative to white collar, high class \u2013 high-paying jobs in urban markets versus maybe the type of renters that would rate class B in the suburban markets?\nMichael Schall: Yes, this is Mike. And there is a lot to that question, so I will try to unpack it as best I can. Every recession is a little bit different. And normally, we view Southern California as our more typical of the U.S. average and therefore, it\u2019s less volatile. In this recession, it has been incredibly volatile in a certain sector and that is the Motion Picture sector. We didn\u2019t talk about it this time, we have on prior calls and it\u2019s effectively shutdown. And this is like the big wealth generator in Southern California. And so Southern California is probably the biggest surprise relative to prior recessions. For example, in the financial crisis, market rents went down in Southern California about 10% versus about 15% for the Essex portfolio in total. So this time, Southern California looks a lot like Northern California. And I think it\u2019s because of the two key parts of it, again, the filming and entertainment business plus all of these low jobs. When you look at the sectors of jobs that have been demolished, it\u2019s all the lower income segments of the job base, mainly it\u2019s hospitality and restaurants and other services those jobs are down. On the metros, somewhere in the 20% range, which means in the cities which are even higher concentrated, they are even more impacted. So as Angela said, you have got more supply coming into the cities. You also have worse job growth. Again, when we give you the averages, these are averages that more concentrated in the cities. And then when you go north into the tech markets, I think that you have two things that are happening. You have all those service jobs in Seattle and the Bay Area. But you also have, I would say, greater work from home flexibility that is that on the margin has allowed the areas that would generally be that are suburban in nature, most of San Jose and suburban has small downtown up peninsula through Mountain View, where Facebook is located and Google right in that area. Those areas have been greater \u2013 much greater impacted. And I think a lot of that is the work from home phenomena. So I think that the \u2013 so I think the recovery looks like a couple of things because there is nothing fundamentally wrong with any of these businesses. The Motion Picture business is still a high demand. The technology companies, as noted in the prepared remarks, a lot of venture capital money being invested, lots of investments being made by the big tech companies into locations and buildings. And so everything, I think in terms of the broader economy looks fine, we need those companies to come back to the office to some extent. We also need \u2013 there is always people that are retiring and again, selling their expensive California home going somewhere else and then backfilling comes from college graduates coming to take high-paying jobs. So I think that there is a mismatch there, I think that that are leaving the low-income can\u2019t afford to stay, they either have left or are \u2013 stay in put given. And then \u2013 but we haven\u2019t seen the backfill yet. And I think you\u2019re going to see the back starting in the next relatively soon, and I think that they will start to solidify it because we\u2019re 90-something percent occupied. It doesn\u2019t take that many jobs to sort of fill things up, tighten things up and then concession abating pretty quickly. So that\u2019s how we see it. Hopefully, that helps.\nRich Hill: That\u2019s helpful a lot. One final thing for me, it strikes a core to me when you say you have more information than us. I think that\u2019s very true. I would encourage you if there was anything that you could provide on population migration trends that you are seeing in your specific markets in the coming months. I think that would be really well received. But thanks, guys. I really appreciate, as always, the dialogue?\nMichael Schall: Sure. No, we\u2019re happy to give it. And yes, I could give you a little bit of migration information. And again, similar to prior recessions, where everyone focuses on the very short term, which is recessions happen about every 10 years, about every 10 years, I was 50, now I am 60. I make a different decision when I\u2019m 60 when I was 50 about where I live and how hard I want to work in various things. And so that\u2019s part of it. And so lots of people make changes in their life based on what they\u2019re doing and how close they are to retirement and a variety of other things. So I would say a lot of what you\u2019re seeing is just the first leg of what always happens about every 10 years and typically around a recessionary period. But in terms of inflow, outflows, it\u2019s a little bit different by market. We still \u2013 the migration into our markets is still dominated by New York and Boston and even some other California metros. So there is quite a few people moving from San Francisco to Los Angeles, for example, maybe for better weather or whatever. In LA, the outflow is really Las Vegas, Phoenix and other California cities. And in San Francisco, it\u2019s Seattle, Austin, Sacramento, and Seattle is Phoenix, Boise, Austin, in terms of outflow. And again, all three benefiting from highly scaled workers probably in a lot of the eastern metros and from some California cities. So hopefully, that helps. That\u2019s LinkedIn data and \u2013 but our experience is pretty consistent with that.\nRich Hill: Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Amanda Sweitzer with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nAmanda Sweitzer: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I want to dig in a little bit more on just the near-term demand you have seen kind of as you have had occupancy pickup, do you have a sense of where that demand is coming from? Are you taking share from other properties in the market or have you really seen renters move over in quality like you have last cycle?\nMichael Schall: Well, it\u2019s Angela, I think, put a happy face on it and I will let her comment in a minute, but it\u2019s a battle out there. So I wouldn\u2019t say we are taking anything from anyone. I\u2019d say we are all competing fiercely to \u2013 and we all have maybe a little bit different focus. And again, as we have said before, our focus is maintain high occupancy, protect the coupon rent, we will use concessions when we have to, try to be aware of what time of year it is and what that battle is going to look like and plan ahead. So I think we do a good job of that. But I don\u2019t think there is any winners in this current situation. So, we are trying to turn the battleship toward a better day, but it\u2019s not quite here yet. Obviously, apartments, we look ugly when it\u2019s getting better. We lag when your leases cause us to lag and the all-time high in terms of our achieved leases will hit in Q1 and Q2, which is why the year-over-year will look so ugly. And \u2013 but things are definitely slowly getting better and I think we will see that down the road, as Angela said, in the second half.\nAmanda Sweitzer: Okay, that makes sense. And then turning to the disposition you have lined up, can you just provide more color on kind of a profile of those assets either in terms of age or location and then as well as the buyer pool and if that buyer pool has changed at all from pre-COVID?\nAdam Berry: Sure, yes. This is Adam. Happy to answer. So for those three, they are situated throughout our portfolio. And so from \u2013 there is really no kind of a general overview of the type of asset they are. In all three cases, these were actually three exchange buyers. And \u2013 so to say there is one in the Bay Area, just to use as an example. It\u2019s in a heavily concessioned Bay Area market and the way we are underwriting it as you would imagine, it\u2019s kind of tough to peg cap rates given where current net effective rents are. So we are underwriting it based a couple of different ways. One is on kind of pre-COVID in-place rents. And then looking at current net effective today, on current net effective that deal, again this is a heavily concession Bay Area market. It\u2019s in the low 3s, so call it 3.2, something like that and on pre-COVID numbers that\u2019s about a 3.8 or so. And so that\u2019s the spread. That was underwritten in the fourth quarter. So concessions have has varied before that and sense, but that\u2019s the ballpark, and there still is \u2013 there is enough of a transaction market out there where market has been set \u2013 the buyers are a little different than \u2013 during your typical cycle, but there continue to be deals that they go down.\nAmanda Sweitzer: Appreciate all that detail. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with SMBC. Please proceed with your question.\nRich Anderson: Hey, thanks. Good morning and congrats everyone and congrats to John, too, if you are listening. On the topic of eviction moratorium, I am feeling like that could be a messy time when they start to expire, I wonder if you agree? I mean, some people just start paying again, but then perhaps a swath of people say, I got to leave now because they are making me pay. Is there a risk that you could see some volatility in occupancy when those things start to burn off and we kind of try to get back to some sort of normalcy?\nMichael Schall: Hey, Rich, it\u2019s Mike. And maybe Angela want to comment as well, but I think messy was a very good way to describe it because I think we are looking \u2013 we evaluate it very much the same way. Back in when AB3088, which again was supplemented by this SB-91, 3088 was passed in August and required residents to pay \u2013 COVID affected residents to pay at least 25% of their rent by January 31. And then SB-91 ruled that January 31 date to June. So, the 25% is getting larger and that \u2013 it definitely will add pressure to that whole situation. And I am definitely not smart enough to figure out how that\u2019s all going to play out. We are all hoping that this federal stimulus money, we have mostly a B type of portfolio. And so we don\u2019t have any quantification of it whatsoever, but that would certainly help a lot because that would potentially pay 80% of the unpaid rent and we would have to walk away from the 20%, but that\u2019s a whole lot better than what we\u2019ve assumed in terms of our delinquencies. So yes, I think we are recovered in terms of the normal to kind of probably slightly conservative case scenario. And maybe there is a little bit of upside here given SB-91. So that\u2019s how I had answered, but you are absolutely right, I don\u2019t know \u2013 I don\u2019t for sure know the answer to it.\nRich Anderson: Okay. And then you kind of talked about your portfolio sort of characterization B quality. I guess I am a little surprised that the portfolio didn\u2019t do a little bit better with the disruption going on in the urban core, you would think that your portfolio being largely once removed from those environments might have captured a bit more in terms of flow of residents. And it\u2019s easy for me to say, obviously, there is a lot going on in your markets, but perhaps maybe it\u2019s that very characteristic of your portfolio again sort of B quality, not necessarily downtown locations that gives you the feeling to say something like cautious optimism? I am wondering if that\u2019s a driving factor to some of the optimism that you are kind of trying to say today?\nMichael Schall: I mean, optimism is \u2013 I am not sure we are if optimistic is, yes, it looks like we\u2019ve hit bottom after get it being pummeled, then yes, I guess that\u2019s optimistic. But I wouldn\u2019t say that. I mean, I think that as I said in the opening script and the reason why I put it in there is, hey, this \u2013 we\u2019re still at a point where the nation has lost as many jobs as it lost in the financial crisis. And in the financial crisis, our average market rents were down 15%. Seattle was a little worse, about 20%, and Southern California did a little better. So I think we are kind of where we are, where we would expect to be given the extraordinary number of jobs lost. Now it\u2019s not the same as the financial crisis in that you\u2019ve lost these low end service jobs, and they\u2019re mostly in the city servicing at various levels, very wealthy clientele with lots of money. So it\u2019s different, but mostly the same. I would say I am not surprised about where rents have gone in general. And I hope for a robust recovery with vaccine distribution and all that stuff because it seems like a lot of this is really focused on COVID direct outcomes, losing service jobs just because of COVID because those service jobs just aren\u2019t there, they are shutdown by the government. So I think come back pretty quickly because I think people do want to go out to eat dinner and that type of stuff. And so I think it\u2019s going to come back and I hope soon obviously.\nRich Anderson: Okay. And just real quick on the delinquency, kind of just take a reserve against all of the $0.45 hit to this year, I mean, when you really look at that, what\u2019s your experience in terms of then actually not deserving the bad debt tag and they actually become collectible, is it 50% in past cycles or is it hard to say because this one is so different?\nBarb Pak: Yes, this is Barb. This cycle is very different than any other cycle. Even during the financial crisis, our delinquency was only 50 to 60 basis points of scheduled rent. So being at 2.7%, which is where we have been the last couple of quarters, is obviously a lot higher. I think in the fourth quarter, we did take \u2013 reserved against all of it, and that was really due to the environment. We were in a severe lockdown state for most of the quarter and into January, not really knowing when any of that was going to lift. We decided to take a pause. And we will reassess in Q1 and see where things are at as that goes. And then the $0.45 that I alluded to in my script, that\u2019s really compared to our historical run rate. So for the foreseeable future, we do expect delinquency to remain elevated. This eviction protection moratorium, SB-91 goes until June. And then we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen after that. So we have assumed that we don\u2019t make a lot of progress on the delinquency. It\u2019s not because we can\u2019t collect, it\u2019s a combination of both, people not paying and collections kind of are getting us to that mid-2% range of scheduled rent.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your questions.\nRich Hightower: Hey, good morning out there, guys. Just a quick one from me. We have covered a lot of ground. But just on this disconnect between reported same-store and FFO, given the cash concession accounting treatment versus GAAP with respect to revenue and FFO. So if we sort of assume the concessions, heavy concessions shut down on June 30, let\u2019s say, which I think is sort of implied in the outlook. Help us understand the cadence thereafter when you would sort of stop seeing that disconnect between the two series, just as we think about modeling that into 2022, it sounds like?\nBarb Pak: Yes. Well, I don\u2019t have 2022 guidance at this point. But in the back half of the year, we do expect concessions to moderate, not to abate completely but to moderate. And that\u2019s where you will see \u2013 it will benefit same-store revenue growth but the offset will be on core FFO growth given that we will have to amortize the straight line of concessions and so that will mute our core FFO growth relative to the same property growth that you will see. And we expect that to happen in the last two quarters of this year and then 2022 is not something I can give at this time.\nRich Hightower: Yes, right. Thanks, Barb. I guess that part of it for \u2013 while the concessions are still heaviest. But I mean, could you \u2013 is there a way to walk through the timing, assuming a 12-month lease or something like that, that would say, okay, by this point in 2022 you would see same-store and FFO converge or correlate more in the way they have historically, is there way to frame that out or is it just sort of reaching too far at this point?\nMichael Schall: Yes, Rich, this is Mike. Let me add something here. And Angela is in the middle of this, so she can comment too. But it\u2019s more like a battle everyday because we are constantly increasing or pulling back concessions, changing rent levels, trying to find the optimum for net effective rents. And so it\u2019s impossible to model that. And so I\u2019d say, trust us to do a good job of trying to figure that out. We have people that are spending very, I\u2019d say, senior people that are spending a lot of time in the trenches pricing units. Everyone is a little bit different, as you can imagine supply and demand changes on a daily basis. And we just can\u2019t tell you what\u2019s going to happen. We can\u2019t tell you \u2013 our guidance is based on something, but the reality is, we can\u2019t tell you that that exactly is going to happen. And the mix of concession and rent differential it could change. And this is \u2013 I have been here for a really long time, many of you probably say too long. But it\u2019s unlike any other period I\u2019ve seen. And as a result, it\u2019s very difficult to be too granular with respect to answering these questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Hey, good morning. Good morning out there. First, we\u2019ll continue to congrats. So Angela and Barb, as we sit here in New York, on your new roles, that\u2019s wonderful. But Mike, to the point of CEO succession planning, I mean, obviously, we saw Avalon Bay do it. You guys did it a number of years ago when Keith handed the reins over to you. It did seem from the outside that John was being groomed. Maybe that wasn\u2019t the case. But again, on the outside, that\u2019s what it looked like. So can you just talk a little bit about CEO succession? Does this impact anything, does it not? And just any other impact that may come of this or maybe this open up \u2013 this opens up spots in the senior ranks to allow you to groom more people to raise the more senior roles at Essex?\nMichael Schall: Yes, Alex, thanks for the question. It\u2019s a good one, really important. We take succession planning super seriously I\u2019m really pleased that I have 3 very, very capable executives around me. And I think as I look even beyond them, we have a pretty deep bench. And you are right I was somewhat surprised when John contacted me late third quarter, early fourth quarter about sort of a change of plans involving him. And I asked him to reconsider. And we all need to live our lives and make decisions. And so we decided on the course, and it probably took too long to come to agreement about what his role was going to be going forward. We ended up with the press release after Christmas, it could have been much earlier, just took time to finalize what that was going to look like. So apologize for the optics of it. Having said that, John is always in our minds and our hearts, and he\u2019s forever a part of the company. And certainly, we wish him well. He\u2019s done a tremendous amount of good the company. So as we think about succession planning, the basic philosophy is the doors to or the pass to the CEO job are always open. And the historical path has been mostly through finance. I came through finance and then ran ops and then up. And \u2013 but we want other paths to be open too, including maybe through operations or through investment. So wherever we see talented people, it\u2019s one of my primary jobs to keep those pads open and don\u2019t let them be blocked by people that are \u2013 that don\u2019t have interest in being CEO. That\u2019s kind of the key to the whole thing. And then backing off of that down looking at the people below and making sure that they have diverse experiences in moved around the organization. And in the case of Barb, Angela, John, all of them were of rive hats on their way to up the organization. So we expect to continue to do that. And I think that\u2019s the way it has to be in order to have a proper succession process.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then the second question is, one of the hallmarks of Essex has been investing when there is abnormalities in the market. And Mike, you mentioned something interesting that in the suburbs, the rent affordability index was at perhaps an all-time higher, definitely elevated, whereas the urban areas are below the average more affordable. However, you guys have sold out of the urban areas and been more suburban. So does this make you want to switch and now sell more suburban, get back into the urban or are there other dynamics at work where with this pricing affordability imbalance, you wouldn\u2019t do what maybe you would have historically done prior to the pandemic?\nMichael Schall: Maybe I\u2019ll have Adam comment on that, and then I\u2019ll fill in when he\u2019s done. Because he looks at the stuff in a lot of detail, and he \u2013 I give a lot of credit because he\u2019s out there transacting when no one else is. And some of the transactions he\u2019s done, we are so close to the pre-COVID period. And I think it\u2019s pretty exceptional to what we\u2019ve been able to accomplish. So Adam, do you want to comment on that?\nAdam Berry: Sure. Yes. And Alex, hopefully, this gist of what you\u2019re looking for. We are always \u2013 we are looking at all of our markets at all times. And so during this recent kind of recent \u2013 during COVID period, we\u2019ve been primarily sellers. And most of those we sold in the CBDs. And we\u2019ve done that for a variety of reasons, and that dates back to \u2013 we sold Eteno and downtown LA sold Masso in San Francisco prior to COVID. And those pricing on those deals was significantly above what our in-place NAV was at the time. And so we felt at the time the right decision to make from an arbitrage standpoint was sell those and reinvest in either our existing portfolio, buy back stock or in other assets in suburban locations, the really heavily impacted CBD locations, quality of life, especially, say, in downtown LA, in Soma, in San Francisco has been challenging and will likely continue to be challenging here for the foreseeable future. Many of the, what we consider, what we call suburbs are very densely populated suburbs, and that\u2019s where we see opportunity, and that\u2019s where we see much of the market coming back sooner rather than later. So like I said, we\u2019re constantly assessing where we are. And if there are opportunities in CBD, where we can buy at a good basis, and we see significant rent growth, we\u2019ll do that. But yes, I mean, like I said, we\u2019ve been net sellers here, and we\u2019ve sold \u2013 all the deals that we\u2019ve sold last year and then into this year have been within a 2% of our pre-COVID NAV, some above, some slightly below. So that\u2019s been the right philosophy and the right strategy and we\u2019ll assess as we go along. Mike?\nMichael Schall: I say it well. Alex, maybe I\u2019ll add one more thing, just real briefly. The walk score issue is pretty interesting to me because the areas with the best rent growth have the worst walk score. And then the CBDs and some of the places that have the best walk score have been hammered in terms of rent. So everyone needs to ask themselves a question, will walk score ever matter again? And my view is it will. And it will be nuanced, and it may not be the highest walk score gives you the best rents. But I just haven\u2019t believe having a nice location, low crime, pleasant surroundings, lots of entertainment and food options, etcetera, is going to continue to be important. And those are in sort of the high-quality suburbs that Adam just referred to.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Zach Silverberg with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.\nZach Silverberg: Hi, good morning out there. Just a quick one for me. Just a follow-up on an earlier one. In your supplemental and in your prepared remarks, you talked about the VC investments and job postings in Essex market. Maybe can you give a little historical context around that? Is there a specific correlation that you\u2019re looking for or bag time or how are you able to sort of quantify this momentum in terms of lease-up or lease rates?\nMichael Schall: Yes. This is Mike. I have the experience of living through the Dot-com bubble and then bust. And I would say that what I see relative to that is not even close. During the dot-com bubble period rent surged about 40% in 2 years. It set our all-time high in terms of rent to income level, so rents being at a very high percentage of income level. And contrast that to what I said earlier which is rents appear very affordable. San Francisco real rents down somewhere around 20%. Well, Northern California, in general, is about 7% below our long-term average of rent to income in terms of affordability. And if I compare \u2013 if I take a look at that number and compare it to the financial crisis, I think we got to about 90% of the long-term average. So in Northern California, we are at 93%. So starting to feel pretty affordable, again, these are areas that support high income, high jobs, high-paying jobs, etcetera, and the rent levels are now at a point where I doubt that the tech companies are going to at and all that much at the cost of living because affordability has changed pretty dramatically overnight. Now I can change back. It doesn\u2019t take that many new apartment units of demand to come in and take 96% occupancy to 97%, and then it\u2019s a whole different game. But that\u2019s the way that we look at it, we\u2019ve said the band between the rental income, the band between 90% and 110% is kind of the green zone that we do well in. And in the markets that have been hardest hit, we are closer to the 90% of the long-term historical average. And again, in Ventura, we are above the 110%. So it\u2019s \u2013 it will change the choices that renters make, I believe.\nZach Silverberg: Got it. I appreciate the color. I just have one quick follow-up on. In your guidance, you\u2019re not really guiding for any development. Can you maybe just comment there? Is there any future opportunity that you guys are looking at? Anything that right now, you guys just sort of haven\u2019t contemplated in the guidance, any color there?\nAdam Berry: Yes. Zach, this is Adam. We\u2019re constantly looking at different development opportunities. And we do get exposed to quite a few to work through our pref pipeline as well, and they kind of can both feed off of each other. We have a couple of deals right now where we\u2019re looking at fairly seriously in predevelopment stages where we\u2019re spending minimal pursue dollars. We actually did \u2013 we walked away from a predevelopment deal last year, but there continues to be some potential there as well. So we are looking for unique opportunities. The development yields right now are potential, generally speaking, but these two or three that we are looking at ones are really well located, high-quality of life, suburban location. One is really good job center TOD. And then the other one is also a very good job situation with some existing income. So looking at everything and one or two might fit the bill.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is come from the line of Neil Malkin with Capital One Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nNeil Malkin: Thank you. Good morning everyone. Two questions. One for Mike, one for Adam and also congratulations Angela and Barb as well. First, looking at the sort of recovery that you guys are sort of talking about and then starting in the second half. I guess I just want to kind of understand what you think that looks like in terms of the timeline to get back to like, I guess covered? I asked because you look at your main Essex markets, about 1.1 million jobs have been lost in 2020. And you\u2019re assuming like 3.4% or around 400,000 jobs. So a little under 3 years of that kind of growth will be needed to get back to a level commensurate with pre-COVID. So just based on those things, Mike, how do you guys see that sort of recovery? And I understand the comps in the second half of this year are going to be very easy. But after that, what do you guys kind of think about we are at again like pre-COVID type pricing?\nMichael Schall: Yes. That\u2019s a great question. Well, for example, based on the job losses in San Francisco, we should be a lot lower occupied than we really are. And so what happens during the recession is people move closer into the better areas. Plenty of people will say, hey, I would live in San Francisco, but the rents are too high. And so they live within the proximity around San Francisco and commute in. And then once this happens, they make a different choice, and they say, hey, with those rents, there is a backfilling approach. And so I would agree with you. What happens, the natural consequence of that is, and then obviously, there\u2019s another way beyond that and another way beyond that. And somewhere out there on the hinter lands and the very periphery with the Bay Area, you have areas that are not 95% occupied, that be 80% occupied because people make different choices based on pricing. And again, this has been one of the absolutes in my career and why we harp on this rent to income ratio is being so important. So the people \u2013 the number of people that moved out of San Francisco versus has been backfilled, but largely by people that have moved in from, let\u2019s say, Oakland or further out and want to live in the city. And then backfill process is ongoing. So here we are at 96%, having lost all those jobs that you just mentioned. And so the question is when those jobs come back, how does this how does this reverse itself? And some of these people will be happy to live in the city for a year and then maybe it will be priced out of the city and will be moved into one of these secondary markets. So you\u2019re absolutely right. But \u2013 and again, we price it \u2013 this is part of why we price things to keep occupancy high because if we keep occupancy high, we\u2019ll draw people out of the, let\u2019s say, the less desirable suburbs and you wait for demand to come back, and that is our way of maximizing revenue during the recessionary periods.\nNeil Malkin: I totally appreciate that strategy. I think it\u2019s the right one. I guess, I am just trying to get at \u2013 like totally \u2013 it\u2019s great that you have 96% above occupancy, but that doesn\u2019t \u2013 the market rents are still terrible. So yes, I guess, I mean like 2022, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m just saying, like you got \u2013 like 2023, are you back? I\u2019m just trying to kind of assess what that looks like for the portfolio. I don\u2019t know if I can\u2019t give that, that\u2019s hard I apologize it?\nMichael Schall: No, you are spot on. I mean, unfortunately, we won\u2019t be able to be all that specific about this. I would tell you that part of the reason why we do what we do is because concessions can abate pretty quickly. And I can\u2019t tell you how quickly, and I can\u2019t tell you how many jobs it\u2019s going to take in order for that to happen. But I can tell you that that is typically what happens that concessions as quickly as they can. They can go away just as quickly. We are going to have the overhang from the straight-line rent issue, which is a different factor, but our hope is that we get enough demand. Those tech companies continue to hire people bring \u2013 they decide to live somewhere close to the major urban centers or where most of the job locations are. And again, it just doesn\u2019t take that much. But how long will it take to get back to where we were? I mean it\u2019s a battleship, and it\u2019s going to take a year or two at least to get back there, is what I would guess. I mean, the trajectory, as you pointed out, we lost a whole lot of jobs in the nation, and we\u2019ve gotten some of them back, but we are still going to have a shortfall and we are delivering some apartment units. I\u2019d argue that the single-family component is so muted and a lot of markets have a lot more single-family as a percentage of total stock, housing stock than we do. And that is around \u2013 I think it was like 0.3% production level will help a lot. And so I think \u2013 I would guess that as the restaurants open up. We are going to see a surge of people coming back into the cities in these service jobs, and concessions are going to abate pretty quickly that\u2019s what I think would happen and we will be updating as quarters go by, but it\u2019s hard to tell exactly when this is all going to happen.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is come from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Thanks, guys. I appreciate you keeping this going. So \u2013 and also a lot of great detail in the release on jobs posting and some of the macro forecasts despite all of this uncertainty. Your response to a question on migration patterns that some people left aren\u2019t coming back certainly seems to be the case. But how are you contemplating or does your guidance account for the portion of residents that didn\u2019t lose their jobs or even students that temporarily left your market or campuses in these markets?\nMichael Schall: It really doesn\u2019t. I mean, we assume that there is sort of a tailwind, a demographic tailwind in that people live longer, and they retired about at the same time that they used to retire. So they have longer retirements. People live longer, consume houses without consuming jobs. And so there\u2019s sort of a presumption that, that is a demographic tailwind that\u2019s going to be with us as long as live longer. In terms of being more granular than that, we\u2019re really not. And we know those people are out there. There are lots of contract workers and I don\u2019t have that data. It was something that John used to focus on a lot. But a lot of contract workers that left amid COVID and connected with both the entertainment industry and the tech industry. How many of those come back remains a question too. So I view it as when uncertainty unfolds everyone kind of pulls in the companies become less aggressive at hiring. We saw that. We saw the drop-off of tech jobs by the top 10 employers there. And all the contract workers go home if there\u2019s a little bit of a bright spot here the Trump administration was pretty negative on H-1B visas. That will probably open up a bit, and immigration might open up a bit here, which I think will help somewhat. But we don\u2019t try to get more granular other than to look at the supply demand ratio really represented by drop in jobs, that\u2019s probably 80% of the total picture or something like that.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Okay. No, that\u2019s helpful. I appreciate the thoughts there. And then, Barb, I think you mentioned kind of concessions run high in the first half of the year, but was wondering if you could put a finer point on that. Do you expect the net effective pricing that you provided in the release this quarter? Do you expect the pricing you achieved in 4Q in early part of the year that, that reverses because we don\u2019t see the demand come back until maybe later in the year or does it kind of hold around current levels and then improve in the back half of the year?\nBarb Pak: Are you referring to S-16, the new and renewal when you talk about net effective pricing? Just want to...\nAustin Wurschmidt: Yes, correct. I think you were doing gross before and provided some net effective data this quarter.\nBarb Pak: I think Angela can talk about pricing, but yes, in the guidance, we do assume concessions remain relatively consistent with Q4 for the first half of the year. And then moderate in the second half of the year.\nAngela Kleiman: Yes and that\u2019s a good question, it\u2019s Angela here. On the pricing, I think the way we think of it is that Mike talked about market rents troughing kind of currently, fourth quarter or December, January. And I talked about scheduled rent troughing. And say by the end of second quarter because I was looking at year-over-year. And so there is a couple of different factors, which may be a little confusing. So as far as pricing is concerned, we currently do see \u2013 what we reported in January to hold. Keep in mind this is also toward the lower peaking season. So as we progress and if the economy continues to improve, and reopen, we \u2013 that\u2019s why we talked about second quarter \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, second half of the year being better. But it\u2019s hard to talk about it kind of month-to-month. I think right now, we\u2019re in good position because we had employed the strategy of higher occupancy and which allows us to reduce our concession. And so we\u2019re able to continue to do that and that\u2019s what we are targeting for our guidance for the year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Nick Ellico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.\nSumit Malhotra: Hi, guys. This is Sumit here in for Nick. And I apologize, I know we all asked the same questions differently, but I just want to sort of understand how you guys look at this problem. 2020 wasn\u2019t a normal year for leasing. The cadence actually changed. Most of your occupancy gains happened in Q3. And in Q3, I thought looking at the month-to-month stuff, July was the peak year sort of occupancy burst and then a little bit sort of 50%, 50% split in August, September. You also offered more concessions in the Labor Day kind of time frame. So I guess if everything \u2013 the concession side, vaccine aside, everything is sort of \u2013 if you look at it from a normal lease expiration schedule perspective, things are weighted towards the Q3. How does that sort of reset the more normal kind of cadence of turnover and leasing unless you invite in shorter leases or I\u2019m just inquisitive on that?\nAngela Kleiman: This is Angela here. I think you\u2019re asking about the cadence of our leasing season, and if that\u2019s the case, if that is your question, we would expect that cadence itself for 2021 to be somewhat similar to prior years. And so we would expect, depending on our markets, for the most part, they kind of they start peaking, say, around June and sale peaks later, say closer to July. And that\u2019s \u2013 during those times, we tend to have the least amount of concessions, but because our leases also more leases turned during that time, we may \u2013 we would probably end up with slightly lower occupancy just by the way the number work. So that kind of gives you the trajectory in terms of our business. But the reason we\u2019re talking about when things trough and the year-over-year comparables because that does impact what happens for the whole year and that behaves differently because of COVID last year. Because second half of 2020 \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, first half was 2020 was much better than second half. And so you kind of have that flip in terms of year-over-year growth for first half of 2021 will be much harder and second half will be easier.\nSumit Malhotra: Got it. Okay. Yes, yes. A little more clarity on the cadence is what was what I wanted to hear. So, thank you. And in terms of like when we look at your macroeconomic forecast, kudos to Mr. Paul Morgan and team. I guess, it appears that Northern California has the highest job growth at 3.4%, but the lowest rent growth at minus 3.6%. So there\u2019s a lag. I assume that the lag is related to the hyper concession activity we saw in 2021 and 2020. And so you\u2019re sort of building back from there. But I\u2019m also wondering whether you guys have any sort of factors or discounts for jobs that are created by companies domiciled in California, but have been offered the employees the flexibility to work from anywhere. So is that factor in into your kind of negative 1.9% rent growth forecast, effective rent forecast?\nMichael Schall: Let me comment on the minus 1.9. So what that represents is each month, year-over-year, what the market that effective rent differential is year-over-year. So again, if you look at January of this year, the prior year rents were going up, and obviously, we\u2019ve had a big decline in current rent. So you start with a large negative number in January year-over-year. And then as you go through the year, those lines are going to cross because we\u2019re going to end up with a lot easier comps in the second half of the year. And so it really is the trajectory of rents year-over-year. So, it\u2019s going to start with a big negative in January, and then it\u2019s going to go to a mid-single-digit positive by the end of the year and averaging all that out. So January over January, February over February, projected market rents. Average all that out to minus 1.9. So it\u2019s not intended to be because of concessions. It\u2019s really because we\u2019ve had \u2013 we start the year \u2013 again, the prior year rents were all-time highs. Rents have rolled down a lot. So we start in a hole for the first half of this year. And then we start hitting much easier comps as we get into July, August, September and then our year-over-year would be positive. When you average all that together, month by month, you get 1.9 \u2013 minus 1.9%. Does that make sense?\nSumit Malhotra: Yes, got it. And then as far as your job growth forecast as being a driver of that model, does that factor in any work-from-home flexibility versus, let\u2019s say, a model that you built in early 2020?\nMichael Schall: I didn\u2019t ask Paul that question specifically but he is a very thoughtful guy and he is well aware and very concerned as well about this work-from-home scenario. But again, our base case scenario is that people will have greater flexibility working from home. But again, as a CEO of a company, being able to have this team dynamic, what we\u2019re trying to accomplish. There are so many pieces of this organization that all have to act in unison. You\u2019ve got to know the people. And so that\u2019s what really makes us believe that this hybrid model where greater flexibility work-from-home, but people that are going to be in proximity, unlikely to be far, far away from the office because they\u2019re going to have to report from time to time, let\u2019s say, 2, 3 times a week. We think that, that is probably what\u2019s going to happen for a lot of workers. Again and I am excluding all the workers that have to sure, which I think was estimated at about 60%, including, for example, all of our property teams, anyone that works in a restaurant, etcetera. There was a lot of jobs. There\u2019s no work from home flexibility. There is no such thing. And I think that the \u2013 as you read a lot of these reports and news clippings on this subject, they kind of forget about those people. And so I think it\u2019s going to \u2013 again, we will have more work-from-home flexibility. And so baby, the city centers are a little bit less desirable. Even though that\u2019s where the great restaurants are going to continue to be, and that\u2019s where the tourism is going and all other things. So \u2013 but maybe the suburbs do a little bit better in that scenario.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is come from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your questions.\nJohn Pawlowski: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Angela, just a few questions for you on our Northern California portfolio, so I am just curious your thoughts on the quality of occupancy heading into spring and summer leasing when a lot of leases are that were given 1 to 2 months free comps and expire. Are you assuming occupancy meaningful occupancy slippage in the peak leasing season in Northern California?\nAngela Kleiman: That\u2019s a good question. At this point, not likely because the occupancy slippage that we\u2019ve seen last year had that were driven by, say, the consultant switched income or people who lost their job. They already lost their job. They are not going to re-lose their job. And so \u2013 and Northern California already is sitting at one of our lower occupancy levels and so I don\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t expect significant further deterioration from that. We have been able to occupancy there. And so that\u2019s a good sign. And so I expect that we will continue to do that.\nJohn Pawlowski: Yes. But 96.5% is well north of market occupancy. And so I mean there is a lot of private competitors that have an on-occupancy. So as it remains concessionary, I know a lot of the pain is out of the system, but is there any kind of reset in occupancy in your portfolio coming?\nAngela Kleiman: I don\u2019t see that. But keep in mind, the \u2013 some of the major pain points related to CBD, where you have a lot more supply. And we don\u2019t have as much in the CBDs. And so well, it\u2019s still going to be competitive out there. So I\u2019m not dismissing that. I just don\u2019t see further meaningful occupancy deterioration for our portfolio.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. And then on the rent side, could you share what you think gained the lease is right now in the Northern California portfolio if you include concessions?\nMichael Schall: You are making me cry, John.\nAngela Kleiman: Not a pretty number, I can tell you that. So in January we are \u2013 okay January or number, close to up, yes. So gain-to-lease for Northern California as a whole is about 8%. But I do want to also give a little context, right, because while loss lease is an important metric, during seasonally low or slow periods like in the first quarter or in the fourth quarter, and market rent has much higher volatility. So it negatively impacts this metric. It is not as meaningful well it\u2019s not something we would want to hang our hat on, which is whenever people ask us we always point them at average because it\u2019s not too hot, not too cold. So this number isn\u2019t great. But typically, during this time, December isn\u2019t great. Obviously, it\u2019s a larger magnitude. But there are a lot of volatility and smaller number of leases turned during this time. So that magnifies that volatility.\nMichael Schall: And let me add a little color, John. So overall, it\u2019s about 4.6% on the portfolio. And typically, there is a gain-to-lease almost every December, more like in the 2% range. So again, you\u2019re picking the worst part, bad boy for that. You\u2019re picking the first part of the portfolio. And so I wanted to give you that broader context so that it was taken with a little bit of a broader view of what that looks like.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is come from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman. Please proceed with your questions.\nAlex Kalmus: Hi, this is Alex Kalmus on for Dennis. We talked a lot about migration, but curious, you guys are now where the tenants that have come \u2013 where they\u2019re coming from, like their previous living situation. So are there a lot of apartment through apartment moves or have you also seen some pickup in potentially younger adults living with parents that came back to apartment situations?\nMichael Schall: That\u2019s a very good question. And I don\u2019t have the data I wish I had on that. We noted, I think, last quarter that the number of adults living at home was something like 100-year high, right? So there is obviously a lot of people out there that work from home flexibility, etcetera. And I\u2019m pretty sure that, that will uncouple itself in due course. So, most of us don\u2019t want to live with our parents forever. So \u2013 but I am sure that, that\u2019s a piece of it. I don\u2019t have the sense that the really hiring has picked up quite yet. But typically, what happens is the new year comes with new budgets and new business plans and things get going really after Super Bowl Sunday. And then we\u2019ll have a much better sense probably in a quarter about what\u2019s happening. And you see you hit one of the key ones, how many adults are living at home with their parents or recent college graduates, for example, that have work-from-home flexibility and can work-from-home, save some money that\u2019s one piece, but there are other pieces. The contract employees coming back, which are big time part of the part of the high-tech industry. H-1B visas people that work are forced to go home because of COVID and potentially can come back. So there are a number of possible pieces of demand that are out there that we can see coming back. I just don\u2019t have a way to monitor them or follow-on.\nAlex Kalmus: Got it. Thank you for the color. And just hitting on that last point, you mentioned on the H-1B visas. And forgive me if you talked about this earlier, given the overlapping calls today, but is the new administrations, potentially more integration friendly policy, do you see any benefit have you seen any benefits so far and are you expecting any job growth or movement from those change in policies?\nMichael Schall: Yes, I do. I mean, I\u2019d say the Trump administration was very tough on the foreign workers coming into the U.S. A lot of the technology jobs, and a lot of, obviously, the technology CEOs have indicated that they need to draw the best and brightest from around the world, and that it\u2019s good for America for that to happen. Some of the policies that the Trump administration followed were not giving work visas to the spouses of foreign workers and just in general not accommodating them making the renewal process more challenging. They also tried to make actually, the process more fair as well. But \u2013 so it\u2019s a negative. But I would expect the Biden administration I think I saw something recently. I don\u2019t have anything that I pulled for the call. But I think I said something recently that they will open up in addition to not building any more walls, etcetera, that they will open up the immigration process to foreign workers, which would mean a lot of workers went home because they\u2019re their spouse couldn\u2019t work or they didn\u2019t have another occupation. So it changed the dynamic of that program. So I do look forward \u2013 I do think that, that will be a positive, whether it\u2019s a material positive it remains to be seen.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is come from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.\nJohn Kim: Thank you. Is it your understanding that tech companies are going to follow Google\u2019s lead and not require employees to return until September I am just wondering what\u2019s your assumption in guidance as far as the timing of workers returning to office?\nMichael Schall: It\u2019s a good question. We don\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re not making any assumptions about that. And that remains one of the unknowns. All the COVID-related items, I guess, remain unknown. Again, our core belief is that most of these companies have announced that they do want their employees to come back to the office. They\u2019ve been a whole series of pushing back to office states, allowing workers being concerned about in the Google\u2019s case, be concerned about making sure that workers have enough flexibility to plan their lives and lease an apartment, for example, somewhere else that they wanted to. One of the big tech companies don\u2019t remember which one told, ask all of their employees to come back into the current country into the U.S. that was a good positive start and a step toward normalization. And \u2013 but again, there\u2019s no basic assumption that we\u2019ve made with respect to that. We\u2019re just assuming that with virus vaccine distribution that the world will become much more normal as we approach immunity. And as soon as that happens, both of these companies will come back to working at the office.\nJohn Kim: Okay. And Angela, in your prepared remarks about an hour ago, you mentioned the strength of the life science office market. I am just wondering if there is an opportunity to focus more in some of the biotech clusters that you operate in?\nAngela Kleiman: I think that\u2019s an Adam question on investments.\nAdam Berry: There are a few markets that we have targeted that on the development side and investment side that are heavily driven by life sciences and biotech. So absolutely, we see that as a continued driver to the economy and it continues to grow.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to management for any closing comments.\nMichael Schall: Thank you, operator and thanks everyone for joining the call today. We look forward to participating in the Citi Conference coming up in about a month and hopefully, we will meet with many of you there remotely. But I also hope that sometime in the not distant future, we can meet once again in person. Have a nice day. Again, thank you for joining the call.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Schall",
            "content": "Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. I am very pleased to acknowledge the promotions of Angela Kleiman and Barb Pak to their new roles at Essex and greatly appreciate their contributions for many years of dedicated service. Both Angela and Barb will follow me with prepared remarks; and Adam Berry, our Chief Investment Officer, is here for Q&A. At the end of last year, we announced John Burkart's retirement and we thank John for his tireless efforts and numerous contributions to the company's success over nearly three decades. As we reported last night, our fourth quarter and full-year 2020 results continue to be significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in lower same-property revenue and core FFO per share for both the quarter and the full-year. Similar to the last few quarters, pandemic-related regulations have had two primary consequences: first, shelter-in-place and related orders have resulted in unprecedented job losses; and second, anti-eviction and related laws prevent us from maximizing property performance. Government mandates are constantly changing and they intensified during the fourth quarter given surge in COVID-19 cases. Navigating the pandemic involves extraordinary efforts and I thank the Essex team for their tireless dedication amid these challenges. Overall, our fourth quarter results reflect stability and sequential net effective rents beginning in October and as discussed during our third quarter earnings call. Sequential revenues improved 30 basis points in the quarter, with market rents mostly flat in the cities and modestly positive in suburban locations. Therefore, we are cautiously optimistic that we have or will soon reach the bottom in market rent declines. As of December 2020, preliminary three-month trailing job losses in the Essex markets were 7.9% year-over-year, a 150 basis point improvement compared to minus 9.4% for September 2020 and outperforming the nation, which had a 100 basis point improvement from September to December. Even with the recovery of jobs in Q3 and Q4, the nation had 9.2 million fewer jobs year-over-year for the month of December, roughly equal to the number of jobs lost at the worst point of the financial crisis. Our data analytics team prepared S-17 to the supplemental, which is our base case scenario underlying our expectation that net effective rents will decline 1.9% in 2021. The range of potential outcomes is extraordinarily wide for 2021, given many unknowns that relate to the pandemic, including the pace of vaccine deployment and changes in regulation. Our modeling further assumes 4% GDP growth, which should lead to positive momentum in the second-half of 2021. Apartment supply will continue to be a challenge, especially in the downtown locations of Los Angeles and Seattle. Our data and analytics team expects approximately 34,000 apartment deliveries in 2021, a modest increase compared to last year. Also similar to 2020, we don't expect much for-sale housing production going forward. It's our experience that affordable for-sale housing competes directly with rentals, once rents rise to a level that approximates the monthly payment of an entry-level for-sale home, and there is little risk of that occurring in the Essex markets anytime soon. Page S-17.1 of the supplemental highlights 13 recent multibillion-dollar tech initial public offerings for companies headquartered in the Essex markets. Overall, 2020 was a great year for IPOs, with 147 tech sector offerings completed during the year. It's our view that the IPO market is essential to recharge the tech ecosystem, providing growth capital to early-stage investors and to generate liquidity for reinvestment. Page S-17.1 also illustrates the reacceleration in job openings for the top 10 tech companies, which has increased 38% since the August trough. Our analysis indicates that nearly 60% of the total job postings are located in California or Washington, with the next largest state, Texas, accounting for just 7%. The Page S-17.2 of the supplemental package demonstrates that venture capital investments continued on a record pace in 2020 with approximately $130 billion invested in the U.S. with the Essex markets continuing to receive the dominant share of VC investment. Success in the knowledge-based economy requires a critical mass of highly skilled workers, creating a network effect that draws companies to the Bay Area and Seattle. While only a limited number of venture-backed companies will go public, some will experience extraordinary growth similar to Snowflake, DoorDash, Airbnb and resulting in thousands of high-paying jobs. The environment today has many similarities to the previous recessionary periods, including the financial crisis and the bursting of the dot-com bubble. In both cases, migration out of California was often front page news. In 2020, we experienced higher out migration than normal, especially in our West Coast urban centers. In our experience, people make different housing choices during recessions and it's not surprising to see many in the large baby boomer cohort monetized the value of an expensive California home to move to less expensive areas as part of the retirement plan. This recession is unique with respect to the extraordinary loss of jobs that involve lower paid service workers, jobs that are concentrated in the city centers and effective employees often had only two choices: move immediately to find work or stay in their home shielded by eviction forbearance laws. As with previous recessions, we expect most of these trends to reverse. We expect that the demand for restaurants, services and travel will recover swiftly as vaccines are administered, bringing back related service jobs. Workers in the Essex markets earn more than in most parts of the country and the draw of higher-paying jobs, combined with lower recent rent levels makes rental housing down the West Coast, the most affordable it has been since 2013. Our recent McKinsey study estimates that only 22% of the American workforce can work from home without any productivity loss. We have been tracking many companies that have adopted work from home models during the pandemic, and we remain confident that the vast majority of companies will ask employees to return to the office when it is safe to do so, likely with increased work from home flexibility going forward. Google, Netflix and Apple are among the largest companies who have expressed their desire to return to the office, many others will follow. Turning to the regulatory environment, a third wave of COVID-19 cases beginning in November and related concerns about hospital availability led to the imposition of severe stay-at-home orders in all of our California markets. Some of these restrictions were eased last week, but all of the Essex markets remain in California's most restrictive category. Recently, with the passage of SB 91 last week, the state of California has extended COVID-19 related eviction protection from January 31 to June 30, 2021, including pushing back the requirement to pay at least 25% of pandemic-related rent. In addition, the law established a state rental assistance program to allocate $2.6 billion in Federal Stimulus Funds using income levels to prioritize payments and accepting related applications in March. As with similar laws, there are many related requirements and complexities, which we are evaluating. Turning to the apartment investment markets, during 2020, we sold 4 properties with a total of 670 apartment homes for $343 million, all of which were placed under contract subsequent to the implementation of shelter-in-place orders in March. Given the wide discount in valuation for public REITs compared to the private real estate markets, property sales remain our preferred source of funds for investment. Since the onset of the pandemic, a relatively small number of apartment sales support our belief that property values have not changed materially since the onset of the pandemic. However, extraordinary changes in rent increasing in the case of both suburban markets and decreasing sharply in some urban locations, makes it difficult to draw conclusions about cap rates. In the suburbs, where rents are generally at or above pre-pandemic levels, property values have modestly increased and cap rates are somewhat lower compared to the pre-pandemic period. Given lower rents and significant concessions in hard hit cities, recent price talk around possible sales indicate about a 5% reduction in value versus the pre-COVID period, resulting in cap rates for high-quality properties below 4%. As with previous recessions, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have continued to provide very attractive financing with 7-year fixed rate financing in the mid-2% range, potentially supporting lower cap rates. Vaccine distribution should remove uncertainty with respect to apartment operations and property values. As a result, we believe transaction volumes will begin to accelerate. As we have indicated before, improved cash flow from positive leverage in apartments has historically led to a robust transaction market. With that, I will turn the call over to Angela. Hi, Nick. Thanks for the question. It's a good one and this is Mike. We think that there will be more work from home flexibility, but at the same time, we think that employees will be tethered at some level to the office. As I think about the three other very capable people here today, knowing them and trusting them and all these things are a great team effort and teams are better when you really know the people and can trust the people. So I'd say that is key factor that I think. And as noted in the prepared remarks, we'll keep employees relatively close to their jobs. So having said that, I would think the winners in this scenario will ultimately be the high-quality cities that are near the jobs, but also offer maybe a little bit more affordable housing and good schools, low crime rates, et cetera. So I think that, that will play itself out. And I think those areas we have a lot of cities that are among the major metros that qualify for that. So \u2013 and some of them have been pretty hard hit. So I would \u2013 I guess I would add to that, some of the cities that are high-quality cities, their rents have been highly impacted by COVID. Certainly, when I think about Northern California and the tech markets, the Peninsula, San Mateo, even suburban parts of San Jose would be major beneficiaries of that because we view that technology is going to continue to be a very strong economic driver. And the tech ecosystem in the Bay Area is incredibly unique. And therefore, we think it will do well. Does that answer the question? Yes. As noted on the call that last week, the state of California using federal stimulus dollars started a program or announced a program of $2.6 billion, potentially of rent relief. And the way it would work is the landlord would be required to forgive 20%. And so the reimbursement from these programs could be 80%. That will be predicated on percentages of median income, average median income, so it will provide the greatest benefit to those that are lower income levels. And it's hard to tell exactly what that means. We just haven't had enough time to evaluate that program. So I'm guessing that we will have a pretty significant positive impact from it. But again, it's too early to evaluate. Thanks, Nick. Of course, Jeff, I think it's a good question, and it's, I think, probably maybe the most important question out there. So if we look at net effective rents, for the fourth quarter, sequentially, they were down under 1%. So net debt, that's all the markets. Now there is pretty significant variation between market to market. And part of that is even though we have high occupancy overall, there are parts of our portfolio that have lower occupancy. For example, San Francisco is still at 92.5%. Seattle Downtown is at about the same level. And so, there are areas that we are very highly occupied that are offsetting areas that don't have the same occupancy and actually below the average occupancy level. And most of that, as Angela alluded to, is related to the supply level. As you can imagine, if you've got negative job growth equivalent to right now, still as of December, equivalent to the worst part of the great financial crisis, it is not a great time to be delivering apartment units. And therefore, and the cities are getting the bulk of the supply delivery. So you have this confluence that Angela spoke about, which is negative demand growth and loss of supply and the cities are understandably hit from that. Offsetting that is, we do have markets that are doing very well. For example, Ventura, where rents are up almost 10% year-over-year on a market basis. And so we're doing pretty well in a lot of these suburbs. Now that leads to this issue that I talked about many times, which is rent-to-income. And it's interesting that Ventura with its \u2013 I think it's more like 8.5% \u2013 8.5% to 10% rent increase is now about 17% above its long-term historical average of this ratio of rent-to-income, which is incredibly important to us. Whereas in Northern California were 7% below the long-term average of rent-to-income. So everyone looks at this like, hey, the suburbs is going to do a lot better. But when rents go up a long ways, I would question that. And conversely, when the rents are essentially hammered in the cities, it changes the consumer's view of where the opportunity is. And so our view is long \u2013 a little bit longer-term that you are going to see a very significant movement back towards the areas where rents are - high-quality cities where rents are pretty affordable. Well, it's \u2013 there is a number of things. We have a whole \u2013 I kind of have a philosophy on guidance being an ex-CFO. And if I weren't here, I'm not sure that Barb and Angela wouldn't have come to a different decision to be perfectly candid. So \u2013 but yes, I mean, our preference is to always provide what we can and to be pretty open with the market. And then you all can disagree with us. But presumably, we have better information than you have, and therefore, it's up to us to sort of lead the way. So that's the philosophical position I took and it prevailed. Yes, this is Mike. And there is a lot to that question, so I will try to unpack it as best I can. Every recession is a little bit different. And normally, we view Southern California as our more typical of the U.S. average and therefore, it's less volatile. In this recession, it has been incredibly volatile in a certain sector and that is the Motion Picture sector. We didn't talk about it this time, we have on prior calls and it's effectively shutdown. And this is like the big wealth generator in Southern California. And so Southern California is probably the biggest surprise relative to prior recessions. For example, in the financial crisis, market rents went down in Southern California about 10% versus about 15% for the Essex portfolio in total. So this time, Southern California looks a lot like Northern California. And I think it's because of the two key parts of it, again, the filming and entertainment business plus all of these low jobs. When you look at the sectors of jobs that have been demolished, it's all the lower income segments of the job base, mainly it's hospitality and restaurants and other services those jobs are down. On the metros, somewhere in the 20% range, which means in the cities which are even higher concentrated, they are even more impacted. So as Angela said, you have got more supply coming into the cities. You also have worse job growth. Again, when we give you the averages, these are averages that more concentrated in the cities. And then when you go north into the tech markets, I think that you have two things that are happening. You have all those service jobs in Seattle and the Bay Area. But you also have, I would say, greater work from home flexibility that is that on the margin has allowed the areas that would generally be that are suburban in nature, most of San Jose and suburban has small downtown up peninsula through Mountain View, where Facebook is located and Google right in that area. Those areas have been greater \u2013 much greater impacted. And I think a lot of that is the work from home phenomena. So I think that the \u2013 so I think the recovery looks like a couple of things because there is nothing fundamentally wrong with any of these businesses. The Motion Picture business is still a high demand. The technology companies, as noted in the prepared remarks, a lot of venture capital money being invested, lots of investments being made by the big tech companies into locations and buildings. And so everything, I think in terms of the broader economy looks fine, we need those companies to come back to the office to some extent. We also need \u2013 there is always people that are retiring and again, selling their expensive California home going somewhere else and then backfilling comes from college graduates coming to take high-paying jobs. So I think that there is a mismatch there, I think that that are leaving the low-income can't afford to stay, they either have left or are \u2013 stay in put given. And then \u2013 but we haven't seen the backfill yet. And I think you're going to see the back starting in the next relatively soon, and I think that they will start to solidify it because we're 90-something percent occupied. It doesn't take that many jobs to sort of fill things up, tighten things up and then concession abating pretty quickly. So that's how we see it. Hopefully, that helps. Sure. No, we're happy to give it. And yes, I could give you a little bit of migration information. And again, similar to prior recessions, where everyone focuses on the very short term, which is recessions happen about every 10 years, about every 10 years, I was 50, now I am 60. I make a different decision when I'm 60 when I was 50 about where I live and how hard I want to work in various things. And so that's part of it. And so lots of people make changes in their life based on what they're doing and how close they are to retirement and a variety of other things. So I would say a lot of what you're seeing is just the first leg of what always happens about every 10 years and typically around a recessionary period. But in terms of inflow, outflows, it's a little bit different by market. We still \u2013 the migration into our markets is still dominated by New York and Boston and even some other California metros. So there is quite a few people moving from San Francisco to Los Angeles, for example, maybe for better weather or whatever. In LA, the outflow is really Las Vegas, Phoenix and other California cities. And in San Francisco, it's Seattle, Austin, Sacramento, and Seattle is Phoenix, Boise, Austin, in terms of outflow. And again, all three benefiting from highly scaled workers probably in a lot of the eastern metros and from some California cities. So hopefully, that helps. That's LinkedIn data and \u2013 but our experience is pretty consistent with that. Well, it's Angela, I think, put a happy face on it and I will let her comment in a minute, but it's a battle out there. So I wouldn't say we are taking anything from anyone. I'd say we are all competing fiercely to \u2013 and we all have maybe a little bit different focus. And again, as we have said before, our focus is maintain high occupancy, protect the coupon rent, we will use concessions when we have to, try to be aware of what time of year it is and what that battle is going to look like and plan ahead. So I think we do a good job of that. But I don't think there is any winners in this current situation. So, we are trying to turn the battleship toward a better day, but it's not quite here yet. Obviously, apartments, we look ugly when it's getting better. We lag when your leases cause us to lag and the all-time high in terms of our achieved leases will hit in Q1 and Q2, which is why the year-over-year will look so ugly. And \u2013 but things are definitely slowly getting better and I think we will see that down the road, as Angela said, in the second half. Hey, Rich, it's Mike. And maybe Angela want to comment as well, but I think messy was a very good way to describe it because I think we are looking \u2013 we evaluate it very much the same way. Back in when AB3088, which again was supplemented by this SB-91, 3088 was passed in August and required residents to pay \u2013 COVID affected residents to pay at least 25% of their rent by January 31. And then SB-91 ruled that January 31 date to June. So, the 25% is getting larger and that \u2013 it definitely will add pressure to that whole situation. And I am definitely not smart enough to figure out how that's all going to play out. We are all hoping that this federal stimulus money, we have mostly a B type of portfolio. And so we don't have any quantification of it whatsoever, but that would certainly help a lot because that would potentially pay 80% of the unpaid rent and we would have to walk away from the 20%, but that's a whole lot better than what we've assumed in terms of our delinquencies. So yes, I think we are recovered in terms of the normal to kind of probably slightly conservative case scenario. And maybe there is a little bit of upside here given SB-91. So that's how I had answered, but you are absolutely right, I don't know \u2013 I don't for sure know the answer to it. I mean, optimism is \u2013 I am not sure we are if optimistic is, yes, it looks like we've hit bottom after get it being pummeled, then yes, I guess that's optimistic. But I wouldn't say that. I mean, I think that as I said in the opening script and the reason why I put it in there is, hey, this \u2013 we're still at a point where the nation has lost as many jobs as it lost in the financial crisis. And in the financial crisis, our average market rents were down 15%. Seattle was a little worse, about 20%, and Southern California did a little better. So I think we are kind of where we are, where we would expect to be given the extraordinary number of jobs lost. Now it's not the same as the financial crisis in that you've lost these low end service jobs, and they're mostly in the city servicing at various levels, very wealthy clientele with lots of money. So it's different, but mostly the same. I would say I am not surprised about where rents have gone in general. And I hope for a robust recovery with vaccine distribution and all that stuff because it seems like a lot of this is really focused on COVID direct outcomes, losing service jobs just because of COVID because those service jobs just aren't there, they are shutdown by the government. So I think come back pretty quickly because I think people do want to go out to eat dinner and that type of stuff. And so I think it's going to come back and I hope soon obviously. Yes, Rich, this is Mike. Let me add something here. And Angela is in the middle of this, so she can comment too. But it's more like a battle everyday because we are constantly increasing or pulling back concessions, changing rent levels, trying to find the optimum for net effective rents. And so it's impossible to model that. And so I'd say, trust us to do a good job of trying to figure that out. We have people that are spending very, I'd say, senior people that are spending a lot of time in the trenches pricing units. Everyone is a little bit different, as you can imagine supply and demand changes on a daily basis. And we just can't tell you what's going to happen. We can't tell you \u2013 our guidance is based on something, but the reality is, we can't tell you that that exactly is going to happen. And the mix of concession and rent differential it could change. And this is \u2013 I have been here for a really long time, many of you probably say too long. But it's unlike any other period I've seen. And as a result, it's very difficult to be too granular with respect to answering these questions. Yes, Alex, thanks for the question. It's a good one, really important. We take succession planning super seriously I'm really pleased that I have 3 very, very capable executives around me. And I think as I look even beyond them, we have a pretty deep bench. And you are right I was somewhat surprised when John contacted me late third quarter, early fourth quarter about sort of a change of plans involving him. And I asked him to reconsider. And we all need to live our lives and make decisions. And so we decided on the course, and it probably took too long to come to agreement about what his role was going to be going forward. We ended up with the press release after Christmas, it could have been much earlier, just took time to finalize what that was going to look like. So apologize for the optics of it. Having said that, John is always in our minds and our hearts, and he's forever a part of the company. And certainly, we wish him well. He's done a tremendous amount of good the company. So as we think about succession planning, the basic philosophy is the doors to or the pass to the CEO job are always open. And the historical path has been mostly through finance. I came through finance and then ran ops and then up. And \u2013 but we want other paths to be open too, including maybe through operations or through investment. So wherever we see talented people, it's one of my primary jobs to keep those pads open and don't let them be blocked by people that are \u2013 that don't have interest in being CEO. That's kind of the key to the whole thing. And then backing off of that down looking at the people below and making sure that they have diverse experiences in moved around the organization. And in the case of Barb, Angela, John, all of them were of rive hats on their way to up the organization. So we expect to continue to do that. And I think that's the way it has to be in order to have a proper succession process. Maybe I'll have Adam comment on that, and then I'll fill in when he's done. Because he looks at the stuff in a lot of detail, and he \u2013 I give a lot of credit because he's out there transacting when no one else is. And some of the transactions he's done, we are so close to the pre-COVID period. And I think it's pretty exceptional to what we've been able to accomplish. So Adam, do you want to comment on that? I say it well. Alex, maybe I'll add one more thing, just real briefly. The walk score issue is pretty interesting to me because the areas with the best rent growth have the worst walk score. And then the CBDs and some of the places that have the best walk score have been hammered in terms of rent. So everyone needs to ask themselves a question, will walk score ever matter again? And my view is it will. And it will be nuanced, and it may not be the highest walk score gives you the best rents. But I just haven't believe having a nice location, low crime, pleasant surroundings, lots of entertainment and food options, etcetera, is going to continue to be important. And those are in sort of the high-quality suburbs that Adam just referred to. Yes. This is Mike. I have the experience of living through the Dot-com bubble and then bust. And I would say that what I see relative to that is not even close. During the dot-com bubble period rent surged about 40% in 2 years. It set our all-time high in terms of rent to income level, so rents being at a very high percentage of income level. And contrast that to what I said earlier which is rents appear very affordable. San Francisco real rents down somewhere around 20%. Well, Northern California, in general, is about 7% below our long-term average of rent to income in terms of affordability. And if I compare \u2013 if I take a look at that number and compare it to the financial crisis, I think we got to about 90% of the long-term average. So in Northern California, we are at 93%. So starting to feel pretty affordable, again, these are areas that support high income, high jobs, high-paying jobs, etcetera, and the rent levels are now at a point where I doubt that the tech companies are going to at and all that much at the cost of living because affordability has changed pretty dramatically overnight. Now I can change back. It doesn't take that many new apartment units of demand to come in and take 96% occupancy to 97%, and then it's a whole different game. But that's the way that we look at it, we've said the band between the rental income, the band between 90% and 110% is kind of the green zone that we do well in. And in the markets that have been hardest hit, we are closer to the 90% of the long-term historical average. And again, in Ventura, we are above the 110%. So it's \u2013 it will change the choices that renters make, I believe. Yes. That's a great question. Well, for example, based on the job losses in San Francisco, we should be a lot lower occupied than we really are. And so what happens during the recession is people move closer into the better areas. Plenty of people will say, hey, I would live in San Francisco, but the rents are too high. And so they live within the proximity around San Francisco and commute in. And then once this happens, they make a different choice, and they say, hey, with those rents, there is a backfilling approach. And so I would agree with you. What happens, the natural consequence of that is, and then obviously, there's another way beyond that and another way beyond that. And somewhere out there on the hinter lands and the very periphery with the Bay Area, you have areas that are not 95% occupied, that be 80% occupied because people make different choices based on pricing. And again, this has been one of the absolutes in my career and why we harp on this rent to income ratio is being so important. So the people \u2013 the number of people that moved out of San Francisco versus has been backfilled, but largely by people that have moved in from, let's say, Oakland or further out and want to live in the city. And then backfill process is ongoing. So here we are at 96%, having lost all those jobs that you just mentioned. And so the question is when those jobs come back, how does this how does this reverse itself? And some of these people will be happy to live in the city for a year and then maybe it will be priced out of the city and will be moved into one of these secondary markets. So you're absolutely right. But \u2013 and again, we price it \u2013 this is part of why we price things to keep occupancy high because if we keep occupancy high, we'll draw people out of the, let's say, the less desirable suburbs and you wait for demand to come back, and that is our way of maximizing revenue during the recessionary periods. No, you are spot on. I mean, unfortunately, we won't be able to be all that specific about this. I would tell you that part of the reason why we do what we do is because concessions can abate pretty quickly. And I can't tell you how quickly, and I can't tell you how many jobs it's going to take in order for that to happen. But I can tell you that that is typically what happens that concessions as quickly as they can. They can go away just as quickly. We are going to have the overhang from the straight-line rent issue, which is a different factor, but our hope is that we get enough demand. Those tech companies continue to hire people bring \u2013 they decide to live somewhere close to the major urban centers or where most of the job locations are. And again, it just doesn't take that much. But how long will it take to get back to where we were? I mean it's a battleship, and it's going to take a year or two at least to get back there, is what I would guess. I mean, the trajectory, as you pointed out, we lost a whole lot of jobs in the nation, and we've gotten some of them back, but we are still going to have a shortfall and we are delivering some apartment units. I'd argue that the single-family component is so muted and a lot of markets have a lot more single-family as a percentage of total stock, housing stock than we do. And that is around \u2013 I think it was like 0.3% production level will help a lot. And so I think \u2013 I would guess that as the restaurants open up. We are going to see a surge of people coming back into the cities in these service jobs, and concessions are going to abate pretty quickly that's what I think would happen and we will be updating as quarters go by, but it's hard to tell exactly when this is all going to happen. It really doesn't. I mean, we assume that there is sort of a tailwind, a demographic tailwind in that people live longer, and they retired about at the same time that they used to retire. So they have longer retirements. People live longer, consume houses without consuming jobs. And so there's sort of a presumption that, that is a demographic tailwind that's going to be with us as long as live longer. In terms of being more granular than that, we're really not. And we know those people are out there. There are lots of contract workers and I don't have that data. It was something that John used to focus on a lot. But a lot of contract workers that left amid COVID and connected with both the entertainment industry and the tech industry. How many of those come back remains a question too. So I view it as when uncertainty unfolds everyone kind of pulls in the companies become less aggressive at hiring. We saw that. We saw the drop-off of tech jobs by the top 10 employers there. And all the contract workers go home if there's a little bit of a bright spot here the Trump administration was pretty negative on H-1B visas. That will probably open up a bit, and immigration might open up a bit here, which I think will help somewhat. But we don't try to get more granular other than to look at the supply demand ratio really represented by drop in jobs, that's probably 80% of the total picture or something like that. Let me comment on the minus 1.9. So what that represents is each month, year-over-year, what the market that effective rent differential is year-over-year. So again, if you look at January of this year, the prior year rents were going up, and obviously, we've had a big decline in current rent. So you start with a large negative number in January year-over-year. And then as you go through the year, those lines are going to cross because we're going to end up with a lot easier comps in the second half of the year. And so it really is the trajectory of rents year-over-year. So, it's going to start with a big negative in January, and then it's going to go to a mid-single-digit positive by the end of the year and averaging all that out. So January over January, February over February, projected market rents. Average all that out to minus 1.9. So it's not intended to be because of concessions. It's really because we've had \u2013 we start the year \u2013 again, the prior year rents were all-time highs. Rents have rolled down a lot. So we start in a hole for the first half of this year. And then we start hitting much easier comps as we get into July, August, September and then our year-over-year would be positive. When you average all that together, month by month, you get 1.9 \u2013 minus 1.9%. Does that make sense? I didn't ask Paul that question specifically but he is a very thoughtful guy and he is well aware and very concerned as well about this work-from-home scenario. But again, our base case scenario is that people will have greater flexibility working from home. But again, as a CEO of a company, being able to have this team dynamic, what we're trying to accomplish. There are so many pieces of this organization that all have to act in unison. You've got to know the people. And so that's what really makes us believe that this hybrid model where greater flexibility work-from-home, but people that are going to be in proximity, unlikely to be far, far away from the office because they're going to have to report from time to time, let's say, 2, 3 times a week. We think that, that is probably what's going to happen for a lot of workers. Again and I am excluding all the workers that have to sure, which I think was estimated at about 60%, including, for example, all of our property teams, anyone that works in a restaurant, etcetera. There was a lot of jobs. There's no work from home flexibility. There is no such thing. And I think that the \u2013 as you read a lot of these reports and news clippings on this subject, they kind of forget about those people. And so I think it's going to \u2013 again, we will have more work-from-home flexibility. And so baby, the city centers are a little bit less desirable. Even though that's where the great restaurants are going to continue to be, and that's where the tourism is going and all other things. So \u2013 but maybe the suburbs do a little bit better in that scenario. You are making me cry, John. And let me add a little color, John. So overall, it's about 4.6% on the portfolio. And typically, there is a gain-to-lease almost every December, more like in the 2% range. So again, you're picking the worst part, bad boy for that. You're picking the first part of the portfolio. And so I wanted to give you that broader context so that it was taken with a little bit of a broader view of what that looks like. That's a very good question. And I don't have the data I wish I had on that. We noted, I think, last quarter that the number of adults living at home was something like 100-year high, right? So there is obviously a lot of people out there that work from home flexibility, etcetera. And I'm pretty sure that, that will uncouple itself in due course. So, most of us don't want to live with our parents forever. So \u2013 but I am sure that, that's a piece of it. I don't have the sense that the really hiring has picked up quite yet. But typically, what happens is the new year comes with new budgets and new business plans and things get going really after Super Bowl Sunday. And then we'll have a much better sense probably in a quarter about what's happening. And you see you hit one of the key ones, how many adults are living at home with their parents or recent college graduates, for example, that have work-from-home flexibility and can work-from-home, save some money that's one piece, but there are other pieces. The contract employees coming back, which are big time part of the part of the high-tech industry. H-1B visas people that work are forced to go home because of COVID and potentially can come back. So there are a number of possible pieces of demand that are out there that we can see coming back. I just don't have a way to monitor them or follow-on. Yes, I do. I mean, I'd say the Trump administration was very tough on the foreign workers coming into the U.S. A lot of the technology jobs, and a lot of, obviously, the technology CEOs have indicated that they need to draw the best and brightest from around the world, and that it's good for America for that to happen. Some of the policies that the Trump administration followed were not giving work visas to the spouses of foreign workers and just in general not accommodating them making the renewal process more challenging. They also tried to make actually, the process more fair as well. But \u2013 so it's a negative. But I would expect the Biden administration I think I saw something recently. I don't have anything that I pulled for the call. But I think I said something recently that they will open up in addition to not building any more walls, etcetera, that they will open up the immigration process to foreign workers, which would mean a lot of workers went home because they're their spouse couldn't work or they didn't have another occupation. So it changed the dynamic of that program. So I do look forward \u2013 I do think that, that will be a positive, whether it's a material positive it remains to be seen. It's a good question. We don't \u2013 we're not making any assumptions about that. And that remains one of the unknowns. All the COVID-related items, I guess, remain unknown. Again, our core belief is that most of these companies have announced that they do want their employees to come back to the office. They've been a whole series of pushing back to office states, allowing workers being concerned about in the Google's case, be concerned about making sure that workers have enough flexibility to plan their lives and lease an apartment, for example, somewhere else that they wanted to. One of the big tech companies don't remember which one told, ask all of their employees to come back into the current country into the U.S. that was a good positive start and a step toward normalization. And \u2013 but again, there's no basic assumption that we've made with respect to that. We're just assuming that with virus vaccine distribution that the world will become much more normal as we approach immunity. And as soon as that happens, both of these companies will come back to working at the office. Thank you, operator and thanks everyone for joining the call today. We look forward to participating in the Citi Conference coming up in about a month and hopefully, we will meet with many of you there remotely. But I also hope that sometime in the not distant future, we can meet once again in person. Have a nice day. Again, thank you for joining the call."

            "name": "Barb Pak",
            "content": "Thank you, Angela. I will start with a few comments on our fourth quarter results, followed by key assumptions in our 2021 guidance and finally, an update on our recent capital markets activities and the balance sheet. As expected, the fourth quarter was a challenging period with core FFO declining 12.5% compared to 1 year ago. This was primarily driven by an 8% decline in same property revenues as a result of higher concessions and delinquencies. As we noted last quarter, we report concessions on a cash basis in our same-property results because we believe this is more indicative of true market conditions. However, we are required by GAAP to treat concessions on a straight-line basis in calculating consolidated revenue and FFO. As Angela mentioned, during the fourth quarter, we provided $5 million fewer concessions than the third quarter, which helped improve same-property revenue sequentially. However, core FFO declined by 4% or $0.13 per share compared to the third quarter, of which, $0.16 is attributable to lower straight-line rent concessions. We expect this line item to continue to be a headwind to core FFO growth in 2021, which I will discuss in a minute. Please note on Page S-8 of the supplemental, we have detailed the quarterly impact of non-cash straight line rents. Turning to delinquencies, we continue to take a conservative approach to reserving against uncollected rents, especially given the surge in COVID-19 cases in the fourth quarter, which resulted in extended lockdowns in our markets throughout much of the quarter. As such, we reserved against the entire net delinquency balance during this quarter. Our receivable balance currently stands at approximately $7 million, including joint ventures at pro rata share. Based on past collections, we feel this receivable balance is consistent with our ongoing conservative approach. We will continue to assess our delinquency reserve and our net receivable balance each quarter based on collection history and market conditions. Turning to our 2021 guidance, key assumptions are available on Page 5 of the earnings release and S-14 of the supplemental. We have provided a wider than normal range for same-property revenues and core FFO given the significant uncertainties that remain surrounding COVID and the recovery ahead, including vaccine distribution and eviction moratoriums that are outside our control but could swing guidance in a variety of ways. That said, we felt it was important to outline our key assumptions based on information we have today. For the full year, we expect core FFO per diluted share to decline by 5.1% at the midpoint. The key drivers of the decrease are primarily related to the following 2 items. First, we expect same-property revenues and NOI to decline by 2.5% and 4.6%, respectively, at the midpoint. While current operating fundamentals remain steady in our markets as compared to several months ago, we will continue to feel the negative effects of the 2020 rent declines throughout most of 2021. In addition, due to the eviction moratoriums and regulations that remain outside our control, we expect delinquencies will remain elevated in 2021 and will be a drag to core FFO by an estimated $0.45 per share at the midpoint. The company has a long history of excellent rent collections, and we expect this temporary delinquency headwind to become a tailwind to FFO growth once the various COVID-related restrictions are lifted. Second, we also faced significant headwinds from straight-line concessions. We expect this non-cash item will result in $0.41 to $0.56 per share decline in core FFO, representing about a 4% reduction in growth on a year-over-year basis. As it relates to concessions, we expect they will remain high in the first half of the year before moderating in the second half of the year as the economic recovery takes hold. As such, we expect the impact from straight-line rent concessions to be minimal in the first half of the year, with most of the negative impact we forecasted to fall in the last 2 quarters of 2021. Lastly, on the capital markets activities and the balance sheet, during the fourth quarter, we closed $206 million of new preferred equity investments and bought back $46 million of common stock at a significant discount to NAV. These investments are being funded with 3 asset sales totaling approximately $275 million that are under contract and expected to close in the first quarter. This is consistent with our guiding principles of match funding investments on a leverage-neutral basis. For the year, we were able to arbitrage the difference between public and private market pricing by selling $343 million of assets at prices generally consistent with pre-COVID levels and buying back 269 million of stock at an average price of $225 per share, all while maintaining our balance sheet strength and creating value for our shareholders. Our balance sheet remains strong with minimal near-term funding needs and sound financial metrics. While our net debt-to-EBITDA has increased this year, this is primarily the result of the significant decline in EBITDA caused by the pandemic. As the economic recovery takes hold and the West Coast economies continue to reopen, we expect our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio will improve. With ample liquidity and a well covered dividend, our balance sheet remains a source of strength. With that, I will turn the call back to the operator for questions. Yes, this is Barb. This cycle is very different than any other cycle. Even during the financial crisis, our delinquency was only 50 to 60 basis points of scheduled rent. So being at 2.7%, which is where we have been the last couple of quarters, is obviously a lot higher. I think in the fourth quarter, we did take \u2013 reserved against all of it, and that was really due to the environment. We were in a severe lockdown state for most of the quarter and into January, not really knowing when any of that was going to lift. We decided to take a pause. And we will reassess in Q1 and see where things are at as that goes. And then the $0.45 that I alluded to in my script, that's really compared to our historical run rate. So for the foreseeable future, we do expect delinquency to remain elevated. This eviction protection moratorium, SB-91 goes until June. And then we don't know what's going to happen after that. So we have assumed that we don't make a lot of progress on the delinquency. It's not because we can't collect, it's a combination of both, people not paying and collections kind of are getting us to that mid-2% range of scheduled rent. Yes. Well, I don't have 2022 guidance at this point. But in the back half of the year, we do expect concessions to moderate, not to abate completely but to moderate. And that's where you will see \u2013 it will benefit same-store revenue growth but the offset will be on core FFO growth given that we will have to amortize the straight line of concessions and so that will mute our core FFO growth relative to the same property growth that you will see. And we expect that to happen in the last two quarters of this year and then 2022 is not something I can give at this time. Are you referring to S-16, the new and renewal when you talk about net effective pricing? Just want to... I think Angela can talk about pricing, but yes, in the guidance, we do assume concessions remain relatively consistent with Q4 for the first half of the year. And then moderate in the second half of the year."

            "name": "Angela Kleiman",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. First, I would like to express my appreciation to the Essex operations team for their diligent efforts to serve our customers amidst a challenging environment caused by the COVID pandemic. Thank you for all your hard work. As for my comments, I will begin by discussing our 2020 results, followed by our outlook for 2021. The overall, our market performed as we expected, despite the headwinds of new cohort related closures and seasonal decline in demand. Currently, the urban core particularly in tech-centric markets continued to remain more impacted by COVID-19 related job losses and office disclosures. In addition, the change in quality of life, resulting from the closures of restaurants and public amenities has driven a temporary shift in consumer preferences. High-rise buildings or communities located in the area with high walk scores have been the most impacted by this shift in demand. Conversely, communities with private outdoor space or more affordable residences outside the urban core continue to experience greater demand, which benefited many of our properties in Ventura, San Diego, Orange County and the East Bay in Northern California. This temporary shift in demand continued in the fourth quarter, where we experienced a 7.6% and 9.9% year-over-year increase in quarterly turnover in CBD, Seattle and San Francisco compared to the portfolio average turnover of only 1.3%. Furthermore, our CBD locations also had a greater concentration of apartment supply deliveries typically accompanied by very high concession levels. During the fourth quarter, we continued our leasing strategy of leveraging concessions on stabilized communities and building occupancy. There have been encouraging indicators from a sequential perspective in that more than half of our same-property portfolio grew revenues sequentially, driven in part by increases in occupancy and decreases in concessions. We have provided year-over-year net effect rent changes for our portfolio on Page S-16 of our supplemental. New lease rates were down 8.9% in the fourth quarter, stable in January, an improvement from the negative 12.2% achieved in the third quarter. Concessions on same-property approval improved from approximately $18 million in the third quarter to $13 million in the fourth quarter. This reduction in concessions is noteworthy, considering the fourth quarter has seasonally lower demand and historically, concessions increased during this period rather than decrease. Key highlights of the same-property performance of our major markets in the fourth quarter are as follows: in Seattle, 4.9% year-over-year revenue decline was primarily driven by Seattle CBD, which declined by 13%, while the remaining submarkets averaged a 3.2% decline, year-over-year job growth in Seattle declined by 7.3% in the fourth quarter. In Northern California, the 10.4% year-over-year revenue decline was led by CBD, San Francisco and Oakland, averaging an 18% decline, contrasted with a 4.2% decline in Contra Costa County, while Santa Clara County performed in line with the regional average of a 10% decline. Year-over-year job growth in Northern California declined by 8% with San Jose far better at a 6.4% decline. In Southern California, the 7.2% year-over-year decline was primarily driven by LACBD and West L.A. submarkets, averaging a 17% decline, offset by an average decline of 2.4% in our suburban markets of Ventura, Orange County and San Diego. Fourth quarter year-over-year job growth in Southern California declined by 8%. Moving on to our 2021 outlook, as indicated on S-17 of the supplemental, multifamily supply as a percentage of stock remained low at 0.9% for our portfolio. While we expect a percentage of the year-over-year growth to remain flat, new completions will once again be concentrated in the CBDs and urban submarkets where supply is projected to increase by 2.1% compared to just 0.7% across the rest of the portfolio. The confluence of minimal supply and extraordinary job losses remain a significant headwind in our urban markets. In Seattle, we expect multifamily supply as a percentage of stock to increase in 2021 by 1.6%, driven by 2.9% in the CBD, offset by a 1% increase in the suburbs, where we have the majority of our units. We have also seen positive office activities by major tech companies as they continue to push forward on expansion projects. In Seattle, Amazon received approval for a 1.1 million square foot project in Bellevue, Microsoft has continued with their campus expansion, and in , Google acquired a 10-acre site for a large campus. In Northern California, we project overall multifamily supply as a percentage of stock in 2021 to decrease by 10 basis points, although Oakland and San Jose CBD are expected to increase by 1.8% and 3%, respectively. Despite the impact of COVID, tech expansion plans have continued in the area. Amazon purchased a 6-acre site near downtown San Francisco. Facebook last month submitted an updated plan for its 1.25 million square foot campus expansion in Menlo Park, and Google continued to work with the city of San Jose for its major new campus at Diridon Station. In addition, the biotech sector continued to be a strong source of office demand highlighted by the recently approved expansion of Genentech's headquarter in South San Francisco, which would add up to 4.3 million square foot of new office space. In Southern California, we project overall multifamily supply as a percentage of stock to remain flat. The most notable increase is 4% LA CBD and deliveries in West LA will remain elevated once again this year. While many uncertainties remain as to legislation and the timing of the vaccine, based on current market conditions, we assume our scheduled rent for the same-property portfolio will trough in the second quarter this year. Because leases are typically 1 year in duration, our year-over-year revenue growth will be negative in the first half and positive in the second half, leading to our same-store full year guidance of 2.5% revenue decline at the midpoint. Lastly, our current same-store physical occupancy is 96.4%. Our availability 30 days out is 4.7%. Thank you. And I will now turn the call to Barb Pak. Yes, hey, it's Angela here. That's a good question, and it's certainly something we actively debate internally with the tactical strategy, right? Well, I don't think I want to go through our playbook in detail. I would just say that we focus on maximizing revenue, and we do so by optimizing occupancy whenever possible, and we meet the market. And so given where we are, you're right on point that we did in the third quarter focused on occupancy, which allowed us the fourth quarter to pull back on concessions as we see the market stabilize. And so as we continue to see the how the market performs, we will continue to use that strategy. And the goal at this point is really to try to pull back on concessions whenever possible. And of course, keep in mind, that's subject to, of course, the supply, which I mentioned in the CBDs will continue to be pretty heavy and assuming a recovery in the back half of the year. So, all those come into play. Yes and that's a good question, it's Angela here. On the pricing, I think the way we think of it is that Mike talked about market rents troughing kind of currently, fourth quarter or December, January. And I talked about scheduled rent troughing. And say by the end of second quarter because I was looking at year-over-year. And so there is a couple of different factors, which may be a little confusing. So as far as pricing is concerned, we currently do see \u2013 what we reported in January to hold. Keep in mind this is also toward the lower peaking season. So as we progress and if the economy continues to improve, and reopen, we \u2013 that's why we talked about second quarter \u2013 I'm sorry, second half of the year being better. But it's hard to talk about it kind of month-to-month. I think right now, we're in good position because we had employed the strategy of higher occupancy and which allows us to reduce our concession. And so we're able to continue to do that and that's what we are targeting for our guidance for the year. This is Angela here. I think you're asking about the cadence of our leasing season, and if that's the case, if that is your question, we would expect that cadence itself for 2021 to be somewhat similar to prior years. And so we would expect, depending on our markets, for the most part, they kind of they start peaking, say, around June and sale peaks later, say closer to July. And that's \u2013 during those times, we tend to have the least amount of concessions, but because our leases also more leases turned during that time, we may \u2013 we would probably end up with slightly lower occupancy just by the way the number work. So that kind of gives you the trajectory in terms of our business. But the reason we're talking about when things trough and the year-over-year comparables because that does impact what happens for the whole year and that behaves differently because of COVID last year. Because second half of 2020 \u2013 I'm sorry, first half was 2020 was much better than second half. And so you kind of have that flip in terms of year-over-year growth for first half of 2021 will be much harder and second half will be easier. That's a good question. At this point, not likely because the occupancy slippage that we've seen last year had that were driven by, say, the consultant switched income or people who lost their job. They already lost their job. They are not going to re-lose their job. And so \u2013 and Northern California already is sitting at one of our lower occupancy levels and so I don't \u2013 we don't expect significant further deterioration from that. We have been able to occupancy there. And so that's a good sign. And so I expect that we will continue to do that. I don't see that. But keep in mind, the \u2013 some of the major pain points related to CBD, where you have a lot more supply. And we don't have as much in the CBDs. And so well, it's still going to be competitive out there. So I'm not dismissing that. I just don't see further meaningful occupancy deterioration for our portfolio. Not a pretty number, I can tell you that. So in January we are \u2013 okay January or number, close to up, yes. So gain-to-lease for Northern California as a whole is about 8%. But I do want to also give a little context, right, because while loss lease is an important metric, during seasonally low or slow periods like in the first quarter or in the fourth quarter, and market rent has much higher volatility. So it negatively impacts this metric. It is not as meaningful well it's not something we would want to hang our hat on, which is whenever people ask us we always point them at average because it's not too hot, not too cold. So this number isn't great. But typically, during this time, December isn't great. Obviously, it's a larger magnitude. But there are a lot of volatility and smaller number of leases turned during this time. So that magnifies that volatility. I think that's an Adam question on investments."

            "name": "Adam Berry",
            "content": "Sure, yes. This is Adam. Happy to answer. So for those three, they are situated throughout our portfolio. And so from \u2013 there is really no kind of a general overview of the type of asset they are. In all three cases, these were actually three exchange buyers. And \u2013 so to say there is one in the Bay Area, just to use as an example. It's in a heavily concessioned Bay Area market and the way we are underwriting it as you would imagine, it's kind of tough to peg cap rates given where current net effective rents are. So we are underwriting it based a couple of different ways. One is on kind of pre-COVID in-place rents. And then looking at current net effective today, on current net effective that deal, again this is a heavily concession Bay Area market. It's in the low 3s, so call it 3.2, something like that and on pre-COVID numbers that's about a 3.8 or so. And so that's the spread. That was underwritten in the fourth quarter. So concessions have has varied before that and sense, but that's the ballpark, and there still is \u2013 there is enough of a transaction market out there where market has been set \u2013 the buyers are a little different than \u2013 during your typical cycle, but there continue to be deals that they go down. Sure. Yes. And Alex, hopefully, this gist of what you're looking for. We are always \u2013 we are looking at all of our markets at all times. And so during this recent kind of recent \u2013 during COVID period, we've been primarily sellers. And most of those we sold in the CBDs. And we've done that for a variety of reasons, and that dates back to \u2013 we sold Eteno and downtown LA sold Masso in San Francisco prior to COVID. And those pricing on those deals was significantly above what our in-place NAV was at the time. And so we felt at the time the right decision to make from an arbitrage standpoint was sell those and reinvest in either our existing portfolio, buy back stock or in other assets in suburban locations, the really heavily impacted CBD locations, quality of life, especially, say, in downtown LA, in Soma, in San Francisco has been challenging and will likely continue to be challenging here for the foreseeable future. Many of the, what we consider, what we call suburbs are very densely populated suburbs, and that's where we see opportunity, and that's where we see much of the market coming back sooner rather than later. So like I said, we're constantly assessing where we are. And if there are opportunities in CBD, where we can buy at a good basis, and we see significant rent growth, we'll do that. But yes, I mean, like I said, we've been net sellers here, and we've sold \u2013 all the deals that we've sold last year and then into this year have been within a 2% of our pre-COVID NAV, some above, some slightly below. So that's been the right philosophy and the right strategy and we'll assess as we go along. Mike? Yes. Zach, this is Adam. We're constantly looking at different development opportunities. And we do get exposed to quite a few to work through our pref pipeline as well, and they kind of can both feed off of each other. We have a couple of deals right now where we're looking at fairly seriously in predevelopment stages where we're spending minimal pursue dollars. We actually did \u2013 we walked away from a predevelopment deal last year, but there continues to be some potential there as well. So we are looking for unique opportunities. The development yields right now are potential, generally speaking, but these two or three that we are looking at ones are really well located, high-quality of life, suburban location. One is really good job center TOD. And then the other one is also a very good job situation with some existing income. So looking at everything and one or two might fit the bill. There are a few markets that we have targeted that on the development side and investment side that are heavily driven by life sciences and biotech. So absolutely, we see that as a continued driver to the economy and it continues to grow."

        "content": "Operator: Good day and welcome to the Essex Property Trust Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Statements made on this call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the Company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the Company's filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you. Mr. Schall, you may begin.\nMichael Schall: Thank you for joining the call today. Once again, we would like to offer our best wishes to all of those impacted by COVID-19. On today's call, John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments and Adam Berry is here for Q&A. Our results continued to be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including extraordinary local and state government responses. Our reported results for Q3 reflect these unprecedented challenges, resulting in a 6% decline in core FFO and 6.7% lower same property revenues. Despite a variety of challenges, we were mostly successful in our goal of maintaining occupancy and rental rates to the extent possible, which John Burkart will discuss in a moment. Our first priority continues to be the safety of our employees and residents while deploying technology throughout our portfolio, given a strong consumer preference for touchless interaction. Regulatory hurdles have been pervasive across our markets, creating a new level of complexity and administration for our property teams. As can be seen on Page F16 of our supplemental package, California has developed a four-tier system applied to each county for determining the severity of COVID-19 restrictions. Fortunately, recent changes have been mostly moving Essex markets into less restrictive tiers. San Francisco recently reached the least restrictive yellow tier for allowing offices and indoor dining to reopen, among other improvements. Similar positive changes have occurred across several of our markets in recent weeks which represent welcome news for local businesses and residents. We have previously noted that the apartment business closely follows local housing supply and demand trends and seasonal patterns. Given the pandemic, these normal seasonal patterns were disrupted by massive job losses resulting from the pandemic and related shelter-in-place orders. In April, year-over-year, job losses were 13.7%, followed by a solid job growth in May and June. Job gains then moderated again this summer as shelter-in-place orders were extended upon a surge of COVID-19 cases. By September, job losses in Essex markets were still down 8.7% year-over-year, a positive trend from April but still lagging the 6.4% national average job loss. For perspective in the financial crisis, peak to trough U.S. job losses were 9.1 million over 20 months. This year, the nation lost 20.8 million jobs in just two months. We attribute the greater job loss and slower economic recovery in California and Washington to very restrictive shelter-in-place mandates. We see the recovery path ahead as reversing the job losses in the cities and industries that suffered the greatest impact from the shutdown. Tourism, travel, leisure and hospitality sectors were among the hardest hit and they are concentrated in the urban core of various cities. The restaurant industry provides a good example. Using the open table data as of last week, the number of dining reservations in Los Angeles fell by 66% compared to one year ago, while Seattle and San Francisco both declined 78%. This compares to other large cities like Miami, Denver, Dallas and Atlanta, with only 30% to 40% declines. Similarly, employment in hotels, live entertainment, and local transportation activities are down 37% to 50%. And they should have a strong recovery as cities reopen. In Southern California, the TV and film industry is a significant wealth creator and it was decimated by COVID restrictions. In the third quarter, the number of shoot days began to recover from near shut down but remained down 54% year-over-year. The industry is now trending in the right direction and production permits has steadily increased since June, suggesting employment will continue to rise. Younger workers have faced many challenges in the pandemic, including greater job loss and higher unemployment rates compared to more experienced workers. Employers often delayed hiring and reduce the number of job openings during the pandemic as offices and small businesses closed from shelter-in-place orders. Many college graduates chose to move home rather than relocate in proximity to their new employer as a result of work from home flexibility. As a result of these conditions, the share of 18 to 29-year olds living with a parent increased to 52% this summer, up 500 basis points year-over-year and the highest level in over 100 years. The combination of lower immigration from new graduates and higher out migration from young singles has played out in different ways across our market. We have seen pockets of strength in Ventura, Orange County, San Diego, and outer suburban markets in Seattle in Northern California. By contrast, our urban and tech centric sub markets are deeply discounted to attract residents. Meanwhile, tech companies are speaking with their pocketbooks, companies, including Google, Facebook and Amazon continue to expand their real estate footprint in our markets. Notably, Facebook's expanded campus in Menlo Park, and their acquisition of our REI new headquarters in Bellevue, Google's continued plans for urban village in San Jose, and Amazon's continued growth in Bellevue and other sub markets in the Seattle area. As always, we continue to monitor the pace of job openings amongst the top 10 tech employers in our market. And while these numbers are down year-over-year, we are encouraged by recent increases in openings from 9 of the 10 companies in our survey. While today's 17,000 openings are significantly lower compared to the pre-COVID period, today's level is consistent with the pace of hiring they experienced in 2016 and 2017. It appears that the most successful tech companies in the world remain committed to our markets, and most of them have announced work - return to office plans in 2021. Turning to our initial thoughts about 2021, we plan to provide annual guidance as part of our fourth quarter earnings report. There are many moving parts to the guidance discussion, including the impact of the winter's Coronavirus trajectory, the timing of vaccines and improved therapeutics and any new government stimulus measures. With that said, we base our modeling on the consensus of third-party economists for next year's GDP growth, which is currently around 3.7% and compares to this year's minus 3.6%. If that proves accurate, we would expect to benefit from positive tailwind in the form of steady employment growth and rising consumer confidence. In addition to the boost from an improving job outlook, the potential for a COVID vaccine to become widely available next year is an obvious positive that would reduce the need for social distancing and shift the work from home dynamic from a requirement to a lifestyle decision to come to several negative such as potential pay reductions for remote workers, lack of face-to-face collaboration and networking, and potentially fewer career advancement opportunities. Finally, with respect to our year-over-year growth trajectory next year, we would expect to hit an inflection point, during the second quarter as we anniversary the steep COVID related declines. This could set the stage for gradual improvement in rental growth in the back half of 2021. Again, assuming further easing of COVID related restrictions. Our data and analytics team completes its own fundamental research on supply, indicating around 33,000 apartments supply deliveries in 2021, which is similar to 2020. While that continues to represent just below 1% of our apartment stock is still too much supply until the pace of job growth accelerates further. As with the past several years, the 2021 apartment supply estimates from third-party research providers are well in excess of our expectations, implying a ramp up of deliveries that we do not believe is feasible, given skilled labor constraints within the construction industry in our markets. Turning to the apartment investment markets, we have now sold four apartment properties with a total of 670 apartment homes for $343 million, all of which were placed under contracts subsequent to the implementation of shelter in place orders in March. Given the wide discount and valuation for public rates compared to the private real estate markets, we continue to market additional properties with the goal of funding at a minimum all of our investment needs through dispositions. Other than the AIMCO sales that were part of its announced reorganization, very few sizable apartment transactions occurred during the quarter. Generally, the number of properties being marketed has been extremely limited since March and is now slowly increasing. Therefore it remains too soon to draw conclusions about cap rates going forward. In the suburbs where rents have remained relatively stable since the start of the pandemic, cap rates and property value should not change materially compared to the pre-pandemic period. In those suburban areas, we expect high quality properties to sale in the low-to-mid 4% range in terms of cap rates. Given significant concessions in hard hit cities, recent price talk around possible sales indicate a 5% to 10% discount to pre COVID valuations, with a few sales that we've seen in these markets assuming a fairly rapid rent recovery. As with previous recessions, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have continued to provide very attractive financing with 7-year fixed rate financing in the mid-2% range. Significant positive leverage and active sources of debt significantly limits the amount of distress of the markets. Finally, I'll end with a brief comment related to California Prop 21. Including the extraordinary opposition effort coordinated by the Californian's Responsible Housing Group, I would like to commend the leadership of this group including RM, John Eudy for their unrelenting focus its steadfast effort in opposing this flawed proposal. Prop 21 would surely make housing shortages worse in California. The No on 21 Campaign has assembled an amazing constituency consisting of hundreds of organizations, including Veterans Groups, Affordable Housing Advocates, the California NAACP, the State Chamber of Commerce, and scores of others along with Governor Newsom. Almost every newspaper in California supports defeating Prop 21. We all greatly appreciate your effort. And now, I'll turn the call over to John Burkart.\nJohn Burkart: Thank you, Mike. I want to start by thanking the E team. Throughout this period of extreme volatility and complex regulations, they acted thoughtfully and tirelessly to serve our customers. We were successful in our objectives of building occupancy during the third quarter by using various pricing strategies, including concessions along with leveraging our technological advantage. We've significantly improved our response times in the overall customer experience. Our strategy of using upfront concessions when appropriate reduces the impact of the market dislocation on the rent roll. As noted in the table on the bottom of page 2 of our supplemental, our scheduled rents for Q3 2020 is down only 40 basis points from the prior year's quarter. This positions us favorably for revenue growth as concessions continue to abate and our year-over-year comps become a tailwind. As of mid-October, we're offering concessions of three to four weeks in less than half our portfolio compared to over 75% of the portfolio in the third quarter. No material concessions are being offered in Orleans, San Diego, Ventura, in Contra Costa County. Occupancy in these four counties currently average 97.9% with an availability of 2.5%. Like the fact that we are seeing solid signs of stabilization in many of our markets, I do want to acknowledge that we continue to hear anecdotal stories of owners who reacted slowly to delinquency and rapidly changing market conditions and are now attempting to improve their occupancy position during a seasonally slow demand period. As a result, there may be upcoming challenges in various markets. Consumer behavior related to COVID-19 including consumer preference for larger units, private outdoor space, stairs instead of elevators and communities within commuting distance to employment hubs, yet located in proximity to outdoor recreation amenities continues to impact demand in the marketplace. Turning to our Q3 2020 results as presented on Page 2 of our press release, year-over-year revenues declined by 6.7%. While the year-over-year revenue growth continues to decline due to the change in the rental market post-COVID, the improvement in the sequential revenue decline is consistent with the signs of stability that we're seeing in the market. Although we're not currently giving guidance, I want to remind everyone that the combination of a very tough occupancy comp of 97.1 from Q4 of last year and the fact that lease transactions on average are below last year, it is likely that our year-over-year fourth quarter revenue growth will decline from Q3. Turnover in the quarter increased 73 basis points from the prior year's quarter. Communities with certain attributes were the key contributors in this increased turnover, specifically high rises, communities with markets with a greater demographic of college students and Silicon Valley contracts and consultants. On the regulatory front, various governmental bodies have enacted anti eviction and other resident protection. California recently passed AB 3088, which is a positive step toward replacing the patchwork of local ordinances to COVID-19 related delinquency. Impart AB 3088 prohibits eviction for nonpayment of rent between March 1 and August 31 of this year, establishes a minimum future payment threshold to protect against future eviction and establishes access to small claims courts to pursue collection of past due rent. Washington State has similar regulations expiring at the end of this year. While we continue to see many residents paying down prior balances, we also continue to work with our residents on solving delinquency issues. Lastly, expenses in the quarter were negatively impacted by increased property taxes in the Seattle market, and COVID-19 related impacts such as PPE, and higher utilities driven by increased usage from residence for home for longer periods of time. Utility increases in Q3 were offset by year-over-year reduction of 12% in electricity costs, as a result of the various green initiatives we have executed. Turning to our markets, in the Seattle market year-over-year revenues in Q3 were down 1.6%, while year-over-year occupancy for the period was flat. The greatest declines continue to be in Seattle CBD where revenues declined 5.6% followed by the east side with a 1.1% decline. Revenues in the south and north sub markets saw increases of 30 and 60 basis points respectively for the same period. Seattle job growth in Q3 declined 8.1% year-over-year. However, Washington unemployment in August remained 60 basis points while the U.S. average of 7.7. It's worth noting that Seattle home purchasing activity increased during the third quarter. On a trailing three-month average from August, year-over-year home prices were up 12% in August. In August alone, home prices were up 17.4% on a year-over-year basis. Moving to Northern California, in the Bay Area market year-over-year revenues in Q3 were down 8.5%. Occupancy for the period was 96.2 a year-over-year increase of 30 basis points. Oakland CBD in San Francisco continue to be our most challenged sub markets in Q3 with year-over-year revenue declines of 16.5% to 17.1% respectively, compared to San Jose, where revenue declined 7.2%. In the same period, Contra Costa saw the decline of 4.6%, however, sequential revenues in this sub market increased by 1.6% from Q2. Bay Area job growth declined 9.7% year-over-year in Q3, mainly driven by job losses in leisure and hospitality and trade, transportation and utilities, all heavily impacted by the state's required shutdown. However, there are positive signs of growth in the market. Several Bay Area tech companies filed for IPO during the third quarter, including McAfee, Airbnb, Snowflake and Unity Software. In addition, Google unveiled their plans for a 1.3 million square foot tech village in Mountain View. This new development will have a capacity problem of 6,000 additional employees. Carry home purchase activity picked up during the third quarter on a trailing three-month average from August. Year-over-year home prices in the Bay Area were up as much as 8.6%. In August alone, San Jose market home prices were up 20% year-over-year while San Francisco and Oakland were up 14% for the same period. The increases in home prices makes the transition from renting to homeownership even more difficult, and it shows the continued long-term demand for housing in our markets. Then in Southern California, year-over-year revenues in the third quarter declined 7.3% while occupancy declined only 20 basis points. The LA market continues to be a challenge. In Q3, our West LA sub markets saw the greatest year-over-year decline of 16% while our remaining LA sub markets declined between 9.1% and 12%. LA job growth was minus 9.7% in the same period, while unemployment remained the highest of our markets at 15% in August. In Orange County, Q3 year-over-year job growth declined 10.8% while revenues declined 2.6% and occupancy increased 1.4% in the same period. I do want to note that quarterly sequential revenues in our Orange County sub markets actually increased by 1.9% in Q3. Finally in San Diego, our year-over-year revenues declined 2.1% in Q3. The Oceanside sub market however continued to grow revenues by 2.3% in the same period. San Diego job growth declined by 8.9% for the period. Currently our same store physical occupancy is 96.4%. Our availability 30-days out is at 4.5%. And our fourth quarter renewals are being sent out with no increase. Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Angela Kleiman.\nAngela Kleiman: Thank you, John. I'll start with a few comments on our third quarter results, followed by an update on capital markets and funding activities. As noted in our earnings release, and early on, this was a challenging quarter with declines of both same property revenues and core FFO per share. The 6.7% decline in same property revenue growth is primarily driven by concessions and delinquencies. We report concessions on a cash basis in our same property results. Because we believe this approach provides a true picture of current market conditions. The cash impact of concessions was 500 basis points. So, excluding this, our same property revenue decline would have been 1.7% instead of 6.7%. Conversely, on our consolidated financials, with straight line concessions in accordance with gap in calculating core and total FFO. Keep in mind that when concessions abate, our approach will impact the future performance in two ways. First, our year-over-year comparison unstained dollar revenue growth will be favorable. Second, the opposite effect will occur on our FFO growth because there will be a headwind as we continue to straight line concessions over the life of the lease. Onto delinquency, we are encouraged to see total delinquencies declined during the third quarter relative to the second quarter. On the other hand, given the current environment and related uncertainties, we maintain the same approach as last quarter and reserved against 75% of our delinquencies with third quarter. This may prove conservative is California law allows us a clear path to collection of COVID-19 related delinquencies as temporarily provided in AB-3088. The negative impact from our delinquency reserve to same property revenue and core FFO growth was 1.6% and 4%, respectively. Please see the bottom of Page two of our press release and S-15 in our supplemental for additional details. Turning to capital markets. In August, when interest rates dropped down to a level close to the 52-week low, we opportunistically issued 600 million of bonds, consisting of two $300 million tranches, an 11-year and a 30-year maturity at an effective yield of 1.75% and 2.67% respectively. The yield on our 30-year bond was the lowest on record of any Triple B plus rated issuer at that time. Since then, we have repaid a $300 million bond, that's mature in 2022 and have plans to pay up all remaining 2021 maturities at par. The net result is a very low risk maturity schedule for the next two years, was only a $350 million term loan to repay in 2022. As for funding plan for investments in the stock buyback, our structural finance investments are funded by the redemption and our development commitments is less than $73 million over the next two years. Incidentally, because the pandemic has caused delays in development deliveries, our development NOI for the next year will be lower than we expected. Because we are not as far along in our lease offs as we had originally planned. On the stock buyback year-to-date we have repurchased around a million shares at an average price of about $226 per share. We have match funded the stock repurchased with $343 million of property sales, which is comparable to our pre-COVID consensus NAV of close to $290 per share. While we have been opportunistic in arbitraging the compelling discount between our public and private NAV, we paused our share repurchases when COVID-19 caseloads and hospitalizations 32 summer and severe shelter in place orders were issued. Even though we have transacted on a leveraged neutral basis and have reduced our net debt, selling assets also reduces EBITDA. Accordingly, we continue to be mindful of the impact and the debt-to-EBITDA of the impact on adjusted EBITDA ratio in the context of our stock buyback strategy. In summary with minimal near-term funding needs, nothing drawn on our line of credit, and approximately $1.7 billion in total liquidity, our balance sheet remains strong. And we continue to have the flexibility to be opportunistic, while maintaining our disciplined approach to capital allocation. Thank you, and I will now turn the call back to the operator for question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nNick Joseph: Thank you and appreciate all the operating update on the call. If I'm looking at page S15 of the supplemental the operating statistics for October, I know they're done on a gross basis and not taken into account concessions. I know you said concessions were abating. But I'm wondering if you can give the operating numbers do renewal of blended when taken into account concessions for both October and then the third quarter?\nMichael Schall: So let me see if I can give you some more information. I may not give you everything there, but let me give you some more information. Number one, on that note, it shows that the market rents the decline in market rents has improved. And that is true. But the fact is last year, we had an easier comp. So I want to make sure we have the context, whenever you know, it's always a challenge with transparency, giving out more information and then not having all the context. So there's a little bit of a headache when it shows how the October rents have improved year-over-year. But that said, our markets are doing well and across the board and showing signs of stabilization or they're actually improving. So I want to make sure we get the right message across as we get to a read and further, you'll see that number reverses a little bit. I don't want people thinking, oh, now things are getting worse. It's not the case, it's just the year-over-year comp. But as we get into what's happening in October, as far as for concessions go, we have - we started the October reducing concessions. And this is off of a Q3, which is over 75% of our transactions had concessions of roughly a month. And then we moved into October the first couple of weeks, and we were at less than 50%. And then as we move into the second half of October, we're actually now at less than 25%. So we're doing that while maintaining occupancy or improving occupancy and while maintaining low availability. So, all those pieces are going in the right direction at Essex. Again, we don't - we're not in the market, we're part of the market, but we're performing very well within that marketplace. When we look at the break between renewals and new leases, there's definitely more leasing incentives on the new leases typically running 3.3% is what we have in there was accurate. On the renewals, it's usually less than a week. Obviously, there's less of an incentive, this is already - people already in the property. Does that answer your question, Nick?\nNick Joseph: That sounds very helpful, and especially the color on the year-over-year trend. And then maybe just the second question. Angela, I appreciate the commentary on the share repurchase program. What would get you to restart it and I'm wondering, obviously, the stock is below where you are purchasing and for some of the reasons that you discussed. So what would get you more aggressive there? Is it price? Or should we expect it to be paused for the near-term regardless?\nAngela Kleiman: Yes, I think, Nick, if you look at how we manage our capital allocations, we're not really going to deviate too much from that plan. And so, the key commentary I have is really to make sure that we also at the same time preserve our debt-to-EBITDA ratio. And so, it'll be a little bit of all of the above what are we selling? And what price and what's the impact on the EBITDA reduction? At the same time, what are our opportunities to reinvest the sale proceeds? So there - if we have more preferred equity for example, then that certainly will be an important piece. And of course, the other piece is where the stock is trading, right. And so, it's all of these things I guess, that factored in.\nNick Joseph: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.\nSumit Malhotra: I this is Sumit here with Nick. Just a question on cash delinquencies, I know there are 2.2% of scheduled rents. And you recently at a conference earlier in September spoke about positive delinquencies. So could you provide us with an update on how collections are trending on the delinquency side? And how much of this 2.2 will likely head into mid-2021? Also, do you have any delinquencies creeping into your utilities expense side like some of your peers?\nJohn Burkart: Yeah, okay. So, overall, delinquencies are definitely improving. And you can obviously see that from Q3 versus Q2, there are some underlying trends there that occur. And so what's happening is, we are collecting a little bit more in prior delinquencies which is a good thing. Again, I've said all along, we're working with all of our residents. And the great, great, great majority are showing very good behavior. So we are getting a little bit more on the current month's delinquency, is a slight uptick. It kind of ties in with the reduction of the federal aid, but it's really not that material overall. Again, the pitcher delinquency is improving. And so my expectation as we move forward, we continue to have the economy opening up. Although, we still have negative year-over-year job comps, they're getting better and better. And so if on a local level, we actually had seasonal job comps, they would actually show seasonal growth. So things are actually improving out here and my expectation is that delinquency will continue to improve as we move forward. As it relates to utilities or any other line item, they're really running a similar path to the rental delinquencies. If the people who are unable to pay rent are really not paying delinquencies but, yeah there's not paying all of it. So or they're paying a percentage, but the percentage is type of thing. So it's a very parallel path, if that makes sense.\nNick Yulico: Yeah. Hey, guys, Nick here. Just a question - bigger picture question maybe for Mike, what is sort of the biggest selling point you can get investors right now about your portfolio and addressing some of the bigger worries out there, such as potential increase in rent control in California the fact that tech workers are working remotely, and they are in some cases moving to other states like Washington, where there isn't a state income tax. With all that being said what are people missing about the Essex story right now? And I guess, the other thing I'm wondering is, you talked about it sounds like transaction cap rates staying low, much lower than what your stock price implied cap rate is right now. So I mean how do you think about asset sales in this environment as well?\nMichael Schall: Yeah, Nick, those are great questions. And I guess I would start with the latter point you made which is the disconnect between public real estate markets and private real estate markets and trying to monetize that difference. And as Angela stated, we paused a bit in the quarter when the COVID cases were increasing. And it's interesting. We think that's just an obvious benefit for operating the machine in forward direction. We are issuing stock and incurring debt and buying property at a positive differential or arbitrage. And we think that that works pretty well in reverse direction as well. So I'd say that is an obvious way to add value, add NAV per share, add FFO share to the company given the current dislocation. I'd also mention that when we look at the amount of job loss we've had, the rent growth, or the rent reductions that we've seen are really I guess, I would say to be expected. And I know everyone is focused on this work from home issue. But if you just look at LA jobs still as of September down 9.6%, San Francisco down 10% and Oakland down 11%and largely driven by things that will - a big portion of them will come back. Like for example, the tourism, restaurants, hotels, the motion picture business in Southern California. Those are the tech industries. But there's nothing fundamentally wrong with them. And I think that most of the rental revenue loss that we've incurred is just a directly attributable to job growth. And so, I think that this will unwind itself and it's already started to unwind itself as Mr. Burkart just outlined in numbers that are slowly getting better or still, I would say in a pretty tough spot with respect to employment, we need that to recover. But the balance sheet is incredibly well positioned. And we do have some ways to add value to the company. And so we see opportunity there. So I guess that's how it answers your question.\nNick Yulico: All right. Thanks, Mike.\nMichael Schall: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJeff Spector: Thank you. My first question actually was similar to that last question. But, Mike, maybe we could dig a bit deeper into the work from home part? Because, as you stated, it, that seems to be the number one concern for the stock, I believe you said again, as Nick said, cap rates are flat in the suburbs. And did you see talk at least is only minus 5% in the cities verse, I think your stock is implying more of a 20% 25% discount. So the work from home maybe just, can you just talk about that a little bit more and why you're so comfortable that that's not going to impact Essex?\nMichael Schall: Yeah, hey again, it's a great question, Jeff. Thanks for joining the call. I guess our thesis is that the hybrid model will likely prevail. And many of the jobs that are in the cities require a physical presence, I would make that point, virtually everything that connects with a customer, from hotels, to restaurants, to bars, et cetera, the motion picture industry where it is pretty hard to film without people being present, et cetera. And so, we see that as probably it's too much focus on, let's say, the tech community, and not enough focused on the number of jobs that are required to actually physically be there to do your job. But, I guess, and thinking about this, and in looking at what others have said, it's pretty interesting. There's obviously a big debate out there. And, the Netflix CEO, for example, said, he doesn't see any positives from working from home. And another CEO, the Zillow CEO says, the easy decision - the easy part of the process of working from home is making the decision, the hard part is actually implementing it. And I think what he means by that is, there are some pretty serious issues that come along with work from home, that are going to take a lot of time and effort to work out. And I would mention, let's say potential for less pay to the employees, how does the compensation issue work out. The productivity issues, how do you continue a culture of collaboration and a vibrant culture when people don't see each other? And I think, it's we found we're largely remote at this point in time, we've found that it's pretty difficult to resolve significant business problems where senior executives have different perspectives on things, when in a work from home type of environment, you're much better off together. So, again, we are thinking that the hybrid model is probably be going to be the main path going forward. The hybrid model will have required some tethering to an office at some point in time to try to keep those collaboration and the vibrancy and the culture together. And so, we still see ourselves has been pretty well position. So, someone may not live in a city, let's say, but we'll live somewhere, potentially nearby, certainly within driving distance. And we don't see that as a bad thing. We have properties in fact, most of our properties are actually out in suburbia. And so, we think we're well positioned for that. And by the way, the other key point here is, we're not producing a lot of housing, and there's not going to be a lot of housing produced out there. So already, as John said earlier, already, we're starting to see rents increase now in suburbia as that dynamic plays out. And they're reducing in the cities and the areas that have previously had higher rents. And so, the market is compensating for all of these issues, as it always does and the decision a renter might have made six months ago, can be very different from the decisions that they're making today. So, net-net we think we're very well positioned and again, we have properties throughout these markets and throughout the commutable locations near the job centers, and we think that's still the right strategy.\nJeff Spector: Thank you, Mike. My follow up would be are you able, you mentioned, I believe that 9 out of the 10 companies you're tracking, you're seeing an increase in job postings. Are you able to track for those postings? I guess, if they're advertising, hybrid, work from anywhere. Is there a way to quantify that or not? No, it's not possible?\nMichael Schall: Yes, it's - Jeff, it's hard to do. I mean, we in our September presentation, we gave out the dates for office re-openings of some of the top 10 tech companies, but the reality is that they are moving back to some degree, as if there's another phase of or surge of COVID cases, maybe those get pushed back. It appears and looking at, there was a recent Microsoft announcement that gave greater work from home flexibility, etcetera. But I guess, from our perspective, most of the top 10 tech companies have worked via return to work dates out there. And I think that's significant. Because if they were going - all of them were going a 100% work from home as a couple of smaller tech companies are doing, that would be one thing. But most of them have returned to work dates. And even if they get pushed back a little bit, I guess the significance here is, as long as they ultimately are going back to the office as in some way or another, I think that will solidify the connection to the office. And either way, no one's going to pick up the apple spaceship and move it somewhere else. So, it's there for a reason, there are a lot of services there, including daycare and all kinds of things. And it's meant it's there for a reason. And I don't think that that motivation goes away anytime soon. I guess, you're back to the top 10 tech companies in the job outlook, those are data that we take off their websites, and do our own survey, and have tracked what they're doing for many years, because they're so important to our mission. And they, as I said, they're off their peak, which was actually in March of this year by a reasonable amount. I think, looks like somewhere around 27,000 jobs in March open for the top 10 tech companies down to about 17,000 - about 18,000 is the most recent number. And but, now starting to move back in the other direction. So, it looks like that is starting to get better, not worse.\nJeff Spector: Great. Thank you.\nMichael Schall: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nRich Hightower: Yeah, hey, good morning out there guys. Covered a lot of ground, but I guess Mike, just a follow up maybe on a prior thread. As we think about COVID cases rising here in the US and globally and you're seeing renewed lockdowns in places like Europe. I mean, how does that make you feel about California potentially being first in line to take a similar posture in the months ahead if current trends continue? And then I guess, on the flip side, I mean, given just lowered seasonality in terms of leasing volumes, do you think the impact of that happening would be a lot less material than what occurred during the sort of the second and third quarter?\nMichael Schall: Yes, Rich. Hey, you know what I got to say, I greatly appreciate the work that Evercore ISI has done on this issue on the COVID tracking, etcetera it's been fantastic. And we all use it. So, thanks for that. I think that California has been super conservative when it comes to dealing with COVID. And as I said in my prepared remark that means that it accomplished two things at once, it really curtailed the number of the case spread throughout California. And at the same time, it muted our recovery very significantly. So, we're now I think, at a place in California where things are actually in pretty good order. Not that it can't change, and I believe that what will happen is the state will be very vigilant in terms of pushing us back into a more restrictive tier if they have to. But I think as we sit here today, I think we're in a better spot than some of the areas that have been more open, and have let their economy flow more freely. So, we'll take this on a day by day basis. But we look - it looks like California and Washington are actually very well positioned. And I don't think that you would see this, with the chart on Page S16, I don't think you would see this pretty significant movement to reopen the economy, if that wasn't the case.\nRich Hightower: Yeah, that makes sense. And then, just for quick clarification, I think John mentioned 4.5% availability 30-days out at this particular moment, just how does that - give us some context around that, how is that compared to sort of normal for this time of year or year-over-year or along those lines?\nJohn Burkart: Sure, yeah, no that's actually very good overall. I mean, going into this part of the season, Essex as a general rule, we like to have higher occupancy and lower availability going into the season where there's a decline in demand season like and sitting at 4.5% right now availability is a good spot. It's consistent with where we've been in the last several years, the team has worked very hard to meet the market, and very interactive trying to understand what the consumer wants, and off of that and leased our units up and get quality paying tenants. And I think they've done a terrific job, you can see it in our higher occupancy even into October that 96.6. I mean, that's just really, really doggone good. Now, again, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, in Q4 of last year, we were at 97.1, the market was very, very strong. And so we still have some headwinds. But in context, I think the whole portfolio is doing very well, if either signs of strength in some markets like Ventura, Contra Costa, Orange, and San Diego, or we see good signs of stabilization in many other markets. Or I'll mention, say, in San Francisco and Oakland, for example we see the beginnings of this backfill, that's starting to happen. And we mentioned this before, how in our markets, they are desirable places to live. And so when it's really a value proposition, so when the price gets to the right point, consumers make changes. And so what we're starting to see now, from January through September, the average was about 6% move ins came from the outlying areas, and this is far off commuting places, like say Antioch that we're moving into the Oakland area, and or San Francisco. And the numbers vary, but they're fairly close to that 6%, average all the way through pre-COVID, post COVID, all the way through. And now in October, that number jumped to 14%, literally just jumped. And you look and you say okay, what's going on there, I would say this is the super commuters, the people that they're tethered, as Mike said to the employers. Employers are opening up, and they're looking and saying, I have now my value proposition is to move into San Francisco, move into Oakland, and at a lower price point, avoid that commute. This is a great deal. It works for me. And we're starting to see that. That's a real deal thing that actually happened. So, when I look across our markets, again, I get the strength in certain markets. I get the stability in others and I get the very positive signs in the most challenged places like San Francisco and downtown Oakland.\nRich Hightower: Okay, got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Kim: Good morning. You provided some helpful commentary on the incentive in response to Mike, Joe's questions. But I was wondering if you could provide some additional granularity as far as the effective blended rate growth rates in the third quarter and October?\nJohn Burkart: Well, I guess I'm going to look at effective that one month is 8%. Right. And so if we go three weeks, or three quarters, it adds about 6% off of our lease rates, and that would be one way to look at it to get down to that number. But the reason why I'm not going there is I think it's a little bit misleading, to be honest. I mean, we tend to get into this almost bond mentality of doing a calculation and if we did that, I would have gone back in the last several months at GE rent spell this huge amount net effective. And today I would be saying, oh my gosh, rents have moved up this huge amount because concessions are abating. And I think both of those can be a little bit misleading. As Mike has said, for years, concessions can come into the market and go out rather rapidly. We've used them as a tool to increase occupancy as leasing incentives, and to much lesser extent as in renewals. And so my preference in this case is to really look at it and say, okay, what's going on with our street rents, or market rents or coupon rents and then concessions, where they add? They came into the market in a really big way in June. We use them to increase occupancy pretty dramatically, that's worked. The concessions are abating, we're pulling them back. And I think that's the bigger story. But if you get lost in the net effective rents I'd say, you'll have to go all the way back and say they sell a lot. And now they're increasing. And I think - I don't think that's the best way to look at it.\nJohn Kim: Should we be adding the free rent period to the 12-month lease, or is the 12-month inclusive of the free rent? In other words, is it 12-month lease or 13 only?\nJohn Burkart: It's typically 12-month lease. And yes, if you try to get to net effective again, as I said, you just take the concession amount and say okay, if it's a month, it's 8%. And you'd make that adjustment. So I mean, that's the simplistic way to get there. But again, I just don't think that's the best way to look at what's happening in the marketplace right now.\nJohn Kim: Okay, and my second question is on your suburban portfolio. I was wondering if you could categorize what percentage of your suburban portfolio is transit oriented or is densely populated suburban versus, I guess, your more typical garden style suburban portfolio? And if you do have the breakdown, is there a difference in the performance between the two?\nJohn Burkart: Well. I don't have the details of the breakdown with that. But I will tell you as it relates to performance, transit oriented is really not what's driving anything right now. It's basically a lot of people aren't taking the transit. So they're not on bar and they're not on caltrain. If they're commuting, they're on the road. We've seen that many different ways, but we also see that how much used cars are getting bid up, people are opting to drive. But what we do see is, again the walk-ability as I've mentioned previously, it's the higher the walk-ability typically relates to the higher the price per square foot in rents. And that if you were to look at one correlation that would be the units that are negatively impacted the most. And on the other side, is the lower dollars per square foot or lower walk-ability of the units that have benefited the most in this situation, if that makes sense.\nMichael Schall: And hey, John. This is Mike. In our September presentation that's on the internet, there actually is a - there's a chart that describes exactly what John shows you, which is the change in asking rents by Walk Scores on Page 21 of that presentation. So hopefully that'll help. And if you have any follow up questions, give us a call.\nJohn Kim: Very helpful, thank you.\nJohn Burkart: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nRich Hill: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my call. Hey John, I have a question for you. Because I think we maybe have a little bit different take on some of the questioning on this call. I think the market understands that apartments are under pressure. It's one of the worst kept secrets in the market right now. And I frankly, don't think that market is surprised that same store revenue is going to get worse in 4Q and 1Q. I think what the markets looking for is seems to be less bad. And if I think about what you reported last night, particularly for October, you showed that, right. Occupancies improved, leasing spreads were less bad. And so, I think you were making some really important comments about demand as rents come down. So my questions are really - I guess, are really simple one in theory, have we seen the bottom? Do you think that rents have come down enough to attract that incremental demand? And really are we going to start to just reaccelerate from here? Because I really think that the market just need to see less bad, stable to improving occupancy and less bad leasing spreads. So if we're there, I think that's a real positive.\nJohn Burkart: Yeah, and wish you could ask me this in June of 2021 and we can cook for that course of positive. But, obviously, I don't know the future. What I'm trying to point out is, we do have signs of strength that a third of our portfolio is actually moving increasing occupancy rents, stability in large portions of the portfolio. We are not the market, we're a participant in it. And there's some others in the market that are trying to play catch up right now. So, I see volatility going forward. And then recognizing that seasonally, usually Q4 and Q1 are the low points, it would be hard for me to say that I would believe that Q3 is, it turns out to be a low point. But there's just volatility in Q4. A lot of pieces out there, no one knows what's going on with COVID and everything else, but we're feeling good. There are certainly things have improved from what we saw in June and July, which was tremendous amount of activity, trying to find where the market was, we found the market, where the consumers are interested. To your comment, has places in San Francisco and Oakland I brought that comment up, because we are starting to see that people from outlying areas as super commuters are now moving in that value proposition works for them. And that is a very good sign. It's going to be I call it a leading sign. So, that is a good thing. Those markets are still tough and the word acceleration gives me heartburn. But the stability, yes, strength in some other areas, certainly, we're starting to see sequential improve in those four counties that I mentioned. So, overall, I feel much better than it did last quarter, let's put it that way.\nMichael Schall: Hey Rich, this is Mike.\nRich Hill: Yeah, go ahead Mike.\nMichael Schall: Yeah, let me just add one additional item to that. And that is, normally this time of year, we feel pretty good about giving guidance for the next year. And as john said, we don't this year largely because of the COVID uncertainty or unknowns that we talked about in the opening script. It's just, the world can change so rapidly, and for the better or for the worse and it's not - it's things that are completely outside of our purview of understanding. So, we regret not giving our normal guidance on Page S16 for next year. And but we just can't or they're just too many unknowns. One thing that we're focused on and it's so important on Page S9 of the supplement, our average monthly rental rate is down 40 basis points, and we're trying to hold occupancy, we're trying to hold rate. And if we can do that with, again with jobs still down 8.7% on average, and down 11% in Oakland and 10% in San Francisco, trying to hold rate while we have that much job loss, worse than the financial crisis, I think is an amazing piece. So that's what we're trying to do. And we remain both.\nRich Hill: Yeah, that's really helpful, guys. And like, I would just reiterate to you, given where valuations are right now, I don't think the market needs to see you get back to where you were in 1Q '20. I think the market just needs to see less bad. And I think that's why October was encouraging. That's maybe a long way of saying, if we're not catching a falling knife anymore, and it feels like there's some stability emerging, that sounds like a positive. So, look forward to future updates, guys. Good work on the quarter.\nJohn Burkart: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from line of John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Pawlowski: Thanks. So just one quick question for me John, as your private competitors play a little catch up on the occupancy side and as larger rent resets, kind of ripple through sub markets in some of your outside of your portfolio, do you expect occupancy to slide here, coming in the next several quarters?\nJohn Burkart: I don't, I wouldn't say that I expect it to slide. I think the team is doing a phenomenal job. We are very aggressive getting data, we have proprietary data hub, and we pull all the data together. We have daily meetings, pricing and strategy meetings. And it is just an amazing team with leadership all the way through it. And so, we're meeting the market. So, we know that a unit that's vacant, does not earn any revenue and we just for years laughed at the proud and vacant concept that it just doesn't get you anywhere. So we typically are doing 12-month leases and we meet the market and try to understand it, meet it in and stay occupied. So, I don't see the occupancy declining a lot. 96.6 is high but maintaining I'd say 96 and north of 96 I think is what I would expect to see for the next couple of quarters. And then, normally as we start to get into the 3Q - 2Q and 3Q and there starts to be more turnover, that has an impact on reducing occupancy just because of the nature of the turnover. But we will continue to try to maintain higher occupancy. And I just expect there to be volatility and I brought that up, because I don't want people to be surprised by headlines from different vendors saying this is happening here and that's happening there and also thinks that the whole market is going away. There's just individual players that are really struggling right now. There are some people with lost occupancy in the third quarter, which was probably not the best strategy. And now they're trying to figure out what to do.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. One follow-up there, are any markets in Northern California where you've taken concessions off and you think you'll have to put them back on into the winter?\nJohn Burkart: No. I mean, it floats around. I mean, right. We're going to use them where we need them. But we have it's - again, we're meeting on a regular basis to figure this out and figure out what where the market is, and what's happening. But I'm not looking right now and expecting huge obvious weakness in one spot or another, I expect volatility. And so to that extent, what I mean by that is yeah, we'll make pricing adjustments as necessary if things pop up. But it's more like whack a mole, and then trying to maintain a good position throughout this situation.\nMichael Schall: Hey, John, one quick comment. This is Mike. Just one quick follow up with to what John said. Generally, nothing great happens in the fourth quarter, because hiring which is also affected by COVID. But generally, in Q4, companies just wait until Q1 when they have new budgets and business plans, in order to regain resume hiring activity. So you end up with sort of the worst of both worlds. You end up with less hiring, and of course, the supply deliveries keep coming. So keep in mind that that dynamic is definitely is probably greater this quarter, given the pandemic related issues than it has been in the past. So, really, I think we need to get into the New Year before we have really a great sense of what direction we're going to be going in.\nJohn Pawlowski: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Hey everybody, thank you for taking the question. First, just curious, given you guys were more aggressive with concessions over the summer to the extent that others are playing catch up. Curious where you kind of peg your in-place effective rents today versus market rents?\nJohn Burkart: Our in place effective rents? Well, do you mean like last delays where are we at?\nAustin Wurschmidt: So, yeah if you take into account concessions, looking at your effective rents today, how far below or at market are you so to the extent things do soften further, you've already put in some cushion and to the extent the market is coming to you, versus you having to cut further ultimately?\nJohn Burkart: Sure, again, most of our cuts have really been along the lines of concessions, and we've backed away from those. As we noted, our market rents are down about 5.8% in Q3 2020 over Q3 '19. So we've made adjustments down, it varies by market, obviously with San Francisco being greater and other markets much less. But the market as a whole is really hanging in there, as a general rule with the consumer has been looking for is concessions, leasing incentives, and we've continued to structure our pricing along those lines to meet the consumer where they're at. But what we've seen is that over the recent time, certainly over the summer, things were pretty intense. And then as we got into the fall, this need for concessions backed away. And the more we backed away, the more we're able to continue to maintain occupancy and low availability. So, if necessary, we'll adjust, but right now, we've already dropped our market rents by say 5.8%.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Okay, yeah, I guess I'm just generally looking for sort of a loss to lease type number. You're more full today, and your loss to lease?\nJohn Burkart: Yeah, our loss to lease is like 3.6% if we look at it that way. Yeah upside down, okay. Yeah, gain to lease sorry. Gain to lease.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Got it. Gain to lease, got it, okay.\nJohn Burkart: It's like not have been use to saying that, I mean just lastly, we have gain to lease.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Right. Okay. Fair enough. And then in your comments on work from home and you think things kind of get more back to normal over time, you guys are more suburban. So as restrictions get lifted, concerns around the virus, e-services are back up and running. Perhaps the urban cores, take a little longer, so the concessions remain elevated there. Is there a risk that you lose residents that had moved out to more suburban locations, but ultimately want to move back into urban cores and closer to their offices as things do begin to return back to normalcy?\nMichael Schall: Yeah, Austin, this is Mike. And John alluded to some of this a minute ago, when he was talking about the October movement of other Northern California markets back into San Francisco and Oakland doubling from the previous numbers. So that definitely there is a there is movement. And largely, it's because of the price differentials. We've discounted now so much in the cities, that they are a relative value compared to the suburban areas. And suburban areas rents is more recently have actually increased, which again, as long as their price differential continues to expand between the cities and the suburban areas, you're going to see more people moving back in. So we think this is just the normal operation of the markets and compensating for find the rent that sells the units in the marketplace. And so, most people don't focus on that relationship of what rents are doing in the suburban markets versus the urban markets, the reality is it very much affects consumer choice. And so now more people are choosing to live in the cities at a lower price point.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Okay. That makes sense. Okay, thanks for the thoughts.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Santos with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\nDaniel Santos: Hey, good morning, thanks for taking my question. Most of my questions have been answered so just two quick ones for me. I was wondering if you could comment, sorry, if you covered this already, on any sort of future or further operation or balance sheet initiatives that you could look to for cost savings just in the face of continued revenue decline. And then second, I was wondering if you could comment more specifically on whether or not you've considered investing in markets outside of California, just given all the California - the issues California faces both near-term and long-term?\nMichael Schall: Yes, this is Mike. Actually, I would say the pressure on costs are - have increased in COVID. As you can imagine, we had a relatively small collection department, it's now much larger. As you can imagine, selling and changing price and strategy is much more complicated now. So I'd say the business - in terms of operating the business, it's more complicated. But as noted in our - again our September presentation, there are some bright things that are happening. And one of them involves technology, where we said that technology will probably lead to a 100 to 200 basis points improvement in margin overtime. And as I said in my prepared remarks that the consumer has accepted technology actually prefers technology given COVID. And that has allowed us to move pretty strongly into deployment of various different types of technologies. And so there is definitely promise there for reduced cost. And I'm sorry, what was the second part of your question?\nDaniel Santos: I was just wondering, if you could comment more specifically on whether or not you considered investing in markets outside of California, just looking all the over-hang?\nMichael Schall: Yeah. If we can come to believe that advocating for good housing policies in California is something that we're going to do, we're going to be activated, we're going to spend a lot of time and some money doing it. We think that overall, it makes sense to do that, because it's pretty hard to find what we have here. The combination of supply constraints and very vibrant businesses that are growing rapidly, and which is really what drives rents. It forms this virtual cycle of rents push up, wages and then wages allow higher rents, and you will find that in very few markets. So, we do have a process involved in our strategic planning activities that look at other markets that are similar to the West Coast. We don't think any of them are quite as good as the West Coast. But we continue to look at it, obviously, we're just interested in one thing, we're interested in adding value for shareholders and growing the company. And so, if we see the right set of conditions, we would be compelled to take a hard look at it.\nDaniel Santos: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Neil Malkin with Capital One Security. Please proceed with your question.\nNeil Malkin: Thanks, guys. Good morning. Thanks for staying on. Appreciate you giving me the time. First one is on the preferred equity side, you continue to be active in that. I would like you originated a couple, one was stabilized. And that was the first time I've seen you do that. Can you just talk about what that market kind of looks like? I thought that, stabilized assets are easy to finance with the agency debt. If you just maybe talk about it, that's a new trends you're seeing or maybe overall, what kind of opportunities you see in that part of your business?\nAdam Berry: Sure, Neil this is Adam. So, we've definitely seen, we're still very active in the market and have seen more, there is ample debt out there for stabilized assets. But underwriting has definitely has been more challenging for some sponsors. So, we are seeing more and more opportunities on the stabilized side. And you saw the one that we just funded this quarter, and probably a couple more in the pipeline coming down.\nNeil Malkin: Okay, great. Appreciate that. And then I guess, next question is for Mike, as people talked about the coastal issues, but you're talking about Amazon and Google growing in Seattle, Northern California, putting their money where their mouth is office space. I just, again, kind of maybe want to go back, I've looked at some subleasing data. It looks like the square footage available for sublease has gone from like 1.4% to 4% in Northern California. You look at companies like Facebook and Google who have talked about like around 50% of their workforce being remote during regional location. And then, Reddit said, they're not going to adjust compensation based on location, usually, these companies follow each other's moves. So, I guess, how do you think that the framework around the tech markets or at least in those areas in the West Coast isn't at least partially impaired, given those main driving forces from those large companies?\nMichael Schall: Well I guess this is the moment that I would say, I'm glad I'm not an office company, because I agree with what you're saying. Definitely, there's plenty of lease space out there. Although, the vacancy rates that I have don't show huge increases this quarter versus last quarter, but obviously, these things take time to play out. And I guess I'd be cautious to say that, it seems like things are changing rapidly. And, but I still think that we should take some time to wait and see what happens, because, right now, on the work from home thing, again, as noted in the script, it's a pretty much a mandatory thing right now, as opposed to a life's choice that it will be sort of in a post COVID period. So, I think there's a lot of change just being forced upon us. Again, we believe in the hybrid model and we think that that's what will take place going forward. And in fact, we think we'll adopt that model as a company as well, because there are definitely some benefits to it. But at the same time, I'm hyper focused on the culture here and the vibrancy of the company as we all are, everyone in this room is. And, that is critically important to us. I just don't see how you maintain that via whist exclusively and work from home type of format. So, I don't know what's going to happen exactly with these things. But again, I think there's good reason and a lot of issues that need to be resolved on the work from home model, for it to be successful and no doubt there will be some bumps in the road. So, as long as those employees remain within the major metros, I think that we're in good shape. And, they may not we may not get the rent growth in San Francisco, but we will get it out into in the suburban markets. And we'll continue to do pretty well, I think.\nNeil Malkin: I appreciate the feedback. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Calmes with Zelman and Associates. Please proceed with your question.\nAlex Calmes: Hi, thank you for taking my question. Just kind of wrap my arms around going back to the public and private values. If we think about in your opening remarks, you said that there's a 5% to 10% discount in the pre-COVID pricing. But if I think about where volumes are today, there's a significant drop off from last year. So, if we were running at a hypothetical normal rate, would that imply a deeper discount if we were there right now?\nAdam Berry: Hey, Alexander, this is Adam. So I think, to Mike's comment in the earlier script, the 5% to 10% discount that he was talking about was more urban core markets. We've actually seen valuations on suburban assets be at or above pre-COVID levels. You're right. And that volume has definitely been off of what it historically is. That being said, we're constantly in the market talking to potential buyers on potential dispositions. And there are enough out there that the market is being met, I'd say at that kind of at or above pre-COVID pricing. But just as an example, the deal we just sold in Glendale this week, that sold on pre-COVID pricing, or pre-COVID rents at about a 3A cap and that was about 4%, above our pre-COVID value. Cap on concessions and you're in the low-3s. So yeah, we're still pretty confident that the spread and what Mike mentioned that 5% to 10% discount on core markets, we think that still kind of flows through despite the lack of volume.\nAlex Calmes: Got it. Would you call it even a scarcity premium on sort of those assets?\nAdam Berry: There is definitely that potential. Yes.\nAlex Calmes: Got it. Thank you. And just in some of the tax plans we're seeing in the Biden administration. If he were to win, he thinks about 10:31 exchanges and eliminating that. I just want to gauge just how big of a factor that would be in California transaction market? Are you - do you know what percentage that would be?\nMichael Schall: This is Mike. It's hard to tell. I mean, this year given lower revenue, which is not a good thing, we have plenty of room in terms of taxable income to sell some properties and not have a REIT or dividend issue. So, but it will vary from year to year. And they're already given the Prop 13, they're already - it's already a headwind in selling some of our California properties as well. So, it's hard to tell. That's more of a hypothetical question that it depends on the circumstances and what we see going forward. So it's a difficult one to answer.\nAlex Calmes: Okay, thank you for the color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Amanda Sweitzer with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nAmanda Sweitzer: Great, thanks. Just a quick one from me here, have you seen a change in tenant credit quality as you've had more of those values to be [ph] intravenously including those super commuters you're referring to? And then, just for context in past downturn, do you see greater turnover among those value consumers when you do eventually look to raise rent?\nJohn Burkart: Yeah. So as far as the tenant credit quality, no, we have not seen any decline there. It's a situation where if you have a job, you continue to maintain going forward, and then you're able to rent and if you don't, it's a terrible situation, but you're not going to become a new renter. So we haven't seen any declines there. As it relates to turnover, from that type of situation, yeah, the answer is, yeah, there are sometimes I can think of an almost a funny story where we had a resident that moved from one of our outer properties up in Seattle to downtown. They transferred within Essex. And then as the market picked up, this is after the last financial crisis, they moved back into the property that they had started with. And they're very nice person and they wanted to stay with Essex, is an Essex client. But they really did take advantage of the pricing changes. And, again, it's that value proposition that they were making personally between their commute in pricing and everything and making that decision. And that's what we do see goes on. Of course, that's the backdrop there was the rents in Seattle went up, because the economy was growing, demand was increasing because of jobs. And so, the fact that, that person moves out, it really going to impact the overall economic picture. It was a rent rising then.\nAmanda Sweitzer: Make sense. Thanks.\nJohn Burkart: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.\nHaendel St. Juste: Yes, good morning out there.\nJohn Burkart: Hey Haendel.\nHaendel St. Juste: Good morning. First question for me and I'm sorry if I missed this, but did you guys discuss what drove that $8 million increase in non-residential revenue from second quarters up to $19 million? And I guess I'm curious what was behind that as well. And if this builds level, we should be forecasting near term plan on it?\nAngela Kleiman: Hey Haendel, it's Angela. Sure, I see a $19 million increase. I have on the property levels\u2026\nHaendel St. Juste: It's sequentially it's from $11 million to $19 million, this quarter, not $8 million.\nAngela Kleiman: As in to 19, you know what I'll have to get back to you because when I look at our S2 from quarter to quarter, second quarter to third quarter, a growth from $5 million to $6.3 million. So, it's one that is being [indiscernible]\nJohn Burkart: Where are you looking?\nAngela Kleiman: Yeah, where are you looking?\nHaendel St. Juste: Looking on the - sorry one second, Page S8, I'm looking at the non-residential other line items in third quarter $19.8 million versus second quarter of $11.4 million.\nAngela Kleiman: Okay.\nHaendel St. Juste: Looking up bottom line, I was just curious if that was something you had readily available, but certainly can follow up if it's going to take a bit more digging? And then\u2026\nAngela Kleiman: No, it's - And that is straight line rent. I think that's where you're looking at line rent.\nHaendel St. Juste: Non-residential other income $19.847 million. Right, so, doesn't really look like any other event. We'll do the follow up. Mike, maybe I guess following up on -\nAngela Kleiman: Yeah, it's straight on rental and commercial - on commercial. I think that's what it is. But we'll follow up with you. But I think that's what that is.\nHaendel St. Juste: Okay, fair enough. A question then following up on Daniel's question about new markets, we've talked about this over the past few quarters, few years. I guess I'm curious, what are your peers mentioned Salt Lake City specifically? So, I'm curious to know how the market like that ranks on your hypothetical list and maybe you could, disposition proceeds because that's a use of the source of capital for entering new markets given what seems to be a hesitant here to for more stock buybacks?\nMichael Schall: Yeah Haendel, it's a good question. Actually there's a bunch of cities that you can put in that category. They're smaller metros; Boise would be another good example. But there are others as well. I guess, from our perspective, we want to see enough liquidity in the market from an investment perspective, enough local buyers and sellers to create a pretty strong market. And that's one of the issues in each of those markets. The other issue is relatively inexpensive, single family homes. And I think everyone should be very careful with this, about this point in the cycle, because we're starting to see rapid increases in single family home prices. And as soon as you get to a level where, it's more attractive to buy a home than it is to rent an apartment, those markets tend to get hit pretty hard. So, this is why the supply constraints we measure very broadly to include how all types of housing and for sale as well as rental housing, because we've learned that lesson before. We were once upon a time in the city of Portland, another good example of this, although it's a bigger metro than Salt Lake City in Boise. But in the city of Portland, we made some investments based on an urban growth boundary that surrounded Portland that limited the amount of housing production. And we exited Portland actually, because they expanded their urban growth boundary to allow for the production of 10,000 single family homes that are relatively inexpensive price, which made our apartments much less attractive in the overall Housing Choice that were available to consumers. So, I hear that, we like those markets are growing very rapidly. There's definitely money to be made, but there's definitely a higher risk associated with them.\nHaendel St. Juste: Yeah, thanks for that, Mike. And one final question not to split here, but I guess I'm curious on what you guys are seeing on the demand side for studio apartments? Can you just - given that they tend to be the younger or more nimble renters and as people have fled from the city, certainly in search for more space, curious to how the incremental demand or any pricing power emerging in that part of the portfolio? Thanks.\nJohn Burkart: Well, I wouldn't use the word pricing power and attach that to studios. Basically what we see and we look slice and dice at numerous different ways, but as it relates to say, just unit type, clearly, the three bedrooms have higher demand than two bedrooms than one bedroom, than studio at the bottom. Generally, what we see within the marketplace is the studios now have lower occupancy. And again, this ties back to some of my comments were when we look and see where turnover was or where there's demand issues, this is connected in part to say studies, it's also connected to Silicon Valley consultants and those types of things. It also connects to the COVID preference where people want more space, and lower price per square foot. They want more private outdoor space, usually studios have limited private outdoor space. So, yeah there's no question that studios are impacted more than the other unit types, if that answers your question.\nHaendel St. Juste: Certainly, but also curious, if there's been any incremental move certainly the idea that we're looking for some proven in the second group, it's curious when you start to see any at all on that more challenged piece of the portfolio?\nJohn Burkart: Fair enough. We're doing a little bit better, but we're also doing everything we can to figure out the best way to market those units, whether they be as a second office, or whether it be in different discount prices. So, yes, there's a little bit more incremental demand. In context, I would say that it's a balanced picture, because we're working very aggressively to figure out how to market those. And what I would say is, the decline has stopped. There was a noted decline that occurred in the spring on studio, they occupancy. That stopped, it flattened out, and we're now improving a little bit. But again, I think there's other factors involved.\nHaendel St. Juste: Fair enough. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: There are no further questions. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks.\nMichael Schall: Very good. Thank you, operator. And thank you everyone for joining the call today. Hopefully, we'll have a chance to meet with many of you at the upcoming day week in November. Stay safe out there. Thanks for joining us. Good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Schall",
            "content": "Thank you for joining the call today. Once again, we would like to offer our best wishes to all of those impacted by COVID-19. On today's call, John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments and Adam Berry is here for Q&A. Our results continued to be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including extraordinary local and state government responses. Our reported results for Q3 reflect these unprecedented challenges, resulting in a 6% decline in core FFO and 6.7% lower same property revenues. Despite a variety of challenges, we were mostly successful in our goal of maintaining occupancy and rental rates to the extent possible, which John Burkart will discuss in a moment. Our first priority continues to be the safety of our employees and residents while deploying technology throughout our portfolio, given a strong consumer preference for touchless interaction. Regulatory hurdles have been pervasive across our markets, creating a new level of complexity and administration for our property teams. As can be seen on Page F16 of our supplemental package, California has developed a four-tier system applied to each county for determining the severity of COVID-19 restrictions. Fortunately, recent changes have been mostly moving Essex markets into less restrictive tiers. San Francisco recently reached the least restrictive yellow tier for allowing offices and indoor dining to reopen, among other improvements. Similar positive changes have occurred across several of our markets in recent weeks which represent welcome news for local businesses and residents. We have previously noted that the apartment business closely follows local housing supply and demand trends and seasonal patterns. Given the pandemic, these normal seasonal patterns were disrupted by massive job losses resulting from the pandemic and related shelter-in-place orders. In April, year-over-year, job losses were 13.7%, followed by a solid job growth in May and June. Job gains then moderated again this summer as shelter-in-place orders were extended upon a surge of COVID-19 cases. By September, job losses in Essex markets were still down 8.7% year-over-year, a positive trend from April but still lagging the 6.4% national average job loss. For perspective in the financial crisis, peak to trough U.S. job losses were 9.1 million over 20 months. This year, the nation lost 20.8 million jobs in just two months. We attribute the greater job loss and slower economic recovery in California and Washington to very restrictive shelter-in-place mandates. We see the recovery path ahead as reversing the job losses in the cities and industries that suffered the greatest impact from the shutdown. Tourism, travel, leisure and hospitality sectors were among the hardest hit and they are concentrated in the urban core of various cities. The restaurant industry provides a good example. Using the open table data as of last week, the number of dining reservations in Los Angeles fell by 66% compared to one year ago, while Seattle and San Francisco both declined 78%. This compares to other large cities like Miami, Denver, Dallas and Atlanta, with only 30% to 40% declines. Similarly, employment in hotels, live entertainment, and local transportation activities are down 37% to 50%. And they should have a strong recovery as cities reopen. In Southern California, the TV and film industry is a significant wealth creator and it was decimated by COVID restrictions. In the third quarter, the number of shoot days began to recover from near shut down but remained down 54% year-over-year. The industry is now trending in the right direction and production permits has steadily increased since June, suggesting employment will continue to rise. Younger workers have faced many challenges in the pandemic, including greater job loss and higher unemployment rates compared to more experienced workers. Employers often delayed hiring and reduce the number of job openings during the pandemic as offices and small businesses closed from shelter-in-place orders. Many college graduates chose to move home rather than relocate in proximity to their new employer as a result of work from home flexibility. As a result of these conditions, the share of 18 to 29-year olds living with a parent increased to 52% this summer, up 500 basis points year-over-year and the highest level in over 100 years. The combination of lower immigration from new graduates and higher out migration from young singles has played out in different ways across our market. We have seen pockets of strength in Ventura, Orange County, San Diego, and outer suburban markets in Seattle in Northern California. By contrast, our urban and tech centric sub markets are deeply discounted to attract residents. Meanwhile, tech companies are speaking with their pocketbooks, companies, including Google, Facebook and Amazon continue to expand their real estate footprint in our markets. Notably, Facebook's expanded campus in Menlo Park, and their acquisition of our REI new headquarters in Bellevue, Google's continued plans for urban village in San Jose, and Amazon's continued growth in Bellevue and other sub markets in the Seattle area. As always, we continue to monitor the pace of job openings amongst the top 10 tech employers in our market. And while these numbers are down year-over-year, we are encouraged by recent increases in openings from 9 of the 10 companies in our survey. While today's 17,000 openings are significantly lower compared to the pre-COVID period, today's level is consistent with the pace of hiring they experienced in 2016 and 2017. It appears that the most successful tech companies in the world remain committed to our markets, and most of them have announced work - return to office plans in 2021. Turning to our initial thoughts about 2021, we plan to provide annual guidance as part of our fourth quarter earnings report. There are many moving parts to the guidance discussion, including the impact of the winter's Coronavirus trajectory, the timing of vaccines and improved therapeutics and any new government stimulus measures. With that said, we base our modeling on the consensus of third-party economists for next year's GDP growth, which is currently around 3.7% and compares to this year's minus 3.6%. If that proves accurate, we would expect to benefit from positive tailwind in the form of steady employment growth and rising consumer confidence. In addition to the boost from an improving job outlook, the potential for a COVID vaccine to become widely available next year is an obvious positive that would reduce the need for social distancing and shift the work from home dynamic from a requirement to a lifestyle decision to come to several negative such as potential pay reductions for remote workers, lack of face-to-face collaboration and networking, and potentially fewer career advancement opportunities. Finally, with respect to our year-over-year growth trajectory next year, we would expect to hit an inflection point, during the second quarter as we anniversary the steep COVID related declines. This could set the stage for gradual improvement in rental growth in the back half of 2021. Again, assuming further easing of COVID related restrictions. Our data and analytics team completes its own fundamental research on supply, indicating around 33,000 apartments supply deliveries in 2021, which is similar to 2020. While that continues to represent just below 1% of our apartment stock is still too much supply until the pace of job growth accelerates further. As with the past several years, the 2021 apartment supply estimates from third-party research providers are well in excess of our expectations, implying a ramp up of deliveries that we do not believe is feasible, given skilled labor constraints within the construction industry in our markets. Turning to the apartment investment markets, we have now sold four apartment properties with a total of 670 apartment homes for $343 million, all of which were placed under contracts subsequent to the implementation of shelter in place orders in March. Given the wide discount and valuation for public rates compared to the private real estate markets, we continue to market additional properties with the goal of funding at a minimum all of our investment needs through dispositions. Other than the AIMCO sales that were part of its announced reorganization, very few sizable apartment transactions occurred during the quarter. Generally, the number of properties being marketed has been extremely limited since March and is now slowly increasing. Therefore it remains too soon to draw conclusions about cap rates going forward. In the suburbs where rents have remained relatively stable since the start of the pandemic, cap rates and property value should not change materially compared to the pre-pandemic period. In those suburban areas, we expect high quality properties to sale in the low-to-mid 4% range in terms of cap rates. Given significant concessions in hard hit cities, recent price talk around possible sales indicate a 5% to 10% discount to pre COVID valuations, with a few sales that we've seen in these markets assuming a fairly rapid rent recovery. As with previous recessions, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have continued to provide very attractive financing with 7-year fixed rate financing in the mid-2% range. Significant positive leverage and active sources of debt significantly limits the amount of distress of the markets. Finally, I'll end with a brief comment related to California Prop 21. Including the extraordinary opposition effort coordinated by the Californian's Responsible Housing Group, I would like to commend the leadership of this group including RM, John Eudy for their unrelenting focus its steadfast effort in opposing this flawed proposal. Prop 21 would surely make housing shortages worse in California. The No on 21 Campaign has assembled an amazing constituency consisting of hundreds of organizations, including Veterans Groups, Affordable Housing Advocates, the California NAACP, the State Chamber of Commerce, and scores of others along with Governor Newsom. Almost every newspaper in California supports defeating Prop 21. We all greatly appreciate your effort. And now, I'll turn the call over to John Burkart. So let me see if I can give you some more information. I may not give you everything there, but let me give you some more information. Number one, on that note, it shows that the market rents the decline in market rents has improved. And that is true. But the fact is last year, we had an easier comp. So I want to make sure we have the context, whenever you know, it's always a challenge with transparency, giving out more information and then not having all the context. So there's a little bit of a headache when it shows how the October rents have improved year-over-year. But that said, our markets are doing well and across the board and showing signs of stabilization or they're actually improving. So I want to make sure we get the right message across as we get to a read and further, you'll see that number reverses a little bit. I don't want people thinking, oh, now things are getting worse. It's not the case, it's just the year-over-year comp. But as we get into what's happening in October, as far as for concessions go, we have - we started the October reducing concessions. And this is off of a Q3, which is over 75% of our transactions had concessions of roughly a month. And then we moved into October the first couple of weeks, and we were at less than 50%. And then as we move into the second half of October, we're actually now at less than 25%. So we're doing that while maintaining occupancy or improving occupancy and while maintaining low availability. So, all those pieces are going in the right direction at Essex. Again, we don't - we're not in the market, we're part of the market, but we're performing very well within that marketplace. When we look at the break between renewals and new leases, there's definitely more leasing incentives on the new leases typically running 3.3% is what we have in there was accurate. On the renewals, it's usually less than a week. Obviously, there's less of an incentive, this is already - people already in the property. Does that answer your question, Nick? Yeah, Nick, those are great questions. And I guess I would start with the latter point you made which is the disconnect between public real estate markets and private real estate markets and trying to monetize that difference. And as Angela stated, we paused a bit in the quarter when the COVID cases were increasing. And it's interesting. We think that's just an obvious benefit for operating the machine in forward direction. We are issuing stock and incurring debt and buying property at a positive differential or arbitrage. And we think that that works pretty well in reverse direction as well. So I'd say that is an obvious way to add value, add NAV per share, add FFO share to the company given the current dislocation. I'd also mention that when we look at the amount of job loss we've had, the rent growth, or the rent reductions that we've seen are really I guess, I would say to be expected. And I know everyone is focused on this work from home issue. But if you just look at LA jobs still as of September down 9.6%, San Francisco down 10% and Oakland down 11%and largely driven by things that will - a big portion of them will come back. Like for example, the tourism, restaurants, hotels, the motion picture business in Southern California. Those are the tech industries. But there's nothing fundamentally wrong with them. And I think that most of the rental revenue loss that we've incurred is just a directly attributable to job growth. And so, I think that this will unwind itself and it's already started to unwind itself as Mr. Burkart just outlined in numbers that are slowly getting better or still, I would say in a pretty tough spot with respect to employment, we need that to recover. But the balance sheet is incredibly well positioned. And we do have some ways to add value to the company. And so we see opportunity there. So I guess that's how it answers your question. Thank you. Yeah, hey again, it's a great question, Jeff. Thanks for joining the call. I guess our thesis is that the hybrid model will likely prevail. And many of the jobs that are in the cities require a physical presence, I would make that point, virtually everything that connects with a customer, from hotels, to restaurants, to bars, et cetera, the motion picture industry where it is pretty hard to film without people being present, et cetera. And so, we see that as probably it's too much focus on, let's say, the tech community, and not enough focused on the number of jobs that are required to actually physically be there to do your job. But, I guess, and thinking about this, and in looking at what others have said, it's pretty interesting. There's obviously a big debate out there. And, the Netflix CEO, for example, said, he doesn't see any positives from working from home. And another CEO, the Zillow CEO says, the easy decision - the easy part of the process of working from home is making the decision, the hard part is actually implementing it. And I think what he means by that is, there are some pretty serious issues that come along with work from home, that are going to take a lot of time and effort to work out. And I would mention, let's say potential for less pay to the employees, how does the compensation issue work out. The productivity issues, how do you continue a culture of collaboration and a vibrant culture when people don't see each other? And I think, it's we found we're largely remote at this point in time, we've found that it's pretty difficult to resolve significant business problems where senior executives have different perspectives on things, when in a work from home type of environment, you're much better off together. So, again, we are thinking that the hybrid model is probably be going to be the main path going forward. The hybrid model will have required some tethering to an office at some point in time to try to keep those collaboration and the vibrancy and the culture together. And so, we still see ourselves has been pretty well position. So, someone may not live in a city, let's say, but we'll live somewhere, potentially nearby, certainly within driving distance. And we don't see that as a bad thing. We have properties in fact, most of our properties are actually out in suburbia. And so, we think we're well positioned for that. And by the way, the other key point here is, we're not producing a lot of housing, and there's not going to be a lot of housing produced out there. So already, as John said earlier, already, we're starting to see rents increase now in suburbia as that dynamic plays out. And they're reducing in the cities and the areas that have previously had higher rents. And so, the market is compensating for all of these issues, as it always does and the decision a renter might have made six months ago, can be very different from the decisions that they're making today. So, net-net we think we're very well positioned and again, we have properties throughout these markets and throughout the commutable locations near the job centers, and we think that's still the right strategy. Yes, it's - Jeff, it's hard to do. I mean, we in our September presentation, we gave out the dates for office re-openings of some of the top 10 tech companies, but the reality is that they are moving back to some degree, as if there's another phase of or surge of COVID cases, maybe those get pushed back. It appears and looking at, there was a recent Microsoft announcement that gave greater work from home flexibility, etcetera. But I guess, from our perspective, most of the top 10 tech companies have worked via return to work dates out there. And I think that's significant. Because if they were going - all of them were going a 100% work from home as a couple of smaller tech companies are doing, that would be one thing. But most of them have returned to work dates. And even if they get pushed back a little bit, I guess the significance here is, as long as they ultimately are going back to the office as in some way or another, I think that will solidify the connection to the office. And either way, no one's going to pick up the apple spaceship and move it somewhere else. So, it's there for a reason, there are a lot of services there, including daycare and all kinds of things. And it's meant it's there for a reason. And I don't think that that motivation goes away anytime soon. I guess, you're back to the top 10 tech companies in the job outlook, those are data that we take off their websites, and do our own survey, and have tracked what they're doing for many years, because they're so important to our mission. And they, as I said, they're off their peak, which was actually in March of this year by a reasonable amount. I think, looks like somewhere around 27,000 jobs in March open for the top 10 tech companies down to about 17,000 - about 18,000 is the most recent number. And but, now starting to move back in the other direction. So, it looks like that is starting to get better, not worse. Thank you. Yes, Rich. Hey, you know what I got to say, I greatly appreciate the work that Evercore ISI has done on this issue on the COVID tracking, etcetera it's been fantastic. And we all use it. So, thanks for that. I think that California has been super conservative when it comes to dealing with COVID. And as I said in my prepared remark that means that it accomplished two things at once, it really curtailed the number of the case spread throughout California. And at the same time, it muted our recovery very significantly. So, we're now I think, at a place in California where things are actually in pretty good order. Not that it can't change, and I believe that what will happen is the state will be very vigilant in terms of pushing us back into a more restrictive tier if they have to. But I think as we sit here today, I think we're in a better spot than some of the areas that have been more open, and have let their economy flow more freely. So, we'll take this on a day by day basis. But we look - it looks like California and Washington are actually very well positioned. And I don't think that you would see this, with the chart on Page S16, I don't think you would see this pretty significant movement to reopen the economy, if that wasn't the case. And hey, John. This is Mike. In our September presentation that's on the internet, there actually is a - there's a chart that describes exactly what John shows you, which is the change in asking rents by Walk Scores on Page 21 of that presentation. So hopefully that'll help. And if you have any follow up questions, give us a call. Hey Rich, this is Mike. Yeah, let me just add one additional item to that. And that is, normally this time of year, we feel pretty good about giving guidance for the next year. And as john said, we don't this year largely because of the COVID uncertainty or unknowns that we talked about in the opening script. It's just, the world can change so rapidly, and for the better or for the worse and it's not - it's things that are completely outside of our purview of understanding. So, we regret not giving our normal guidance on Page S16 for next year. And but we just can't or they're just too many unknowns. One thing that we're focused on and it's so important on Page S9 of the supplement, our average monthly rental rate is down 40 basis points, and we're trying to hold occupancy, we're trying to hold rate. And if we can do that with, again with jobs still down 8.7% on average, and down 11% in Oakland and 10% in San Francisco, trying to hold rate while we have that much job loss, worse than the financial crisis, I think is an amazing piece. So that's what we're trying to do. And we remain both. Hey, John, one quick comment. This is Mike. Just one quick follow up with to what John said. Generally, nothing great happens in the fourth quarter, because hiring which is also affected by COVID. But generally, in Q4, companies just wait until Q1 when they have new budgets and business plans, in order to regain resume hiring activity. So you end up with sort of the worst of both worlds. You end up with less hiring, and of course, the supply deliveries keep coming. So keep in mind that that dynamic is definitely is probably greater this quarter, given the pandemic related issues than it has been in the past. So, really, I think we need to get into the New Year before we have really a great sense of what direction we're going to be going in. Yeah, Austin, this is Mike. And John alluded to some of this a minute ago, when he was talking about the October movement of other Northern California markets back into San Francisco and Oakland doubling from the previous numbers. So that definitely there is a there is movement. And largely, it's because of the price differentials. We've discounted now so much in the cities, that they are a relative value compared to the suburban areas. And suburban areas rents is more recently have actually increased, which again, as long as their price differential continues to expand between the cities and the suburban areas, you're going to see more people moving back in. So we think this is just the normal operation of the markets and compensating for find the rent that sells the units in the marketplace. And so, most people don't focus on that relationship of what rents are doing in the suburban markets versus the urban markets, the reality is it very much affects consumer choice. And so now more people are choosing to live in the cities at a lower price point. Yes, this is Mike. Actually, I would say the pressure on costs are - have increased in COVID. As you can imagine, we had a relatively small collection department, it's now much larger. As you can imagine, selling and changing price and strategy is much more complicated now. So I'd say the business - in terms of operating the business, it's more complicated. But as noted in our - again our September presentation, there are some bright things that are happening. And one of them involves technology, where we said that technology will probably lead to a 100 to 200 basis points improvement in margin overtime. And as I said in my prepared remarks that the consumer has accepted technology actually prefers technology given COVID. And that has allowed us to move pretty strongly into deployment of various different types of technologies. And so there is definitely promise there for reduced cost. And I'm sorry, what was the second part of your question? Yeah. If we can come to believe that advocating for good housing policies in California is something that we're going to do, we're going to be activated, we're going to spend a lot of time and some money doing it. We think that overall, it makes sense to do that, because it's pretty hard to find what we have here. The combination of supply constraints and very vibrant businesses that are growing rapidly, and which is really what drives rents. It forms this virtual cycle of rents push up, wages and then wages allow higher rents, and you will find that in very few markets. So, we do have a process involved in our strategic planning activities that look at other markets that are similar to the West Coast. We don't think any of them are quite as good as the West Coast. But we continue to look at it, obviously, we're just interested in one thing, we're interested in adding value for shareholders and growing the company. And so, if we see the right set of conditions, we would be compelled to take a hard look at it. Well I guess this is the moment that I would say, I'm glad I'm not an office company, because I agree with what you're saying. Definitely, there's plenty of lease space out there. Although, the vacancy rates that I have don't show huge increases this quarter versus last quarter, but obviously, these things take time to play out. And I guess I'd be cautious to say that, it seems like things are changing rapidly. And, but I still think that we should take some time to wait and see what happens, because, right now, on the work from home thing, again, as noted in the script, it's a pretty much a mandatory thing right now, as opposed to a life's choice that it will be sort of in a post COVID period. So, I think there's a lot of change just being forced upon us. Again, we believe in the hybrid model and we think that that's what will take place going forward. And in fact, we think we'll adopt that model as a company as well, because there are definitely some benefits to it. But at the same time, I'm hyper focused on the culture here and the vibrancy of the company as we all are, everyone in this room is. And, that is critically important to us. I just don't see how you maintain that via whist exclusively and work from home type of format. So, I don't know what's going to happen exactly with these things. But again, I think there's good reason and a lot of issues that need to be resolved on the work from home model, for it to be successful and no doubt there will be some bumps in the road. So, as long as those employees remain within the major metros, I think that we're in good shape. And, they may not we may not get the rent growth in San Francisco, but we will get it out into in the suburban markets. And we'll continue to do pretty well, I think. This is Mike. It's hard to tell. I mean, this year given lower revenue, which is not a good thing, we have plenty of room in terms of taxable income to sell some properties and not have a REIT or dividend issue. So, but it will vary from year to year. And they're already given the Prop 13, they're already - it's already a headwind in selling some of our California properties as well. So, it's hard to tell. That's more of a hypothetical question that it depends on the circumstances and what we see going forward. So it's a difficult one to answer. Yeah Haendel, it's a good question. Actually there's a bunch of cities that you can put in that category. They're smaller metros; Boise would be another good example. But there are others as well. I guess, from our perspective, we want to see enough liquidity in the market from an investment perspective, enough local buyers and sellers to create a pretty strong market. And that's one of the issues in each of those markets. The other issue is relatively inexpensive, single family homes. And I think everyone should be very careful with this, about this point in the cycle, because we're starting to see rapid increases in single family home prices. And as soon as you get to a level where, it's more attractive to buy a home than it is to rent an apartment, those markets tend to get hit pretty hard. So, this is why the supply constraints we measure very broadly to include how all types of housing and for sale as well as rental housing, because we've learned that lesson before. We were once upon a time in the city of Portland, another good example of this, although it's a bigger metro than Salt Lake City in Boise. But in the city of Portland, we made some investments based on an urban growth boundary that surrounded Portland that limited the amount of housing production. And we exited Portland actually, because they expanded their urban growth boundary to allow for the production of 10,000 single family homes that are relatively inexpensive price, which made our apartments much less attractive in the overall Housing Choice that were available to consumers. So, I hear that, we like those markets are growing very rapidly. There's definitely money to be made, but there's definitely a higher risk associated with them. Very good. Thank you, operator. And thank you everyone for joining the call today. Hopefully, we'll have a chance to meet with many of you at the upcoming day week in November. Stay safe out there. Thanks for joining us. Good day."

            "name": "Angela Kleiman",
            "content": "Thank you, John. I'll start with a few comments on our third quarter results, followed by an update on capital markets and funding activities. As noted in our earnings release, and early on, this was a challenging quarter with declines of both same property revenues and core FFO per share. The 6.7% decline in same property revenue growth is primarily driven by concessions and delinquencies. We report concessions on a cash basis in our same property results. Because we believe this approach provides a true picture of current market conditions. The cash impact of concessions was 500 basis points. So, excluding this, our same property revenue decline would have been 1.7% instead of 6.7%. Conversely, on our consolidated financials, with straight line concessions in accordance with gap in calculating core and total FFO. Keep in mind that when concessions abate, our approach will impact the future performance in two ways. First, our year-over-year comparison unstained dollar revenue growth will be favorable. Second, the opposite effect will occur on our FFO growth because there will be a headwind as we continue to straight line concessions over the life of the lease. Onto delinquency, we are encouraged to see total delinquencies declined during the third quarter relative to the second quarter. On the other hand, given the current environment and related uncertainties, we maintain the same approach as last quarter and reserved against 75% of our delinquencies with third quarter. This may prove conservative is California law allows us a clear path to collection of COVID-19 related delinquencies as temporarily provided in AB-3088. The negative impact from our delinquency reserve to same property revenue and core FFO growth was 1.6% and 4%, respectively. Please see the bottom of Page two of our press release and S-15 in our supplemental for additional details. Turning to capital markets. In August, when interest rates dropped down to a level close to the 52-week low, we opportunistically issued 600 million of bonds, consisting of two $300 million tranches, an 11-year and a 30-year maturity at an effective yield of 1.75% and 2.67% respectively. The yield on our 30-year bond was the lowest on record of any Triple B plus rated issuer at that time. Since then, we have repaid a $300 million bond, that's mature in 2022 and have plans to pay up all remaining 2021 maturities at par. The net result is a very low risk maturity schedule for the next two years, was only a $350 million term loan to repay in 2022. As for funding plan for investments in the stock buyback, our structural finance investments are funded by the redemption and our development commitments is less than $73 million over the next two years. Incidentally, because the pandemic has caused delays in development deliveries, our development NOI for the next year will be lower than we expected. Because we are not as far along in our lease offs as we had originally planned. On the stock buyback year-to-date we have repurchased around a million shares at an average price of about $226 per share. We have match funded the stock repurchased with $343 million of property sales, which is comparable to our pre-COVID consensus NAV of close to $290 per share. While we have been opportunistic in arbitraging the compelling discount between our public and private NAV, we paused our share repurchases when COVID-19 caseloads and hospitalizations 32 summer and severe shelter in place orders were issued. Even though we have transacted on a leveraged neutral basis and have reduced our net debt, selling assets also reduces EBITDA. Accordingly, we continue to be mindful of the impact and the debt-to-EBITDA of the impact on adjusted EBITDA ratio in the context of our stock buyback strategy. In summary with minimal near-term funding needs, nothing drawn on our line of credit, and approximately $1.7 billion in total liquidity, our balance sheet remains strong. And we continue to have the flexibility to be opportunistic, while maintaining our disciplined approach to capital allocation. Thank you, and I will now turn the call back to the operator for question. Yes, I think, Nick, if you look at how we manage our capital allocations, we're not really going to deviate too much from that plan. And so, the key commentary I have is really to make sure that we also at the same time preserve our debt-to-EBITDA ratio. And so, it'll be a little bit of all of the above what are we selling? And what price and what's the impact on the EBITDA reduction? At the same time, what are our opportunities to reinvest the sale proceeds? So there - if we have more preferred equity for example, then that certainly will be an important piece. And of course, the other piece is where the stock is trading, right. And so, it's all of these things I guess, that factored in. Hey Haendel, it's Angela. Sure, I see a $19 million increase. I have on the property levels... As in to 19, you know what I'll have to get back to you because when I look at our S2 from quarter to quarter, second quarter to third quarter, a growth from $5 million to $6.3 million. So, it's one that is being [indiscernible] Yeah, where are you looking? Okay. No, it's - And that is straight line rent. I think that's where you're looking at line rent. Yeah, it's straight on rental and commercial - on commercial. I think that's what it is. But we'll follow up with you. But I think that's what that is."

            "content": "Sure, Neil this is Adam. So, we've definitely seen, we're still very active in the market and have seen more, there is ample debt out there for stabilized assets. But underwriting has definitely has been more challenging for some sponsors. So, we are seeing more and more opportunities on the stabilized side. And you saw the one that we just funded this quarter, and probably a couple more in the pipeline coming down. Hey, Alexander, this is Adam. So I think, to Mike's comment in the earlier script, the 5% to 10% discount that he was talking about was more urban core markets. We've actually seen valuations on suburban assets be at or above pre-COVID levels. You're right. And that volume has definitely been off of what it historically is. That being said, we're constantly in the market talking to potential buyers on potential dispositions. And there are enough out there that the market is being met, I'd say at that kind of at or above pre-COVID pricing. But just as an example, the deal we just sold in Glendale this week, that sold on pre-COVID pricing, or pre-COVID rents at about a 3A cap and that was about 4%, above our pre-COVID value. Cap on concessions and you're in the low-3s. So yeah, we're still pretty confident that the spread and what Mike mentioned that 5% to 10% discount on core markets, we think that still kind of flows through despite the lack of volume. There is definitely that potential. Yes."

            "name": "John Burkart",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. I want to start by thanking the E team. Throughout this period of extreme volatility and complex regulations, they acted thoughtfully and tirelessly to serve our customers. We were successful in our objectives of building occupancy during the third quarter by using various pricing strategies, including concessions along with leveraging our technological advantage. We've significantly improved our response times in the overall customer experience. Our strategy of using upfront concessions when appropriate reduces the impact of the market dislocation on the rent roll. As noted in the table on the bottom of page 2 of our supplemental, our scheduled rents for Q3 2020 is down only 40 basis points from the prior year's quarter. This positions us favorably for revenue growth as concessions continue to abate and our year-over-year comps become a tailwind. As of mid-October, we're offering concessions of three to four weeks in less than half our portfolio compared to over 75% of the portfolio in the third quarter. No material concessions are being offered in Orleans, San Diego, Ventura, in Contra Costa County. Occupancy in these four counties currently average 97.9% with an availability of 2.5%. Like the fact that we are seeing solid signs of stabilization in many of our markets, I do want to acknowledge that we continue to hear anecdotal stories of owners who reacted slowly to delinquency and rapidly changing market conditions and are now attempting to improve their occupancy position during a seasonally slow demand period. As a result, there may be upcoming challenges in various markets. Consumer behavior related to COVID-19 including consumer preference for larger units, private outdoor space, stairs instead of elevators and communities within commuting distance to employment hubs, yet located in proximity to outdoor recreation amenities continues to impact demand in the marketplace. Turning to our Q3 2020 results as presented on Page 2 of our press release, year-over-year revenues declined by 6.7%. While the year-over-year revenue growth continues to decline due to the change in the rental market post-COVID, the improvement in the sequential revenue decline is consistent with the signs of stability that we're seeing in the market. Although we're not currently giving guidance, I want to remind everyone that the combination of a very tough occupancy comp of 97.1 from Q4 of last year and the fact that lease transactions on average are below last year, it is likely that our year-over-year fourth quarter revenue growth will decline from Q3. Turnover in the quarter increased 73 basis points from the prior year's quarter. Communities with certain attributes were the key contributors in this increased turnover, specifically high rises, communities with markets with a greater demographic of college students and Silicon Valley contracts and consultants. On the regulatory front, various governmental bodies have enacted anti eviction and other resident protection. California recently passed AB 3088, which is a positive step toward replacing the patchwork of local ordinances to COVID-19 related delinquency. Impart AB 3088 prohibits eviction for nonpayment of rent between March 1 and August 31 of this year, establishes a minimum future payment threshold to protect against future eviction and establishes access to small claims courts to pursue collection of past due rent. Washington State has similar regulations expiring at the end of this year. While we continue to see many residents paying down prior balances, we also continue to work with our residents on solving delinquency issues. Lastly, expenses in the quarter were negatively impacted by increased property taxes in the Seattle market, and COVID-19 related impacts such as PPE, and higher utilities driven by increased usage from residence for home for longer periods of time. Utility increases in Q3 were offset by year-over-year reduction of 12% in electricity costs, as a result of the various green initiatives we have executed. Turning to our markets, in the Seattle market year-over-year revenues in Q3 were down 1.6%, while year-over-year occupancy for the period was flat. The greatest declines continue to be in Seattle CBD where revenues declined 5.6% followed by the east side with a 1.1% decline. Revenues in the south and north sub markets saw increases of 30 and 60 basis points respectively for the same period. Seattle job growth in Q3 declined 8.1% year-over-year. However, Washington unemployment in August remained 60 basis points while the U.S. average of 7.7. It's worth noting that Seattle home purchasing activity increased during the third quarter. On a trailing three-month average from August, year-over-year home prices were up 12% in August. In August alone, home prices were up 17.4% on a year-over-year basis. Moving to Northern California, in the Bay Area market year-over-year revenues in Q3 were down 8.5%. Occupancy for the period was 96.2 a year-over-year increase of 30 basis points. Oakland CBD in San Francisco continue to be our most challenged sub markets in Q3 with year-over-year revenue declines of 16.5% to 17.1% respectively, compared to San Jose, where revenue declined 7.2%. In the same period, Contra Costa saw the decline of 4.6%, however, sequential revenues in this sub market increased by 1.6% from Q2. Bay Area job growth declined 9.7% year-over-year in Q3, mainly driven by job losses in leisure and hospitality and trade, transportation and utilities, all heavily impacted by the state's required shutdown. However, there are positive signs of growth in the market. Several Bay Area tech companies filed for IPO during the third quarter, including McAfee, Airbnb, Snowflake and Unity Software. In addition, Google unveiled their plans for a 1.3 million square foot tech village in Mountain View. This new development will have a capacity problem of 6,000 additional employees. Carry home purchase activity picked up during the third quarter on a trailing three-month average from August. Year-over-year home prices in the Bay Area were up as much as 8.6%. In August alone, San Jose market home prices were up 20% year-over-year while San Francisco and Oakland were up 14% for the same period. The increases in home prices makes the transition from renting to homeownership even more difficult, and it shows the continued long-term demand for housing in our markets. Then in Southern California, year-over-year revenues in the third quarter declined 7.3% while occupancy declined only 20 basis points. The LA market continues to be a challenge. In Q3, our West LA sub markets saw the greatest year-over-year decline of 16% while our remaining LA sub markets declined between 9.1% and 12%. LA job growth was minus 9.7% in the same period, while unemployment remained the highest of our markets at 15% in August. In Orange County, Q3 year-over-year job growth declined 10.8% while revenues declined 2.6% and occupancy increased 1.4% in the same period. I do want to note that quarterly sequential revenues in our Orange County sub markets actually increased by 1.9% in Q3. Finally in San Diego, our year-over-year revenues declined 2.1% in Q3. The Oceanside sub market however continued to grow revenues by 2.3% in the same period. San Diego job growth declined by 8.9% for the period. Currently our same store physical occupancy is 96.4%. Our availability 30-days out is at 4.5%. And our fourth quarter renewals are being sent out with no increase. Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Angela Kleiman. Yeah, okay. So, overall, delinquencies are definitely improving. And you can obviously see that from Q3 versus Q2, there are some underlying trends there that occur. And so what's happening is, we are collecting a little bit more in prior delinquencies which is a good thing. Again, I've said all along, we're working with all of our residents. And the great, great, great majority are showing very good behavior. So we are getting a little bit more on the current month's delinquency, is a slight uptick. It kind of ties in with the reduction of the federal aid, but it's really not that material overall. Again, the pitcher delinquency is improving. And so my expectation as we move forward, we continue to have the economy opening up. Although, we still have negative year-over-year job comps, they're getting better and better. And so if on a local level, we actually had seasonal job comps, they would actually show seasonal growth. So things are actually improving out here and my expectation is that delinquency will continue to improve as we move forward. As it relates to utilities or any other line item, they're really running a similar path to the rental delinquencies. If the people who are unable to pay rent are really not paying delinquencies but, yeah there's not paying all of it. So or they're paying a percentage, but the percentage is type of thing. So it's a very parallel path, if that makes sense. Sure, yeah, no that's actually very good overall. I mean, going into this part of the season, Essex as a general rule, we like to have higher occupancy and lower availability going into the season where there's a decline in demand season like and sitting at 4.5% right now availability is a good spot. It's consistent with where we've been in the last several years, the team has worked very hard to meet the market, and very interactive trying to understand what the consumer wants, and off of that and leased our units up and get quality paying tenants. And I think they've done a terrific job, you can see it in our higher occupancy even into October that 96.6. I mean, that's just really, really doggone good. Now, again, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, in Q4 of last year, we were at 97.1, the market was very, very strong. And so we still have some headwinds. But in context, I think the whole portfolio is doing very well, if either signs of strength in some markets like Ventura, Contra Costa, Orange, and San Diego, or we see good signs of stabilization in many other markets. Or I'll mention, say, in San Francisco and Oakland, for example we see the beginnings of this backfill, that's starting to happen. And we mentioned this before, how in our markets, they are desirable places to live. And so when it's really a value proposition, so when the price gets to the right point, consumers make changes. And so what we're starting to see now, from January through September, the average was about 6% move ins came from the outlying areas, and this is far off commuting places, like say Antioch that we're moving into the Oakland area, and or San Francisco. And the numbers vary, but they're fairly close to that 6%, average all the way through pre-COVID, post COVID, all the way through. And now in October, that number jumped to 14%, literally just jumped. And you look and you say okay, what's going on there, I would say this is the super commuters, the people that they're tethered, as Mike said to the employers. Employers are opening up, and they're looking and saying, I have now my value proposition is to move into San Francisco, move into Oakland, and at a lower price point, avoid that commute. This is a great deal. It works for me. And we're starting to see that. That's a real deal thing that actually happened. So, when I look across our markets, again, I get the strength in certain markets. I get the stability in others and I get the very positive signs in the most challenged places like San Francisco and downtown Oakland. Well, I guess I'm going to look at effective that one month is 8%. Right. And so if we go three weeks, or three quarters, it adds about 6% off of our lease rates, and that would be one way to look at it to get down to that number. But the reason why I'm not going there is I think it's a little bit misleading, to be honest. I mean, we tend to get into this almost bond mentality of doing a calculation and if we did that, I would have gone back in the last several months at GE rent spell this huge amount net effective. And today I would be saying, oh my gosh, rents have moved up this huge amount because concessions are abating. And I think both of those can be a little bit misleading. As Mike has said, for years, concessions can come into the market and go out rather rapidly. We've used them as a tool to increase occupancy as leasing incentives, and to much lesser extent as in renewals. And so my preference in this case is to really look at it and say, okay, what's going on with our street rents, or market rents or coupon rents and then concessions, where they add? They came into the market in a really big way in June. We use them to increase occupancy pretty dramatically, that's worked. The concessions are abating, we're pulling them back. And I think that's the bigger story. But if you get lost in the net effective rents I'd say, you'll have to go all the way back and say they sell a lot. And now they're increasing. And I think - I don't think that's the best way to look at it. It's typically 12-month lease. And yes, if you try to get to net effective again, as I said, you just take the concession amount and say okay, if it's a month, it's 8%. And you'd make that adjustment. So I mean, that's the simplistic way to get there. But again, I just don't think that's the best way to look at what's happening in the marketplace right now. Well. I don't have the details of the breakdown with that. But I will tell you as it relates to performance, transit oriented is really not what's driving anything right now. It's basically a lot of people aren't taking the transit. So they're not on bar and they're not on caltrain. If they're commuting, they're on the road. We've seen that many different ways, but we also see that how much used cars are getting bid up, people are opting to drive. But what we do see is, again the walk-ability as I've mentioned previously, it's the higher the walk-ability typically relates to the higher the price per square foot in rents. And that if you were to look at one correlation that would be the units that are negatively impacted the most. And on the other side, is the lower dollars per square foot or lower walk-ability of the units that have benefited the most in this situation, if that makes sense. Thank you. Yeah, and wish you could ask me this in June of 2021 and we can cook for that course of positive. But, obviously, I don't know the future. What I'm trying to point out is, we do have signs of strength that a third of our portfolio is actually moving increasing occupancy rents, stability in large portions of the portfolio. We are not the market, we're a participant in it. And there's some others in the market that are trying to play catch up right now. So, I see volatility going forward. And then recognizing that seasonally, usually Q4 and Q1 are the low points, it would be hard for me to say that I would believe that Q3 is, it turns out to be a low point. But there's just volatility in Q4. A lot of pieces out there, no one knows what's going on with COVID and everything else, but we're feeling good. There are certainly things have improved from what we saw in June and July, which was tremendous amount of activity, trying to find where the market was, we found the market, where the consumers are interested. To your comment, has places in San Francisco and Oakland I brought that comment up, because we are starting to see that people from outlying areas as super commuters are now moving in that value proposition works for them. And that is a very good sign. It's going to be I call it a leading sign. So, that is a good thing. Those markets are still tough and the word acceleration gives me heartburn. But the stability, yes, strength in some other areas, certainly, we're starting to see sequential improve in those four counties that I mentioned. So, overall, I feel much better than it did last quarter, let's put it that way. Thank you. Appreciate it. I don't, I wouldn't say that I expect it to slide. I think the team is doing a phenomenal job. We are very aggressive getting data, we have proprietary data hub, and we pull all the data together. We have daily meetings, pricing and strategy meetings. And it is just an amazing team with leadership all the way through it. And so, we're meeting the market. So, we know that a unit that's vacant, does not earn any revenue and we just for years laughed at the proud and vacant concept that it just doesn't get you anywhere. So we typically are doing 12-month leases and we meet the market and try to understand it, meet it in and stay occupied. So, I don't see the occupancy declining a lot. 96.6 is high but maintaining I'd say 96 and north of 96 I think is what I would expect to see for the next couple of quarters. And then, normally as we start to get into the 3Q - 2Q and 3Q and there starts to be more turnover, that has an impact on reducing occupancy just because of the nature of the turnover. But we will continue to try to maintain higher occupancy. And I just expect there to be volatility and I brought that up, because I don't want people to be surprised by headlines from different vendors saying this is happening here and that's happening there and also thinks that the whole market is going away. There's just individual players that are really struggling right now. There are some people with lost occupancy in the third quarter, which was probably not the best strategy. And now they're trying to figure out what to do. No. I mean, it floats around. I mean, right. We're going to use them where we need them. But we have it's - again, we're meeting on a regular basis to figure this out and figure out what where the market is, and what's happening. But I'm not looking right now and expecting huge obvious weakness in one spot or another, I expect volatility. And so to that extent, what I mean by that is yeah, we'll make pricing adjustments as necessary if things pop up. But it's more like whack a mole, and then trying to maintain a good position throughout this situation. Our in place effective rents? Well, do you mean like last delays where are we at? Sure, again, most of our cuts have really been along the lines of concessions, and we've backed away from those. As we noted, our market rents are down about 5.8% in Q3 2020 over Q3 '19. So we've made adjustments down, it varies by market, obviously with San Francisco being greater and other markets much less. But the market as a whole is really hanging in there, as a general rule with the consumer has been looking for is concessions, leasing incentives, and we've continued to structure our pricing along those lines to meet the consumer where they're at. But what we've seen is that over the recent time, certainly over the summer, things were pretty intense. And then as we got into the fall, this need for concessions backed away. And the more we backed away, the more we're able to continue to maintain occupancy and low availability. So, if necessary, we'll adjust, but right now, we've already dropped our market rents by say 5.8%. Yeah, our loss to lease is like 3.6% if we look at it that way. Yeah upside down, okay. Yeah, gain to lease sorry. Gain to lease. It's like not have been use to saying that, I mean just lastly, we have gain to lease. Yeah. So as far as the tenant credit quality, no, we have not seen any decline there. It's a situation where if you have a job, you continue to maintain going forward, and then you're able to rent and if you don't, it's a terrible situation, but you're not going to become a new renter. So we haven't seen any declines there. As it relates to turnover, from that type of situation, yeah, the answer is, yeah, there are sometimes I can think of an almost a funny story where we had a resident that moved from one of our outer properties up in Seattle to downtown. They transferred within Essex. And then as the market picked up, this is after the last financial crisis, they moved back into the property that they had started with. And they're very nice person and they wanted to stay with Essex, is an Essex client. But they really did take advantage of the pricing changes. And, again, it's that value proposition that they were making personally between their commute in pricing and everything and making that decision. And that's what we do see goes on. Of course, that's the backdrop there was the rents in Seattle went up, because the economy was growing, demand was increasing because of jobs. And so, the fact that, that person moves out, it really going to impact the overall economic picture. It was a rent rising then. Sure. Hey Haendel. Where are you looking? Well, I wouldn't use the word pricing power and attach that to studios. Basically what we see and we look slice and dice at numerous different ways, but as it relates to say, just unit type, clearly, the three bedrooms have higher demand than two bedrooms than one bedroom, than studio at the bottom. Generally, what we see within the marketplace is the studios now have lower occupancy. And again, this ties back to some of my comments were when we look and see where turnover was or where there's demand issues, this is connected in part to say studies, it's also connected to Silicon Valley consultants and those types of things. It also connects to the COVID preference where people want more space, and lower price per square foot. They want more private outdoor space, usually studios have limited private outdoor space. So, yeah there's no question that studios are impacted more than the other unit types, if that answers your question. Fair enough. We're doing a little bit better, but we're also doing everything we can to figure out the best way to market those units, whether they be as a second office, or whether it be in different discount prices. So, yes, there's a little bit more incremental demand. In context, I would say that it's a balanced picture, because we're working very aggressively to figure out how to market those. And what I would say is, the decline has stopped. There was a noted decline that occurred in the spring on studio, they occupancy. That stopped, it flattened out, and we're now improving a little bit. But again, I think there's other factors involved."

Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the Company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the Company\u2019s filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you. You may begin.\nMichael Schall: Thank you for joining our call today. The unprecedented reactions from the COVID-19 pandemic have presented many challenges that have affected every part of our business and indeed our lives. We'd like to offer our best wishes to all those impacted by COVID-19 and thank you for participating on the call today. On today's call, John Burkart and Angela Kleiman, will follow me with comments and Adam Berry is here for Q&A. Our reported results for Q2 reflect these unprecedented challenges as we reported 5.1% decline in core FFO from a year ago, representing an abrupt turnaround from very favorable conditions throughout this economic cycle. Our first priority upon receiving COVID-19 related shut down orders was to ensure the safety of our employees and residents, while reacting thoughtfully to shelter-in-place restrictions and regulatory hurdles that had been especially pervasive across our markets. Unprecedented job loss from mandatory shutdown orders in March suddenly insignificantly reduced rental demand, leading to lower occupancy in April, followed by a steady recovery throughout the quarter. Ultimately occupancy fully recovered and was 96.2% in July. Delinquencies also spiked due to job losses in anti-eviction ordinances, which often contain collection forbearance provisions. Proposed regulations that could further impede collection of COVID-19 related rent receivables led us to adopt a conservative approach to bad debt. During the second quarter, the direct cost of the pandemic in the form of greater residential and commercial delinquency, lost occupancy and COVID-19 related maintenance totaled $27 million. We view these costs is mostly temporary and have seen improvement in each category second quarter. John and Angela will provide additional detail as part of their remarks. Fortunately, the economy improved quickly from its April trough as measured by resumed job growth, lower continuing unemployment claims and fewer warn notices. In addition, many businesses have found ways to adapt to the virus by creating new safety protocols and procedures. After declining nearly 14% in the Essex markets during April, by June year-over-year your job declines had moderated by almost 400 basis points to 10.1%. We expect gradual improvement to continue in the second half of the year. Turning to the West Coast markets, technology companies are a primary driver of wealth creation and growth in the Bay Area in Seattle. Most of the leading tech companies remain in a growth mode with minimal damage to their business models and many of them such as Amazon, Netflix and Zoom have benefited from the shelter-in-place restrictions, resulting in greater market share. Generally, it appears that many large tech companies have slowed their pace of growth, while allowing greater flexibility for employees to work-from-home. We track the open positions at the 10 largest public technology companies, all of which are headquartered in an Essex market. Recently, these companies had approximately 17,000 job openings in California and Washington. These large company tech jobs are down by about a third on a year-over-year basis and are now at about the same level since we saw in 2017. Many of the top tech companies including Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Salesforce are planning for employees to return to the office and have established related dates, which range from October 2022 to July 2021. This is consistent with our comments during our June NAREIT meetings, whereby we expect employees in the post-COVID era to have a greater work-from-home flexibility, while also needing to report to the office at various times to maintain team dynamics, acclimate new hires and pursue career opportunities, all of which require periodic face-to-face contact. Venture capital has continued to flow at a healthy pace according to the most recent data. However, we understand that the mix of investments is more focused on companies that have business models that are not directly impacted by COVID-19 and have lower cash burn rate. Southern California has a more diversified economy that has outperformed during previous recessionary periods. While San Diego, Orange and Ventura counties have generally continued this trend, Los Angeles County has notably underperformed. L.A.'s preliminary unemployment rate was 19.5% in June, well above the level implied by recent job losses of 12.3% on a trailing three months basis, and partially explained by the usually large number of gig and freelance workers in L.A. that are not captured by the BLS payroll survey. Filming and content production is the key contributor to jobs and wealth creation in Los Angeles, and the industry came to a temporary standstill. Film L.A. reported that the number of shoot days during the second quarter declined 98% from the prior year across television film and commercials. Despite these challenges, the demand for content is unabated amid the pandemic, and there are reasons to be optimistic. In a joint report called a Safeway Forward, various organizations including the screen actors guild have outlined the process for content production amid the pandemic, which is building production momentum. A key factor impacting all of our markets is the loss of leisure and hospitality and other services jobs, which represented from 12% to 17% of total jobs at June, 2019 in the Essex Metros. Compared to the total jobs lost in the Essex bucket this past year, these service jobs declined an average of about 30% year-over-year with the greatest declines in Seattle and San Francisco. These job losses are throughout each metro area, although the downtown locations had the greatest concentrations of affected businesses. We see the recovery path ahead as reversing the pandemic related declines we experienced this last quarter. In the near-term progress will depend on the direction of COVID infection rate and the associated governmental limitations on business activity. Given the COVID-related shutdown of film and digital content industries and its potential for value creation, its recovery is essential in Los Angeles. Fortunately, that recovery is underway with the recent restart in a production of daily TV shows such as Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune in Culver City and several soap operas produced by CBS and ABC. Necessarily crowded motion picture sets and safety mandates will probably make this a slow process. Wealthy areas create demand for restaurants, bars and other services and the related jobs contribute to housing demand, particularly in the cities. That makes service jobs systematically important to housing, and we believe that they will recover. Finally, mostly of the technology industries are in great condition and should be expected to resume greater hiring and growth. Along with unspent wealth accumulated during the pandemic, we expect the recovery of jobs to be strong as the outlook for managing the pandemic improves. In light of the unpredictable nature of the pandemic and with the recent surge in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations, the course of the pandemic and governmental responses have become intertwined with job growth and other economic outcomes. Thus, we've made the decision to withdraw our forecast on Page S-16 of the supplemental until we have better clarity on the direction of the pandemic. Finally, turning to the apartment transaction market, we sold two properties during the quarter, both of which were placed under contract in May. Pricing for both represented a small discount compared to the pre-COVID period. Both properties were in downtown San Jose, continuing the theme of the past few years of selling downtown locations that are more susceptible to added supply and a diminishing quality of life. Going forward, we expect to grow the portfolio near major employment centers that offer a better living experience. Generally, the transaction market had been slow to recover with very few closed apartment sales and even fewer properties being marketed. The industry is working through key issues in the selling process, such as travel restrictions and due diligence challenges. Given a dearth of transactions, it's too early to conclude on how buyers will value apartment properties going forward. A few closed transactions since the onset of the pandemic traded at prices at or near pre-COVID levels, suggesting that, highly motivated buyers have taken a longer view when valuing property by treating the COVID-19 specific impacts such as delinquency as a purchase price adjustment, rather than long-term reductions in NOI or higher cap rate. At quarter end, we had two additional properties under contract for sale. Both are smaller properties and one of them closed in July. Going forward, our intent is to mostly fund our growth with disposition proceeds. We announced one new development deal in suburban San Diego and we have a robust preferred equity pipeline. As before, plenty of money is searching for distress real estate which will be scarce with institutional-grade apartments, given extraordinarily low financing costs. As with prior recessions, the existence of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac virtually assures a source of liquidity for apartment. Yields or cap rates for apartments generally substantially exceed long-term interest rates and related debt and the resulting positive leverage remains a powerful force in the market. Unlike REIT stocks, private market values in terms of cap rates are generally sticky, meaning that they don't change immediately in reaction to events, but rather seek to reflect the longer term financial performance of a property. At the end of the day, we believe that, the transaction markets will like to recover because lower interest rates will provide sufficient incentive to offset greater perceived risk. Historically, we found opportunities to add value as markets transition and in periods of disruption. I'm confident that, we have the team, resources and strategy to thoughtfully act on these opportunities, consistent with our long-term track record of our performance. And now, I'll turn the call over to John Burkart.\nJohn Burkart: Thank you, Mike. Our priority during this period was our people, the safety of our residents and our employees. I'm incredibly proud of what our team accomplished and how they worked together to serve and support our residents through this challenging time. Thank you, E team. Looking at the second quarter of 2020, the occupancy challenges that we faced early on related to a reduction in demand when the initial stay-at-home orders were implemented as opposed to an exodus of existing residents. During May, traffic increased substantially and we took advantage of the relative strength in our market by lowering our rental rates and offering significant leasing incentive in certain markets of two to eight weeks on stabilized properties, leading to an increase in our same-store occupancy of 110 basis points in June. The relative strength in the market continued into July, enabling us to increase our asking rent, decrease our leasing incentives and add another 80 basis points in occupancy. Our availability 30 days out as of the end of July was 10 basis points lower than where it was last year at this time. As our customers adapt to the new COVID-19 environment, we are seeing some consumer behavioral changes that make intuitive set. For example, with the current work-from-home practices, the value proposition of living in downtown San Francisco has temporarily changed since the restaurant, entertainment and sports venues have shut down. Additionally, the value of having more private indoor space presume calls, high speed internet and access to open space for outdoor activities have increased demand for suburban assets despite being a greater distance from corporate offices. We have also noted that work-from-home has turned into work-from-anywhere as we've seen several consultants moving back to their original home and continuing to work for their West Coast employer. Regarding the work-from-anywhere theme, we believe this trend will reverse when conditions permit. We were all positively surprised by the ease in which we all adapted to Zoom and believe that this experience will have a lasting impact on future same-day business travel. However, the loss of a personal connection frozen screens and barking dogs in the background, so the Zoom cannot replace the value that comes from in person interaction. If I heard someone say recently, I am done with living at work. We see the changes in consumer behavior within our portfolio, our same-store portfolio in Contra Costa, Ventura, Orange and San Diego at higher occupancies today than in pre-COVID March. Turning to our Q2 \u201920 results as presented on page two of our press release, year-over-year, revenues declined by 3.8%. On delinquencies various governmental bodies have enacted and continually extend resident protection along with prohibitions against late fees and eviction. These regulations have been a strong headwind for the industry and our markets compared to other metros. Thankfully, they are temporary in nature. Referring to the S-15, delinquency for our total portfolio on a cash basis was 4.3% in the second quarter of 2020 compared to 34 basis points in the second quarter of 2019. In the month of July on a cash basis, delinquency was 2.7%, which is down from the prior month. In July, 18% of our same-store assets had positive delinquency. Meaning the delinquency line item contributed positively to the revenues due to residents paying past due amount. We appreciate that our residents continues to prioritize their rental obligation. Moving on to our operating strategy in this new environment, our operations objective continues to be focused on maximizing revenue. Given current conditions, our strategies will evolve as the market changes and will vary across our market. For example, we will likely run lower occupancy in urban markets such as downtown San Francisco while targeting higher occupancies in highly desirable suburban markets, such as San Ramon. Overall, we believe that market occupancy has fallen about 150 basis points, and our same-store portfolio is expected to run at a lower occupancy for the remainder of the year. As noted on S-15 our supplemental and consistent with our expectations, our new lease rate, excluding leasing incentives, were down 5.8% in July compared to the prior year\u2019s period. We expect that market rental rates will remain depressed in the fall due to the seasonal decline in demand. That said, some of the historical factors such as contractors moving home in the fourth quarter are not an issue since they've already moved out due the work-from-home policies in place. On to tech initiatives, we continue to make considerable progress on the technology front as our employees learn how to optimize our new tools. For example, we currently have several leasing agents that are leveraging these tools that enable them to be two to three times more productive than the average leasing agent. We are seeing similar progress with our maintenance systems as well. Our emphasis will continue to be on people first, if we try to bring everyone up to speed. However, we expect that through the increased productivity and natural attrition, we will both lower our headcount and increase our compensation to our top performers. Another advancement in our technology roadmap includes the development of our mobile leasing app that is on target for pilot at the end of this year. The app is fully integrated with our other sales tools and will fundamentally change how we interact with our prospects, providing them with a simple, seamless 24/7 mobile experience. Finally, we are now offering ultrafast internet offered by market leading fiber providers that 10% of our assets, and we expect to complete installation at another 50% of our assets by year end. The ultrafast service is in great demand in our current work-from-home environment and is expected to be a great value adds asset for our residents. Turning to our markets, in the Seattle market year-over-year revenues in Q2 was down 20 basis points and occupancy was down 1%. The greatest decline during this period was in the Seattle CBD revenues declined to 70 basis points followed by the East side with a 20 basis point decline while revenues in the South saw an increase of 10 basis points in the same period. In July, unemployment in Washington remained 90 basis points below the U.S. average of 10.7%. In the same period, Amazon's job openings remained at just over 8,000 a year-over-year decrease of about 25%. Moving to Northern California and the Bay Area market, year-over-year revenues in Q2 were down 3.4%, revenues in San Francisco open CBD declined by 6.3% and 7.8% respectively although San Jose revenues declined only 1.5% in the same period. Tennessee job growth declined the least of our markets in Q2 and was a hundred basis points below the US decline of 11.3. In Southern California year-over-year revenues in the second quarter declined 5.7% well occupancy declined 2.1%. L.A. was our hardest hit market with a year-over-year revenue decline of 8.6% in Q2. Our L.A. County sub markets have declined between 8.4% and 9.7% in the same period with the greatest decline in L.A. CBD. The L.A. economy has been the most impacted out of all our markets with an unemployment rate of 19.5%, leading to a higher delinquency rate than our other markets. In Orange County, the South Orange submarket outperformed North Orange submarket with year-over-year revenue decline of 2.6% and 5.1% respectively in the second quarter. Finally, in San Diego, year-over-year revenue declined 2% in Q2 with the exception of the Oceanside submarket, which grew revenues by 2% in the same period, likely benefiting from the military stay-in-place order through the end of June. Currently, our same-store portfolio\u2019s physical occupancy is 96%. Our availability 30 days out is at 5.5% and our third quarter renewals are being sent out with an average reduction in rate of 1.4%. Thank you. And then, we'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Angela Kleiman.\nAngela Kleiman: Thank you, John. I'll start with a few comments about the quarter followed by an update on our funding plan for investments and the balance sheet. As noted in our earnings release in earlier comments, this will be a challenging quarter with declines in both same property revenue growth and core FFO per share. The 3.8% decline in same property revenue growth is primarily driven by two key factors. First, we took a conservative approach and reserved against, approximately 75% of our delinquencies, which negatively impacted our same property revenue growth by 2.9%. This information is available in a new table at the bottom of Page 2 of our press release, along with other additional details. Second, we report concessions on the cash basis in our same property results, which reduced our growth rate by approximately 1% compared to using the straight line method. The combine negative impact to same property revenue growth from both of these accounting treatments is 3.9%. As for our core FFO per share growth, the total negative impact of delinquencies in the second quarter is 20%, without this, our core FFO per share growth would have been positive 1.5%. More details are available in a new reconciliation table on Page S-15 of the supplemental, along with additional disclosures on operations. On to operating expenses, same-store expenses increased by 6%, primarily driven by Washington property taxes, which have increased approximately 15% compared to the prior year. As you may recall, taxes in Seattle decreased by 5% in 2019, resulting in a difficult year-over-year comparison, our controllable expenses have remained generally in line with plan for the rest of the year. Turning to funding plan for investments and the stock buybacks, we are expecting to spend approximately 205 million in 2020 between our development pipeline and structural finance commitments. In addition, we have bought back 223 million of stock year-to-date, bringing total funding needs to 428 million. As for funding sources, we expect 150 million of structured finance redemptions and we closed on the sale of three assets for 284 million. In total, we have 434 million of funds available which covers all new funding obligations this year on a leverage-neutral basis. Moving onto capital markets, the finance team was very productive in the second quarter, securing a $200 million term loan, which was used to pay down all remaining 2020 debt maturities. In June, we opportunistically issued 150 million in bonds, achieving a 2.09% effective rate for 12-year CAGR and use the proceeds to pay down our line of credit. Lastly on the balance sheet, our reported net to EBITDA was 6.4 times, an increase from prior quarter primarily related to how we account for delinquency reserve. Adjusting for the impact of delinquencies, our net debt to EBITDA would have been six times. With nothing drawn on our line of credit, an approximately 1.4 billion in total liquidity, our balance sheet remains strong as we continue to maintain our discipline approach to capital allocation. Thank you and I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJeff Spector: Just looking at some of my notes from the remarks between Mike and John, on your thoughts on periodic contact at the office, first work-from-home and some of the initiatives that John laid out, I guess, just big picture. Can you clarify at least today, how you think your portfolio is positioned for what you think may be? I'm sorry I was a little confused between the different comments.\nJohn Burkart: Yes, why don't I go ahead and start with that. This is John. I think we're actually positioned very well and what we're seeing is, people wanting to different value propositions. So, they're looking for our assets of which we have many that have a little bit lower price point or dollars per square foot, a little bit more space. They're in great locations as it relates to outdoor recreational opportunities, and then of course, access to high-speed and going forward gig speed Internet. So I think we're positioned very well for that. What we're seeing is, at this point in time, many of the tech companies have decided that they're going to defer occupying the buildings, a range of dates really starting from October through one of them throughout July of 2021. But in no cases, do we see that becoming permanent. And then again, it gets back to this reality of people are now realizing that as much as we all kind of suck it up and we\u2019re impressed with Zoom and really worked hard to make things work, which is fantastic, something is being lost. And with the competitive juices flowing, we strongly believe, the companies will want to bring people back together and they see the value like they've always saw the value in having that. And there's also another piece to it, which is, I can speak anecdotally. I was talking to someone over the weekend and they mentioned the idea of moving in the extended commute zone and their employers said, that's fine, buy you're going to get a 20% to 25% pay cut, obviously completely negating their perceived value of a lower real estate prices. So, no doubt, they're not moving and we think we're positioned very well for the long run with our portfolio. Does that answer it? Mike, do you have there?\nMichael Schall: Yes, Jeff. Let me just add a little bit more kind of America point of view, because I totally agree with what John says. And I think that, things are in ultimately pretty good order considering the fact that we've had a 10% loss of jobs in June. So, that's an extraordinary number of jobs being lost and more than the financial crisis. And as a result, that's going to impact our performance and our economy. And there are a couple of pieces that are just so fundamental and these are the things I tried to bring out in my script. Basically, tourism is shut down and obviously the West Coast tourism is a pretty big deal. A lot of people like to go to San Francisco and to the various L.A. places. But with restaurants and bars shut down, those services are not available and you probably can't get there. It is difficult to get there given all the various shutdown orders, et cetera. And the other kind of key parts to our economy are certainly the film and content production in L.A., which we'd realize exactly how big a problem that was with respect to your COVID-19 and prevention of COVID-19, and producing content. And then finally, the tech flow down that I commented on in my scripts. So, all these things are actually things that are demanded in the marketplace and they will recover. And yes, it'll take time and we're certainly disappointed about the second wave and the renewed shutdown orders. In many cases, restaurants and bars were open for a couple of days and then shut down again in California. And so this has been incredibly disruptive in California and has made it difficult to get traction on things that really matter. Generally speaking, we have areas with pretty substantial amounts of wealth. Wealthy people like to consume services and including restaurants and bars, also people that have a choice between living in the hinterlands where you can make $15 an hour versus working in the city in a restaurant job restaurant type job, making $50 an hour. That's why they're, that's why people go to city. So basically, most of these relationships and activities have been shut down, again on a temporary basis, and I think California has been incredibly, let's say, vigilant with respect to these shutdown orders. They've been very extensive throughout the market places and continue to have an impact. So, with the easing of that and with better COVID news, I think you're going to see things open up relatively quickly.\nOperator: Our next question, it comes from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Bilerman: It\u2019s Michael Bilerman here with Nick and Mike. In the press release, you talked about Cares fund that Essex started with donations from executive officers, and it says, you intend to distribute up to 3 million of that 3 million was it all donations? And do you expect to use corporate cash as part of it? Or is it all led by executives?\nMichael Schall: No, Michael, it's a combination of both. And we set up at the beginning of the crisis, we set up a resident response team and they found extraordinary needs out there. And including people for example that didn't have money for food and other essential needs. So, we \u2013 actually, the executive group in that case essentially donated some money to provide meals for people. And then we realized that even more broadly, we have other needs because there are people that have lost their jobs and don't have great prospects for getting another job. And so, we wanted to have an entity that would provide relocation money and similar types of services. And so we decided to set up the Essex Cares entity in order to do that. So in that situation where it's not doing them any good, they need to move on in their life and find something. If we can provide those relocation benefits, it's good for them. It gets them into a better place. And, in our case, we have -- and I mentioned ordinances so we can evict them anyway. So, it's probably better for everybody. So, I think that this is a good example of finding sort of the common good as it relates to the current situation and providing an opportunity to let people move to pursue their life and better their life.\nMichael Bilerman: Right. So -- and then -- so how much of that $3 million was corporate cash? How much was donations? And how much capital do you foresee Essex contributing going forward to these initiatives?\nMichael Schall: Well, I don't think we've decided exactly. I think the portion that came from the employee pool is somewhere around $500,000 and the rest came from FX, but that's not a not a perfect number, but a rough number, that's what we did.\nMichael Bilerman: And then, the 2.5 is prospective? Or was there an expense in the quarter for the corporate cash then?\nJohn Burkart: Michael, let me address that. So, there were expenses during the quarter, but we set the entity up toward the end of the quarter. So, what happened during the quarter was already expanded. And essentially, we created the entity in response to the needs that were out there and what we were seeing on the ground when we're dealing with the people. Our resident response team consists of some 50 to 60 Essex employees, and they're talking to our residents, couple times typically. And again, they're trying to -- we came up with a basket of needs and people that were really in difficult situations. And so, this is intended to respond to those needs on more of a prospective basis.\nMichael Bilerman: Okay, this last one on the topic. Is the 2.5 million that's going to be Essex corporate cash? How are you going to treat that? Are you going to treat that as a cost of revenue? Are you even included in same-store? Or are you going to treat it completely separate from the financials?\nMichael Schall: Well, I\u2019ll let my financial guru talk that. Angela?\nAngela Kleiman: Michael, that\u2019s a good question. I think it depends on what it's being used for. So, for example, if it's for groceries or to relocate our tenants, it'll be a G&A item. But if it's for something that\u2019s revenue related, impacting, say, delinquencies, it would be a contra revenue items. And so, at this point, it\u2019s too early to see where that geography lands. But the intention is really more of a G&A item, and we'll see what that means anything.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nRich Hill: Hey, good morning guys. I apologize if my phone dies in the middle of this call. We're in the midst of getting a pretty bad storm. I think a lot of people on the phone might be as well. So, I want to come back and talk about a topic that you've spent some time on the past, which is valuing occupancy versus rent growth. And if I'm looking at sort of your metrics, I think you're at 94.9 in 2Q, you've gone up to 95.8 as of July. But new renewal spreads are obviously negative and maybe even a little bit lower than where they were in the quarter. So, I'm just wondering, if you can give us an update about how you're thinking about occupancy versus rent growth at this point? And when you think that you might be in a position to push occupancy and renewal and new leases be less bad than they are right now?\nJohn Burkart: Well, this is John. That's a great question. Well, again, as Mike had mentioned, we started in a hole in April really related to the shelter-in-place and just the demand stopped for a period of time. So, as we moved in as traffic increase pretty dramatically in May and then we took advantage of that decided to fill up the portfolio, and big picture there's a thing that we like, which is, let's not be proud and vacant. And vacant unit really obviously earned nothing, so we made the decision to get aggressive and offer some leasing discount or leasing incentives to enable us to gain occupancy and we ultimately gained about 200 basis points of occupancy between June and July, and that's positioned as well. We subsequently pulled back on concession and we're still offering them in certainly market-by-market, it depends. But taking some of our markets suburban markets like the San Diego, Orange County, Ventura, Contra Costa, in many of those cases, we've pulled back quite a bit on concession and those occupancies are riding higher. And in actuality, they're actually higher, as I mentioned in my remarks than they were in March. So, we look at it and say, the best thing is to position ourselves so that we're leading the market and not allow ourselves to be sitting vacant. And so, that's why we took that action. Right now, we're in a pretty good spot and we're just watching the market on literally a daily basis, understanding what's going on. There are some areas that are more distressed. Certainly, San Francisco, we only have less than a thousand units there, but San Francisco is definitely under stress. And I'll also know San Francisco about 30% of our units are so our studios and studios are clearly a challenged unit type in this market. The process has moved out so that's also putting a little bit of excessive pressure on the San Francisco market in our numbers. Does that answer your question?\nRich Hill: Yes. Yes, it does. And I wanted to maybe just come back to that a little bit more and think about the impact of concessions, and you might've talked about this a little bit earlier on. But if I'm thinking about this correctly, new leases were an average -- new leases saw an average of one to two months of concessions. So, I'm just trying to think about how we're supposed to think about the net effective rents. Can you just walk us through the effective portion of it? Because it seems like, it could be down a lot more than what the headline suggests. So, I want to make sure I'm thinking about that correctly.\nJohn Burkart: Yes. So concession, I mean, think of it in this particular market, I would think of it very similar to a development of lease up, where you offer concessions to incent someone to move. And obviously, there's certain real cost of moving and then there's just the pure motivation of moving. And so, when we desire to fill up our portfolio, we offered concessions. It's not really reflective on necessarily market rents are lower. Doing often the concessions enabled us to gain a significant amount of occupancy. So, I would look at it that way. I don't want to answer around though. There are clear to concessions in the marketplace. We were more aggressive because we wanted to fill up our portfolio and we've now backed away quite a bit from that. Our average confessions, I know in the supplemental, you're looking at saying four to eight weeks and that was pretty common. But the average concession during June was closer to 4% or four weeks for a little bit less than that that we used to, which enable us to fill out. So, there was a range. We clearly got assets and then serial concessions and some that were at eight weeks and sort of tendency a footnote in the financials.\nRich Hill: Got it. Got it. And so, just to be clear, and I'm sorry for belaboring this point. But it's hard to compare across names and that's what I'm trying to understand at this point.\nJohn Burkart: Yes.\nRich Hill: The new and renewals are headline without the concession, right?\nJohn Burkart: That is correct. And I'll ask you to throw in one more comment on the renewals to get a little clarity. The renewals go out typically 60 days plus into the marketplace, both we're trying to give our customers time to make a decision. And then, there's certain laws that prevent us from sending them out, say less than 30 days. And so, what can happen is the market can move between the time you send the renewal out, which is what happened in the second quarter and when it actually becomes effective. So, we would have had renewals that were effective in June that may have been signed in March, if that makes sense, always get a leg of the market rent, which are happening at that point in time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Thanks guys. And just building a little bit, maybe even more, you know, John it sound like you said that into July incentives have been proved even more. So, I mean, relative to that four weeks or last in June, have you virtually eliminated concessions at this point across most of your markets given where occupancy is today? Or is it the two weeks? Can you give us, help us quantify that? And then what the impact is from an effective rent perspective?\nMichael Schall: Sure. So, it moves around daily literally, but I can tell you that for a period of time, we completely eliminated them out of San Diego, Orange, Ventura and parts of a Contra Costa. Subsequently, we've moved back in week to two weeks here and there, other markets, and it's certainly Seattle falls in that bucket as well. Other markets like San Francisco, we continue to offer concessions somewhere in the range of four to eight weeks. it depends And San Mateo, pretty high with concessions and a similar number of weeks. And Silicon Valley is a mixed bag, but there are concessions in Silicon Valley, especially near the least ups. There is both Downtown Oakland and Silicon Valley and then some in San Francisco, where there's lease up that obviously is a concessionary market. But we are pulling them back and we're going back and forth. And part of it is, we run the Company as a portfolio and not asset by assets. So where we see opportunity where the markets are stronger, like Orange County and San Diego, Ventura, we're going to allow that to increase the occupancy increased a little bit more and offset some of the areas that are a little bit weaker like San Francisco.\nAustin Wurschmidt: No, that's helpful. And then how frequently are you using concessions on renewal leases to retain tenants? And could you quantify what that net effect of spread is in July versus last year?\nJohn Burkart: Yes, so with renewals much less, it's probably about 10% of what we're doing with the new leases and the renewals go out without any concessions. They can get negotiated in depending upon the situation. But our renewals, really, I expected the renewable going forward. That'll really dry up because the market is changing right now. And so, where we were in June and what we negotiated in June, we negotiated less in July and probably less again in August. So, maybe a week or something or less than that, I mean, because again, most of them don't even have concessions for the renewals. So we\u2019re not really trying to extend some of the move that's where we\u2019re trying to intent some of the move that\u2019s because they come into play because it really is a matter of they have moving costs. And so there's kind of this exchange that goes on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nAlexander Goldfarb: A few questions here, John in hearing your response to everyone's questions, it sounds like things improved in July. And then since then they have improved. So, where I think Mike who talked about or you talking about rent pressure in the back half. It sounds like that's more like you're not pushing rents positively, but you're seeing good demand. Most of your markets, we're seeing occupancy and that you're really not concerned about the back half for a repeat of the softening that occurred in early in 2Q. Is that a fair assessment?\nJohn Burkart: I'll start. I'm sure Mike might have some comments. But there's a lot of risk factors out there, Alex. So certainly factually, today, the market is better today than it was yesterday, the day before, et cetera. And this is all a good thing. And we feel good about that our portfolio is positioned very well, all things considered. But there's obviously things that are happening, related to COVID that throw risk factors. There is some unusual, there are some positives, as I mentioned earlier consultants, they usually move out in the fourth quarter, well, that's not going to happen because they already moved out. We didn't have insurance come in, and therefore they won't move out. So, those are positives that may enable us to have a longer leasing period. And then, there's some interesting things going around some of the colleges, for example, many of them are doing partially online. And that requires you to be very tethered to the university because you may be online for a class and then a half an hour later, you have a lab on site, but you still need to live right at that university and they cut down the occupancy. My family just went through this and my daughter got bumped out of her spot. So, she's now an apartment. And so, there's things like that that are positive, but there's obviously risk factors out there. And I'll flip it over the Mike if you have more to add there.\nMichael Schall: Yes, Alex suddenly, I try to tie this in, pretty specifically back to what's going on, on the job front. And, John, so John mentioned, the things you've done better and probably didn't draw enough attention to this. But in my script, I said, year-over-year job growth declines have moderated almost 400 basis points to 10.1%. So, from my perspective, things are really horrible in April. We fell off a cliff in terms of occupancy, and a variety of other things. We had an additional challenge in that we had all of these anti-eviction ordinances. And if someone wanted out of their lease, given the backdrop of having an anti-eviction ordinance, we were actually, I would say, motivated to let them out of their lease probably to a greater extent than many other places would be. And then, so, we did so that accounted for sort of the occupancy drop, and then you things got better. And again, job declines, moderated 400 basis points and the results got better. And so I would, that's kind of the point of my script is to say, we need things to continue to get better. And that's going to be intertwined with the COVID-19 experience going forward. And we remain hopeful that it's certainly -- we certainly believe is going the right direction. We certainly believe that mankind and potentially a vaccine or therapeutics or whatever, it is going to continue to moderate the picture. But we did positive developments, certainly, as it relates to the shutdown orders. And once again, it looks like we're hitting a new peak on this second surge. And so, maybe we can open the restaurants again and we can do some other things. I was talking to some people recently about restaurants in Palo Alto, and they're shutting down, partially shutting down the streets, so they can move more and the tables out on the streets and then have a traditional restaurant experience outdoors, that won't work in the winter, but in the summer that'll be great. So, there is incremental improvement for sure, and just good thoughtful people can overcome a lot of these challenges. So, I would expect certainly the progress to be ongoing. But whether we can take a big step forward or when we take the big step forward, we're still unclear as to when that might be. Hopefully that makes sense. So, we're making progress. We want it to be faster. It's a little too slow, but it seems to be going in the right direction.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Right, But I guess to the point Mike, you guys \u2013 obviously, none of us can predict the future, but from what your properties and your reasons are telling you today, you felt comfortable, as you guys said pulling back discussion. You've seen an uptick in occupancy, and I think with the exception of like the Downtown L.A. or downtown San Francisco, it sounds like most of your markets have been responding well to the actions that you guys have taken. You didn't identify maybe I missed, but it did sound like you identified markets are still weakening and getting worse and getting softer yet, correct?\nMichael Schall: Yes. I mean, that's a fair statement Alex. So, San Francisco is still challenged. We're trying to figure that one out, but it's a very small part of our portfolio. But the other markets clearly responded to pricing and we've said this back that we saw traffic increased pretty dramatically and that's when we made the decision to get aggressive and lease up the portfolio. So, yes, our pricing was intended to increase occupancy. It worked very well. We've pulled back from that. We're maintaining occupancy, it's still, we're working very hard. We're watching things daily, but we're, we're not seeing things fall backwards in your words. San Francisco again is a little challenged, pretty challenged.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then just the second question, on the delinquency, it sounds like you guys let people leave move, the ability to do so or whatever unlike New York. So, you guys let people leave. Their rent, the delinquency came down. The people who are in there do you expect the people to be money good or these are sort of the freeloaders that are just hanging out for free rent and they're never going to pay. They're never going to leave the unit.\nMichael Schall: There's going to be, I mean, there's no doubt, there is going to be a mixed bag of people. But like I said in my remarks, we had 18%, around one out of five assets where we had positive delinquency, meaning it contributed to revenues because people that owed us were paying back payments. So, there's a lot of hard work and people out there, we continually see these headlines, people struggling to get the unemployment payments. So, my sense is as the money is coming through, many of them are trying to make a good effort to pay us. In the end, there will some that take advantage of us. There always are. But, I don't think that's the majority. But how it worked out, certainly as this thing drags on, it becomes harder to tag, and so we're cautious on how this whole thing plays out as it relates to collections and delinquency.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rich Hightower with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.\nRich Hightower: I hope everybody is well. Just to maybe steer the conversation in a different direction here. Mike, what's your updated take on the policy risk landscape Essex? And certainly, we could be having a very different conversation 90 days from now the next time your reports. So just where do we stand on different bills and Prop 21 and so forth?\nMichael Schall: Yes, there's definitely a lot to talk about. So, Rich, if I miss them, you can just follow up and ask again. But obviously, the biggest one that we're most focused on is Prop 21 here in California, which would amend a law that was passed in the mid nineties to promote housing construction called Costa Hawkins. And, so it would severely change that law and bring back potentially forms of rent control that really don't work that really discourage housing production in all the cities that they adopted. And, it's interesting that we already have statewide rent control with respect to AB 1482, which passed last year, along with about 18 other bills that were intended to try to jumpstart and to increase the amount of housing that was available in California. But in fact, in the case of AB 1482, the apartment industry did not oppose that bill because we thought it was a reasonable finding the middle ground of the need for more housing and the need to protect tennis. So, we thought that the legislature did a very good job of that. But Prop 21 is brought by someone that is not involved in the housing industry. It's a special interest group. And so, they are continuing that campaign. In our case, we decided to keep our entity that we used to by Prop 10 in 2018 alive, and essentially the same group of people lead that entity and are the opposition team on with respect to Prop 21. And they've made a lot of progress. Polling continues to be fairly similar to what it was and as it relates to Prop 10 at this time, maybe a little bit better than that because AB 1482 was passed. The politics I think are somewhat different in that we already have statewide rent control. So why do we need this other rent control proposal? And the campaign is proceeding well, there are something like or somewhere over a hundred organizations and you can see them all representing seniors, labor, community groups, et cetera that have joined Essex in opposing Prop 21. And there is a website if anyone's interested, which is noonprop21.boat. And I go to that website and see it. So, we're optimistic about it. We're fully a hundred percent support of it and we\u2019re raising money and we\u2019re preparing for the final showdown. So that is the story on Prop 21. Rich, maybe before I go on, do you have any follow ups on Prop 21?\nRich Hightower: Yes, that was a great summary Mike. You mentioned that polling Prop 10 maybe a little bit of things back. And is there anything other than the obvious, the COVID environment, that\u2019s driving that or are there any takeaways from that element specifically.\nMichael Schall: Well, it's difficult to see exactly how COVID is going to play out as it relates to that. Obviously, rents are declined and certainly since AB 1482 was passed, rents have declined. So, why not give 1482 a chance to work because it seems to be working. And again, what is the need for another ballot proposition that effectively attacks the same issue that the legislature has already acted upon. And I think that that issue actually helps us because, again, we have a legislative solution. So, why do we need to go to the ballot box? Certainly with respect to the sponsor that has very little to do with housing, and, and fight that battle. So, but that's where we are. And, we'll we will see, I mean, there'll be more coming out on Prop 21 in the coming weeks, so happy to discuss, if you want to call separately or whatever. And then, I guess I would also mentioned the porphyry of anti eviction ordinances, which are incredibly difficult and you're like, John, I give great credit to the ethics team because sorting through city, county state, and even, federal laws with respect to and I think ordinances and all the different things that are that are out there, there's a tremendous amount going on. They are constantly changing all of these various eviction ordinances being extended different terms. I think that there will likely be some legal action on some of them because they're pushing the envelope with respect to I think, what would normally seem to be appropriate in the circumstances. And I throw out as an example that San Francisco permanently banning landlords from eviction. This is at any time in the future for COVID-19 delinquencies. So, I mean, we definitely have an uphill struggle with respect to collections. And to the extent, it almost appears that if you never have to -- if you never have to have accountability for your delinquency, then it almost seems like and we can't -- there's no late fees, there's no interest charges, you almost make create a scenario where there's no incentive to pay the landlord. So, this is the dilemma because we're not in many cases allowed to ask for documentation of a COVID-19 hardship and normal things that one would expect. So, this continues to be an ongoing dilemma.\nRich Hightower: Okay, appreciate the call. And I guess one follow up, if I may, the incentive being a landlord and somebody might also be called into question longer term. I mean, what's your sense of risk to the portfolio from a capital allocation standpoint? And obviously, it's nothing you can turn on a dime or do quickly. But how do you think about diversification sort of beyond your current core markets in that sense?\nMichael Schall: Yes, we're here for very specific reasons. So, we -- I think we're actually pretty diversified as it relates to the major metros on the west coast, which, again, it's a big part of the globe, global economies while I think California and Washington or something like a fifth largest economy in the world. So, we're not talking about a small area and what we've done is tried to diversify with respect to product and in many, many cities up and down the West Coast. So, I think we're actually more diverse than that might seem. And having said that, why are we here? We're here because supply and demand for housing is very attractive and rents grow better over time. And so, if there were other places that had similar long term rent growth as the West Coast, we would likely be there. But that doesn't exist. And so, we're trying to maximize the growth of the portfolio over time and do it in a thoughtful way and certainly a risk adverse way, and diversify the portfolio within the West Coast, which again, it's a very large area. And so, we will look at and we constantly look at other geographies and other opportunities and we'll continue to do that. We certainly do that once a year in our strategic planning session with the Board, which comes up here in September. And so, we'll continue to do that and maybe this will change it a little bit, but I would say, the anecdote to maybe a little bit less diversity is a very strong balance sheet. So, you have to withstand the periods of time when there is more volatility and we've done that. And as a result, we believe that, we have kind of the best of both worlds. We have a very strong balance sheet that can withstand significant shocks and on the other hand have among the highest long-term growth rates and rents.\nRich Hightower: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rich Anderson with SMBC. Please proceed with your question.\nRich Anderson: Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Maybe there should be a new proposition to cap rent decline -- \nMichael Schall: Hey, Rich. We'll vote for you for governor.\nRich Anderson: So, I'd like to get back to the concentration, West Coast concentration here. Point Mike a get it the big economies, big area of the country, but still a lot of common knitting in the state of California, that's sort of a singular problem. One thing I've noticed about you guys over the years is, things have a tendency to change over a shorter period of time than your peers. I remember back that supply issue on quarter, you were kind of having trouble pinpoint at the next quarter things certainly were much better. And I have that a little bit wrong, but I know I'm close. And saying that things change in perhaps maybe in months for us that might be measured in quarters for your peers. And I'm wondering third quarter had a very different flavor, is there a real chance that we could have a conversation three months from now that could vastly actually different than the tone of the press release that you release last night?\nMichael Schall: It looks like it's starting to abate finally, but I think it might be a little bit longer term than that. Having said that, we fell off the cliff in terms of occupancy in April and again, because of these anti eviction ordinances, we were probably more aggressive at letting people move on with their life if they lost their job and needed more affordable housing than some of the others. And that caused vacancy to decline more. And, but it also set us up to find a tenant that can be a good long-term tenant. And so there were some definite trade-offs during the quarter, and then playing catch up with respect to using concessions to build occupancy as John alluded to definitely cost us something. And again, as in July, we're in a much better position and we don't have that. We don't have that overhang that we have to deal with.  So I would say that's incrementally better, certainly unemployment going from improving by 400 basis points. That's going to help us in the quarter. So there is good news out there and but as I tried to allude to in my comments, we need the film production business to come back. That looks like a choppy road. And even restaurants, all the service jobs and restaurants and bars, et cetera, that looks like a somewhat choppy roads. So cautiously optimistic and we'll see, but I do think the next quarter will be better than the last that's for sure. \nRich Anderson: And then the concentration question, and you mentioned this you're always going to look at some other markets, and I don't remember when it was probably 15 years ago when you were looking at Baltimore and country, is your radar that far away or is it more closer in to the West coast area, perhaps at Denver or something like that? \nMichael Schall: Yeah, it's a little above. I mean, what we try to do is look at other major metros, similar to the West coast, there's some element of supply constraints. We look at the stability of the economy and the federal government in Washington DC is pretty darn stable employer of people. And so it tends to do better when things are or not ongoing, well, although it also can produce a fair amount of apartment supply at the same time, so that comes back and hurt it. But, we look at things much like trying to find markets that are like the West coast, which are very difficult to find. And then we also consider blurring the line. So at what point in time might we go to some of the other markets that are near our existing markets, but just a step further out.  We own an asset in Santa Cruz. We've owned assets in Tracy and the inland empire. And, I'd say, you know, our experience there is, those are very much timing markets. And so, is there a possibility of example, setting up a coinvestment type entity, which inherently will have an exit for a period of time and then exit and do more a timing type trading is something that we also consider and so I'm not sure what we're going to do. I do know that, from feedback from our board that they are going to want to take a harder look at this issue. So we'll be having more robust conversations about it. \nOperator: Our next question is from Neil Malkin with Capital One Security. Please proceed with your question.\nNeil Malkin: So, maybe talking about the development side, or the external side, started a JV development, just curious how that side of the business is going and the appetite level, hearing this only kind of distress in the market, and not really on the acquisition side, but more on the development land, pre purchase. Those types of things. Can you just talked about, what you see there? Have you gotten more inbound calls and how do you see, maybe the next, six to nine months shaping out on that side of the ledger.\nAdam Berry: All right, well, this is Adam. So, I can cover this and Mike feel free to hop-in. So, as far as the stress goes on the land side of things, landowners are incredibly stubborn when it comes to decreasing their expectations on land values. So, yes, lots of inbound calls. But very few yields that seem to be getting a dry now. We haven't seen much if any decrease in construction costs so that coupled with some challenging a challenging rental environment, there's very little that we see right now that would pencil. We continue to be aggressive on the on the private equity side, because there are there are a number of legacy deals that that are out there searching for funding and construction lending standards have gotten somewhat higher and we've gotten more conservative with our with our prep underwriting. But even still, there's still a relatively high demand for that though. Like I said, we continue to have a robust pipelines. And that's probably where the, the main focus is going to be for the immediate future.\nNeil Malkin: Okay, great. Other one for me kind of been talked about, it seems like on each call, to talk about regulation and things like that continued to get, I don't know, worse and worse extreme. Can you just maybe talk about a couple of things in particular, AD1436, which I think is the statewide codified in the statewide 60 moratorium, either the sooner of the end of state of emergency plus 90-days or April 2021. Just maybe what's going on there. And then, the other thing I guess part D would be you look at like proper trash in Seattle. You look at a lot of these things are deep on the belief, a lot of a lot of issues that, although you are diversified as you say they're very much a function of the California and Washington I'll say, mentality type. So, I'm just wondering how you navigate through that process or approach these, these things that seem to kind of come out at you on a more frequent basis?\nMichael Schall: Yes, it is a great question. And I will say that we are surprised at the incredible, both number of eviction related and tenant protection related bills that come out of this. And it certainly in the short-term, we had our own our own self imposed limitations for 90-days on evictions and rent increases and a variety of other things. So I think that is something that is just appropriate and proper in dealing with this -- with the pandemic. But there's a point at which, and I would guess it will getting near that point that, things go too far. And so what we try to do is both certainly comply and understand all the existing ordinances that are out there. And again, they're at all different levels of government and they constantly change. And at the same time, try to advocate in our discussions with CAA and others like for example, if a resident, if this goes on for some prolonged period of time, if a resident was a certain amount of funds, shouldn't, they have some affirmative responsibility to prove their COVID-19 affect or impact or something like that.  And work with their tenant. There is a steer out there that, there's going to be widespread evictions, you're following this situation. And I look at it and we're realistic people, we have no interest in that, just mass evictions at all. In fact, we're better off working together, but it needs to be on several level playing field. We need them to essentially prove their or acknowledge their COVID-19 issue. And then we can react and try to do what is thoughtful for both of us. So the laws as they're currently constructed don't do that exactly. So there's a bunch of laws out there as you point out that prolong the eviction process and not just limited to the one you mentioned, but just on an ongoing basis.  And it still remains to be seen what happens with those laws. I mentioned, in San Francisco, the inability to evict anyone at any time indefinitely for COVID-19 delinquencies. And I'm not sure exactly how we get paid back on those particular delinquencies. So this has been a, an ongoing issue and certainly it's disappointing from our perspective, then that we have no ability to control our destiny. And it seems like people have the ability to essentially do things they shouldn't be allowed to do. So I'll leave it at that. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Calmes with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.\nAlex Calmes: Just looking at another discrepancy between pockets, or would it make sense for the match funds your positions? Or are you looking to get a little more progressive on --?\nMichael Schall: Yes, Angela in her remarks talked about mass funding, firstly, everything that we do going forward. So that definitely is the plan and not just buy a stock, buy back preferred equity and others. So Angela outlined the her sources and uses for the rest of the year. So I think we're good -- I think we're on the same page with respect to how we're going to do that. Maintain a very strong balance sheet.\nAlex Calmes: So looking at rent collecting month over month, what is usual for patched up in the following marker for doing thing.\nMichael Schall: A little bit hard to hear your question. So I'll repeat it. So I get it right. You're asking what the usual cadence for rent collection is if someone's delinquent, I think, and you were just in a different time. Because normally if someone's delinquent, we're going to obviously communicate with them either come up with an agreement with them, which case we're pretty reasonable. If they over the month rent, we're going to let them have a prepayment plan that's going to work over a reasonable amount of time. If they don't want to communicate, we're going to give him a three day notice and start a process and work through that.  So normally that's how it would go where it is today. Some of those options are not available. The communication is, and again, I'm very pleased to see that without any current hammers, we're seeing people step up and make payments on what they owe. Some people wanting to enter payment plans, others not they're concerned about whether they'd be able to keep those, but they're still paying more than their rent. And so we're seeing good behavior out of people in general. Hopefully that answers your question. \nAlex Calmes: I\u2019m looking more for, percentage pass that you\u2019re collecting 94% April rent at the end of April, and enter contract with you in May. Is there basis point catch up that you have been seeing? Or has it been mostly negotiated.\nAngela Kleiman: Hi, this is Angela here. If you\u2019re looking at the amount of revenue that is not reserved, we are essentially at over a 100% collected for same store, which means some of that of course goes towards delinquency. But keep in mind this is only July, one month. And so to John's point, we are seeing good behavior and most people are trying to be responsible, but it just too early to be okay what does that trend mean given this is July numbers. \nOperator: Our next question comes from John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Pawlowski : Just one follow up for me. John can you help me just understand whether your comment where elevating concessions aren't indicative of where market rents are. Because in certain markets, it feels like every, a lot of big private and public developers are four to eight weeks free. So it feels like the market clearing price of rents transcend demands, market rents across your portfolio. If all your competitors are four to eight weeks free, is is down in the neighborhood of 15%. Could you just elaborate on that? \nJohn Burkart: I'm glad to, first I have to give you guys some credit, you've done a nice job trying to track things. So I appreciate that it's out there, but I would say what we're picking up and what ethics does is got of frustration out of not having a great market data, because some of the vendors aren't doing a great job. We created our own proprietary database. So we've got over a thousand assets and we're tracking. And then what we find is different days, different competitors are offering concessions. They're doing it in different units. And so there are commonly assets there that are offering maybe four day a week. But that doesn't mean that those are the only units that are renting. And what we saw back in June was many of the bigger owners were trying to gain occupancy. Increased absorption, just like a very large development lease, ultimately, are multiple leases competing against each other, that works for us and can't speak for our peers that that works for us. And so we're backing off, and we're continuing to find that we're receiving leases in many cases, without concessions, not all those cases San Francisco is different in your asset by asset we have different plans, but that the idea of having a concession to help pay the moving cost to them, some of the move has paid off for us.  And again, we're generally backing off now, when you get into a very competitive spot like downtown Oakland in the CBD or San Francisco or downtown San Jose, there's lease up going on in LA, there's lease up going on and so things get blurred a little bit because you've got to lease up, consider offering concessions. If you're stabilizing down the street, you're probably still offering large concessions. So, there's a little blurring going on. But we are seeing as you get down to other markets that like say, Ventura, lots of Orange County, San Diego, in many cases, conditions just drying up. And that's kind of what can happen with secession isn't there in the market, and then they just dry up rather rapidly. And we are seeing that happen. So, the overall, again, really as a tool to increase absorption, and I understand your ideas and that effective, but the reality is we try to use them to increase absorption and they worked well for us. Does that answer your question?\nJohn Pawlowski: It does, it sounds like it's more of a debate over duration. So, if these concessions ever to continue for the next six months, effective rents have to be down 50-ish percent across these markets. Right. I mean, it's just, -- it's just too lucrative a market?\nJohn Burkart: And again with us, yes. Why reference we gain 200 to 190 basis points in occupancy because there was an impact from we offer concessions, we increased interest in tax, and we're backing off of that. So, that worked well done to create excess demand. So, yes, -- if they went on forever, yes. Then they're part of the market. That'd be different.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Kim : John, mentioned in the prepared remarks. The value proposition of Downtown assets is defined with the Bourbon. And I was just wondering if you could remind us of the breakdown that you have or that you identify as Downtown or urban versus suburban. market?\nJohn Burkart: Sure, well, yes, we look at about 10% urban and 90% suburban. And there's, obviously can be some blending that goes on certainly as you get into some of the locations in Southern California, where it's, kind of blended but overall, we look at 10% we have very little incentive to under 1000 units in downtown market in our store portfolio.\nJohn Kim : Okay, and then on this profession discussion, which I know it's already interesting property results, but if we are assuming four weeks of construction as an average there might be higher than that in the second quarter, then that would imply reasons were down 10% renewables are down 8%. And I think there's no better compression level but I'm not really sure. If I'm in the sector, basis level, it's gotten better just given where the waste is sorted, have gone so I was wondering if you could help quantify that difference between the second quarter in July, as far as the effective rent change.\nJohn Burkart: Yeah. I can definitely tell you on that. If you were to look at it truly on net effective and in this regard the increase in absorption, so just weird advanced transact net effective. They definitely get better in July. And they're going to comment on the renewals, not all the renewals concessions and in many cases it was a week or something like that. So, it wouldn't be translate to a, let's say, an average of an 8% or one month on the renewals. That's the renewals were closest to offer 1% somewhere in that area. But on the new leases, again, the focus was on the new leases with the concessions to increase absorption. So, in some of that has gone away. And so, if you look at it purely that way net effect, yeah, definitely rents are up in July over June.\nOperator: The question comes from Zach Silverberg with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.\nZach Silverberg: Hi and good morning be out there. Just a quick one on capital allocation. I'm just curious, in the press release, you mentioned more stock buybacks. Where does the stock buyback program fit into your best use of capital today? And how do you view this moving forward?\nMichael Schall : Yeah. Hi. This is Mike. Yeah, we've slowed down a little bit on the stock buyback, and the thought there is that, the affects of COVID-19 are going to be with us for a longer period of time. And so, the impetus to do a lot of stock buy back quickly is less important. We are constantly watching debt-to-EBITDA and some of the other balance sheet metrics. And so, if you're selling assets to buy back stock, you're going to need to do leverage along the way, because as you sell an asset, obviously your EBITDA shrinking. So, we're mindful about how we do stock buyback. We're still very interested in it. It is still one of the things that is important to us. But, and again, funding it along the way with asset sales is an imperative action with respect to all of what we're doing. So I'd say, at this point in time, as Adam mentioned that, probably the preferred equity pipeline is going to be our go to source, given that, there are fewer providers out there and therefore we have a better selection of transactions to pick from and would be that. And, we definitely like co-investment transactions when the transaction market gets better and we see more quality assets that are trading. And obviously, it depends on what guys are trading out, but this idea of buying, let's say four and a half type cap rate with your cost of debt in the low to mid twos, that generates a whole lot of cash flow and is pretty attractive transactions. So, I think we're going to have opportunities on the external side and actually, I think this is, the fun part of the business, when there's disruption in the marketplace and lots of opportunity and we get to pick what the best use of capital is, I think that's what we do exceptionally well. Does that answer?\nZach Silverberg: Another quick one from me. You guys mentioned a mobile leasing app that you're developing. Do you have any sort of project return targets around this and what percentage I guess of your portfolio is completely touch less for a customer from the lease up process? \nMichael Schall: Sure. So we're not giving away the metrics at this point in time on that, but I can tell you it'd be quite a change from the perspective of the customer being able to come in and lease on a mobile iPhone, literally set up, obviously some setting up the appointment all the way through to getting approved instantly and moving forward. So we're very excited about that. We think that will give us a great customer experience and positioned very well going forward when you're talking about the touchless, at this point in time, really we have, from a tour perspective and otherwise we can go touchless all the way through other than of course once they get to the site, they're going to move in. But, we're touchless across the board in that sense, does that answer the question? \nOperator: We have reached the end of the question and answer session at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Michael Schall for closing comments. \nMichael Schall: Very good. Thank you operator. And thank you everyone for joining the call today. Certainly our best wishes to you and your families during these very challenging times. And we hope to see you all either in person or on Zoom someday soon. Have a good day.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect at this time. And we thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Schall",
            "content": "Thank you for joining our call today. The unprecedented reactions from the COVID-19 pandemic have presented many challenges that have affected every part of our business and indeed our lives. We'd like to offer our best wishes to all those impacted by COVID-19 and thank you for participating on the call today. On today's call, John Burkart and Angela Kleiman, will follow me with comments and Adam Berry is here for Q&A. Our reported results for Q2 reflect these unprecedented challenges as we reported 5.1% decline in core FFO from a year ago, representing an abrupt turnaround from very favorable conditions throughout this economic cycle. Our first priority upon receiving COVID-19 related shut down orders was to ensure the safety of our employees and residents, while reacting thoughtfully to shelter-in-place restrictions and regulatory hurdles that had been especially pervasive across our markets. Unprecedented job loss from mandatory shutdown orders in March suddenly insignificantly reduced rental demand, leading to lower occupancy in April, followed by a steady recovery throughout the quarter. Ultimately occupancy fully recovered and was 96.2% in July. Delinquencies also spiked due to job losses in anti-eviction ordinances, which often contain collection forbearance provisions. Proposed regulations that could further impede collection of COVID-19 related rent receivables led us to adopt a conservative approach to bad debt. During the second quarter, the direct cost of the pandemic in the form of greater residential and commercial delinquency, lost occupancy and COVID-19 related maintenance totaled $27 million. We view these costs is mostly temporary and have seen improvement in each category second quarter. John and Angela will provide additional detail as part of their remarks. Fortunately, the economy improved quickly from its April trough as measured by resumed job growth, lower continuing unemployment claims and fewer warn notices. In addition, many businesses have found ways to adapt to the virus by creating new safety protocols and procedures. After declining nearly 14% in the Essex markets during April, by June year-over-year your job declines had moderated by almost 400 basis points to 10.1%. We expect gradual improvement to continue in the second half of the year. Turning to the West Coast markets, technology companies are a primary driver of wealth creation and growth in the Bay Area in Seattle. Most of the leading tech companies remain in a growth mode with minimal damage to their business models and many of them such as Amazon, Netflix and Zoom have benefited from the shelter-in-place restrictions, resulting in greater market share. Generally, it appears that many large tech companies have slowed their pace of growth, while allowing greater flexibility for employees to work-from-home. We track the open positions at the 10 largest public technology companies, all of which are headquartered in an Essex market. Recently, these companies had approximately 17,000 job openings in California and Washington. These large company tech jobs are down by about a third on a year-over-year basis and are now at about the same level since we saw in 2017. Many of the top tech companies including Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Salesforce are planning for employees to return to the office and have established related dates, which range from October 2022 to July 2021. This is consistent with our comments during our June NAREIT meetings, whereby we expect employees in the post-COVID era to have a greater work-from-home flexibility, while also needing to report to the office at various times to maintain team dynamics, acclimate new hires and pursue career opportunities, all of which require periodic face-to-face contact. Venture capital has continued to flow at a healthy pace according to the most recent data. However, we understand that the mix of investments is more focused on companies that have business models that are not directly impacted by COVID-19 and have lower cash burn rate. Southern California has a more diversified economy that has outperformed during previous recessionary periods. While San Diego, Orange and Ventura counties have generally continued this trend, Los Angeles County has notably underperformed. L.A.'s preliminary unemployment rate was 19.5% in June, well above the level implied by recent job losses of 12.3% on a trailing three months basis, and partially explained by the usually large number of gig and freelance workers in L.A. that are not captured by the BLS payroll survey. Filming and content production is the key contributor to jobs and wealth creation in Los Angeles, and the industry came to a temporary standstill. Film L.A. reported that the number of shoot days during the second quarter declined 98% from the prior year across television film and commercials. Despite these challenges, the demand for content is unabated amid the pandemic, and there are reasons to be optimistic. In a joint report called a Safeway Forward, various organizations including the screen actors guild have outlined the process for content production amid the pandemic, which is building production momentum. A key factor impacting all of our markets is the loss of leisure and hospitality and other services jobs, which represented from 12% to 17% of total jobs at June, 2019 in the Essex Metros. Compared to the total jobs lost in the Essex bucket this past year, these service jobs declined an average of about 30% year-over-year with the greatest declines in Seattle and San Francisco. These job losses are throughout each metro area, although the downtown locations had the greatest concentrations of affected businesses. We see the recovery path ahead as reversing the pandemic related declines we experienced this last quarter. In the near-term progress will depend on the direction of COVID infection rate and the associated governmental limitations on business activity. Given the COVID-related shutdown of film and digital content industries and its potential for value creation, its recovery is essential in Los Angeles. Fortunately, that recovery is underway with the recent restart in a production of daily TV shows such as Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune in Culver City and several soap operas produced by CBS and ABC. Necessarily crowded motion picture sets and safety mandates will probably make this a slow process. Wealthy areas create demand for restaurants, bars and other services and the related jobs contribute to housing demand, particularly in the cities. That makes service jobs systematically important to housing, and we believe that they will recover. Finally, mostly of the technology industries are in great condition and should be expected to resume greater hiring and growth. Along with unspent wealth accumulated during the pandemic, we expect the recovery of jobs to be strong as the outlook for managing the pandemic improves. In light of the unpredictable nature of the pandemic and with the recent surge in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations, the course of the pandemic and governmental responses have become intertwined with job growth and other economic outcomes. Thus, we've made the decision to withdraw our forecast on Page S-16 of the supplemental until we have better clarity on the direction of the pandemic. Finally, turning to the apartment transaction market, we sold two properties during the quarter, both of which were placed under contract in May. Pricing for both represented a small discount compared to the pre-COVID period. Both properties were in downtown San Jose, continuing the theme of the past few years of selling downtown locations that are more susceptible to added supply and a diminishing quality of life. Going forward, we expect to grow the portfolio near major employment centers that offer a better living experience. Generally, the transaction market had been slow to recover with very few closed apartment sales and even fewer properties being marketed. The industry is working through key issues in the selling process, such as travel restrictions and due diligence challenges. Given a dearth of transactions, it's too early to conclude on how buyers will value apartment properties going forward. A few closed transactions since the onset of the pandemic traded at prices at or near pre-COVID levels, suggesting that, highly motivated buyers have taken a longer view when valuing property by treating the COVID-19 specific impacts such as delinquency as a purchase price adjustment, rather than long-term reductions in NOI or higher cap rate. At quarter end, we had two additional properties under contract for sale. Both are smaller properties and one of them closed in July. Going forward, our intent is to mostly fund our growth with disposition proceeds. We announced one new development deal in suburban San Diego and we have a robust preferred equity pipeline. As before, plenty of money is searching for distress real estate which will be scarce with institutional-grade apartments, given extraordinarily low financing costs. As with prior recessions, the existence of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac virtually assures a source of liquidity for apartment. Yields or cap rates for apartments generally substantially exceed long-term interest rates and related debt and the resulting positive leverage remains a powerful force in the market. Unlike REIT stocks, private market values in terms of cap rates are generally sticky, meaning that they don't change immediately in reaction to events, but rather seek to reflect the longer term financial performance of a property. At the end of the day, we believe that, the transaction markets will like to recover because lower interest rates will provide sufficient incentive to offset greater perceived risk. Historically, we found opportunities to add value as markets transition and in periods of disruption. I'm confident that, we have the team, resources and strategy to thoughtfully act on these opportunities, consistent with our long-term track record of our performance. And now, I'll turn the call over to John Burkart. Yes, Jeff. Let me just add a little bit more kind of America point of view, because I totally agree with what John says. And I think that, things are in ultimately pretty good order considering the fact that we've had a 10% loss of jobs in June. So, that's an extraordinary number of jobs being lost and more than the financial crisis. And as a result, that's going to impact our performance and our economy. And there are a couple of pieces that are just so fundamental and these are the things I tried to bring out in my script. Basically, tourism is shut down and obviously the West Coast tourism is a pretty big deal. A lot of people like to go to San Francisco and to the various L.A. places. But with restaurants and bars shut down, those services are not available and you probably can't get there. It is difficult to get there given all the various shutdown orders, et cetera. And the other kind of key parts to our economy are certainly the film and content production in L.A., which we'd realize exactly how big a problem that was with respect to your COVID-19 and prevention of COVID-19, and producing content. And then finally, the tech flow down that I commented on in my scripts. So, all these things are actually things that are demanded in the marketplace and they will recover. And yes, it'll take time and we're certainly disappointed about the second wave and the renewed shutdown orders. In many cases, restaurants and bars were open for a couple of days and then shut down again in California. And so this has been incredibly disruptive in California and has made it difficult to get traction on things that really matter. Generally speaking, we have areas with pretty substantial amounts of wealth. Wealthy people like to consume services and including restaurants and bars, also people that have a choice between living in the hinterlands where you can make $15 an hour versus working in the city in a restaurant job restaurant type job, making $50 an hour. That's why they're, that's why people go to city. So basically, most of these relationships and activities have been shut down, again on a temporary basis, and I think California has been incredibly, let's say, vigilant with respect to these shutdown orders. They've been very extensive throughout the market places and continue to have an impact. So, with the easing of that and with better COVID news, I think you're going to see things open up relatively quickly. No, Michael, it's a combination of both. And we set up at the beginning of the crisis, we set up a resident response team and they found extraordinary needs out there. And including people for example that didn't have money for food and other essential needs. So, we \u2013 actually, the executive group in that case essentially donated some money to provide meals for people. And then we realized that even more broadly, we have other needs because there are people that have lost their jobs and don't have great prospects for getting another job. And so, we wanted to have an entity that would provide relocation money and similar types of services. And so we decided to set up the Essex Cares entity in order to do that. So in that situation where it's not doing them any good, they need to move on in their life and find something. If we can provide those relocation benefits, it's good for them. It gets them into a better place. And, in our case, we have -- and I mentioned ordinances so we can evict them anyway. So, it's probably better for everybody. So, I think that this is a good example of finding sort of the common good as it relates to the current situation and providing an opportunity to let people move to pursue their life and better their life. Well, I don't think we've decided exactly. I think the portion that came from the employee pool is somewhere around $500,000 and the rest came from FX, but that's not a not a perfect number, but a rough number, that's what we did. Well, I'll let my financial guru talk that. Angela? Sure. So, it moves around daily literally, but I can tell you that for a period of time, we completely eliminated them out of San Diego, Orange, Ventura and parts of a Contra Costa. Subsequently, we've moved back in week to two weeks here and there, other markets, and it's certainly Seattle falls in that bucket as well. Other markets like San Francisco, we continue to offer concessions somewhere in the range of four to eight weeks. it depends And San Mateo, pretty high with concessions and a similar number of weeks. And Silicon Valley is a mixed bag, but there are concessions in Silicon Valley, especially near the least ups. There is both Downtown Oakland and Silicon Valley and then some in San Francisco, where there's lease up that obviously is a concessionary market. But we are pulling them back and we're going back and forth. And part of it is, we run the Company as a portfolio and not asset by assets. So where we see opportunity where the markets are stronger, like Orange County and San Diego, Ventura, we're going to allow that to increase the occupancy increased a little bit more and offset some of the areas that are a little bit weaker like San Francisco. Yes, Alex suddenly, I try to tie this in, pretty specifically back to what's going on, on the job front. And, John, so John mentioned, the things you've done better and probably didn't draw enough attention to this. But in my script, I said, year-over-year job growth declines have moderated almost 400 basis points to 10.1%. So, from my perspective, things are really horrible in April. We fell off a cliff in terms of occupancy, and a variety of other things. We had an additional challenge in that we had all of these anti-eviction ordinances. And if someone wanted out of their lease, given the backdrop of having an anti-eviction ordinance, we were actually, I would say, motivated to let them out of their lease probably to a greater extent than many other places would be. And then, so, we did so that accounted for sort of the occupancy drop, and then you things got better. And again, job declines, moderated 400 basis points and the results got better. And so I would, that's kind of the point of my script is to say, we need things to continue to get better. And that's going to be intertwined with the COVID-19 experience going forward. And we remain hopeful that it's certainly -- we certainly believe is going the right direction. We certainly believe that mankind and potentially a vaccine or therapeutics or whatever, it is going to continue to moderate the picture. But we did positive developments, certainly, as it relates to the shutdown orders. And once again, it looks like we're hitting a new peak on this second surge. And so, maybe we can open the restaurants again and we can do some other things. I was talking to some people recently about restaurants in Palo Alto, and they're shutting down, partially shutting down the streets, so they can move more and the tables out on the streets and then have a traditional restaurant experience outdoors, that won't work in the winter, but in the summer that'll be great. So, there is incremental improvement for sure, and just good thoughtful people can overcome a lot of these challenges. So, I would expect certainly the progress to be ongoing. But whether we can take a big step forward or when we take the big step forward, we're still unclear as to when that might be. Hopefully that makes sense. So, we're making progress. We want it to be faster. It's a little too slow, but it seems to be going in the right direction. Yes. I mean, that's a fair statement Alex. So, San Francisco is still challenged. We're trying to figure that one out, but it's a very small part of our portfolio. But the other markets clearly responded to pricing and we've said this back that we saw traffic increased pretty dramatically and that's when we made the decision to get aggressive and lease up the portfolio. So, yes, our pricing was intended to increase occupancy. It worked very well. We've pulled back from that. We're maintaining occupancy, it's still, we're working very hard. We're watching things daily, but we're, we're not seeing things fall backwards in your words. San Francisco again is a little challenged, pretty challenged. There's going to be, I mean, there's no doubt, there is going to be a mixed bag of people. But like I said in my remarks, we had 18%, around one out of five assets where we had positive delinquency, meaning it contributed to revenues because people that owed us were paying back payments. So, there's a lot of hard work and people out there, we continually see these headlines, people struggling to get the unemployment payments. So, my sense is as the money is coming through, many of them are trying to make a good effort to pay us. In the end, there will some that take advantage of us. There always are. But, I don't think that's the majority. But how it worked out, certainly as this thing drags on, it becomes harder to tag, and so we're cautious on how this whole thing plays out as it relates to collections and delinquency. Yes, there's definitely a lot to talk about. So, Rich, if I miss them, you can just follow up and ask again. But obviously, the biggest one that we're most focused on is Prop 21 here in California, which would amend a law that was passed in the mid nineties to promote housing construction called Costa Hawkins. And, so it would severely change that law and bring back potentially forms of rent control that really don't work that really discourage housing production in all the cities that they adopted. And, it's interesting that we already have statewide rent control with respect to AB 1482, which passed last year, along with about 18 other bills that were intended to try to jumpstart and to increase the amount of housing that was available in California. But in fact, in the case of AB 1482, the apartment industry did not oppose that bill because we thought it was a reasonable finding the middle ground of the need for more housing and the need to protect tennis. So, we thought that the legislature did a very good job of that. But Prop 21 is brought by someone that is not involved in the housing industry. It's a special interest group. And so, they are continuing that campaign. In our case, we decided to keep our entity that we used to by Prop 10 in 2018 alive, and essentially the same group of people lead that entity and are the opposition team on with respect to Prop 21. And they've made a lot of progress. Polling continues to be fairly similar to what it was and as it relates to Prop 10 at this time, maybe a little bit better than that because AB 1482 was passed. The politics I think are somewhat different in that we already have statewide rent control. So why do we need this other rent control proposal? And the campaign is proceeding well, there are something like or somewhere over a hundred organizations and you can see them all representing seniors, labor, community groups, et cetera that have joined Essex in opposing Prop 21. And there is a website if anyone's interested, which is noonprop21.boat. And I go to that website and see it. So, we're optimistic about it. We're fully a hundred percent support of it and we're raising money and we're preparing for the final showdown. So that is the story on Prop 21. Rich, maybe before I go on, do you have any follow ups on Prop 21? Well, it's difficult to see exactly how COVID is going to play out as it relates to that. Obviously, rents are declined and certainly since AB 1482 was passed, rents have declined. So, why not give 1482 a chance to work because it seems to be working. And again, what is the need for another ballot proposition that effectively attacks the same issue that the legislature has already acted upon. And I think that that issue actually helps us because, again, we have a legislative solution. So, why do we need to go to the ballot box? Certainly with respect to the sponsor that has very little to do with housing, and, and fight that battle. So, but that's where we are. And, we'll we will see, I mean, there'll be more coming out on Prop 21 in the coming weeks, so happy to discuss, if you want to call separately or whatever. And then, I guess I would also mentioned the porphyry of anti eviction ordinances, which are incredibly difficult and you're like, John, I give great credit to the ethics team because sorting through city, county state, and even, federal laws with respect to and I think ordinances and all the different things that are that are out there, there's a tremendous amount going on. They are constantly changing all of these various eviction ordinances being extended different terms. I think that there will likely be some legal action on some of them because they're pushing the envelope with respect to I think, what would normally seem to be appropriate in the circumstances. And I throw out as an example that San Francisco permanently banning landlords from eviction. This is at any time in the future for COVID-19 delinquencies. So, I mean, we definitely have an uphill struggle with respect to collections. And to the extent, it almost appears that if you never have to -- if you never have to have accountability for your delinquency, then it almost seems like and we can't -- there's no late fees, there's no interest charges, you almost make create a scenario where there's no incentive to pay the landlord. So, this is the dilemma because we're not in many cases allowed to ask for documentation of a COVID-19 hardship and normal things that one would expect. So, this continues to be an ongoing dilemma. Yes, we're here for very specific reasons. So, we -- I think we're actually pretty diversified as it relates to the major metros on the west coast, which, again, it's a big part of the globe, global economies while I think California and Washington or something like a fifth largest economy in the world. So, we're not talking about a small area and what we've done is tried to diversify with respect to product and in many, many cities up and down the West Coast. So, I think we're actually more diverse than that might seem. And having said that, why are we here? We're here because supply and demand for housing is very attractive and rents grow better over time. And so, if there were other places that had similar long term rent growth as the West Coast, we would likely be there. But that doesn't exist. And so, we're trying to maximize the growth of the portfolio over time and do it in a thoughtful way and certainly a risk adverse way, and diversify the portfolio within the West Coast, which again, it's a very large area. And so, we will look at and we constantly look at other geographies and other opportunities and we'll continue to do that. We certainly do that once a year in our strategic planning session with the Board, which comes up here in September. And so, we'll continue to do that and maybe this will change it a little bit, but I would say, the anecdote to maybe a little bit less diversity is a very strong balance sheet. So, you have to withstand the periods of time when there is more volatility and we've done that. And as a result, we believe that, we have kind of the best of both worlds. We have a very strong balance sheet that can withstand significant shocks and on the other hand have among the highest long-term growth rates and rents. Hey, Rich. We'll vote for you for governor. It looks like it's starting to abate finally, but I think it might be a little bit longer term than that. Having said that, we fell off the cliff in terms of occupancy in April and again, because of these anti eviction ordinances, we were probably more aggressive at letting people move on with their life if they lost their job and needed more affordable housing than some of the others. And that caused vacancy to decline more. And, but it also set us up to find a tenant that can be a good long-term tenant. And so there were some definite trade-offs during the quarter, and then playing catch up with respect to using concessions to build occupancy as John alluded to definitely cost us something. And again, as in July, we're in a much better position and we don't have that. We don't have that overhang that we have to deal with.  So I would say that's incrementally better, certainly unemployment going from improving by 400 basis points. That's going to help us in the quarter. So there is good news out there and but as I tried to allude to in my comments, we need the film production business to come back. That looks like a choppy road. And even restaurants, all the service jobs and restaurants and bars, et cetera, that looks like a somewhat choppy roads. So cautiously optimistic and we'll see, but I do think the next quarter will be better than the last that's for sure. Yeah, it's a little above. I mean, what we try to do is look at other major metros, similar to the West coast, there's some element of supply constraints. We look at the stability of the economy and the federal government in Washington DC is pretty darn stable employer of people. And so it tends to do better when things are or not ongoing, well, although it also can produce a fair amount of apartment supply at the same time, so that comes back and hurt it. But, we look at things much like trying to find markets that are like the West coast, which are very difficult to find. And then we also consider blurring the line. So at what point in time might we go to some of the other markets that are near our existing markets, but just a step further out.  We own an asset in Santa Cruz. We've owned assets in Tracy and the inland empire. And, I'd say, you know, our experience there is, those are very much timing markets. And so, is there a possibility of example, setting up a coinvestment type entity, which inherently will have an exit for a period of time and then exit and do more a timing type trading is something that we also consider and so I'm not sure what we're going to do. I do know that, from feedback from our board that they are going to want to take a harder look at this issue. So we'll be having more robust conversations about it. Yes, it is a great question. And I will say that we are surprised at the incredible, both number of eviction related and tenant protection related bills that come out of this. And it certainly in the short-term, we had our own our own self imposed limitations for 90-days on evictions and rent increases and a variety of other things. So I think that is something that is just appropriate and proper in dealing with this -- with the pandemic. But there's a point at which, and I would guess it will getting near that point that, things go too far. And so what we try to do is both certainly comply and understand all the existing ordinances that are out there. And again, they're at all different levels of government and they constantly change. And at the same time, try to advocate in our discussions with CAA and others like for example, if a resident, if this goes on for some prolonged period of time, if a resident was a certain amount of funds, shouldn't, they have some affirmative responsibility to prove their COVID-19 affect or impact or something like that.  And work with their tenant. There is a steer out there that, there's going to be widespread evictions, you're following this situation. And I look at it and we're realistic people, we have no interest in that, just mass evictions at all. In fact, we're better off working together, but it needs to be on several level playing field. We need them to essentially prove their or acknowledge their COVID-19 issue. And then we can react and try to do what is thoughtful for both of us. So the laws as they're currently constructed don't do that exactly. So there's a bunch of laws out there as you point out that prolong the eviction process and not just limited to the one you mentioned, but just on an ongoing basis.  And it still remains to be seen what happens with those laws. I mentioned, in San Francisco, the inability to evict anyone at any time indefinitely for COVID-19 delinquencies. And I'm not sure exactly how we get paid back on those particular delinquencies. So this has been a, an ongoing issue and certainly it's disappointing from our perspective, then that we have no ability to control our destiny. And it seems like people have the ability to essentially do things they shouldn't be allowed to do. So I'll leave it at that. Yes, Angela in her remarks talked about mass funding, firstly, everything that we do going forward. So that definitely is the plan and not just buy a stock, buy back preferred equity and others. So Angela outlined the her sources and uses for the rest of the year. So I think we're good -- I think we're on the same page with respect to how we're going to do that. Maintain a very strong balance sheet. A little bit hard to hear your question. So I'll repeat it. So I get it right. You're asking what the usual cadence for rent collection is if someone's delinquent, I think, and you were just in a different time. Because normally if someone's delinquent, we're going to obviously communicate with them either come up with an agreement with them, which case we're pretty reasonable. If they over the month rent, we're going to let them have a prepayment plan that's going to work over a reasonable amount of time. If they don't want to communicate, we're going to give him a three day notice and start a process and work through that.  So normally that's how it would go where it is today. Some of those options are not available. The communication is, and again, I'm very pleased to see that without any current hammers, we're seeing people step up and make payments on what they owe. Some people wanting to enter payment plans, others not they're concerned about whether they'd be able to keep those, but they're still paying more than their rent. And so we're seeing good behavior out of people in general. Hopefully that answers your question. Yeah. Hi. This is Mike. Yeah, we've slowed down a little bit on the stock buyback, and the thought there is that, the affects of COVID-19 are going to be with us for a longer period of time. And so, the impetus to do a lot of stock buy back quickly is less important. We are constantly watching debt-to-EBITDA and some of the other balance sheet metrics. And so, if you're selling assets to buy back stock, you're going to need to do leverage along the way, because as you sell an asset, obviously your EBITDA shrinking. So, we're mindful about how we do stock buyback. We're still very interested in it. It is still one of the things that is important to us. But, and again, funding it along the way with asset sales is an imperative action with respect to all of what we're doing. So I'd say, at this point in time, as Adam mentioned that, probably the preferred equity pipeline is going to be our go to source, given that, there are fewer providers out there and therefore we have a better selection of transactions to pick from and would be that. And, we definitely like co-investment transactions when the transaction market gets better and we see more quality assets that are trading. And obviously, it depends on what guys are trading out, but this idea of buying, let's say four and a half type cap rate with your cost of debt in the low to mid twos, that generates a whole lot of cash flow and is pretty attractive transactions. So, I think we're going to have opportunities on the external side and actually, I think this is, the fun part of the business, when there's disruption in the marketplace and lots of opportunity and we get to pick what the best use of capital is, I think that's what we do exceptionally well. Does that answer? Sure. So we're not giving away the metrics at this point in time on that, but I can tell you it'd be quite a change from the perspective of the customer being able to come in and lease on a mobile iPhone, literally set up, obviously some setting up the appointment all the way through to getting approved instantly and moving forward. So we're very excited about that. We think that will give us a great customer experience and positioned very well going forward when you're talking about the touchless, at this point in time, really we have, from a tour perspective and otherwise we can go touchless all the way through other than of course once they get to the site, they're going to move in. But, we're touchless across the board in that sense, does that answer the question? Very good. Thank you operator. And thank you everyone for joining the call today. Certainly our best wishes to you and your families during these very challenging times. And we hope to see you all either in person or on Zoom someday soon. Have a good day."

            "name": "Angela Kleiman",
            "content": "Thank you, John. I'll start with a few comments about the quarter followed by an update on our funding plan for investments and the balance sheet. As noted in our earnings release in earlier comments, this will be a challenging quarter with declines in both same property revenue growth and core FFO per share. The 3.8% decline in same property revenue growth is primarily driven by two key factors. First, we took a conservative approach and reserved against, approximately 75% of our delinquencies, which negatively impacted our same property revenue growth by 2.9%. This information is available in a new table at the bottom of Page 2 of our press release, along with other additional details. Second, we report concessions on the cash basis in our same property results, which reduced our growth rate by approximately 1% compared to using the straight line method. The combine negative impact to same property revenue growth from both of these accounting treatments is 3.9%. As for our core FFO per share growth, the total negative impact of delinquencies in the second quarter is 20%, without this, our core FFO per share growth would have been positive 1.5%. More details are available in a new reconciliation table on Page S-15 of the supplemental, along with additional disclosures on operations. On to operating expenses, same-store expenses increased by 6%, primarily driven by Washington property taxes, which have increased approximately 15% compared to the prior year. As you may recall, taxes in Seattle decreased by 5% in 2019, resulting in a difficult year-over-year comparison, our controllable expenses have remained generally in line with plan for the rest of the year. Turning to funding plan for investments and the stock buybacks, we are expecting to spend approximately 205 million in 2020 between our development pipeline and structural finance commitments. In addition, we have bought back 223 million of stock year-to-date, bringing total funding needs to 428 million. As for funding sources, we expect 150 million of structured finance redemptions and we closed on the sale of three assets for 284 million. In total, we have 434 million of funds available which covers all new funding obligations this year on a leverage-neutral basis. Moving onto capital markets, the finance team was very productive in the second quarter, securing a $200 million term loan, which was used to pay down all remaining 2020 debt maturities. In June, we opportunistically issued 150 million in bonds, achieving a 2.09% effective rate for 12-year CAGR and use the proceeds to pay down our line of credit. Lastly on the balance sheet, our reported net to EBITDA was 6.4 times, an increase from prior quarter primarily related to how we account for delinquency reserve. Adjusting for the impact of delinquencies, our net debt to EBITDA would have been six times. With nothing drawn on our line of credit, an approximately 1.4 billion in total liquidity, our balance sheet remains strong as we continue to maintain our discipline approach to capital allocation. Thank you and I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions. Michael, that's a good question. I think it depends on what it's being used for. So, for example, if it's for groceries or to relocate our tenants, it'll be a G&A item. But if it's for something that's revenue related, impacting, say, delinquencies, it would be a contra revenue items. And so, at this point, it's too early to see where that geography lands. But the intention is really more of a G&A item, and we'll see what that means anything. Hi, this is Angela here. If you're looking at the amount of revenue that is not reserved, we are essentially at over a 100% collected for same store, which means some of that of course goes towards delinquency. But keep in mind this is only July, one month. And so to John's point, we are seeing good behavior and most people are trying to be responsible, but it just too early to be okay what does that trend mean given this is July numbers."

So, as far as the stress goes on the land side of things, landowners are incredibly stubborn when it comes to decreasing their expectations on land values. So, yes, lots of inbound calls. But very few yields that seem to be getting a dry now. We haven't seen much if any decrease in construction costs so that coupled with some challenging a challenging rental environment, there's very little that we see right now that would pencil. We continue to be aggressive on the on the private equity side, because there are there are a number of legacy deals that that are out there searching for funding and construction lending standards have gotten somewhat higher and we've gotten more conservative with our with our prep underwriting. But even still, there's still a relatively high demand for that though. Like I said, we continue to have a robust pipelines. And that's probably where the, the main focus is going to be for the immediate future."

            "name": "John Burkart",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Our priority during this period was our people, the safety of our residents and our employees. I'm incredibly proud of what our team accomplished and how they worked together to serve and support our residents through this challenging time. Thank you, E team. Looking at the second quarter of 2020, the occupancy challenges that we faced early on related to a reduction in demand when the initial stay-at-home orders were implemented as opposed to an exodus of existing residents. During May, traffic increased substantially and we took advantage of the relative strength in our market by lowering our rental rates and offering significant leasing incentive in certain markets of two to eight weeks on stabilized properties, leading to an increase in our same-store occupancy of 110 basis points in June. The relative strength in the market continued into July, enabling us to increase our asking rent, decrease our leasing incentives and add another 80 basis points in occupancy. Our availability 30 days out as of the end of July was 10 basis points lower than where it was last year at this time. As our customers adapt to the new COVID-19 environment, we are seeing some consumer behavioral changes that make intuitive set. For example, with the current work-from-home practices, the value proposition of living in downtown San Francisco has temporarily changed since the restaurant, entertainment and sports venues have shut down. Additionally, the value of having more private indoor space presume calls, high speed internet and access to open space for outdoor activities have increased demand for suburban assets despite being a greater distance from corporate offices. We have also noted that work-from-home has turned into work-from-anywhere as we've seen several consultants moving back to their original home and continuing to work for their West Coast employer. Regarding the work-from-anywhere theme, we believe this trend will reverse when conditions permit. We were all positively surprised by the ease in which we all adapted to Zoom and believe that this experience will have a lasting impact on future same-day business travel. However, the loss of a personal connection frozen screens and barking dogs in the background, so the Zoom cannot replace the value that comes from in person interaction. If I heard someone say recently, I am done with living at work. We see the changes in consumer behavior within our portfolio, our same-store portfolio in Contra Costa, Ventura, Orange and San Diego at higher occupancies today than in pre-COVID March. Turning to our Q2 '20 results as presented on page two of our press release, year-over-year, revenues declined by 3.8%. On delinquencies various governmental bodies have enacted and continually extend resident protection along with prohibitions against late fees and eviction. These regulations have been a strong headwind for the industry and our markets compared to other metros. Thankfully, they are temporary in nature. Referring to the S-15, delinquency for our total portfolio on a cash basis was 4.3% in the second quarter of 2020 compared to 34 basis points in the second quarter of 2019. In the month of July on a cash basis, delinquency was 2.7%, which is down from the prior month. In July, 18% of our same-store assets had positive delinquency. Meaning the delinquency line item contributed positively to the revenues due to residents paying past due amount. We appreciate that our residents continues to prioritize their rental obligation. Moving on to our operating strategy in this new environment, our operations objective continues to be focused on maximizing revenue. Given current conditions, our strategies will evolve as the market changes and will vary across our market. For example, we will likely run lower occupancy in urban markets such as downtown San Francisco while targeting higher occupancies in highly desirable suburban markets, such as San Ramon. Overall, we believe that market occupancy has fallen about 150 basis points, and our same-store portfolio is expected to run at a lower occupancy for the remainder of the year. As noted on S-15 our supplemental and consistent with our expectations, our new lease rate, excluding leasing incentives, were down 5.8% in July compared to the prior year's period. We expect that market rental rates will remain depressed in the fall due to the seasonal decline in demand. That said, some of the historical factors such as contractors moving home in the fourth quarter are not an issue since they've already moved out due the work-from-home policies in place. On to tech initiatives, we continue to make considerable progress on the technology front as our employees learn how to optimize our new tools. For example, we currently have several leasing agents that are leveraging these tools that enable them to be two to three times more productive than the average leasing agent. We are seeing similar progress with our maintenance systems as well. Our emphasis will continue to be on people first, if we try to bring everyone up to speed. However, we expect that through the increased productivity and natural attrition, we will both lower our headcount and increase our compensation to our top performers. Another advancement in our technology roadmap includes the development of our mobile leasing app that is on target for pilot at the end of this year. The app is fully integrated with our other sales tools and will fundamentally change how we interact with our prospects, providing them with a simple, seamless 24/7 mobile experience. Finally, we are now offering ultrafast internet offered by market leading fiber providers that 10% of our assets, and we expect to complete installation at another 50% of our assets by year end. The ultrafast service is in great demand in our current work-from-home environment and is expected to be a great value adds asset for our residents. Turning to our markets, in the Seattle market year-over-year revenues in Q2 was down 20 basis points and occupancy was down 1%. The greatest decline during this period was in the Seattle CBD revenues declined to 70 basis points followed by the East side with a 20 basis point decline while revenues in the South saw an increase of 10 basis points in the same period. In July, unemployment in Washington remained 90 basis points below the U.S. average of 10.7%. In the same period, Amazon's job openings remained at just over 8,000 a year-over-year decrease of about 25%. Moving to Northern California and the Bay Area market, year-over-year revenues in Q2 were down 3.4%, revenues in San Francisco open CBD declined by 6.3% and 7.8% respectively although San Jose revenues declined only 1.5% in the same period. Tennessee job growth declined the least of our markets in Q2 and was a hundred basis points below the US decline of 11.3. In Southern California year-over-year revenues in the second quarter declined 5.7% well occupancy declined 2.1%. L.A. was our hardest hit market with a year-over-year revenue decline of 8.6% in Q2. Our L.A. County sub markets have declined between 8.4% and 9.7% in the same period with the greatest decline in L.A. CBD. The L.A. economy has been the most impacted out of all our markets with an unemployment rate of 19.5%, leading to a higher delinquency rate than our other markets. In Orange County, the South Orange submarket outperformed North Orange submarket with year-over-year revenue decline of 2.6% and 5.1% respectively in the second quarter. Finally, in San Diego, year-over-year revenue declined 2% in Q2 with the exception of the Oceanside submarket, which grew revenues by 2% in the same period, likely benefiting from the military stay-in-place order through the end of June. Currently, our same-store portfolio's physical occupancy is 96%. Our availability 30 days out is at 5.5% and our third quarter renewals are being sent out with an average reduction in rate of 1.4%. Thank you. And then, we'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Angela Kleiman. Yes, why don't I go ahead and start with that. This is John. I think we're actually positioned very well and what we're seeing is, people wanting to different value propositions. So, they're looking for our assets of which we have many that have a little bit lower price point or dollars per square foot, a little bit more space. They're in great locations as it relates to outdoor recreational opportunities, and then of course, access to high-speed and going forward gig speed Internet. So I think we're positioned very well for that. What we're seeing is, at this point in time, many of the tech companies have decided that they're going to defer occupying the buildings, a range of dates really starting from October through one of them throughout July of 2021. But in no cases, do we see that becoming permanent. And then again, it gets back to this reality of people are now realizing that as much as we all kind of suck it up and we're impressed with Zoom and really worked hard to make things work, which is fantastic, something is being lost. And with the competitive juices flowing, we strongly believe, the companies will want to bring people back together and they see the value like they've always saw the value in having that. And there's also another piece to it, which is, I can speak anecdotally. I was talking to someone over the weekend and they mentioned the idea of moving in the extended commute zone and their employers said, that's fine, buy you're going to get a 20% to 25% pay cut, obviously completely negating their perceived value of a lower real estate prices. So, no doubt, they're not moving and we think we're positioned very well for the long run with our portfolio. Does that answer it? Mike, do you have there? Michael, let me address that. So, there were expenses during the quarter, but we set the entity up toward the end of the quarter. So, what happened during the quarter was already expanded. And essentially, we created the entity in response to the needs that were out there and what we were seeing on the ground when we're dealing with the people. Our resident response team consists of some 50 to 60 Essex employees, and they're talking to our residents, couple times typically. And again, they're trying to -- we came up with a basket of needs and people that were really in difficult situations. And so, this is intended to respond to those needs on more of a prospective basis. Well, this is John. That's a great question. Well, again, as Mike had mentioned, we started in a hole in April really related to the shelter-in-place and just the demand stopped for a period of time. So, as we moved in as traffic increase pretty dramatically in May and then we took advantage of that decided to fill up the portfolio, and big picture there's a thing that we like, which is, let's not be proud and vacant. And vacant unit really obviously earned nothing, so we made the decision to get aggressive and offer some leasing discount or leasing incentives to enable us to gain occupancy and we ultimately gained about 200 basis points of occupancy between June and July, and that's positioned as well. We subsequently pulled back on concession and we're still offering them in certainly market-by-market, it depends. But taking some of our markets suburban markets like the San Diego, Orange County, Ventura, Contra Costa, in many of those cases, we've pulled back quite a bit on concession and those occupancies are riding higher. And in actuality, they're actually higher, as I mentioned in my remarks than they were in March. So, we look at it and say, the best thing is to position ourselves so that we're leading the market and not allow ourselves to be sitting vacant. And so, that's why we took that action. Right now, we're in a pretty good spot and we're just watching the market on literally a daily basis, understanding what's going on. There are some areas that are more distressed. Certainly, San Francisco, we only have less than a thousand units there, but San Francisco is definitely under stress. And I'll also know San Francisco about 30% of our units are so our studios and studios are clearly a challenged unit type in this market. The process has moved out so that's also putting a little bit of excessive pressure on the San Francisco market in our numbers. Does that answer your question? Yes. So concession, I mean, think of it in this particular market, I would think of it very similar to a development of lease up, where you offer concessions to incent someone to move. And obviously, there's certain real cost of moving and then there's just the pure motivation of moving. And so, when we desire to fill up our portfolio, we offered concessions. It's not really reflective on necessarily market rents are lower. Doing often the concessions enabled us to gain a significant amount of occupancy. So, I would look at it that way. I don't want to answer around though. There are clear to concessions in the marketplace. We were more aggressive because we wanted to fill up our portfolio and we've now backed away quite a bit from that. Our average confessions, I know in the supplemental, you're looking at saying four to eight weeks and that was pretty common. But the average concession during June was closer to 4% or four weeks for a little bit less than that that we used to, which enable us to fill out. So, there was a range. We clearly got assets and then serial concessions and some that were at eight weeks and sort of tendency a footnote in the financials. Yes. That is correct. And I'll ask you to throw in one more comment on the renewals to get a little clarity. The renewals go out typically 60 days plus into the marketplace, both we're trying to give our customers time to make a decision. And then, there's certain laws that prevent us from sending them out, say less than 30 days. And so, what can happen is the market can move between the time you send the renewal out, which is what happened in the second quarter and when it actually becomes effective. So, we would have had renewals that were effective in June that may have been signed in March, if that makes sense, always get a leg of the market rent, which are happening at that point in time. Yes, so with renewals much less, it's probably about 10% of what we're doing with the new leases and the renewals go out without any concessions. They can get negotiated in depending upon the situation. But our renewals, really, I expected the renewable going forward. That'll really dry up because the market is changing right now. And so, where we were in June and what we negotiated in June, we negotiated less in July and probably less again in August. So, maybe a week or something or less than that, I mean, because again, most of them don't even have concessions for the renewals. So we're not really trying to extend some of the move that's where we're trying to intent some of the move that's because they come into play because it really is a matter of they have moving costs. And so there's kind of this exchange that goes on. I'll start. I'm sure Mike might have some comments. But there's a lot of risk factors out there, Alex. So certainly factually, today, the market is better today than it was yesterday, the day before, et cetera. And this is all a good thing. And we feel good about that our portfolio is positioned very well, all things considered. But there's obviously things that are happening, related to COVID that throw risk factors. There is some unusual, there are some positives, as I mentioned earlier consultants, they usually move out in the fourth quarter, well, that's not going to happen because they already moved out. We didn't have insurance come in, and therefore they won't move out. So, those are positives that may enable us to have a longer leasing period. And then, there's some interesting things going around some of the colleges, for example, many of them are doing partially online. And that requires you to be very tethered to the university because you may be online for a class and then a half an hour later, you have a lab on site, but you still need to live right at that university and they cut down the occupancy. My family just went through this and my daughter got bumped out of her spot. So, she's now an apartment. And so, there's things like that that are positive, but there's obviously risk factors out there. And I'll flip it over the Mike if you have more to add there. I'm glad to, first I have to give you guys some credit, you've done a nice job trying to track things. So I appreciate that it's out there, but I would say what we're picking up and what ethics does is got of frustration out of not having a great market data, because some of the vendors aren't doing a great job. We created our own proprietary database. So we've got over a thousand assets and we're tracking. And then what we find is different days, different competitors are offering concessions. They're doing it in different units. And so there are commonly assets there that are offering maybe four day a week. But that doesn't mean that those are the only units that are renting. And what we saw back in June was many of the bigger owners were trying to gain occupancy. Increased absorption, just like a very large development lease, ultimately, are multiple leases competing against each other, that works for us and can't speak for our peers that that works for us. And so we're backing off, and we're continuing to find that we're receiving leases in many cases, without concessions, not all those cases San Francisco is different in your asset by asset we have different plans, but that the idea of having a concession to help pay the moving cost to them, some of the move has paid off for us.  And again, we're generally backing off now, when you get into a very competitive spot like downtown Oakland in the CBD or San Francisco or downtown San Jose, there's lease up going on in LA, there's lease up going on and so things get blurred a little bit because you've got to lease up, consider offering concessions. If you're stabilizing down the street, you're probably still offering large concessions. So, there's a little blurring going on. But we are seeing as you get down to other markets that like say, Ventura, lots of Orange County, San Diego, in many cases, conditions just drying up. And that's kind of what can happen with secession isn't there in the market, and then they just dry up rather rapidly. And we are seeing that happen. So, the overall, again, really as a tool to increase absorption, and I understand your ideas and that effective, but the reality is we try to use them to increase absorption and they worked well for us. Does that answer your question? And again with us, yes. Why reference we gain 200 to 190 basis points in occupancy because there was an impact from we offer concessions, we increased interest in tax, and we're backing off of that. So, that worked well done to create excess demand. So, yes, -- if they went on forever, yes. Then they're part of the market. That'd be different. Sure, well, yes, we look at about 10% urban and 90% suburban. And there's, obviously can be some blending that goes on certainly as you get into some of the locations in Southern California, where it's, kind of blended but overall, we look at 10% we have very little incentive to under 1000 units in downtown market in our store portfolio. Yeah. I can definitely tell you on that. If you were to look at it truly on net effective and in this regard the increase in absorption, so just weird advanced transact net effective. They definitely get better in July. And they're going to comment on the renewals, not all the renewals concessions and in many cases it was a week or something like that. So, it wouldn't be translate to a, let's say, an average of an 8% or one month on the renewals. That's the renewals were closest to offer 1% somewhere in that area. But on the new leases, again, the focus was on the new leases with the concessions to increase absorption. So, in some of that has gone away. And so, if you look at it purely that way net effect, yeah, definitely rents are up in July over June."

        "content": "Operator: Good day and welcome to the Essex Property Trust First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you. You may begin.\nMichael Schall: Thank you for joining our call today. John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments, and Adam Berry is here for Q&A. These are challenging times as we manage through unprecedented events in our nation\u2019s history. We would like to offer our best wishes to all those impacted by COVID-19, their caregivers and those participating on the call today. We reported a strong first quarter results last night, exceeding the midpoint of our FFO per share guidance by $0.07, with the results for the quarter mostly unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic. As noted in the press release, we withdrew our 2020 FFO guidance ranges. Generally, we believe providing FFO guidance and related assumptions is an important aspect of investor communications. However, in the current environment, we believe that the range of probable outcomes for Essex is too wide to be useful to investors. Since the initial shelter-in-place order in the Bay Area was announced on March 17, the nation has experienced over 30 million unemployment claims, and economic uncertainty is as great as I have ever seen. Key variables in the government\u2019s policy response are impossible to model such as the duration of the shutdown, the possibility that a second wave of infection could occur and the effectiveness of social distancing during a phased reopening of the economy. After a prolonged debate, we made the difficult decision to withdraw our core FFO guidance. In my prepared remarks today, I will cover three topics: a recap of actions taken in the past 2 months in response to the pandemic, a review of our updated estimates for rent growth in our markets as can be found on Page S-16 of the supplemental and insights into what we\u2019re seeing in the West Coast property transaction markets. Turning to our response to the pandemic, we have been very impressed with how the Essex team has responded and adapted to the dynamic and unprecedented conditions created by COVID-19. As the scope of the pandemic became more clear in early March we created a COVID response team comprised of senior leadership to gather information and act decisively. To maintain essential property operations, we implemented a variety of social distancing practices at each property; provided incentives and tools to push nearly all transactions online, over the phone or through the mail. We acquired and distributed PPE to our on-site staff and expanded training for safety protocols. We transitioned 5 corporate offices to work from home and implemented a virtual management process with daily contact via teleconference. In addition, we conducted weekly live video conferences that were available to all Essex employees to ensure consistent messaging and unity in a chaotic time. Communication is important during periods of uncertainty. And on March 23, we issued a press release to outline for investors, employees and residents how the company is going to assist those that are financially impacted by COVID-19, including protection from eviction and late fees, creation of payment plans and dissemination of information about governmental and community resources. The past 2 months have required urgent responses to many complex issues, including many unknowables related to the pandemic itself, a plethora of well-intentioned but imprecise government regulations and properly balancing our obligations to stakeholders in the spirit of corporate responsibility. With that backdrop, it\u2019s essential to recognize the tireless efforts of the Essex team amid great concern for their health and safety of their families to rapidly and thoughtfully react to the crisis. Well done, team Essex. Turning to the West Coast rental markets, we have prepared a scenario for our 2020 rent growth expectations on Slide S-16 of the supplemental that incorporate macro U.S. forecasts for GDP and job growth that are prepared by a broad spectrum of industry and Wall Street economists. While the span of forecasted outcomes is wide to an unprecedented extent, there is a common expectation that the U.S. will experience double-digit declines in second quarter GDP growth and an overall contraction in the economy in 2020, with job losses for the year estimated at around 7%. In summary, we expect approximately 900,000 job losses or 6.6% in our West Coast metros in 2020 compared to the net addition of 207,000 jobs from our estimate last quarter. An approximate 14% reduction in estimated total housing deliveries from last quarter is not sufficient to offset the impact of negative job growth, leading to our belief that market rents overall will decline an average of 2.8% in 2020 versus last quarter\u2019s estimated 3% increase in market rents. The extraordinary fiscal and monetary stimulus programs that have been implemented by the federal government have already helped stabilize capital markets and should limit the risk of financial contagion. If you consider by contrast the major stimulus programs from the Great Recession, they occurred roughly a year after the recession started. But in today\u2019s case, they were just days and weeks into the crisis and have been much larger in scope. On Page S-16.1 of our supplemental, we highlight the impact of the $600 per week federal supplement to unemployment insurance that was part of the CARES Act. While the effectiveness of the program has been muted by processing delays at state unemployment offices, the weekly checks have started to arrive and will substantially offset the income loss for a large segment of the population that has suffered from job losses and furloughs. We highlight this program because it hasn\u2019t received much attention. Given these benefits, the income shortfalls for lower to middle income workers are much less severe than they would have been otherwise. And in some cases again, at lower and middle income levels, some workers will receive more in unemployment benefit as compared to their compensation. Finally, I will turn to the apartment transaction market. Yields or cap rates for apartment transactions generally exceed interest rates on related debt, and the resulting positive leverage is a powerful force in the market. Unlike the great financial crisis, large banks have maintained relatively conservative lending standards and strong liquidity and capital positions, and interest rates have declined further since the crisis began. As an example, we recently received a quote for a 7-year Fannie Mae loan on a joint venture property with a fixed interest rate of 2.75%. We believe these factors will be sufficient to avoid widespread distress in the apartment space. Unlike REIT stocks, private market values in terms of cap rates are generally sticky, meaning that they don\u2019t change immediately in reaction to events but rather seek to reflect the longer-term financial performance of a property. Generally speaking, many potential buyers are seeking a higher cap rate as a result of the pandemic. However, apartment owners generally have no distress, and exceptionally low interest rates provide the opportunity to improve cash flow through refinance to take advantage of record-low positive leverage. As a result of these factors, the spread between buyer and seller expectations has widened and the gap separating them is probably around 30 to 60 basis points, likely resulting in fewer apartment transactions in the near term. If our stock price was higher, we would be an aggressive buyer in this environment. Historically, periods of disruption have resulted in great opportunity for Essex. I am confident that we have the team, resources and strategy to thoughtfully act on these opportunities, consistent with our long-term track record of outperformance. And now I will turn the call over to John Burkart.\nJohn Burkart: Thank you, Mike. I would like to start by echoing Mike\u2019s sentiment and recognize our associates who are working hard to provide our customers the best service in this essential business of providing housing. Over the past few weeks, we have seen countless demonstrations of the Essex spirit throughout our community. Our teams have shown grit and determination in the face of rapidly changing working conditions. But even more, they have shown compassion to each other and to our residents, from proactively reaching out to those in need, buying residents groceries and even obtaining and distributing personal protective equipment. In addition, we have published resources on our website to assist residents in finding the financial assistance they may need during this time as well as created a library of resources for residents whose children are home from school or who are simply looking for productive ways to use their time during this crisis. Most residents and prospects have been understanding of the changes we needed to make at our communities and appreciative of the great efforts of our team to continue to provide exceptional service during this time, a big thank you to our e-team, our residents and the community. We are truly all in this together. Turning to our first quarter 2020 results, we achieved 3.2% revenue growth over the prior year\u2019s quarter. The results were in line with our expectations. Although this is the Q1 call, I believe everyone is more interested in recent events post-COVID shelter-in-place orders, therefore I will be focusing on specific April metrics and recent market activity. I will begin with general comments and move on to the markets. As this situation is unprecedented, with numerous key variables impacting both supply and demand, my commentary on the future market expectations and conditions relies on numerous, generally positive assumptions such as the relaxation of the shelter-in-place orders in the near future, a reduction of new supply entering the market and a restart of the economy in an orderly way. Currently, the rental market is disrupted. There is a gap between the bid/ask price for rental transactions at certain properties in the market. Rental transactions are disproportionately occurring at stabilized properties, offering 2 to 4 weeks free rent, while other properties are losing occupancy. April 2020 year-over-year same-store economic rents were up approximately 1.5%, while financial occupancy declined 1.3% compared to the prior year\u2019s period. We are currently offering various leasing incentives, which includes 2 to 4 weeks free rent. I expect the market will move back to equilibrium in June as the shelter-in-place requirements are relaxed and we enter the summer leasing season. Historically, during periods of reduced demand, our portfolio has benefited from people taking advantage of lower pricing and moving from the outlying areas to the core areas where our portfolio is located. I expect the same market dynamics to play out in the coming months. Looking at operations post shelter-in-place, leasing applications in our portfolio bottomed the first week of April and have increased each week since that time. Our same-store financial occupancy decreased 1.3% in April from March. Roughly half of the decline in occupancy was due to COVID-19-related lease breaks. The remainder was related to reduced leasing velocity. This last week, we have seen activity increase dramatically. Our tours increased 47%, and our applications increased 62% over the prior 4-week period average. The initial shock appears to be over, and now the market is moving to equilibrium. Now we will turn to April delinquencies, delinquencies in our total portfolio on a cash basis was 5% in April compared to 33 basis points for the full first quarter of 2020. As the magnitude of this crisis became more apparent in March, we acted immediately to form a resident response team to engage with our residents in understanding their situations, identifying resources for them and partnering with them to get them back on to firm financial ground. As noted in S-15, approximately 4,600 tenants, representing 7.4% of our total portfolio, completed our online request form in April, confirming that they had been financially impacted by COVID-19 and requesting assistance. 36% of those residents paid their April rent in full. Another 36% made a partial payment averaging about 50% of their rent and 28% were unable to pay their April rent. Residents representing 60 basis points of our portfolio requested to move out immediately, which we allowed, enabling the residents to move forward with their life and the company to potentially avoid future delinquency. Of the residents who stated they were financially impacted by COVID-19, 16% were in the food and beverage industry; 9% each in retail and personal services, which relates to fitness, massage or beautician services; and 7% each in healthcare, transportation, construction and professional and business services. 2.2% of our residents are delinquent, and we have been unable to contact them. However, some of them have made partial payments. Interestingly, the delinquency at the property level within a selected market had fairly large variations. Certain properties were substantially more impacted than others. I believe this disproportionate impact is the root cause of the market dislocation. I would compare it to randomly located new lease-ups aggressively attempting to increase occupancy. Owners at the highly impacted buildings with respect to occupancy and/or delinquency as well as those who are struggling to compete in this new virtual sales world are likely to be the ones aggressively offering concessions. On to expenses, as Mike has mentioned, we have withdrawn our financial guidance. However, I want to note some expense considerations. Utility usage and related expenses will be higher due to the shelter-in-place mandates. In addition, we expect a significant ongoing increase in expenses related to personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies as well as related increased labor cost due to new cleaning protocols. Finally, to protect our employees and residents, we have stopped performing non-emergency work orders in occupied units. We have provided residents with self-help videos and other resources to help them fix many of their own issues. However, we expect that there will be some level of pent-up work orders as conditions change. Moving on to our operating strategy in this new environment, our technology vision and related operating strategy that we have been executing positioned us well going into this rapid change. Our cloud-first strategy enabled a relatively smooth transition as the stay-at-home orders were implemented. We remained fully operational while rapidly transitioning to working from home. The new operating environment of social distancing requires a solid digital presence, including video tours, digital maps, self-help information and related videos as well as smartphones for FaceTime tours and other similar tours. We made the decision early on to rapidly accelerate our technology-enabled transformation, completing the implementation of our mobile maintenance app 2.0, our sales lead management system 2.0 and several other initiatives, shaving 4 to 12 months off the original rollout plans. As the restrictions are relaxed, we are positioned well for this new environment. Our operating strategy going forward will balance occupancy and market rents, maximizing revenue. We will likely operate at a lower occupancy than we have over the past several years. We will continue to leverage our technology platform and operate consistent with the social distancing protocols by using a combination of virtual tours and live video tours, where our sales associate is either on site touring a prospect via phone, or the resident is on site and the sales associate is live answering questions and explaining various features and benefits of the particular unit and amenity. Our smart lock digital entry systems enable us to provide access to vacant units for self-tours, thus eliminating the need for agents to be on site to provide access. These were very challenging weeks for certain, but we are emerging from this challenge stronger and we are well prepared for the future. Turning to our markets, in the Seattle market, April 2020 year-over-year same-store economic rents were up 6.1%, while financial occupancy declined 80 basis points compared to the prior year\u2019s period. Delinquency in the northern technology-driven markets, were lower. In April, delinquency in our Seattle same-store portfolio was 1.8%, the lowest in our same-store portfolio. Moving to Northern California, in the Bay Area, April 2020 year-over-year same-store economic rents were up 17 basis points, while financial occupancy declined 1.2%. Delinquencies for the same period in the Bay Area were 3.9%. Our Santa Clara County submarket had the lowest delinquency at 2%, while Alameda, San Mateo and Contra Costa County were 4.1%, 6.3% and 7.9%, respectively. Consistent with the rest of the market, our 4 Bay Area lease-ups, 500 Folsom, Station Park Green, Mylo and Patina at Midtown, had very little activity since late March, which was the result of both the construction challenges as well as reduced demand in the marketplace. Continuing South, Southern California same-store economic rents were up 1.1% year-over-year in April 2020, while financial occupancy declined 1.6%. In the same period, our Southern California region had a higher delinquency overall in our same-store portfolio at 7.5%. Ventura and San Diego delinquency was at 4.4% and 4.5%, respectively. Orange County delinquency was 7.5%, and L.A. County delinquency was 9.4%. Our L.A. CBD and Woodland Hills submarkets were the hardest-hit at 12.1% and 13.8%, respectively. As of April 30, our same-store portfolio\u2019s physical occupancy was 94.4%, and our availability 30 days out is 6.5%. Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Angela Kleiman.\nAngela Kleiman: Thank you, John. I will briefly comment on our first quarter results then provide an update on our funding plans and the balance sheet. We had a strong start to the year with first quarter same-property NOI growth of 3.9% and core FFO per share exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by $0.07 and achieving a 7.7% growth compared to the same period last year. As noted in our earnings release, we have withdrawn our 2020 guidance as a result of the unprecedented uncertainty caused by the COVID pandemic. Subsequently, we have enhanced our disclosure by providing additional data on April operations and more liquidity details on Page S-15. Turning to our funding plan for investments, stock buybacks and dividends, during the first quarter, we committed $106 million of capital towards structure finance investments at an average yield of 11.2%. The funding for these investments is expected to start around September and occur over a period of 6 to 12 months thereafter, which means our funding needs for 2020 is only about $40 million. Similarly, our development funding needs for 2020 is also de minimis at about $75 million. This represents 50% of our total development commitment shown on Page S-11. In fact, approximately 90% of the current development pipeline is expected to complete lease-up within the next year. We have begun reducing our exposure to direct development several years ago because the rate of construction costs increased at a greater pace than rent growth, ultimately compressing yields. Hence, this is consistent with the plan we have discussed on previous calls. Moving on to funding sources, we expect to receive a total of $215 million from structured finance repayments, of which $115 million can be allocated to our investment needs noted earlier and $100 million can be allocated to fund our stock buyback. Since we have repurchased $176 million of stock, the remaining $76 million will be match-funded with cash flow from operations. As for our dividends, during the first quarter, we raised the annual dividends by 6.5%, which represents the 26th consecutive dividend increase. We are proud of this track record, which few companies have achieved. Even though cash flow from operations may be lower than the original plan for this year, the dividend remains very secure and covered by free cash flow. With over $1 billion in liquidity, no debt maturities in 2020 and our funding commitments well covered, Essex remains in a strong financial position. Thank you. And I will now turn the call back to the operator.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nicholas Joseph with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nNicholas Joseph: Thanks. Mike, you mentioned the transaction market and that your cost of equity isn\u2019t where you would like it to be, but if you see good external growth opportunities, either repurchasing your shares or on the acquisition market, would you execute an increased near-term leverage?\nMichael Schall: Hi, Nick. Thanks for the question. I appreciate it. I think at this point in time, given this incredible uncertainty, we would like to stay more leverage-neutral in terms of how we approach our different investment types. Not to say that we won\u2019t sell property in order to pursue other types of opportunities, but at this point in time, until we see greater clarity because I would say at this point in time there are more unknowns than knowns out there given the unprecedented nature of the pandemic itself. And so we are going to remain fairly conservative when it comes to leverage for the foreseeable future.\nNicholas Joseph: Thanks. And then just maybe on operations, you mentioned the concessions that you are seeing on some stabilized properties, what sort of concessions are you seeing on lease-up properties today in the different markets?\nJohn Burkart: Sure. This is John. The lease-up properties just going back to the stabilized just for a second, what we are seeing is we are seeing 2 to 4 weeks pretty common is where we are seeing rental transactions. And I mentioned the comment as far as dislocation because simply looking at asking rents and assuming that asking reflects the actual rent, that\u2019s what I\u2019m getting at. It doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect that. Where the transactions are occurring is where there are some level of concessions that are going on out there. As we move from the stabilized market, and that, again, back a step, that really relates to what I see as a dislocation that\u2019s caused by the impact of some of the delinquencies hitting certain properties and not others, kind of creating many lease-ups out there. I think that will abate in the near future. As we move to the lease-ups, the lease-up concessions are closer to 2 months, and there are some other specials that are going on. Again, the whole market just kind of expanded out from shorter concessions on lease-ups and no concessions on stabilized, to 2 to 4 weeks stabilized and basically 8 weeks on a new product across the board. Does that answer your question?\nNicholas Joseph: Yes. That was very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Hi, good morning out there. I am curious what your thoughts are on the collections across your markets, married with the comment you said regarding the slow rollout of unemployment benefits and then also balancing that with some of the tenant activism that\u2019s made headlines of late?\nJohn Burkart: Yes, I will take that. What we are seeing, I am going to start with an amazing event and we are really seeing some good people that were impacted by situations outside their control, really all trying to figure it out and do the right thing. I don\u2019t want to focus on the potential of a few bad actors. The reality is we have a lot of great people that are working hard. Our resident response team is engaged with them and we are seeing good behavior by really the majority of those people. I acknowledge there are some people we haven\u2019t connected with. But even those people, some of them have actually paid some levels of rent. They might just be a little bit shell-shocked from this whole situation. My expectation is that as the government assistance rolls out, that people will probably make as much rent payments as they can. And then again, as I mentioned, we do expect the relaxation of some of the shelter-in-place requirements and a somewhat orderly challenged, but orderly economic improvement. And so we expect to see people starting to go back to work, being able to pay rent. And for those that can\u2019t pay rent, they may end up moving out. But again, our markets that we\u2019re in benefit from this chronic undersupply. And so what we\u2019ve always seen in the past is whenever there is some level of a shock, it takes some time, 1 to 3, 4 months, and we start to have people from the outside areas moving into our markets and supporting occupancy and therefore, rents. So I see \u2013 I have a somewhat optimistic view as to how this goes, but again, I want to be very candid that where we are today, there is a little bit of dislocation going on right now.\nAustin Wurschmidt: That\u2019s helpful. What do you think the likelihood that you collect some of that unpaid or delinquent rent is over time as some of those benefits roll in?\nMichael Schall: Hi this is Mike, Austin. We don\u2019t know. Honestly, that falls in the bucket of we actually have more unknowns than knowns, which is why we didn\u2019t give guidance. I think this is one of the key issues out there. And historically, as John said, we have somewhere around 30 to 40 basis points of delinquency. And it does not present an accounting issue. We just assume. Effectively, we treat it on a cash basis. And so it\u2019s a little bit different now. And fortunately, because of the timing of when all this happened, we have pretty much 3 months to work through those issues and have better information. We know, historically, that the further you get away from the move-out date, the more difficult it is to collect. And that\u2019s just our experience over time. And so we are motivated to move pretty quickly and which of course, many of these eviction prohibitions and other governmental actions prevent us from doing that. And so as John said in his prepared remarks, which I think is important here, that if someone comes to us and says, hey, I will move out, we are going to likely let them out of their lease, which means that we are going to have a little bit more turnover, but we\u2019re going to control the unit at a time when, again, because of these eviction prohibitions, we don\u2019t have a lot of choices. So we\u2019re working through all that. It\u2019s, I think, one of the more complicated issues that we have to deal with, with respect to this whole challenging scenario.\nAustin Wurschmidt: That\u2019s helpful. And I know there is still a lot of uncertainty, but you guys kind of leading into this had preferred equity over ground-up development. I am curious as you think about coming out of this and how you want to be opportunistic how are you weighing those types of investments?\nMichael Schall: Yes, this is Mike. And Adam is here too so he may want to add something, but yes, we still like the preferred equity investment. We are not in the first loss piece. Again, we come in to those transactions at the point in time that they are beginning construction. So costs are known, financing is in place, et cetera. So we are not taking a great deal of risk upfront. And typically, those deals underwrite to somewhere in the high 4 to low 5 cap rate and they were of course at around the 85% loan-to-value ratio, which means our effective cap rate is somewhere in the mid-5s. So, the chances of having distress at that level I think is incredibly unlikely. And in terms of investment policy going over \u2013 going forward, direct versus preferred equity, I will let Adam handle that.\nAdam Berry: Yes. To echo what Mike has said, we continue to aggressively pursue on the pref equity side throughout this crisis. We\u2019ve underwritten deals a little more conservatively, increased interest rates commensurately with our additional cost of capital that\u2019s happened over the last month or so. And we\u2019ve continued to identify deals, and we\u2019re in the process of due diligence on a number of pref equity deals. Going forward, there are definitely development deals out there and we will continue to track and monitor. There is some expectation that costs will come back toward us with decreased construction. We haven\u2019t seen any of it so far, and we have our finger on the pulse with a number of pref equity deals out there right now. So haven\u2019t seen a decrease in pricing, and sellers are very, very hesitant to decrease their pricing expectations. So I think the development world will take a little pause, but we continue to like I said aggressively pursue on that side.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Thank you. All very helpful.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.\nNick Yulico: Hi, everyone. I just want to first ask on the market rent forecast you gave, which is for market rents being down about 3% this year. Can you just give us a feel for how fast that could manifest in your portfolio in terms of a decline in new lease rates? And I guess I am also wondering if the impact could be bigger than that on a short run basis and you assume some sort of recovery in rates in the back half of the year, any perspective there would be helpful?\nMichael Schall: Yes, Nick. This is Mike and I am sure Mr. Burkart has an opinion on this one as well. So I think what you have here is a shock to the system. And anecdotally, lots of people that can\u2019t afford their apartment, potentially moving to different places and other things. So that will be the shock to the system. And then there\u2019s a recovery. The recovery is almost always people backfilling from further-out locations into areas that are closer to the jobs, and then we benefit from that over time, but this takes time to play out. So this presumes, since we were up 3% in Q1, on S-16, last quarter and now we are at minus 2.8%, it assumes a pretty dramatic drop-off in market rents. Of course, we don\u2019t turn units. We turn units ratably throughout the year. I think part of that, because we enter what\u2019s traditionally a more seasonal period, so the fourth quarter is a little bit more challenging for us on the demand side anyway, we still have the deliveries of apartments into the markets. And so we think it will be pretty choppy going into the fourth quarter, and then we think it recovers from that point on. So the other point I would make is John\u2019s comment about stabilized concessions. I think that stabilized concessions are assumed to continue in our economic growth forecast on Page S-16. And again, just to remind everyone what this is. This is a scenario based on macro factors, effectively supply demand factors. When you throw them into our model for what happens with various supply demand factors, what happens to rents, this is what we get. There is still a whole bunch of unknowns on top of this. Again, the policy issues, will there be more regulation in these markets, which we don\u2019t see. We think there has been plenty of regulation, actually, but we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen with that. The cadence of move-ins and move-outs, we can\u2019t predict that. And the collection of the delinquency is another challenging subject. So that\u2019s why we decided to give this data on S-16 without giving guidance because there is a whole another level of assumptions. And we think that there is enough very large assumptions embedded in S-16 that it just didn\u2019t make sense to push it further.\nNick Yulico: Okay, that\u2019s helpful, Mike. And then just in terms of supply if we look, Oakland and San Jose are two markets that are facing some of the biggest supply deliveries in the second quarter, third quarter of this year. Is your sense that any of those projects have now been delayed in terms of timing? And then also, if you could just maybe tell us in a real-time basis what you are seeing for projects that are delivering and lease-up, I mean is it you mentioned 2 months earlier. Is that the norm in these markets, is it worse than that? Thanks.\nMichael Schall: Yes, it\u2019s \u2013 it can be worse than that. But I would focus you on the percent of supply, total supply to total stock, which is at 0.6% for the portfolio. And Northern California is a little bit higher at 0.7%. But then, again, Northern California also has more momentum. I think we believe that tech markets are the winner here. And because their business models are pretty COVID-19-resistant for the most part, not that venture capital hasn\u2019t been affected, it has a little bit and jobs haven\u2019t been affected they have. Although when we look at, for example, the top 10 technology companies, job openings are down a little bit, but they\u2019re still very strong. So our view is that the tech markets do better here, and we\u2019ll continue on the path of leading the West Coast markets. And obviously, that\u2019s been a key part of our investment. So I guess what I\u2019m saying is I would be less concerned about supply in Northern California, given the strength, the overall strength of the job markets and the companies here. Probably, if we have a concern, even though it appears to be the least amount of supply, it\u2019s Southern California because it doesn\u2019t have the job drivers that Northern California and Seattle have.\nNick Yulico: Okay, thank you.\nMichael Schall: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Neil Malkin with Capital One Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nNeil Malkin: Hi, everyone. I wanted to go back to \u2013 I just wanted to kind of go back to the question that Austin brought up. I believe in your supplement, you\u2019ve called out 2% of the delinquency is \u2013 or 2% of the total rent is people who are not affected by COVID but haven\u2019t paid. So that\u2019s basically the moral hazard. I guess I would be interested in, if you can at all, Mike, just maybe walk through what markets you\u2019re the most concerned about. Obviously, people are talking about rent strikes. It seems like the legislature and judges have no interest of pushing through evictions anytime soon. I guess any more color on how you see that kind of playing out, when you see the eviction, I guess, the market normalizing? And how much worse could that moral hazard get as we continue to have an elevated unemployment environment for a longer period of time?\nMichael Schall: Yes. It\u2019s a good question. And I believe you\u2019re talking about, on S-15, the 2.2% which is the percentage of units delinquent in April not requesting assistance. So I guess most of that category is people that we haven\u2019t heard from. And I think that there are really 2 components. There is the moral hazard component, those that just want to take advantage of the situation, the various laws and the reluctance of the courts to process evictions, et cetera. But I think there\u2019s another piece of that, which is people that are just overwhelmed and/or, for whatever reason, ignore their notices. So I think it\u2019s still a little bit early to tell exactly how that breaks down. I guess, from my perspective, that\u2019s not a huge number in the scheme of things because I know when we were talking to our Board, we gave them a much larger range of delinquents. And so I think our actual experience is better than what we thought. And I was concerned that, to your point, that if you\u2019re going to give people, there\u2019s no hammer as it relates to evictions, maybe in late fees for some period of time as part of our overall program to try to help residents through this difficult period, etcetera, that there might be more of those people that just say, oh, I\u2019m just not going to pay rent. Keep in mind that they still have a credit issue, and so there is a reason to pay rent. They still owe the money. And we still fully intend to pursue the collection effort. And we will have to approach it a bit differently, given the magnitude of it. And so \u2013 but we\u2019re going to still push hard to collect it where we can. So this falls within one of the unknowns, and we\u2019re not sure exactly what\u2019s going to happen with that category. Fortunately, it\u2019s only 2.2%.\nJohn Burkart: Yes. Mike, let me just add. In my comments, I mentioned that those are the people that we haven\u2019t spoken with. But I also said some of them have actually paid partial payments. So to be clear, you can\u2019t look at that group and say that they\u2019re a moral hazard. I\u2019ll give you an example. One of the things we did at Essex is we \u2013 early on, realizing the challenge that this was for so many people, we identified residents that have been challenged with us in the past. They may have had reviews that they wrote that they were upset with for whatever reason, and we reached out to them just to check and see how they were doing. The feedback we got was amazing, but what we found is many people were somewhat shell-shocked. They really just weren\u2019t interacting with the public. And so we had people that were saying, wow, call me back next week. And so I think how this impacted a lot of people were some people just kind of went back into their units and just disconnected from everything, and then others were just trying to work through it. And maybe they were working, and they\u2019re connecting with other people. So I don\u2019t associate the 2.2% as being reflective of moral hazard. I recognize there may be some of that out there. But I think people will come along, and we\u2019re seeing good behavior overall. We\u2019re hearing amazing stories. So I wouldn\u2019t associate that with moral hazard.\nNeil Malkin: Alright. I appreciate the detail. Yes. Another one I have is, in terms of the H-1B visa program, I know a lot of that goes to tech. I know a lot of that goes into your markets. And so I\u2019m just wondering if you have any sense as to what that looks like going into the summer. Is that sort of demand or occupancy that you assume now will be lost? And then the venture capital side as well, I guess, sort of like the two in a specific to the West Coast had these demand drivers. I just had questions on that?\nMichael Schall: Yes. Yes, this is Mike again. We haven\u2019t spent a lot of time on the H-1Bs, given all the other things that we\u2019re working on. Anecdotally, we have not heard \u2013 in terms of what they\u2019re actually doing, we know that they don\u2019t qualify generally for unemployment. And therefore, to the extent they\u2019re displaced, then maybe there\u2019s a possibility that they will go home. And so that\u2019s out there. But it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s too hard to tell at this point in time. And I\u2019m sorry, I missed the second part of your question.\nNeil Malkin: Yes, sure. Sorry. I was just asking about venture capital, you had alluded to it.\nMichael Schall: Thank you. Yes, yes. Yes, venture capital. So yes. No, I did. I did. Yes, venture capital, I mean, it still remains strong in our markets, still above the dot-com era. The last funding by quarter last quarter was \u2013 first quarter 2020 was $12 billion versus about $10 billion in the dot-com period, so still strong. Again, anecdotally, we\u2019re hearing that venture capital valuations are dropping pretty substantially by a big number. We also \u2013 when we go through the WARN notices or the notices of layoffs, there are a lot of venture capital-funded companies that are on that list. So trying to figure out how to kind of continue operations at a time when valuations are not really attractive. So I would put this in the bucket of still a lot more unknowns than knowns as the venture capital world is trying to figure out what to do. I know, in our case, we have our technology fund consortium of \u2013 that the REITs and other multifamily owners put together. And we\u2019re seeing some pretty attractive deal flow as a result of that and lower valuations overall. And so we think it\u2019s actually a very good time to be an investor in technology at this point in time compared to the recent past.\nNeil Malkin: I appreciate the color. Thank you, guys.\nMichael Schall: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJeff Spector: Good afternoon and thanks for all of the color. If I missed this, I apologize. Can you discuss May collection so far, what you\u2019re seeing?\nJohn Burkart: Yes, you didn\u2019t miss it. This is John. They\u2019re materially consistent with April. One thing I would say is, because of when the fifth falls, things can move around a little bit, but we\u2019re right on path with April.\nJeff Spector: Okay, great. Thanks. And then I believe, Mike, in his opening remarks, talked about an expectation for a decline in market rents in 2020. I believe I heard negative 2.8%. Just given what\u2019s going on, it just \u2013 it doesn\u2019t seem so bad to me. Again, I know it\u2019s down, and you were expecting up 3%-plus. But is that correct? And can you put that in perspective, let\u2019s say, versus what you saw during the tech crash or Great Recession, that minus \u2013 was it minus 2.8%?\nMichael Schall: Yes, Jeff. Yes, keep in mind, this is actually published in S-16 of the supplement, where we try to give you an idea of what we think market rents are going to do on average for 2020. And so we come to 2.8%. However, keep in mind, we have 3% rent growth, market rent growth in the first quarter. So to average 2.8% for the year, we expect rents to decline pretty substantially between now and year-end. And again, I go back to John\u2019s comments about stabilized concessions because if you give away a month free, that\u2019s actually a pretty significant reduction in market rents. And I think it\u2019s somewhere in that magnitude where we expect, again, as we\u2019re working through all the delinquents and some of them are moving out, and we\u2019ve created more units than we would ordinarily have to rent and now we have to draw people into those units that we think we\u2019re going to have to provide more incentive to do that. And so that will be probably mostly in the form of a concession. But I think that\u2019s the environment for the rest of the year, and then I think John points this out too, then we probably hit equilibrium at some point in time, we would say, toward the end of the year. And then I think things can recover from that point. Does that make sense?\nJeff Spector: Yes. And can you compare that \u2013 the minus 2.8% for the year to, let\u2019s say, what happened during the tech crash or Great Recession?\nMichael Schall: Yes. Well, overall, market rents declined in the financial crisis about 15% over a couple of years. In terms of \u2013 but keep in mind, we don\u2019t actually realize that or realize it over time because we have leases in place. And I actually have these numbers. So in 2009, the reported revenue drop was 2.8%, and 2010 was 3.3%. So we had 2.8% \u2013 same-property revenue dropped 2.8% in 2009, 3.3% in 2010, on an overall, about 15% reduction in market rents. And so as you can tell, I mean the reported numbers are pretty dramatically less than given leases in place compared to the market rent numbers. Does that help?\nJeff Spector: Yes. It\u2019s very helpful. And I wish everyone well. Thank you.\nMichael Schall: Thank you.\nJohn Burkart: Thank you. You too Jeff.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Kim: Thanks. Good morning. I was interested in the commentary about the increased tours and applications in the past 4 weeks and trying to compare that with the 140 basis points of occupancy that was lost during April. Do you think that with the increased activity, that occupancy has basically troughed already and how do those metrics compare year-over-year?\nJohn Burkart: Yes. So the \u2013 I definitely believe that activity troughed, it troughed in the first week of April and the commentary that I gave related to the last week versus the April average, and it was up substantially. Our applications were up over 60%. So we saw a lot of market activity. So, very good outlook going forward, what we are seeing is the market is moving toward equilibrium. We are offering some level of concessions. People are renting units. Things are going in the right direction. That\u2019s a good thing. As it relates to year-over-year activity, we\u2019re definitely lower. It\u2019s a little harder to compare because when you look at, say, tours, we\u2019re up an infinite amount on virtual tours right now. We had no virtual tours a year ago. And so when you\u2019re trying to compare those numbers, it\u2019s a little challenging. That\u2019s why I gave away the trough, which was the first week of April and then this last week, where we are in comparison. We\u2019re continuing to see this with good leasing traffic, good activity. But overall, definitely, the market for April was and we call it shell-shocked, it was less than what it was a year ago in April, but given exact comparisons, it would be misleading.\nJohn Kim: Okay. So the activity is a good leading indicator. I was wondering if you could also clarify the difference between financial and physical occupancy on S-15? That\u2019s basically 100 basis points and I\u2019m...\nJohn Burkart: Yes. Financial occupancy relates to whether or not someone is in our unit for the full month of the period, whatever the period is, compared to our scheduled rent, whereas physical occupancy is just simply looking at the units and whether or not they\u2019re occupied, so the \u2013 at one point in time. So, our \u2013 we quoted our physical occupancy as of April 30, which was on that day, whereas our financial occupancy for April would have been the whole month, so a little bit different. The reason we were doing that is we\u2019re trying to give out to people, again, full transparency, give a good understanding of where we ended up because we did end up lower than where we were for the month. I will say, though that things have picked up and is what you would expect. It\u2019s consistent with what I\u2019m saying. We do expect occupancy to continue to pick up. I think that was probably our low point. When you think about it with traffic being in the low at the first week, that\u2019s typically going to relate to occupancy being in the low several weeks later and then all of a sudden, it picks up. So this whole thing is working out as expected consistently. And I expect our occupancy will continue to pick up going forward, which it is right now.\nJohn Kim: So is it fair to say that the physical occupancy is a leading indicator for the financial, and then the tours and applications are, I mean, an indicator for both?\nJohn Burkart: Yes.\nJohn Kim: Okay, thank you.\nJohn Burkart: Sure. You welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Hey, good morning. And I apologize for the background noise. So a few questions. First of all, I think you guys are pretty bold to let tenants do their own home repairs. I can\u2019t wait to see the photos of the aftermath. But two questions. So first, Mike, can you just \u2013 you talked about the different markets, and Seattle\u2019s strongest, the Northern L.A. suburb\u2019s the weakest as far as rent collection. Can you just \u2013 maybe I missed it, but can you just give us some color on urban versus suburban? And especially that you guys have sold down, you\u2019ve been selling down your urban exposure, so just sort of curious how you\u2019re seeing your portfolio rent collections, etcetera, play out between that dynamic?\nMichael Schall: Sure, Alex. Good question. And yes, I don\u2019t want to see the drywall patch job that our residents do for sure. Let\u2019s see. The \u2013 I think...\nJohn Burkart: Yes. I mean I can talk about their delinquency. Yes, I\u2019ll talk to...\nMichael Schall: Why don\u2019t you just start? Yes.\nJohn Burkart: The delinquency, first off, Alex, we are a high-service shop, so some of the self-help might literally be replacing the light bulb. But anyway, the \u2013 as to the delinquency, as I mentioned, we aren\u2019t really seeing a high-rise versus low-rise of rent. We\u2019re not seeing correlations as it relates to that. When I look at the \u2013 what occurred, certain assets were impacted more than others. And when I dug deep into that, you could see the logic, like an asset that perhaps is next to a mall or one that\u2019s highly impacted by a school, and you could understand what was going on. But then when I tried to apply that fact to other assets that had similar situations, next to a mall, 10 miles away, or highly impacted by a school, the results weren\u2019t the same. It was really interesting and unique. And what I did find, though, is that there was a submarket distinction, and that\u2019s why I brought up the submarkets. And so Downtown L.A. was highly impacted. And that\u2019s why I brought that one up specifically as was the Woodland Hills and Woodland Hills has exposure to the entertainment industry. So we did see those types of impacts. We also saw regional impacts, less in the Pacific Northwest. And of course, there, we have a lot of assets on the Eastside, many of them are garden-style and that type of thing, really low impact. And then in the middle was the Bay Area, and in more in the South, we had greater impact. Some of it was the Disneyland effect.\nMichael Schall: Yes. And Alex, let me pick up on that. So yes, we have sold some buildings in the downtown. MaSo, as you\u2019ll recall, was sold in Q4 of last year and 8th & Hope the year before, one in Downtown San Francisco, one in Downtown L.A. And I would say, most of that motivated by some of the issues and the grittiness of the downtown and our expectation for some of the areas to be cleaned up more quickly and transition more quickly than they did. So I think that, that continues to be a pretty significant issue here on the West Coast. And our performance has been \u2013 it\u2019s been okay in the downtowns. It hasn\u2019t been great because of some of those factors. And so our \u2013 we become more suburban over time. And again, with we want to own property in the, I would say, B- to A quality area, in areas near jobs and never too far from the major job nodes. And I would say that suburban generally has outperformed the urban here on the West Coast. I realize that, in other markets, you can have different outcomes.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then the second question is sort of going to that geographically, obviously, New York, here, we\u2019ve been really hit hard. But speaking to folks in the rest of the country, including out even in the Bay Area, it seems like COVID has really been much less of an impact and that there\u2019s a sense of people who want to get back to their jobs much quicker than the politicians want. So in your view, do you sense that there\u2019s this pent-up demand where people are ready to get back to their jobs, and you guys may even rebound quicker than people think just because the level of COVID is less and the people are just far ready for it because they don\u2019t have to rely on mass transit or do you think that it will take longer to reopen in your markets?\nMichael Schall: It is the million-dollar question. And certainly, I don\u2019t have an answer to it. I put this definitely in the unknown category. I think that we tend to have high-income levels out here, and the people that are earning high incomes want to consume services. And the services, for the most part, restaurants and a variety of things, those services are really not open at this point in time. So I think that there is a motivation to start opening things up again. Having said that, there \u2013 I think the governmental entities are incredibly, let\u2019s say, conservative and concerned about surge capacity and some of the other issues that go along with it. So we\u2019re going to take it one day at a time and can\u2019t exactly predict what\u2019s there. But I totally agree with you. I think that the demand for services is building and is pretty intense out there. And so hopefully, that motivates. We\u2019ve seen various different things on the news about this in terms of closing the L.A. beaches. Boy, that\u2019s a tough one, but because people want to get out and go do things. So I can\u2019t exactly tell you what\u2019s going to happen, but I definitely can feel the pressure building.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nRich Hill: Hey, guys. I just wanted to follow-up on the negative 2.8% macro forecast. And by the way, thank you very much for that. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not easy to put together right now. But I think one of the things that I\u2019m certainly trying to understand, and I think a lot of people are trying to understand, is the cadence of that. And I\u2019m not looking for you to give a specific guide. But maybe if you could just walk us through if you think you\u2019re going to see a deeper 2Q \u201820 trough and then a quicker rebound. Or is it going to be more stable but down over the course of the year? And the reason I asked the question is I think about your \u2013 I think it was a negative 7% job growth forecast for the year, which is a little bit more severe than Morgan Stanley was projecting, which maybe suggests that you\u2019re expecting it to be delayed out but maybe not as deep in 2Q. So any color you could provide on that? That would be really helpful.\nMichael Schall: Yes, Rich. This is Mike. And I think I went through some of this previously. But the job forecast and the GDP forecast or estimates, again, we survey a wide range. We don\u2019t do any fundamental research as it relates to the macro economy. And as there is wide dispersion of what people think is going to happen. And as we sort of triangulated all that, we got the minus 900,000, 6.6% job loss in our West Coast markets. So that\u2019s where that came from. We don\u2019t \u2013 again, we don\u2019t add \u2013 we don\u2019t try to add value. We just try to report the facts as it relates to that. What this has intended to do is take those macro forces and consider what would happen with rents in a normal situation because we don\u2019t have a COVID-19 model because we\u2019ve never been through this before. But in a normal situation, if you had minus 6.6% jobs \u2013 job growth and you had about 0.9% apartment deliveries, what would happen with rents? And so that\u2019s where the 2.8% number came from in terms of our rent forecast, minus 2.8%. And again, that compares to plus 3% that we achieved in the first quarter. So in order to average minus 2.8% for the year, when you to start with 3 months of 3, yes, things get pretty ugly in the second half of the year. We view this as more just part of the shock of \u2013 to the system. There\u2019s been an extraordinary shock to the system. And I think John\u2019s equilibrium comment is the right one. We need to get back to equilibrium, and there will be short-term pain in order to get back to equilibrium. And best I can tell, it\u2019s going to be somewhere around 1 month free on stabilized communities, which is sort of embedded into the minus 2.8%. So that\u2019s where it comes from. And \u2013 but this is just our modeling. This is what happens in our rent forecasting model when you put these various pieces in. Again, it doesn\u2019t reflect a COVID-19 scenario and the extraordinary uniqueness of the situation. So it could be different. And again, this is why we didn\u2019t follow up with this and then push into guidance because there\u2019s a whole another set of assumptions that would go into that.\nRich Hill: Yes, yes. And that\u2019s helpful, and I recognize I\u2019m asking a tough question. It sounds like, given the 1-month free concessions right now, and hopefully, those will burn off towards the end of the year, maybe we could assume something more than severe than the negative 4.75 that the average for the next 3 quarters would assume in 2Q and then gradually getting better because I think you had noted that you begin to inflect in 1Q \u201821. So I was just trying to get my hands around what does that average look like. And it sounds like it might be a little bit deeper in 2Q but then start to get better as the year progresses?\nMichael Schall: Yes. In our model, it gets progressively worse because, again, you have seasonality that comes into the equation. Although we would say Q3 is normally our best quarter, let\u2019s say, and we\u2019re not going to get the benefit of the positive seasonality, and so maybe the negative which typically comes in the fourth quarter will be more muted. But we just don\u2019t know. So we \u2013 the way that our model runs is it gets progressively worse, and then we\u2019ll hit bottom sometime in Q4 and then rebound from there.\nRich Hill: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And I will follow-up with any questions, but thanks guys. I appreciate the color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Hardik Goel with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.\nHardik Goel: Hey guys. First of all, thank you for all the great color on all the work you have done and Mike, congratulations on buying back stock. Second downturn in a row, that said, I really wanted to get your thoughts on \u2013 you guys talked \u2013 you guys track the labor market really well. We\u2019ve gotten great commentary in the past about what job trends are like. What does your work there really tell you about not just startup employment but employment from the big tech companies and how would that compare to last year? Can you contextualize that?\nMichael Schall: We can. Let\u2019s see \u2013 let me pull out a slide on the big tech companies, which I have here somewhere. But again, we \u2013 there is a piece of it that we don\u2019t know and that is to what extent do things open up as we \u2013 as California and Washington open up, how many of those jobs will come back. Will it be half the restaurants that get \u2013 that become filled given social distancing? And that\u2019s kind of our best guess, but that, of course, means that the other half don\u2019t come back immediately, and what happens with them. So this is part of the unknown with respect to that part of it. And again, I think the good thing about our markets is that we have high-income people. We generally are in the better areas. And people have the \u2013 want to consume services, which are not there right now, but I think there\u2019s going to be a lot of pressure to bring them back. So I guess that\u2019s the first statement. In terms of specifically, our process of tracking what\u2019s happening with the top 10 tech companies, all of which are headquartered in an Essex market, we have, let\u2019s see, total openings at 22,900 as of May 1, 2020. So that compares to last quarter of \u2013 at March 27, it was about 28,000 or 29,000. So there\u2019s been about a 20% reduction there. But if you go back in time, you hit about the same level as Q4 \u201818 in terms of the number of open positions, so Q3, Q4 \u201818 in terms of the number of positions open. So I would put that in the still-strong category. And even though it\u2019s off, it\u2019s off the all-time high that we achieved last quarter. So I think still pretty compelling. Does that help?\nHardik Goel: And just as a follow-up to that. I think John mentioned a few times \u2013 and that is really helpful, by the way. John mentioned a few times equilibrium pricing. And I was just wondering what do you guys see as equilibrium maybe in 2021 once we are past some of this uncertainty. Is it the economic environment stronger than 4Q \u201819 or is it something where we still have a 6% unemployment rate and pricing power inherently is not as strong as the late cycle?\nMichael Schall: Yes. Again, I think this is \u2013 goes within the category of, hey, there has been an extraordinary shock to the system and the markets are trying to find equilibrium, but they\u2019re changing as time goes on. Again, there are people that are on unemployment. Some of them will be brought back and \u2013 to work. And some of them won\u2019t have a job, given you\u2019re probably going to chop the capacity of a restaurant in half, for example. And maybe that\u2019s made up with delivery or pickup type services or whatever, but it\u2019s just going to be different. And I would say it\u2019s beyond our ability to really predict with any degree of certainty when it comes to what that scenario is going to look like, which \u2013 but it will \u2013 we will have equilibrium. Historically, when you talk about the great financial crisis or 9/11 or the dot-com period, these periods go on for maybe 18 months and then kind of turn the corner. In this case, I think we\u2019ve had all the negative part of that 18 months in 1 month. And so it\u2019s all been compressed, and then now we have the second part where we\u2019re hopefully hitting bottom and now we\u2019re recovering. So I would expect that whole process, therefore, to compress to maybe 9 months or something like that.\nHardik Goel: Got it. That\u2019s really helpful. And just if you would oblige me one last one. Could you give us a range of the prices in which you bought back stock? I know the average was 2.27 and I maybe reaching here, but I have to try?\nAngela Kleiman: Hi. This is Angela. I think you\u2019re trying to be a troublemaker here. So let\u2019s just leave it as is. That\u2019s our average and that\u2019s what we report. Yes, I\u2019ll give you some credit for trying.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Pawlowski with Green Street. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Pawlowski: Just one for me. Mike, there has been a flurry of cities to enact their own type of rent freeze measure, and I realize most of them won\u2019t really impact your portfolio at all because they abide by Costa-Hawkins. There\u2019s a few examples of cities kind of violating Costa-Hawkins right now, but again, a de minimis impact, at least from our lands in your portfolio. When you step back and you evaluate the legislative landscape, is there anything on your radar that would prohibit your renewal pricing power beyond your own proactive 90-day window? Is there any issues with any cities later in the year where you won\u2019t be able to push renewals?\nMichael Schall: Well, John, I know you guys tracked us pretty well, and we do, too. And there have been all kinds of proposals out there. Fortunately, most of them have not moved forward. And in California, obviously, we have AB 1482, which is statewide rent control, imposing a cap of CPI plus 5 with a cap of 10. So we\u2019re managing through that environment. Fortunately, the more aggressive proposals have not been adopted, thank goodness. I would say the one that was most concerning, really, maybe two of them, one is L.A. extending the rent payment program out a year. And then there\u2019s the judicial council that essentially is not going to hear eviction cases for some period after the state of emergency is raised. So we track it, but we think that, for the most part, we\u2019re working through it. And as John said, the good news is that most of our residents have chosen a higher path of working with us to work through their situation. And again, I look at that 2% bucket that hasn\u2019t communicated with us as being probably, ultimately, good news with respect to those that aren\u2019t trying to take the maximum advantage of these various laws.\nJohn Pawlowski: Got it. Thanks for taking the question.\nMichael Schall: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Schall: Wes, you there?\nWes Golladay: Well, sorry, I forgot this whole mute function. Sorry about that. Looking at S-16, the 2.8% rent decline, have you made any adjustments to the Essex model for the CARES Act neutralizing job loss?\nMichael Schall: No. I don\u2019t \u2013 no, we have not. Again, this is \u2013 take the macro inputs, job growth, GDP growth, supply, and it\u2019s straight, this is what comes out of our model if we put those factors in and again, for the marketplace. So I think the CARES Act will definitely help. That\u2019s referring to S-16.1. And the pretty great unemployment benefits that are out there, I think that helps with respect to people hopefully being able to stay in our units longer and paying rent for a longer period of time and minimizing the damage. Even if they pay a half a month, that may be okay. At least they don\u2019t accrue a balance that becomes so large that they just can\u2019t \u2013 we just finance it. So I think it will help. It will help more on the delinquency side probably than it will on the rent side.\nWes Golladay: Okay. And then did you comment already about retail exposure?\nJohn Burkart: No. I\u2019m glad to hit that. Retail is a really small part of our portfolio, like 1%, 1.5%. Our retail delinquency was basically about half of the retail tenants paid what they owed. So it was roughly in line with other things I\u2019ve seen in the industry. That group of retail where they\u2019re located at multifamily sites typically are relatively handing out their service providers. So when the business shuts down, they struggle. We\u2019re working with really all of them and are pretty hopeful that they will be able to reopen back up. And we also will work with them on payment plans. So \u2013 but that group was hit hard, and we\u2019ve seen that really across the industry in everything I\u2019ve seen.\nWes Golladay: Okay thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.\nHaendel St. Juste: Hello good morning out there. \nMichael Schall: Good morning Haendel.\nHaendel St. Juste: So Mike, I guess I was intrigued by your comments earlier on not being afraid to capitalize on the transaction markets should the right opportunities emerge. And I had flashbacks to the time around the great financial recession when you guys backed up the truck and acquired a sizable amount of newly completed or near-completion construction and lease-up type of assets. Those deals you\u2019re going to merge with BRE were instrumental in lowering your portfolio age and broadening your submarket and price point selections in your California market. So I guess I\u2019m curious if you would be similarly interested in buying up busted condo projects or development lease-ups in size. And would you be more willing to cull from the bottom of your portfolio to fund it or perhaps use a fund structure to pursue these types of deals?\nMichael Schall: Yes. Haendel, those are great questions. I guess the difference between now and the great financial crisis, in the great financial crisis, you had mortgages being made to people that couldn\u2019t afford to pay them back. And the amount of distress within the housing sector was extraordinary, as you\u2019ll recall, which created this opportunity to buy vacant brand-new condo buildings at 50% of replacement. There is nothing even close to that out there at this time. And again, my comments in the script about record-high positive leverage. If you take a typical deal that might be a 6, let\u2019s say, 6.5 un-levered IRR with positive leverage, you\u2019re probably in the high 9s to low 10s, somewhere in that zone in terms of IRR \u2013 levered IRR. So I think that, that is going to prevent any kind of significant distress within the markets. Of course, there are always some transactions that manage to find very aggressive lenders, and they manage to leverage our property up to 90% or more. And they\u2019re out there for sure, but they are few and far between, I would guess, at this point in time. So in terms of our basic view of transactions, we view it as, okay, what can we do with our portfolio on a leverage-neutral basis? So what\u2019s the arbitrage ability within our portfolio? What can we sell and replace at a higher overall yield or growth rate or IRR, let\u2019s say? And how do we transact? So we\u2019re always thinking about it that way. And so I would say that preferred equity is still pretty important to us. It\u2019s still sort of at the top of our list. And also, I would say, certainly, joint ventures, which take greater advantage than on our balance sheet, or a little bit higher leverage than the joint ventures at \u2013 when we begin, and then, of course, that leverage drops over time but utilizes the leverage to a small extent or to some extent beyond that. So I would say those 2 things are transactions that we\u2019re looking at and are interested in. And I didn\u2019t mean to exclude Adam from this discussion because he\u2019s the expert at it. Adam, what did I miss?\nAdam Berry: You nailed it all, Mike.\nMichael Schall: Did that help, Haendel?\nHaendel St. Juste: It did. It did. I appreciate that. I want to go back to an earlier question, I guess, from a different angle. Just I\u2019m curious if you\u2019re hearing anything in terms of rent forgiveness bills being contemplated in California and Washington beyond the tenant protection on \u2013 for the temporary ban on evictions that we\u2019ve been hearing here. As I\u2019m sure you know, New York state is kind of contemplating such a forgiveness bill. I think it\u2019s NY S1825. So I\u2019m curious if there\u2019s anything you\u2019re hearing. And it\u2019s \u2013 just more broadly, as a concept, does that even work? Or how would that work? Just the idea of the government stepping in and telling landlords to forgive 1, 2, 3 months free rent. So curious on maybe what you\u2019re hearing and what you\u2019re thinking on that.\nMichael Schall: Well, clearly, this is California, and so you\u2019re going to hear some of those things and there have been various proposals out there. And we don\u2019t think that they\u2019re constitutional, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily stop them from being circulated. There actually is a bill in Sacramento, AB 828, that would give the courts the right to force landlords under certain circumstances to reduce rents by 25%. We think it\u2019s unlikely. But it\u2019s out there. We think it\u2019s very unlikely. We don\u2019t think it will happen. And again, from what we understand in all these discussions throughout the West Coast, which are mainly cities, there have been a lot of proposals, but the city attorneys have been pretty good at pointing out the legal peril with respect to that position. So they have \u2013 those bills have not been passed. And I think at this point in time, it appears that we\u2019re beyond that period where we\u2019re getting what seems to be a new legal mandate a day. We\u2019re kind of beyond that period now, and I think we\u2019re more in the period of let\u2019s figure out how to get back to work and open up. So I think that, from a timing perspective, the time for those bills has come and gone.\nHaendel St. Juste: Got it. Appreciate the thoughts.\nMichael Schall: Thank you\nOperator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And now I would like to turn the call back over to Michael Schall for closing comments.\nMichael Schall: Yes. Thank you, operator and thanks everyone for joining the call today. Please call or e-mail us with any questions or comments. And our best wishes to you and your family during this challenging time. Thank you. Good day.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Schall",
            "content": "Thank you for joining our call today. John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments, and Adam Berry is here for Q&A. These are challenging times as we manage through unprecedented events in our nation's history. We would like to offer our best wishes to all those impacted by COVID-19, their caregivers and those participating on the call today. We reported a strong first quarter results last night, exceeding the midpoint of our FFO per share guidance by $0.07, with the results for the quarter mostly unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic. As noted in the press release, we withdrew our 2020 FFO guidance ranges. Generally, we believe providing FFO guidance and related assumptions is an important aspect of investor communications. However, in the current environment, we believe that the range of probable outcomes for Essex is too wide to be useful to investors. Since the initial shelter-in-place order in the Bay Area was announced on March 17, the nation has experienced over 30 million unemployment claims, and economic uncertainty is as great as I have ever seen. Key variables in the government's policy response are impossible to model such as the duration of the shutdown, the possibility that a second wave of infection could occur and the effectiveness of social distancing during a phased reopening of the economy. After a prolonged debate, we made the difficult decision to withdraw our core FFO guidance. In my prepared remarks today, I will cover three topics: a recap of actions taken in the past 2 months in response to the pandemic, a review of our updated estimates for rent growth in our markets as can be found on Page S-16 of the supplemental and insights into what we're seeing in the West Coast property transaction markets. Turning to our response to the pandemic, we have been very impressed with how the Essex team has responded and adapted to the dynamic and unprecedented conditions created by COVID-19. As the scope of the pandemic became more clear in early March we created a COVID response team comprised of senior leadership to gather information and act decisively. To maintain essential property operations, we implemented a variety of social distancing practices at each property; provided incentives and tools to push nearly all transactions online, over the phone or through the mail. We acquired and distributed PPE to our on-site staff and expanded training for safety protocols. We transitioned 5 corporate offices to work from home and implemented a virtual management process with daily contact via teleconference. In addition, we conducted weekly live video conferences that were available to all Essex employees to ensure consistent messaging and unity in a chaotic time. Communication is important during periods of uncertainty. And on March 23, we issued a press release to outline for investors, employees and residents how the company is going to assist those that are financially impacted by COVID-19, including protection from eviction and late fees, creation of payment plans and dissemination of information about governmental and community resources. The past 2 months have required urgent responses to many complex issues, including many unknowables related to the pandemic itself, a plethora of well-intentioned but imprecise government regulations and properly balancing our obligations to stakeholders in the spirit of corporate responsibility. With that backdrop, it's essential to recognize the tireless efforts of the Essex team amid great concern for their health and safety of their families to rapidly and thoughtfully react to the crisis. Well done, team Essex. Turning to the West Coast rental markets, we have prepared a scenario for our 2020 rent growth expectations on Slide S-16 of the supplemental that incorporate macro U.S. forecasts for GDP and job growth that are prepared by a broad spectrum of industry and Wall Street economists. While the span of forecasted outcomes is wide to an unprecedented extent, there is a common expectation that the U.S. will experience double-digit declines in second quarter GDP growth and an overall contraction in the economy in 2020, with job losses for the year estimated at around 7%. In summary, we expect approximately 900,000 job losses or 6.6% in our West Coast metros in 2020 compared to the net addition of 207,000 jobs from our estimate last quarter. An approximate 14% reduction in estimated total housing deliveries from last quarter is not sufficient to offset the impact of negative job growth, leading to our belief that market rents overall will decline an average of 2.8% in 2020 versus last quarter's estimated 3% increase in market rents. The extraordinary fiscal and monetary stimulus programs that have been implemented by the federal government have already helped stabilize capital markets and should limit the risk of financial contagion. If you consider by contrast the major stimulus programs from the Great Recession, they occurred roughly a year after the recession started. But in today's case, they were just days and weeks into the crisis and have been much larger in scope. On Page S-16.1 of our supplemental, we highlight the impact of the $600 per week federal supplement to unemployment insurance that was part of the CARES Act. While the effectiveness of the program has been muted by processing delays at state unemployment offices, the weekly checks have started to arrive and will substantially offset the income loss for a large segment of the population that has suffered from job losses and furloughs. We highlight this program because it hasn't received much attention. Given these benefits, the income shortfalls for lower to middle income workers are much less severe than they would have been otherwise. And in some cases again, at lower and middle income levels, some workers will receive more in unemployment benefit as compared to their compensation. Finally, I will turn to the apartment transaction market. Yields or cap rates for apartment transactions generally exceed interest rates on related debt, and the resulting positive leverage is a powerful force in the market. Unlike the great financial crisis, large banks have maintained relatively conservative lending standards and strong liquidity and capital positions, and interest rates have declined further since the crisis began. As an example, we recently received a quote for a 7-year Fannie Mae loan on a joint venture property with a fixed interest rate of 2.75%. We believe these factors will be sufficient to avoid widespread distress in the apartment space. Unlike REIT stocks, private market values in terms of cap rates are generally sticky, meaning that they don't change immediately in reaction to events but rather seek to reflect the longer-term financial performance of a property. Generally speaking, many potential buyers are seeking a higher cap rate as a result of the pandemic. However, apartment owners generally have no distress, and exceptionally low interest rates provide the opportunity to improve cash flow through refinance to take advantage of record-low positive leverage. As a result of these factors, the spread between buyer and seller expectations has widened and the gap separating them is probably around 30 to 60 basis points, likely resulting in fewer apartment transactions in the near term. If our stock price was higher, we would be an aggressive buyer in this environment. Historically, periods of disruption have resulted in great opportunity for Essex. I am confident that we have the team, resources and strategy to thoughtfully act on these opportunities, consistent with our long-term track record of outperformance. And now I will turn the call over to John Burkart. Hi, Nick. Thanks for the question. I appreciate it. I think at this point in time, given this incredible uncertainty, we would like to stay more leverage-neutral in terms of how we approach our different investment types. Not to say that we won't sell property in order to pursue other types of opportunities, but at this point in time, until we see greater clarity because I would say at this point in time there are more unknowns than knowns out there given the unprecedented nature of the pandemic itself. And so we are going to remain fairly conservative when it comes to leverage for the foreseeable future. Hi this is Mike, Austin. We don't know. Honestly, that falls in the bucket of we actually have more unknowns than knowns, which is why we didn't give guidance. I think this is one of the key issues out there. And historically, as John said, we have somewhere around 30 to 40 basis points of delinquency. And it does not present an accounting issue. We just assume. Effectively, we treat it on a cash basis. And so it's a little bit different now. And fortunately, because of the timing of when all this happened, we have pretty much 3 months to work through those issues and have better information. We know, historically, that the further you get away from the move-out date, the more difficult it is to collect. And that's just our experience over time. And so we are motivated to move pretty quickly and which of course, many of these eviction prohibitions and other governmental actions prevent us from doing that. And so as John said in his prepared remarks, which I think is important here, that if someone comes to us and says, hey, I will move out, we are going to likely let them out of their lease, which means that we are going to have a little bit more turnover, but we're going to control the unit at a time when, again, because of these eviction prohibitions, we don't have a lot of choices. So we're working through all that. It's, I think, one of the more complicated issues that we have to deal with, with respect to this whole challenging scenario. Yes, this is Mike. And Adam is here too so he may want to add something, but yes, we still like the preferred equity investment. We are not in the first loss piece. Again, we come in to those transactions at the point in time that they are beginning construction. So costs are known, financing is in place, et cetera. So we are not taking a great deal of risk upfront. And typically, those deals underwrite to somewhere in the high 4 to low 5 cap rate and they were of course at around the 85% loan-to-value ratio, which means our effective cap rate is somewhere in the mid-5s. So, the chances of having distress at that level I think is incredibly unlikely. And in terms of investment policy going over \u2013 going forward, direct versus preferred equity, I will let Adam handle that. Yes, Nick. This is Mike and I am sure Mr. Burkart has an opinion on this one as well. So I think what you have here is a shock to the system. And anecdotally, lots of people that can't afford their apartment, potentially moving to different places and other things. So that will be the shock to the system. And then there's a recovery. The recovery is almost always people backfilling from further-out locations into areas that are closer to the jobs, and then we benefit from that over time, but this takes time to play out. So this presumes, since we were up 3% in Q1, on S-16, last quarter and now we are at minus 2.8%, it assumes a pretty dramatic drop-off in market rents. Of course, we don't turn units. We turn units ratably throughout the year. I think part of that, because we enter what's traditionally a more seasonal period, so the fourth quarter is a little bit more challenging for us on the demand side anyway, we still have the deliveries of apartments into the markets. And so we think it will be pretty choppy going into the fourth quarter, and then we think it recovers from that point on. So the other point I would make is John's comment about stabilized concessions. I think that stabilized concessions are assumed to continue in our economic growth forecast on Page S-16. And again, just to remind everyone what this is. This is a scenario based on macro factors, effectively supply demand factors. When you throw them into our model for what happens with various supply demand factors, what happens to rents, this is what we get. There is still a whole bunch of unknowns on top of this. Again, the policy issues, will there be more regulation in these markets, which we don't see. We think there has been plenty of regulation, actually, but we don't know what's going to happen with that. The cadence of move-ins and move-outs, we can't predict that. And the collection of the delinquency is another challenging subject. So that's why we decided to give this data on S-16 without giving guidance because there is a whole another level of assumptions. And we think that there is enough very large assumptions embedded in S-16 that it just didn't make sense to push it further. Yes, it's \u2013 it can be worse than that. But I would focus you on the percent of supply, total supply to total stock, which is at 0.6% for the portfolio. And Northern California is a little bit higher at 0.7%. But then, again, Northern California also has more momentum. I think we believe that tech markets are the winner here. And because their business models are pretty COVID-19-resistant for the most part, not that venture capital hasn't been affected, it has a little bit and jobs haven't been affected they have. Although when we look at, for example, the top 10 technology companies, job openings are down a little bit, but they're still very strong. So our view is that the tech markets do better here, and we'll continue on the path of leading the West Coast markets. And obviously, that's been a key part of our investment. So I guess what I'm saying is I would be less concerned about supply in Northern California, given the strength, the overall strength of the job markets and the companies here. Probably, if we have a concern, even though it appears to be the least amount of supply, it's Southern California because it doesn't have the job drivers that Northern California and Seattle have. Thanks. Yes. It's a good question. And I believe you're talking about, on S-15, the 2.2% which is the percentage of units delinquent in April not requesting assistance. So I guess most of that category is people that we haven't heard from. And I think that there are really 2 components. There is the moral hazard component, those that just want to take advantage of the situation, the various laws and the reluctance of the courts to process evictions, et cetera. But I think there's another piece of that, which is people that are just overwhelmed and/or, for whatever reason, ignore their notices. So I think it's still a little bit early to tell exactly how that breaks down. I guess, from my perspective, that's not a huge number in the scheme of things because I know when we were talking to our Board, we gave them a much larger range of delinquents. And so I think our actual experience is better than what we thought. And I was concerned that, to your point, that if you're going to give people, there's no hammer as it relates to evictions, maybe in late fees for some period of time as part of our overall program to try to help residents through this difficult period, etcetera, that there might be more of those people that just say, oh, I'm just not going to pay rent. Keep in mind that they still have a credit issue, and so there is a reason to pay rent. They still owe the money. And we still fully intend to pursue the collection effort. And we will have to approach it a bit differently, given the magnitude of it. And so \u2013 but we're going to still push hard to collect it where we can. So this falls within one of the unknowns, and we're not sure exactly what's going to happen with that category. Fortunately, it's only 2.2%. Yes. Yes, this is Mike again. We haven't spent a lot of time on the H-1Bs, given all the other things that we're working on. Anecdotally, we have not heard \u2013 in terms of what they're actually doing, we know that they don't qualify generally for unemployment. And therefore, to the extent they're displaced, then maybe there's a possibility that they will go home. And so that's out there. But it's just \u2013 it's too hard to tell at this point in time. And I'm sorry, I missed the second part of your question. Thank you. Yes, yes. Yes, venture capital. So yes. No, I did. I did. Yes, venture capital, I mean, it still remains strong in our markets, still above the dot-com era. The last funding by quarter last quarter was \u2013 first quarter 2020 was $12 billion versus about $10 billion in the dot-com period, so still strong. Again, anecdotally, we're hearing that venture capital valuations are dropping pretty substantially by a big number. We also \u2013 when we go through the WARN notices or the notices of layoffs, there are a lot of venture capital-funded companies that are on that list. So trying to figure out how to kind of continue operations at a time when valuations are not really attractive. So I would put this in the bucket of still a lot more unknowns than knowns as the venture capital world is trying to figure out what to do. I know, in our case, we have our technology fund consortium of \u2013 that the REITs and other multifamily owners put together. And we're seeing some pretty attractive deal flow as a result of that and lower valuations overall. And so we think it's actually a very good time to be an investor in technology at this point in time compared to the recent past. Thank you. Yes, Jeff. Yes, keep in mind, this is actually published in S-16 of the supplement, where we try to give you an idea of what we think market rents are going to do on average for 2020. And so we come to 2.8%. However, keep in mind, we have 3% rent growth, market rent growth in the first quarter. So to average 2.8% for the year, we expect rents to decline pretty substantially between now and year-end. And again, I go back to John's comments about stabilized concessions because if you give away a month free, that's actually a pretty significant reduction in market rents. And I think it's somewhere in that magnitude where we expect, again, as we're working through all the delinquents and some of them are moving out, and we've created more units than we would ordinarily have to rent and now we have to draw people into those units that we think we're going to have to provide more incentive to do that. And so that will be probably mostly in the form of a concession. But I think that's the environment for the rest of the year, and then I think John points this out too, then we probably hit equilibrium at some point in time, we would say, toward the end of the year. And then I think things can recover from that point. Does that make sense? Yes. Well, overall, market rents declined in the financial crisis about 15% over a couple of years. In terms of \u2013 but keep in mind, we don't actually realize that or realize it over time because we have leases in place. And I actually have these numbers. So in 2009, the reported revenue drop was 2.8%, and 2010 was 3.3%. So we had 2.8% \u2013 same-property revenue dropped 2.8% in 2009, 3.3% in 2010, on an overall, about 15% reduction in market rents. And so as you can tell, I mean the reported numbers are pretty dramatically less than given leases in place compared to the market rent numbers. Does that help? Thank you. Sure, Alex. Good question. And yes, I don't want to see the drywall patch job that our residents do for sure. Let's see. The \u2013 I think... Why don't you just start? Yes. Yes. And Alex, let me pick up on that. So yes, we have sold some buildings in the downtown. MaSo, as you'll recall, was sold in Q4 of last year and 8th & Hope the year before, one in Downtown San Francisco, one in Downtown L.A. And I would say, most of that motivated by some of the issues and the grittiness of the downtown and our expectation for some of the areas to be cleaned up more quickly and transition more quickly than they did. So I think that, that continues to be a pretty significant issue here on the West Coast. And our performance has been \u2013 it's been okay in the downtowns. It hasn't been great because of some of those factors. And so our \u2013 we become more suburban over time. And again, with we want to own property in the, I would say, B- to A quality area, in areas near jobs and never too far from the major job nodes. And I would say that suburban generally has outperformed the urban here on the West Coast. I realize that, in other markets, you can have different outcomes. It is the million-dollar question. And certainly, I don't have an answer to it. I put this definitely in the unknown category. I think that we tend to have high-income levels out here, and the people that are earning high incomes want to consume services. And the services, for the most part, restaurants and a variety of things, those services are really not open at this point in time. So I think that there is a motivation to start opening things up again. Having said that, there \u2013 I think the governmental entities are incredibly, let's say, conservative and concerned about surge capacity and some of the other issues that go along with it. So we're going to take it one day at a time and can't exactly predict what's there. But I totally agree with you. I think that the demand for services is building and is pretty intense out there. And so hopefully, that motivates. We've seen various different things on the news about this in terms of closing the L.A. beaches. Boy, that's a tough one, but because people want to get out and go do things. So I can't exactly tell you what's going to happen, but I definitely can feel the pressure building. Yes, Rich. This is Mike. And I think I went through some of this previously. But the job forecast and the GDP forecast or estimates, again, we survey a wide range. We don't do any fundamental research as it relates to the macro economy. And as there is wide dispersion of what people think is going to happen. And as we sort of triangulated all that, we got the minus 900,000, 6.6% job loss in our West Coast markets. So that's where that came from. We don't \u2013 again, we don't add \u2013 we don't try to add value. We just try to report the facts as it relates to that. What this has intended to do is take those macro forces and consider what would happen with rents in a normal situation because we don't have a COVID-19 model because we've never been through this before. But in a normal situation, if you had minus 6.6% jobs \u2013 job growth and you had about 0.9% apartment deliveries, what would happen with rents? And so that's where the 2.8% number came from in terms of our rent forecast, minus 2.8%. And again, that compares to plus 3% that we achieved in the first quarter. So in order to average minus 2.8% for the year, when you to start with 3 months of 3, yes, things get pretty ugly in the second half of the year. We view this as more just part of the shock of \u2013 to the system. There's been an extraordinary shock to the system. And I think John's equilibrium comment is the right one. We need to get back to equilibrium, and there will be short-term pain in order to get back to equilibrium. And best I can tell, it's going to be somewhere around 1 month free on stabilized communities, which is sort of embedded into the minus 2.8%. So that's where it comes from. And \u2013 but this is just our modeling. This is what happens in our rent forecasting model when you put these various pieces in. Again, it doesn't reflect a COVID-19 scenario and the extraordinary uniqueness of the situation. So it could be different. And again, this is why we didn't follow up with this and then push into guidance because there's a whole another set of assumptions that would go into that. Yes. In our model, it gets progressively worse because, again, you have seasonality that comes into the equation. Although we would say Q3 is normally our best quarter, let's say, and we're not going to get the benefit of the positive seasonality, and so maybe the negative which typically comes in the fourth quarter will be more muted. But we just don't know. So we \u2013 the way that our model runs is it gets progressively worse, and then we'll hit bottom sometime in Q4 and then rebound from there. We can. Let's see \u2013 let me pull out a slide on the big tech companies, which I have here somewhere. But again, we \u2013 there is a piece of it that we don't know and that is to what extent do things open up as we \u2013 as California and Washington open up, how many of those jobs will come back. Will it be half the restaurants that get \u2013 that become filled given social distancing? And that's kind of our best guess, but that, of course, means that the other half don't come back immediately, and what happens with them. So this is part of the unknown with respect to that part of it. And again, I think the good thing about our markets is that we have high-income people. We generally are in the better areas. And people have the \u2013 want to consume services, which are not there right now, but I think there's going to be a lot of pressure to bring them back. So I guess that's the first statement. In terms of specifically, our process of tracking what's happening with the top 10 tech companies, all of which are headquartered in an Essex market, we have, let's see, total openings at 22,900 as of May 1, 2020. So that compares to last quarter of \u2013 at March 27, it was about 28,000 or 29,000. So there's been about a 20% reduction there. But if you go back in time, you hit about the same level as Q4 \u201818 in terms of the number of open positions, so Q3, Q4 \u201818 in terms of the number of positions open. So I would put that in the still-strong category. And even though it's off, it's off the all-time high that we achieved last quarter. So I think still pretty compelling. Does that help? Yes. Again, I think this is \u2013 goes within the category of, hey, there has been an extraordinary shock to the system and the markets are trying to find equilibrium, but they're changing as time goes on. Again, there are people that are on unemployment. Some of them will be brought back and \u2013 to work. And some of them won't have a job, given you're probably going to chop the capacity of a restaurant in half, for example. And maybe that's made up with delivery or pickup type services or whatever, but it's just going to be different. And I would say it's beyond our ability to really predict with any degree of certainty when it comes to what that scenario is going to look like, which \u2013 but it will \u2013 we will have equilibrium. Historically, when you talk about the great financial crisis or 9/11 or the dot-com period, these periods go on for maybe 18 months and then kind of turn the corner. In this case, I think we've had all the negative part of that 18 months in 1 month. And so it's all been compressed, and then now we have the second part where we're hopefully hitting bottom and now we're recovering. So I would expect that whole process, therefore, to compress to maybe 9 months or something like that. Well, John, I know you guys tracked us pretty well, and we do, too. And there have been all kinds of proposals out there. Fortunately, most of them have not moved forward. And in California, obviously, we have AB 1482, which is statewide rent control, imposing a cap of CPI plus 5 with a cap of 10. So we're managing through that environment. Fortunately, the more aggressive proposals have not been adopted, thank goodness. I would say the one that was most concerning, really, maybe two of them, one is L.A. extending the rent payment program out a year. And then there's the judicial council that essentially is not going to hear eviction cases for some period after the state of emergency is raised. So we track it, but we think that, for the most part, we're working through it. And as John said, the good news is that most of our residents have chosen a higher path of working with us to work through their situation. And again, I look at that 2% bucket that hasn't communicated with us as being probably, ultimately, good news with respect to those that aren't trying to take the maximum advantage of these various laws. Thank you. Wes, you there? No. I don't \u2013 no, we have not. Again, this is \u2013 take the macro inputs, job growth, GDP growth, supply, and it's straight, this is what comes out of our model if we put those factors in and again, for the marketplace. So I think the CARES Act will definitely help. That's referring to S-16.1. And the pretty great unemployment benefits that are out there, I think that helps with respect to people hopefully being able to stay in our units longer and paying rent for a longer period of time and minimizing the damage. Even if they pay a half a month, that may be okay. At least they don't accrue a balance that becomes so large that they just can't \u2013 we just finance it. So I think it will help. It will help more on the delinquency side probably than it will on the rent side. Good morning Haendel. Yes. Haendel, those are great questions. I guess the difference between now and the great financial crisis, in the great financial crisis, you had mortgages being made to people that couldn't afford to pay them back. And the amount of distress within the housing sector was extraordinary, as you'll recall, which created this opportunity to buy vacant brand-new condo buildings at 50% of replacement. There is nothing even close to that out there at this time. And again, my comments in the script about record-high positive leverage. If you take a typical deal that might be a 6, let's say, 6.5 un-levered IRR with positive leverage, you're probably in the high 9s to low 10s, somewhere in that zone in terms of IRR \u2013 levered IRR. So I think that, that is going to prevent any kind of significant distress within the markets. Of course, there are always some transactions that manage to find very aggressive lenders, and they manage to leverage our property up to 90% or more. And they're out there for sure, but they are few and far between, I would guess, at this point in time. So in terms of our basic view of transactions, we view it as, okay, what can we do with our portfolio on a leverage-neutral basis? So what's the arbitrage ability within our portfolio? What can we sell and replace at a higher overall yield or growth rate or IRR, let's say? And how do we transact? So we're always thinking about it that way. And so I would say that preferred equity is still pretty important to us. It's still sort of at the top of our list. And also, I would say, certainly, joint ventures, which take greater advantage than on our balance sheet, or a little bit higher leverage than the joint ventures at \u2013 when we begin, and then, of course, that leverage drops over time but utilizes the leverage to a small extent or to some extent beyond that. So I would say those 2 things are transactions that we're looking at and are interested in. And I didn't mean to exclude Adam from this discussion because he's the expert at it. Adam, what did I miss? Did that help, Haendel? Well, clearly, this is California, and so you're going to hear some of those things and there have been various proposals out there. And we don't think that they're constitutional, but that doesn't necessarily stop them from being circulated. There actually is a bill in Sacramento, AB 828, that would give the courts the right to force landlords under certain circumstances to reduce rents by 25%. We think it's unlikely. But it's out there. We think it's very unlikely. We don't think it will happen. And again, from what we understand in all these discussions throughout the West Coast, which are mainly cities, there have been a lot of proposals, but the city attorneys have been pretty good at pointing out the legal peril with respect to that position. So they have \u2013 those bills have not been passed. And I think at this point in time, it appears that we're beyond that period where we're getting what seems to be a new legal mandate a day. We're kind of beyond that period now, and I think we're more in the period of let's figure out how to get back to work and open up. So I think that, from a timing perspective, the time for those bills has come and gone. Thank you Yes. Thank you, operator and thanks everyone for joining the call today. Please call or e-mail us with any questions or comments. And our best wishes to you and your family during this challenging time. Thank you. Good day."

            "name": "Angela Kleiman",
            "content": "Thank you, John. I will briefly comment on our first quarter results then provide an update on our funding plans and the balance sheet. We had a strong start to the year with first quarter same-property NOI growth of 3.9% and core FFO per share exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by $0.07 and achieving a 7.7% growth compared to the same period last year. As noted in our earnings release, we have withdrawn our 2020 guidance as a result of the unprecedented uncertainty caused by the COVID pandemic. Subsequently, we have enhanced our disclosure by providing additional data on April operations and more liquidity details on Page S-15. Turning to our funding plan for investments, stock buybacks and dividends, during the first quarter, we committed $106 million of capital towards structure finance investments at an average yield of 11.2%. The funding for these investments is expected to start around September and occur over a period of 6 to 12 months thereafter, which means our funding needs for 2020 is only about $40 million. Similarly, our development funding needs for 2020 is also de minimis at about $75 million. This represents 50% of our total development commitment shown on Page S-11. In fact, approximately 90% of the current development pipeline is expected to complete lease-up within the next year. We have begun reducing our exposure to direct development several years ago because the rate of construction costs increased at a greater pace than rent growth, ultimately compressing yields. Hence, this is consistent with the plan we have discussed on previous calls. Moving on to funding sources, we expect to receive a total of $215 million from structured finance repayments, of which $115 million can be allocated to our investment needs noted earlier and $100 million can be allocated to fund our stock buyback. Since we have repurchased $176 million of stock, the remaining $76 million will be match-funded with cash flow from operations. As for our dividends, during the first quarter, we raised the annual dividends by 6.5%, which represents the 26th consecutive dividend increase. We are proud of this track record, which few companies have achieved. Even though cash flow from operations may be lower than the original plan for this year, the dividend remains very secure and covered by free cash flow. With over $1 billion in liquidity, no debt maturities in 2020 and our funding commitments well covered, Essex remains in a strong financial position. Thank you. And I will now turn the call back to the operator. Hi. This is Angela. I think you're trying to be a troublemaker here. So let's just leave it as is. That's our average and that's what we report. Yes, I'll give you some credit for trying."

            "content": "Yes. To echo what Mike has said, we continue to aggressively pursue on the pref equity side throughout this crisis. We've underwritten deals a little more conservatively, increased interest rates commensurately with our additional cost of capital that's happened over the last month or so. And we've continued to identify deals, and we're in the process of due diligence on a number of pref equity deals. Going forward, there are definitely development deals out there and we will continue to track and monitor. There is some expectation that costs will come back toward us with decreased construction. We haven't seen any of it so far, and we have our finger on the pulse with a number of pref equity deals out there right now. So haven't seen a decrease in pricing, and sellers are very, very hesitant to decrease their pricing expectations. So I think the development world will take a little pause, but we continue to like I said aggressively pursue on that side. You nailed it all, Mike."

            "name": "John Burkart",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. I would like to start by echoing Mike's sentiment and recognize our associates who are working hard to provide our customers the best service in this essential business of providing housing. Over the past few weeks, we have seen countless demonstrations of the Essex spirit throughout our community. Our teams have shown grit and determination in the face of rapidly changing working conditions. But even more, they have shown compassion to each other and to our residents, from proactively reaching out to those in need, buying residents groceries and even obtaining and distributing personal protective equipment. In addition, we have published resources on our website to assist residents in finding the financial assistance they may need during this time as well as created a library of resources for residents whose children are home from school or who are simply looking for productive ways to use their time during this crisis. Most residents and prospects have been understanding of the changes we needed to make at our communities and appreciative of the great efforts of our team to continue to provide exceptional service during this time, a big thank you to our e-team, our residents and the community. We are truly all in this together. Turning to our first quarter 2020 results, we achieved 3.2% revenue growth over the prior year's quarter. The results were in line with our expectations. Although this is the Q1 call, I believe everyone is more interested in recent events post-COVID shelter-in-place orders, therefore I will be focusing on specific April metrics and recent market activity. I will begin with general comments and move on to the markets. As this situation is unprecedented, with numerous key variables impacting both supply and demand, my commentary on the future market expectations and conditions relies on numerous, generally positive assumptions such as the relaxation of the shelter-in-place orders in the near future, a reduction of new supply entering the market and a restart of the economy in an orderly way. Currently, the rental market is disrupted. There is a gap between the bid/ask price for rental transactions at certain properties in the market. Rental transactions are disproportionately occurring at stabilized properties, offering 2 to 4 weeks free rent, while other properties are losing occupancy. April 2020 year-over-year same-store economic rents were up approximately 1.5%, while financial occupancy declined 1.3% compared to the prior year's period. We are currently offering various leasing incentives, which includes 2 to 4 weeks free rent. I expect the market will move back to equilibrium in June as the shelter-in-place requirements are relaxed and we enter the summer leasing season. Historically, during periods of reduced demand, our portfolio has benefited from people taking advantage of lower pricing and moving from the outlying areas to the core areas where our portfolio is located. I expect the same market dynamics to play out in the coming months. Looking at operations post shelter-in-place, leasing applications in our portfolio bottomed the first week of April and have increased each week since that time. Our same-store financial occupancy decreased 1.3% in April from March. Roughly half of the decline in occupancy was due to COVID-19-related lease breaks. The remainder was related to reduced leasing velocity. This last week, we have seen activity increase dramatically. Our tours increased 47%, and our applications increased 62% over the prior 4-week period average. The initial shock appears to be over, and now the market is moving to equilibrium. Now we will turn to April delinquencies, delinquencies in our total portfolio on a cash basis was 5% in April compared to 33 basis points for the full first quarter of 2020. As the magnitude of this crisis became more apparent in March, we acted immediately to form a resident response team to engage with our residents in understanding their situations, identifying resources for them and partnering with them to get them back on to firm financial ground. As noted in S-15, approximately 4,600 tenants, representing 7.4% of our total portfolio, completed our online request form in April, confirming that they had been financially impacted by COVID-19 and requesting assistance. 36% of those residents paid their April rent in full. Another 36% made a partial payment averaging about 50% of their rent and 28% were unable to pay their April rent. Residents representing 60 basis points of our portfolio requested to move out immediately, which we allowed, enabling the residents to move forward with their life and the company to potentially avoid future delinquency. Of the residents who stated they were financially impacted by COVID-19, 16% were in the food and beverage industry; 9% each in retail and personal services, which relates to fitness, massage or beautician services; and 7% each in healthcare, transportation, construction and professional and business services. 2.2% of our residents are delinquent, and we have been unable to contact them. However, some of them have made partial payments. Interestingly, the delinquency at the property level within a selected market had fairly large variations. Certain properties were substantially more impacted than others. I believe this disproportionate impact is the root cause of the market dislocation. I would compare it to randomly located new lease-ups aggressively attempting to increase occupancy. Owners at the highly impacted buildings with respect to occupancy and/or delinquency as well as those who are struggling to compete in this new virtual sales world are likely to be the ones aggressively offering concessions. On to expenses, as Mike has mentioned, we have withdrawn our financial guidance. However, I want to note some expense considerations. Utility usage and related expenses will be higher due to the shelter-in-place mandates. In addition, we expect a significant ongoing increase in expenses related to personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies as well as related increased labor cost due to new cleaning protocols. Finally, to protect our employees and residents, we have stopped performing non-emergency work orders in occupied units. We have provided residents with self-help videos and other resources to help them fix many of their own issues. However, we expect that there will be some level of pent-up work orders as conditions change. Moving on to our operating strategy in this new environment, our technology vision and related operating strategy that we have been executing positioned us well going into this rapid change. Our cloud-first strategy enabled a relatively smooth transition as the stay-at-home orders were implemented. We remained fully operational while rapidly transitioning to working from home. The new operating environment of social distancing requires a solid digital presence, including video tours, digital maps, self-help information and related videos as well as smartphones for FaceTime tours and other similar tours. We made the decision early on to rapidly accelerate our technology-enabled transformation, completing the implementation of our mobile maintenance app 2.0, our sales lead management system 2.0 and several other initiatives, shaving 4 to 12 months off the original rollout plans. As the restrictions are relaxed, we are positioned well for this new environment. Our operating strategy going forward will balance occupancy and market rents, maximizing revenue. We will likely operate at a lower occupancy than we have over the past several years. We will continue to leverage our technology platform and operate consistent with the social distancing protocols by using a combination of virtual tours and live video tours, where our sales associate is either on site touring a prospect via phone, or the resident is on site and the sales associate is live answering questions and explaining various features and benefits of the particular unit and amenity. Our smart lock digital entry systems enable us to provide access to vacant units for self-tours, thus eliminating the need for agents to be on site to provide access. These were very challenging weeks for certain, but we are emerging from this challenge stronger and we are well prepared for the future. Turning to our markets, in the Seattle market, April 2020 year-over-year same-store economic rents were up 6.1%, while financial occupancy declined 80 basis points compared to the prior year's period. Delinquency in the northern technology-driven markets, were lower. In April, delinquency in our Seattle same-store portfolio was 1.8%, the lowest in our same-store portfolio. Moving to Northern California, in the Bay Area, April 2020 year-over-year same-store economic rents were up 17 basis points, while financial occupancy declined 1.2%. Delinquencies for the same period in the Bay Area were 3.9%. Our Santa Clara County submarket had the lowest delinquency at 2%, while Alameda, San Mateo and Contra Costa County were 4.1%, 6.3% and 7.9%, respectively. Consistent with the rest of the market, our 4 Bay Area lease-ups, 500 Folsom, Station Park Green, Mylo and Patina at Midtown, had very little activity since late March, which was the result of both the construction challenges as well as reduced demand in the marketplace. Continuing South, Southern California same-store economic rents were up 1.1% year-over-year in April 2020, while financial occupancy declined 1.6%. In the same period, our Southern California region had a higher delinquency overall in our same-store portfolio at 7.5%. Ventura and San Diego delinquency was at 4.4% and 4.5%, respectively. Orange County delinquency was 7.5%, and L.A. County delinquency was 9.4%. Our L.A. CBD and Woodland Hills submarkets were the hardest-hit at 12.1% and 13.8%, respectively. As of April 30, our same-store portfolio's physical occupancy was 94.4%, and our availability 30 days out is 6.5%. Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Angela Kleiman. Sure. This is John. The lease-up properties just going back to the stabilized just for a second, what we are seeing is we are seeing 2 to 4 weeks pretty common is where we are seeing rental transactions. And I mentioned the comment as far as dislocation because simply looking at asking rents and assuming that asking reflects the actual rent, that's what I'm getting at. It doesn't necessarily reflect that. Where the transactions are occurring is where there are some level of concessions that are going on out there. As we move from the stabilized market, and that, again, back a step, that really relates to what I see as a dislocation that's caused by the impact of some of the delinquencies hitting certain properties and not others, kind of creating many lease-ups out there. I think that will abate in the near future. As we move to the lease-ups, the lease-up concessions are closer to 2 months, and there are some other specials that are going on. Again, the whole market just kind of expanded out from shorter concessions on lease-ups and no concessions on stabilized, to 2 to 4 weeks stabilized and basically 8 weeks on a new product across the board. Does that answer your question? Yes, I will take that. What we are seeing, I am going to start with an amazing event and we are really seeing some good people that were impacted by situations outside their control, really all trying to figure it out and do the right thing. I don't want to focus on the potential of a few bad actors. The reality is we have a lot of great people that are working hard. Our resident response team is engaged with them and we are seeing good behavior by really the majority of those people. I acknowledge there are some people we haven't connected with. But even those people, some of them have actually paid some levels of rent. They might just be a little bit shell-shocked from this whole situation. My expectation is that as the government assistance rolls out, that people will probably make as much rent payments as they can. And then again, as I mentioned, we do expect the relaxation of some of the shelter-in-place requirements and a somewhat orderly challenged, but orderly economic improvement. And so we expect to see people starting to go back to work, being able to pay rent. And for those that can't pay rent, they may end up moving out. But again, our markets that we're in benefit from this chronic undersupply. And so what we've always seen in the past is whenever there is some level of a shock, it takes some time, 1 to 3, 4 months, and we start to have people from the outside areas moving into our markets and supporting occupancy and therefore, rents. So I see \u2013 I have a somewhat optimistic view as to how this goes, but again, I want to be very candid that where we are today, there is a little bit of dislocation going on right now. Yes. Mike, let me just add. In my comments, I mentioned that those are the people that we haven't spoken with. But I also said some of them have actually paid partial payments. So to be clear, you can't look at that group and say that they're a moral hazard. I'll give you an example. One of the things we did at Essex is we \u2013 early on, realizing the challenge that this was for so many people, we identified residents that have been challenged with us in the past. They may have had reviews that they wrote that they were upset with for whatever reason, and we reached out to them just to check and see how they were doing. The feedback we got was amazing, but what we found is many people were somewhat shell-shocked. They really just weren't interacting with the public. And so we had people that were saying, wow, call me back next week. And so I think how this impacted a lot of people were some people just kind of went back into their units and just disconnected from everything, and then others were just trying to work through it. And maybe they were working, and they're connecting with other people. So I don't associate the 2.2% as being reflective of moral hazard. I recognize there may be some of that out there. But I think people will come along, and we're seeing good behavior overall. We're hearing amazing stories. So I wouldn't associate that with moral hazard. Yes, you didn't miss it. This is John. They're materially consistent with April. One thing I would say is, because of when the fifth falls, things can move around a little bit, but we're right on path with April. Thank you. You too Jeff. Yes. So the \u2013 I definitely believe that activity troughed, it troughed in the first week of April and the commentary that I gave related to the last week versus the April average, and it was up substantially. Our applications were up over 60%. So we saw a lot of market activity. So, very good outlook going forward, what we are seeing is the market is moving toward equilibrium. We are offering some level of concessions. People are renting units. Things are going in the right direction. That's a good thing. As it relates to year-over-year activity, we're definitely lower. It's a little harder to compare because when you look at, say, tours, we're up an infinite amount on virtual tours right now. We had no virtual tours a year ago. And so when you're trying to compare those numbers, it's a little challenging. That's why I gave away the trough, which was the first week of April and then this last week, where we are in comparison. We're continuing to see this with good leasing traffic, good activity. But overall, definitely, the market for April was and we call it shell-shocked, it was less than what it was a year ago in April, but given exact comparisons, it would be misleading. Yes. Financial occupancy relates to whether or not someone is in our unit for the full month of the period, whatever the period is, compared to our scheduled rent, whereas physical occupancy is just simply looking at the units and whether or not they're occupied, so the \u2013 at one point in time. So, our \u2013 we quoted our physical occupancy as of April 30, which was on that day, whereas our financial occupancy for April would have been the whole month, so a little bit different. The reason we were doing that is we're trying to give out to people, again, full transparency, give a good understanding of where we ended up because we did end up lower than where we were for the month. I will say, though that things have picked up and is what you would expect. It's consistent with what I'm saying. We do expect occupancy to continue to pick up. I think that was probably our low point. When you think about it with traffic being in the low at the first week, that's typically going to relate to occupancy being in the low several weeks later and then all of a sudden, it picks up. So this whole thing is working out as expected consistently. And I expect our occupancy will continue to pick up going forward, which it is right now. Yes. Sure. You welcome. Yes. I mean I can talk about their delinquency. Yes, I'll talk to... The delinquency, first off, Alex, we are a high-service shop, so some of the self-help might literally be replacing the light bulb. But anyway, the \u2013 as to the delinquency, as I mentioned, we aren't really seeing a high-rise versus low-rise of rent. We're not seeing correlations as it relates to that. When I look at the \u2013 what occurred, certain assets were impacted more than others. And when I dug deep into that, you could see the logic, like an asset that perhaps is next to a mall or one that's highly impacted by a school, and you could understand what was going on. But then when I tried to apply that fact to other assets that had similar situations, next to a mall, 10 miles away, or highly impacted by a school, the results weren't the same. It was really interesting and unique. And what I did find, though, is that there was a submarket distinction, and that's why I brought up the submarkets. And so Downtown L.A. was highly impacted. And that's why I brought that one up specifically as was the Woodland Hills and Woodland Hills has exposure to the entertainment industry. So we did see those types of impacts. We also saw regional impacts, less in the Pacific Northwest. And of course, there, we have a lot of assets on the Eastside, many of them are garden-style and that type of thing, really low impact. And then in the middle was the Bay Area, and in more in the South, we had greater impact. Some of it was the Disneyland effect. No. I'm glad to hit that. Retail is a really small part of our portfolio, like 1%, 1.5%. Our retail delinquency was basically about half of the retail tenants paid what they owed. So it was roughly in line with other things I've seen in the industry. That group of retail where they're located at multifamily sites typically are relatively handing out their service providers. So when the business shuts down, they struggle. We're working with really all of them and are pretty hopeful that they will be able to reopen back up. And we also will work with them on payment plans. So \u2013 but that group was hit hard, and we've seen that really across the industry in everything I've seen."

Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found on the company\u2019s filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall. You may begin.\nMichael Schall: Good day and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Angela Kleiman and Barb Pak will follow me with comments and Adam Berry is here for Q&A. Today, I will provide an overview of fourth quarter and full year results, our expectations for 2022 and an overview of the apartment investment market. Essex experienced a strong recovery in 2021, following the unprecedented and extraordinary challenges of 2020. The fourth quarter was our second consecutive quarter of positive same-store results and core FFO exceeded our original guidance midpoint by $0.05 per share. Overall, net effective rents remain above pre-COVID levels, despite a modest seasonal slowdown that occurs every fourth quarter. In California, the pandemic and related regulation has led to an unprecedented divergence in apartment performance across our portfolio. The suburban areas that underperformed for most of the past 30 years are now our top performers and our historical top performers are now our ladders. To demonstrate, net effective rents in San Diego, Orange and Ventura counties are up at least 25% from pre-COVID levels, pushing rent-to-income ratios in these counties to all-time highs. Conversely, rents in the tech markets remain well below pre-COVID levels, especially San Francisco and San Mateo counties, which remained down at least 15% and now screen affordable relative to their much higher median household incomes. There is a similar divergence in performance in the large metros that contain both urban and suburban areas. For example, in Los Angeles County, Downtown LA net effective rents are flat from pre-COVID levels, while suburban areas, such as Long Beach and Santa Clarita are up 15% to 20%. We attribute the underperformance of the urban core to the damaging lockdowns in 2020, which resulted in severe job losses in restaurants and the service sectors. More broadly, recoveries in the urban core and major tech companies have been slowed by ongoing government restrictions, worker shortages and delayed return to office plans. While the large tech companies generally did not experience job losses, their hiring slowed during the pandemic and many employees relocated in the initial phase of the pandemic due to citywide shutdowns. As of December 2021, the U.S. has recovered about 96% of jobs lost in the pandemic compared to only 78% for the Essex markets. Obviously, we are disappointed that many tech employers pushed back their office re-openings during the surge of the Omicron variant over the holidays. However, the data indicates that most large tech employers will adopt a hybrid office environment and therefore, the return to office should be a significant catalyst for housing demand in our poorest performing markets. With job growth now exceeding the U.S. average, we believe that our recovery is well underway and several observations support our positive outlook. As highlighted on previous earnings calls, there has been many large investments in office space by the large tech companies this past year, contributing to positive net office absorption in 7 of our 8 major markets, representing 4.8 million square feet of space. Available office sublease space has begun to decline in San Francisco, San Jose, Los Angeles and Seattle, which supports our belief that many companies are moving forward with their return to office plans. As expected, there is a resurgence in service and hospitality-related hiring as our cities recover, with year-over-year increases in leisure hospitality employment ranging from about 29% in Ventura to about 56% in San Francisco. Recent immigration policy changes from the White House announced last week should also support the positive momentum that we are seeing in job growth at the higher income levels. For many years, Santa Clara and San Mateo counties disproportionately benefited from foreign immigration. However, during the COVID pandemic, stricter immigration policies during the previous administration drove net foreign immigration to a 30-year low. We suspect that the recently announced immigration policy changes will contribute to job growth, particularly in the Bay Area. Venture capital investment in the Essex markets continues unabated. In the fourth quarter, approximately $37.5 billion of capital was invested in West Coast-based companies or approximately 40% of the total venture capital deployed in the United States and representing 124% year-over-year increase. The West Coast remains a leader in venture capital, which is a driver of global innovation and in turn local economies and job growth. The top 10 tech employers in our markets continue to seek talent and with open positions listed in California or Washington reaching 47,000 in the fourth quarter, far exceeding the pre-COVID peak by 62%. Turning to our expectations for 2022, Page S-17 of our supplemental package summarizes our key operating expectations and assumptions. We continue to expect full year rent growth of 7.7% for Essex\u2019s West Coast markets. Our rent estimates are derived from a top-down and bottoms-up approach that we continue to refine with each passing year. We are expecting 4.1% job growth in our markets next year, suggesting moderation from the 5.5% trailing 3-month average Essex markets achieved as of December. Even at 4.1%, West Coast job growth should significantly outpace the nation. Our research team conducts its own fundamental analysis of apartment supply and they expect around 37,000 apartment deliveries in 2022. This is slightly higher compared to 2021 and should lead to a limited disruption at stabilized communities. Similar to 2020, there are pockets of apartment supply deliveries in some urban submarkets, notably CBD LA. Similar to 2021 for-sale housing deliveries will remain very muted at about 0.6% of total stock of for-sale homes. Continued improvement in apartment trends in 2022 maybe bolstered by inflationary pressures in the United States currently at the highest level since the early 1980s. While inflation and its countermeasures have the potential to slow the economy, it\u2019s worth noting that apartments are resilient with short lease durations and high operating margins. In addition, it is incredibly difficult to ramp up rental and for-sale housing production on the West Coast given long entitlement processes, government restrictions and construction labor shortages. Finally, we have a conservative debt structure characterized by minimal levels of variable rate debt, staggered debt maturities, and low leverage. Estimating future supply a few years from now is another important part of Essex\u2019s capital allocation process and Page S-17.1 of the supplemental highlights recent increases in housing permit activity in various prominent residential REIT markets. While supply \u2013 while future supply in the Essex markets is expected to drop in 2023 and remain at manageable levels thereafter, supply appears to be increasing in several other markets. It is also important to note that we have limited exposure to the institutional single-family rental market compared to other metros. We continue to believe that housing supply and demand is the fundamental driver of our business and our capital allocation priorities. I have a few brief comments on the apartment investment markets where the deal volume in our markets has now surpassed pre-COVID levels as institutional capital targets West Coast apartments. Cap rates are consistently in the low to mid 3% range and we have seen yields converge across markets, construction types, location and age. We sold 4 properties last year valued at $330 million, using the proceeds to fund stock repurchases early on and then acquisitions as the year progressed and our cost of capital improved. For the year, we acquired $432 million, with the majority of acquisitions completed in a co-investment format to conserve capital. Generally, we see greater deal volumes during uncertain conditions, so we are optimistic about more opportunities to create value in the transaction market in 2022 and Barb will detail our \u201822 guidance assumptions in a moment. With that, I will turn the call over to Angela Kleiman.\nAngela Kleiman: Thanks Mike. First, I\u2019d like to express my gratitude for the exceptional operations and support teams we have here at Essex. As the challenge to our business continue to evolve, our team has also continued to step up, which speaks to the dedication, work ethic and the can-do attitude across the organization. On to today\u2019s comments, I\u2019ll begin with key operational highlights of our major regions, then focus on our outlook for the year, followed by an update on the progress we are making by leveraging technology, data analytics and transforming our operating platform. We are pleased with our fourth quarter results of 4% year-over-year and 1.6% sequential growth in same-property revenues. We have detailed on S-16 of our supplement, which shows the fourth quarter year-over-year new and renewal rent spreads up by 17.1% and 10.7% respectively. The significant recovery in rents over the last year was bolstered by the occupancy and concession strategies we implemented throughout the pandemic. To review our markets by region, I will begin in Southern California, which represents almost 45% of our NOI and was our best performing region in 2021. Through many economic cycles, we have consistently relied on Southern California for steady performance. And during the pandemic, it had exceeded our expectations. The one caveat is the Los Angeles submarket. While it is also showing strong rent growth, this market faces offsetting challenges from the ongoing eviction moratorium and disproportionate bad debt. Notwithstanding these challenges, we remain optimistic with the broader Los Angeles submarket because of the continued strategic commercial investments by companies like Warner Bros, which is planning to develop a 1.3 million square feet of studio and office space in Burbank. This will be the largest studio development in the country and is expected to bring about 1,400 new jobs to the market. Film LA recently reported the production activity hit an all-time high in the fourth quarter and Apple recently proposed a 0.5 million square foot office development in Culver City, which should create approximately 2,500 new jobs. The continued job growth and high cost of homeownership amidst a slight increase in supply deliveries in Orange County and San Diego are factors considered in our expectation for demand for rental housing and the basis for our 2022 outlook for Southern California market rent growth of 7.1%. Moving north to the Bay Area and Northern California, it is no secret that Northern California\u2019s rents have lacked the nation and the Essex portfolio average. We view the region is in early stages of its recovery. Unlike most markets across the country, which are effectively back to normal economic levels, the Bay Area has yet to fully recover due to ongoing COVID regulations such as mask mandates and delayed return to office tempering the momentum of normal economic activities. We have seen communications by Bay Area companies informing employees of plans to return to office after Omicron case subsides and we remain encouraged by the large tech companies\u2019 expansion plans and commercial investments in our markets, as highlighted by Mike. Furthermore, our supply delivery forecast a decline in 2022. Thus, we anticipate rapid recovery in rent growth without requiring a comparable level of increased housing demand. Keep in mind, that our Northern California portfolio is mostly suburban and should benefit from those employees having fewer commuting days in a hybrid environment. These factors contribute to our expectation for Northern California to be one of our strongest rental markets in 2022, with market rent forecasted to increase by 8.7%. Turning to our Seattle portfolio, which continues to perform well, we anticipate a similar level of supply deliveries this year as last year with the majority concentrated in downtown Seattle. Because our portfolio skews to the east side in Bellevue and surrounding suburbs, the demand for our communities remain strong from the continued investments by several companies, most notably Amazon, which has committed to developing a second tower in Bellevue, with construction to start this year and is expected to create an additional 3,500 jobs. Therefore, we forecast Seattle\u2019s market rent growth at 7.2% for 2022. Moving on to the advancements in our operating model, by way of background, our disciplined focus of investing in high-quality submarkets has resulted in 70% of our properties being located within 5 miles of each other. With this competitive advantage in geographic concentration and innovation in technology and data analytics, we have re-envisioned Essex operating model with property collections. Essentially, we are transitioning from a dedicated team at an individual property to teams that will cover a collection of properties along with each associate to specialize in specific function and improving our ability to cross-sell among nearby properties. By organizing properties into collections and centralizing certain administrative duties, we expect to generate more efficiencies across the portfolio. We have already implemented this collections model in Orange County and San Diego and have achieved a reduction in personnel by approximately 10% to 15% through natural attrition. In addition, our data analytics has determined that our ability to cross-sell neighboring communities has increased by over 800 basis points following the adoption of the collections model. We plan to complete the rollout of the collections operating model to the remaining regions by the end of this year. While Essex has been efficient historically with each associate covering 40 units prior to 2019, with recent enhancements, we currently have each associate covering 43 units across the entire portfolio. Further benefits are expected in 2022 and thereafter as we complete our technology and other implementation plans. We are currently co-developing proprietary applications with partners from RET Ventures Fund and other software developers that will enhance the associate and customer experience. One example of advancements in our operating model over the past months has enabled 100% contactless tours, which currently consist of 92% self-guided tours and 8% virtual tours. As part of our technology initiative, we are starting the rollout of Alloy Access, a smart rent common area access solution, which will elevate the resident experience, while also further the productivity of our operations team by enhancing security, usability and monitoring, along with improving the effectiveness of the self-guided tours for prospective customers. In addition, we are working with Funnel to co-develop a tailored solution to further automate our platform, which we plan to rollout later this year. We believe this will directly benefit both the associates and customers through streamlined systems, on-demand features and link communications across properties, which will meaningfully accelerate the timetable to turn prospects into renters. We integrate these advancements with our data analytics platform to provide new operational insights. For example, leveraging newly available data on our leasing patterns from Funnel has improved the quality and effectiveness of our customer interactions. We have also applied advanced analytics with data from site plan to streamline our maintenance workflow, which reduced our unit churn times by 10% in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis despite COVID-related labor challenges. We expect that these initiatives will continue to provide us with additional levers and insights to improve our revenue growth and operating margins in the coming years. With that, I will turn the call over to Barb Pak.\nBarb Pak: Thanks, Angela. Today, I will discuss the key assumptions supporting our 2022 guidance and conclude with an update on the balance sheet. We ended 2021 with strong momentum in the fourth quarter as demonstrated by 4.7% same-property NOI growth and 7.6% core FFO growth. We believe the economic recovery has only just begun on the West Coast and thus, this positive momentum will continue throughout 2022. As such, we are forecasting core FFO per share growth of 9.7% at the midpoint, which is the highest growth in 6 years. We are pleased that our 2022 core FFO per share guidance is expected to exceed our pre-pandemic FFO achieved in 2019 despite the challenging operating environment. This is a testament to our disciplined operating strategy and capital allocation process, which is driving results to the bottom line. Our 2022 FFO growth is primarily driven by a 7.8% increase in our same-property revenues on a cash basis and 8.3% on a GAAP basis. For the year, we expect fewer concessions as compared to last year, but delinquency remains a challenge and we are expecting delinquency of 2.4% of scheduled rent in 2022, which is 30 basis points higher than 2021. We have two counties representing 50% of our total delinquency, where tenant protections remain in place. In addition, response times on tenant applications seeking emergency rental assistance remains slow and outside of our control, leading to large monthly swings in the delinquency line item. As a reminder, our historical annual delinquency has been around 35 basis points of scheduled rent. And given our long history of high collections, we believe we can ultimately return to this level once the various restrictions are lifted. We continue to assist residents in applying for federal tenant release funds and have received $29 million to-date, of which $12 million was in the fourth quarter. As for operating expenses, we are forecasting a 4% increase, which is above our historical average of 2% to 3%. This is the result of wage pressures in the market along with general inflation in the economy for materials. In total, same-property NOI is expected to grow 9.4% on a cash basis. Continuing with our investment expectations for 2022, as we have discussed throughout the past year, we have seen an elevated level of early redemptions of our preferred equity and subordinated loan investments due to high demand for West Coast apartments and low interest rates. In 2021, we had approximately $210 million of redemptions and our 2022 guidance contemplates another $350 million of redemptions. Some of this was pushed from the fourth quarter into this year. Over the past year, it has become more challenging to find new investments given the influx of capital to this segment. However, we were able to secure $117 million of new commitments, with an average yield of 11%, maintaining our disciplined approach to underwriting these projects. Our 2022 guidance contemplates an additional $100 million of new commitments at the midpoint, of which we assume $50 million will be funded during the second half of the year. The remainder of the preferred equity redemption proceeds will be used to fund new acquisitions. Finally, the balance sheet remains in a strong position. During the quarter, we saw continued improvement in our credit metrics and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio declined to 6.3x as EBITDA grew. We expect this trend to continue throughout 2022. Over the past 2 years, we have taken advantage of the low interest rate environment and refinanced nearly 40% of our debt, locking in low rates and reducing our weighted average interest rate by 70 basis points. As such, we have only 6% of our debt maturing over the next 2 years. In addition, we have minimal exposure to short-term rates, with only 4% of our consolidated debt subject to floating rates. As such, we have minimal risk to the rising interest rate environment. Given limited near-term maturities, no material development funding needs and ample liquidity, the company remains in a strong financial position. With that, I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first questions come from the line of Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.\nRich Hill: Hi, good morning, guys. I wanted to maybe just start off with a question about new leases relative to same-store revenue. I typically view new leases as leading indicator of particular revenue and you put up just a huge number for new leases in January, I think, of around 17%. So how are we supposed to think about that and maybe if I could push you a little bit, why is the same-store revenue higher?\nAngela Kleiman: Sure, Rich. It\u2019s Angela here. So let me just give you a little context on the S-16 that shows our new lease it is terrific with 17%. But keep in mind, that\u2019s a year-over-year number to start. And we had communicated that between fourth quarter of 2020 to first quarter of 2021, so that comparable period, that\u2019s when market rent troughed. And so from a year-over-year perspective, we are really hitting kind of the greatest delta, if you will, from a differential perspective. So if we\u2019re talking about really the same-store guidance, what we probably \u2013 I think a better indicator is to look to the S-17 that Mike talked about earlier and you take that market rent of 7.7%, that market rent growth. And then you factor in the loss to lease at year-end. And I know we normally do \u2013 look to the September loss lease, but you might recall that we were \u2013 we had a typical seasonality and the seasonal peak was pushed. So we had caution against using the September loss lease. So if we look at the December loss lease, it\u2019s around 6%. And after and then some of these other factors such as legislation and delinquency, that\u2019s what ultimately drives our midpoint guidance of 7.8%.\nRich Hill: Got it. And look, that makes sense to me. We spend a lot of time on your macro forecast. So I guess your revenue guide was consistent with that, which is sort of what we expected. The newly spread, which is really high, and that\u2019s helpful color. Just one more question for me. When we\u2019re unpacking what you reported and guided to relative to our numbers, one of the things that stood out to us was rising interest expenses and then rising non-same-store expenses. Can you just maybe talk through what you\u2019re expecting for the interest expense side of the equation? And if you\u2019re intentionally being conservative given the interest rate environment that we\u2019re in right now?\nBarb Pak: Hi, Rich, it\u2019s Barb. In terms of the interest expense line, the biggest factor there is the reduction in cap interest as our development pipeline has substantially rolled off. And so that\u2019s a pretty substantial increase in the interest expense. We do have a couple of rate increases forecasted in the guidance, and we will \u2013 it\u2019s really why we have a range, but have a lot of variable rate debt. We only have 4% of our consolidated debt is variable rate. So that\u2019s a small impact to the numbers. It really is the cap interest side of the equation. I think that\u2019s a $4 million reduction.\nRich Hill: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you, guys. I will jump back in, but thank you for that.\nMichael Schall: Thanks, Rich.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your questions.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Hi, good morning. So just a few questions for me. As far as Southern California goes, the strength that, that market is experiencing in general, do you think that will continue? So when San Francisco reopens and those tech jobs once again have to be in the office, are you expecting a migration back of people who migrated down to Southern Cal going back to Northern Cal? Or your view is that everyone who has populated Southern Cal love the lifestyle and is not looking to relocate back.\nMichael Schall: Hi, Alex, it\u2019s Mike. I\u2019ll start with this and then flip it to Angela maybe for some more comments. We think that there is a reversion underway, and it will draw people back to where the jobs were kind of pre pandemic. And so the pandemic caused a lot of disruption with respect to where people went and many people went to Southern California and elsewhere. And so we think as the pandemic winds down, people will go back to where they once were, again, hybrid model being the typical format for a lot of the big companies out here. So we think that some of the people will move from Southern California back to Northern California. But keep in mind, there were people from Southern California that moved to Phoenix and other places as well. So it\u2019s not just a one direction movement, and we think that the overall impact will be beneficial for California in total. So even though some people move from Southern California back to Northern California, that will be offset by potentially other people moving back for job reasons and/or lifestyle decisions. So with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Angela. Anything to add, Angela?\nAngela Kleiman: Maybe just a little historical context, Alex, with the Southern California portfolio and in particular, San Diego, Ventura and Orange County, these are markets that were at \u2013 that perform at a 97% occupancy even pre-COVID. So it\u2019s already a highly desirable place to be. And we combine that with this region having the most \u2013 the strongest loss to lease and it actually has, as far as we can see, pretty long legs. So in the interim, during the reversion that Mike is referring to, it may be more of a net neutral, but long-term, this market will still \u2013 we will see this market continue to perform well with a good tailwind from loss to lease.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then just as a follow-up to that, as part of guidance, and Mike, you\u2019ve spoken about the exodus of the high-tech worker and then the service worker who left when their businesses were shut down. But as far as guidance goes, how much of guidance is predicated on the return of tech workers, return of the baristas? Just trying to get a sense \u2013 or if return to office occurs and if service job, those people who left came back, that\u2019s incremental above and beyond what you\u2019re already assuming in your numbers?\nMichael Schall: Yes, Alex, I would say that it\u2019s already happening. So it\u2019s not a future event necessarily. I think we\u2019re in the middle of the reversion. And I think to point to a statistic just look at job growth, and job growth is \u2013 trailing 3-month job growth is highest in Seattle, 6.2%, followed by Northern California at \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, Southern California by 5.8% and Northern California by 5%. So jobs are coming back. People are starting to move. The Bay Area, obviously, is a step behind, but we think it will catch up given the strength and the uniqueness of the tech employers that are there. And so we think it\u2019s all underway, and it\u2019s just going to take some time to play out. I guess the question is, can it accelerate? I mean we actually expect it to accelerate, especially in the tech markets, which were, of course, those that were most impacted. By the end of the year, we expect that California will \u2013 or our markets will have about 93% of their jobs that they lost during the pandemic recovered. We\u2019re currently at about 78% now. So we expect, again, these trends to continue and pretty favorable for our markets given what the impact on jobs is.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Thank you.\nMichael Schall: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Nick Joseph with Citi. Please proceed with your questions.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. Maybe just following up on that, it seems like another topic at least for San Francisco and maybe Seattle as well as just been quality of life overall. And obviously, a return to the office will help improve things, but do you think there is other steps that need to be taken or will the return to the office really help with quality of life as well?\nMichael Schall: I think quality of life considerations really come into play in the CBDs. The homelessness, concerns about defunding the police, etcetera, I think that is where quality of life issues are more manifest and obvious. And as I say, they are not creating any more beaches around here. So that\u2019s obviously a benefit. And so I think that the quality of life in suburbia is actually very high. And we\u2019re \u2013 as we said before, we\u2019re going to push out a little bit further strategically into some other \u2013 some different markets. And Adam\u2019s here can talk about this, which we\u2019ve never bought invested before, but it represents one of those markets in suburbia. Good community, good decent schools in a very nice Northern San Diego submarket. And we\u2019re looking for that, and we think that we can find great quality of life in some of those markets, and there is great opportunity out there.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. And then as you think about the co-investment and the preferred and the Med book, obviously, you\u2019ve gotten good returns from it, and it\u2019s led to some opportunities. But as you think about kind of earnings and some of the volatility that we\u2019re seeing this year associated with it, how do you think about the size going forward from a strategic perspective?\nMichael Schall: Yes. Nick, I think it\u2019s about right, actually. So we have about $700 billion combined between preferred equity and the debt. And again, we don\u2019t want that business to get to be too large. We, I think, took advantage of an opportunity in 2020 to grow the business a bit given that there was very little else that was working. And I think that\u2019s helped, but it will be somewhat lumpy and that\u2019s the primary reason why the Board and all of us think that we should control its size and not let it get too large. So that\u2019s first and foremost on our mind. If in our \u2013 from our perspective, it is probably the best risk/reward of what we do in terms of how we generate income, and plus there are some other advantages. One of our investments this quarter was a joint venture that came out of the preferred business. So I thought that was having other types of business tied to that is important. Plus, we get we get a look at many development deals that are going on in the marketplace and that allows us to be more discerning with respect to our development pipeline.\nNick Joseph: Thank you.\nMichael Schall: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Rich Hightower with Evercore. Please proceed with your questions.\nRich Hightower: Hi, good morning, guys. I want to go back to a couple of the prepared comments in terms of delinquencies, and I guess the longer term assumption that that delinquency rate will revert more to historical norms. Every time we talk to your coastal peers, regulatory risk is obviously very prominent in the decision to diversify outside of certain markets. I assume this is part of that. So I guess what over the longer term gives you the confidence that the regulatory environment in that regard will indeed get back to where we were pre-COVID?\nMichael Schall: Yes, it\u2019s a good question. And it\u2019s definitely something that\u2019s on our mind. And we will say that it\u2019s frustrating from time to time, but I guess we would ask that everyone take a balanced view of these regulatory risks and look at the other side. And then the other side is that limited housing supply really comes from all the regulations that make it difficult to build housing in these markets. And so we try to balance that equation as best we can and knowing that we are a beneficiary of the supply issues that California has because there is always another regulation that is making it more difficult for us to build housing right around the corner, which is what keep supply under control in California. So keep that in mind. And we know that we need to be a strong advocate with respect to sensible housing policies, and we\u2019re going to be active in that area going forward. But again, we would hate to trade away the unique benefits that we have given the supply restrictions in California.\nRich Hightower: Okay. I appreciate. There is two sides to the comment there, Mike. Maybe one quick follow-up, I mean just are you able to delineate for us on this call, the bad debt percentages in terms of leases that were signed in the pre-COVID advantage, true sort of COVID hardship at the time versus any leases that were signed in the world started to get better again. I mean \u2013 and people that were gaining the system after COVID was already a factor early to do that?\nMichael Schall: I\u2019ll start and then flip it to Barb. A lot of this \u2013 there was nothing in the pre-COVID period that indicated that there were any issues with delinquency. So I\u2019ll make that comment number one. Most of the issues that we have are really related to the government \u2013 the governmental agency, which is \u2013 there is a website called Housing Is Key. And they have very recently about 7 billion in applications and they paid out about 1.9 billion, so they are way behind. And so there is this delay in getting reimbursed for all these claims, and Barb has some information about what\u2019s in process, etcetera. But I guess the key here is that the state agencies are way behind, and there is a lot of money that has been submitted, and we don\u2019t know \u2013 we don\u2019t have control over what\u2019s going to happen with those funds. And so we\u2019re just going to have to wait, which led to what we hope to be is obviously conservative guidance. We weren\u2019t intending to be conservative, but we realize that some of these factors are out of our control and so that we are maybe to the conservative perspective, but we just don\u2019t know. Barb, with that said, I think you have some additional numbers.\nBarb Pak: Yes, Rich. So in terms of our cumulative delinquency, we\u2019re at about $67 million. We have applied for reimbursement for 80% of that, so about $53 million. And of that amount, $33 million relates to our existing residents. However, the tenant \u2013 the timing and amount of being able to collect that is unknown because the program prioritizes based on the resident area meeting income, which is something that we\u2019re not fully privy to at the time they apply. The remainder is applications we apply for on behalf of past residents. Now our ability to collect on that is if the resident will engage, and that\u2019s unknown at this time, but we have applied for everything that we can. And as Mike said, the state of California has been slow to disburse funds, which is causing a lot of the noise in our numbers at this point.\nRich Hightower: Okay, thanks for the color, guys.\nMichael Schall: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.\nBrad Heffern: Hi, Barb, thanks. I was wondering about rent to income. You talked in the prepared comments about the big divergence between urban and suburban. Can you give any figures about where rent to income have trended in those two splits? And if they have moved, has that largely been because rent has moved or has income moved as well? Thanks.\nMichael Schall: Yes. This is Mike, and maybe Angela may have a comment too here. But generally speaking, the good news is that incomes are moving and that affects us in terms of our guidance, but it also helps us charge more rent or allows us to have higher rent levels and helps us much more than what it cost us on the operating expense side. So we\u2019re pleased with higher income levels, and we\u2019re seeing that throughout our portfolio. And in terms of numbers, so Southern California, for example, has a rent to median income. This is the median \u2013 this is not our data, this is a general data that comes from our data vendors, but using median rents and median incomes, we\u2019re currently at 26.9% rent to income in Southern California versus the long-term average of 22.3%, so well in excess of that average. And then conversely, in Northern California, we\u2019re currently at 22.1% rent to income versus a long-term average of 23.1%, so well below in that regard. Seattle is a little bit different. It\u2019s at 21.1% versus 18.7%, respectively. So it suggests that it\u2019s higher in the rent to income versus the long-term average, although that market has changed pretty dramatically in terms of it going from being a lower cost to a higher cost or higher rent market over the last 10 years or so. So I\u2019d say, it\u2019s fundamentally changed its nature. Does that help answer your question?\nBrad Heffern: It does. I mean one of the things I was trying to get at is, specifically for Northern California, when you have the backfill after the initial sort of COVID pain, I\u2019m curious, did you see significantly lower incomes from those people? And that\u2019s part of what caused the pricing pressure? And is there any reversion of that or is the pricing pressure truly just due to other factors?\nMichael Schall: Yes, if that\u2019s the question, yes. No, we see \u2013 so take the leisure and hospitality segment, which lost a tremendous number of jobs because the state shutdown the restaurants and the hotel shut and travel were shutdown basically. So all those people that are generally pretty low wage earners left the Bay Area and went somewhere else. They migrated far and wide or went home with parents, etcetera. And so we\u2019re starting to see them come back. They are skewing the data in terms of their impact on rent income. It looks like we\u2019re bringing in a lot of lower-income workers, but it\u2019s just replacing what we lost a while ago. So there is nothing fundamentally wrong with the Bay Area or any of our markets with respect to income levels. I think they are still in very good shape. The tech companies continue to \u2013 they didn\u2019t lose a lot of employees, and they continue to hire at robust levels, at high income levels. And then those high income levels are what really drive the demand for the services, all the jobs that we lost early on in the pandemic. And the high incomes \u2013 people here make enough money that they can pay a little bit more for their dinner and some of these other services. And so we just don\u2019t see that as a key issue. The key issue is, how do you draw back people that left in the early parts of the pandemic, how do you draw them back now. And I think that\u2019s an ongoing process. Is that helps?\nBrad Heffern: Thank you. Yes, that\u2019s perfect.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.\nJohn Kim: Hello. I was wondering if you talked about sourcing new preferred Med has been challenging in this environment. Would you consider doing deals outside of your core markets, not necessarily to own the equity, but just provide a wider pool of more opportunities?\nMichael Schall: This is Mike. Actually, I\u2019m going to give it to Adam in a minute, but we \u2013 the answer is, we are, to some extent. In other words, we\u2019re not going to completely different markets that we\u2019re pushing into other markets. Adam, we want to give them a couple of examples of deals that we\u2019ve done?\nAdam Berry: Yes. John, so we have been tracking in other markets since really the platform was put into place, and we\u2019ve actually \u2013 we\u2019ve done \u2013 echo on my set. So we look slightly outside of our markets to where we think the fundamentals are still there. They \u2013 and so a couple of that we have done, we did one in Redland [ph], which is Inland Empire. That one is going well currently funded. And then we have one round trip in Sacramento. That market has obviously done very well. So we continue to track markets within our overall footprint, but a little outside, and we will consider a little further beyond that.\nJohn Kim: Okay. So nothing outside of the West Coast really?\nMichael Schall: Yes.\nJohn Kim: My second question is on your revenue-generating CapEx guidance of $100 million, which is more than double what you invested in last year. How much does this add to same-store revenue growth this year versus 2023? Is it fair to assume that most of this CapEx will be outside of Northern California?\nBarb Pak: We actually are looking at these opportunities throughout the portfolio. So it\u2019s not skewed toward one region because we are seeing strong market rent growth in all of our portfolios in all of our regions. And as far as when they will be realized, less likely in 2022, just because, as you know, it takes time to renovate and then get them leased up until that time. By the time that occurs, you certainly wouldn\u2019t have a full year of revenue. So it\u2019s more likely going to impact 2023.\nJohn Kim: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your questions.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Hi, thank you. Mike, in your prepared remarks, you referenced that buyers in the markets are not really discerning, I guess, between location and maybe vintage of product. And so is that simply just a function of the amount of capital that\u2019s coming into your markets and chasing deals? And separately, is there really any opportunity for you to pull forward any portfolio management objectives as a result of kind of everything seemingly converging in pricing?\nAdam Berry: Hi, Austin, this is Adam. I can start with that and then if Mike has any follow-ups. So we\u2019re seeing a different buyer pool for different vintages and different locations, but ultimately, what you said in your question is right. There is so much capital chasing these deals, whether it\u2019s coming from value-add funds or larger core funds or whomever that the compression between product age type, construction type and location has been significant and continues to remain today. As it relates \u2013 Mike, do you want to cover that?\nMichael Schall: Yes. The \u2013 could you repeat the question about the portfolio?\nAustin Wurschmidt: Yes. Just portfolio management objectives trading around some markets, increasing product quality, whatever sort of is in your...?\nMichael Schall: Yes, the broader management objectives, yes. We continue to believe that we can add value in a variety of ways. And it isn\u2019t that we are necessarily going to dramatically increase our portfolio allocation to any one market or decrease it. I think that we are overall pretty happy. We want our to see how the pandemic recovery plays out. Like everyone else, there is a number of unknowns about portfolio transitions, and we would like to get into a more normal world. As I mentioned in the \u2013 in my prepared remarks, the laggards of the last 30 years from now are top-performing markets. Is that possible that, that continues, or does it revert back. And I suspect that there will be some fairly significant amount of reversion. As we think of the world, we think that probably the urban core \u2013 again, given issues with homelessness, crime, etcetera, are probably a mile \u2013 negative mile to significant negative. Hopefully, the cities get control over some of these issues. I think they can definitely do that with respect to crime. I am not so sure that there is a plan when it comes to homelessness. But again, that\u2019s pretty focused on the urban core, much less so in \u2013 throughout the suburban parts of our portfolio, which is where the vast majority of our property is located. We have commented actually before the pandemic on deemphasizing the city centers, partially due to what I just said. And so that remains something that we will take a look at and potentially transact around going forward. But overall, North South balance, Seattle, I think was doing really incredibly well, great job growth and couple of key drivers up there in Microsoft and Amazon are really pushing that market. So , we would like to increase our portfolio up there actually, but it\u2019s difficult to find the product at the price that adds value, so more to say, we have been there before.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Yes. Got it. And then just maybe given where the stock is trading, certainly preferred, I think have the preferred equity investments have been one of the most attractive you have referenced. But beyond that, given where your stock is trading, is the joint venture still one of the best uses? Do you take a look at issuing from time-to-time where you are trading today? What\u2019s sort of the thinking around your cost of capital and potential uses?\nMichael Schall: Yes. When we look at deals, our deal generation is sort of independent of how we capitalize or how we take the deal down. And where we believe that we are adding value to the company and that could be core FFO or cash flow and/or NAV per share to the company, we will take it down on the balance sheet. And at times like now where we don\u2019t think we can add value, we will do it in our \u2013 one of our co-investments where we are still a substantial owner. We still own about 50% of these transactions, and we manage it and therefore, we earn some \u2013 a small amount of fee income. But it\u2019s really driven by the capital side of the equation. And again, at this point, we probably wouldn\u2019t issue stock. We would prefer to transact in a co-investment format.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street. Please proceed with your questions.\nJohn Pawlowski: Thanks. Just one follow-up question to that, the North and South \u2013 Southern California balance in the portfolio either for Mike or Adam, I guess I am listening, Mike, to your opening remarks and the unset investment takeaways by Northern California by the laggard or maybe sell or prune the winners just in terms of the dispersion of relative rents we have seen in the last 24 months. So, kind of pounding the table on the mean reversion trade, why don\u2019t you have as much conviction to go out and tilt the portfolio on the margin towards Northern California more heavily?\nMichael Schall: John, it\u2019s a great question, and Adam, will you bring me 100 buildings in Northern California, please, at a 3.8% cap rate. That\u2019s the answer. It\u2019s not there. And if we could do it, we would. We did buy one property in Fremont, again, a co-investment. We would buy more if we could, John. But again, the markets are going to evolve and perhaps, we will continue to see more products hit the market. And we wouldn\u2019t \u2013 for high-quality property in the right areas of the Bay Area, we are not black lining the Bay Area by any means.\nAdam Berry: Just to tack on a little there. We see every deal that\u2019s marketed and every deal that\u2019s not marketed, and so it\u2019s always a relative game. And so we are underwriting consistently up and down the portfolio and jumping in where we see opportunity for that value add. Otherwise, we have seen deals in Bay Area closed at 3.1%, 3.2% cap, and that\u2019s not where we are going to compete.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. So, going in economic yields are still meaningfully lower in Northern California than LA, Orange County, San Diego?\nMichael Schall: I keep telling Adam. I say, Adam, well, interest rates are going up. So, what\u2019s going on with cap rates. And Adam keeps telling me, they are pushing down, right. I mean that\u2019s effectively what we have seen.\nAdam Berry: That\u2019s effectively right. And so John, it\u2019s not even going in. So that 3.1%, 3 2% cap that I quoted is economics. So, taking all units to market as of today. So, there is \u2013 it doesn\u2019t include any future growth, but that\u2019s still absorbing loss of lease, so, yes, very competitive.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. Thank you.\nMichael Schall: Thanks John.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please proceed with your questions.\nHaendel St. Juste: Hi. I guess it\u2019s still morning out there. Good morning. I wanted to \u2013 I have a question on your blended rate. I guess I am trying to better understand the cadence in the back half of the year versus the first half and some of the key drivers or underlying assumptions. You started off the year on a strong foot. You seem to be fairly optimistic about an improvement in back half of the year. But looking at the guide, there is a massive drop-off to get to your same revenue guide. So, maybe you can help me understand or square that a bit more. Thanks.\nBarb Pak: Sure, Haendel. It\u2019s really more of a function of the year-over-year comparable. And so we expect the first half to be much stronger because first half of 2021, it was still quite soft. And of course, we started recovering in the second half of 2021. And so from a year-over-year perspective, this year, the second half will be harder comparable, and that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving the trends.\nHaendel St. Juste: No, I understand that. So, I guess maybe helping us understand maybe the delta perhaps between some of the regions in the back half of the year. Obviously, there is some tailwinds helping North Cal, but perhaps, North Cal has more headwinds given how well it\u2019s reformed. So, maybe a bit more color perhaps on maybe the spread that you are thinking of there?\nBarb Pak: Well, in terms of the spread, what we see is, in Seattle, would be the highest from a year-over-year on the second half because it has higher loss to lease and lower delinquency and better concession benefit. And Northern California and Southern California are pretty much very comparable. Southern California, because of the challenge by delinquency, while Northern California has that concessionary benefit and so they end up more similar, but in terms of spread, we are not talking \u2013 we are talking, say, 40 basis points versus not hundreds of basis points. So, they are all pretty not close.\nHaendel St. Juste: Okay. That\u2019s helpful.\nBarb Pak: And Haendel, just one question, are you asking about market rent growth or same-store growth? I am just trying to understand?\nHaendel St. Juste: Yes. No, I guess the first question was more on the blended rate growth within the same-store, but the market commentary is helpful.\nBarb Pak: Okay.\nHaendel St. Juste: Where are you guys \u2013 I mean I don\u2019t know if I missed it, but you guys mentioned where you are sending out renewals today for February and March?\nBarb Pak: We didn\u2019t \u2013 let me take a quick look. So, on the renewals, we are sending out \u2013 hold on, 2022. Where is that, here. So, we are sending renewals out, portfolio average in the low teens, so around, say, 13%-ish. And with Seattle, the highest, followed by North Cal and in South Cal, around 10%-ish.\nHaendel St. Juste: Got it. And that\u2019s helpful. Mike, I guess a question for you. I heard your comments earlier about VC investment. And I understand there is a lot of profitable and very viable, established companies, tech companies today, but I guess I am curious, how concerned you might be regarding the ongoing Facebook or Meta troubles and the number of not yet profitable start-ups. I guess I am curious what \u2013 any level of concern you might have at all as to what might happen to your job growth assumptions that these companies have to cut G&A?\nMichael Schall: Yes. Haendel, it\u2019s definitely a concern. But I don\u2019t think in terms of the STEM graduates and the workers that are in these fields, I don\u2019t think there is any shortage of positions that might be available to them. There is plenty of jobs out there. I was coming out of college, I worked for venture capital company. And so I was there for quite some time, and it\u2019s amazing how different the world is. And these companies are venture financed for a much longer period of time now, and the rounds are much larger. In fact, I think most of the money that was deployed that I discussed in the script was mega rounds, rounds exceeding $100 billion. So, we have some concern about it. Obviously, those companies are more vulnerable. And therefore, I think that\u2019s warranted. I have been through that in my career in the late \u201890s, where all these companies went public and without a product, and they didn\u2019t work out well. So, I think the current model of venture capital funding is much better and much more resilient. And a lot of these companies, the best ones will see it through. And the ones that don\u2019t succeed, I think the employees have plenty of opportunity out there at some of the other companies. That\u2019s what makes the Bay Area such a unique place from a technology employment standpoint.\nHaendel St. Juste: That\u2019s helpful. And if I could squeeze one more. I don\u2019t know if I missed that number, too, but did you guys tell us what\u2019s embedded in the guide for rental assisted payments for this year?\nBarb Pak: Haendel, this is Barb. Like I mentioned earlier, we have applied for $52 million of our cumulative delinquency, $32 million of that is our existing tenants, and we feel good about that number. However, the timing is very uncertain. And what we do is, we forecast on a net basis. So, we have assumed that delinquency does increase this year because of the uncertainty related to the timing of payments on the \u2013 these applications as well as the California program, which the applications have exceeded the amount that\u2019s already been allocated to the State. So, there is a variety of things that led us to that assumption.\nHaendel St. Juste: Okay. So, if I understand it, should you be successful in getting \u2013 I guess I am trying to understand, how \u2013 what level of payments are kind of embedded? And where the upside \u2013 where that line lies, I guess I am having trouble understanding what exactly is the net number, the absolute number that\u2019s included in the guide this year?|\nBarb Pak: So, in our guidance is a 2.4% delinquency as a percent of scheduled rent. That\u2019s what will drive our numbers. And one thing that we are seeing is our delinquency has gotten worse overall \u2013 our net delinquency has gotten more over the last couple of months as more of our tenants are applying for aid as the program has changed recently to allow tenant supply for three additional months. Therefore, applications are going up. So, there is a lot of moving parts on that front, but the net number is, we do expect delinquency to get slightly worse this year before it gets better.\nHaendel St. Juste: Okay. Thanks. I will follow-up offline. But thank you all. I appreciate the time. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Rich Anderson with SMBC. Please proceed with your questions.\nRich Anderson: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. So, is there any logic to the concept that regulatory environment could actually be a good thing in terms of being a magnet for residents. I know some of your peers are running because of regulation, but on the other side of that table is perhaps a resident \u2013 I don\u2019t know. I would like to know that I have tenant-friendly regulation behind me if I am living in California. Is there any relevance to that line of thinking in your mind, Mike?\nMichael Schall: Yes, Rich, it\u2019s a good concept. People generally don\u2019t think they are landlord very much. We don\u2019t hear a great deal of appreciation. But having said that, I mean I think that tenants do appreciate it. Candidly, from my perspective, I worry that it\u2019s taking advantage of the system as opposed to we will offer a safety net, we are all for helping people out that it can go too far in trying to find that comfortable middle ground, I think is what they are trying to do. And I am very glad I am not managing that program, by the way. So, I think it\u2019s a good point. I think people do appreciate that part of California, and \u2013 but they are going to do what\u2019s best for them, which ultimately will come down to their job and their quality of life and those factors that we spend most of our time thinking about.\nRich Anderson: Right. I mean Costa-Hawkins reversal is defeated. CPI plus 5% state-wide rent cap. I mean these weren\u2019t terrible events in the life cycle of multifamily California, but anyway. Second question is, you mentioned that cap rates are still going down with, I guess what we would call the threat of rising interest rates, still tenures at historical lows. But I look back, 2018 tenure was over 3%. And I had looked at what you said in your call at the time, you said cap rates are running around 4.25%. So, are you kind of quietly hoping for perhaps an increase in interest rates to something more like that and also inflation because of the pass-through qualities of multifamily and that you could really start to see some opportunities come. I know it\u2019s 3.1% now on the cap rate, but maybe that changes if we get some real change to the interest rate environment, and that perhaps opens up opportunities for you and you are more substantial cost or capital raising opportunities versus your peers?\nMichael Schall: Yes. No, it\u2019s a great question, great observation. And I think that the company is positioned sort of for the worst-case scenario, whatever might be in terms of the balance sheet and the overall structure. A world in which incomes are inflating and rents are inflating is a good world for us, I think. I mean I think that there will be opportunity. And even though our \u2013 probably, our interest costs would go up in that scenario, the vast majority of our debt is pretty well locked down in terms of maturities and rates. So, that would be a good world for us, and I think there is a reasonable chance that\u2019s where we are on.\nRich Anderson: So, is a four -handle type cap rate, is there anything systemic about your world right now that, that can\u2019t happen even if a scenario of 3% plus 10-year were to happen because that \u2013 I would assume that, that\u2019s a very realistic?\nMichael Schall: Yes, it\u2019s \u2013 I mean the comment I would make is that cap rates tend to be pretty sticky over time. So, they don\u2019t just change overnight just because interest rates move up or down. And I would say, back in those \u2013 the 2018 period you were referring to, we were maybe a little frustrated that cap rates weren\u2019t moving down somewhat given how much the tenure had rallied. But until the COVID period, they remain pretty sticky even though you had pretty significant reductions in interest rates over that period of time. I think that probably you are not going to see cap rates adjust upward quickly. There is too much money looking for a yield and yield investment and 3% versus some of the options is still 3% and is still in the scheme of things interesting to some investors. So, I wouldn\u2019t expect that to change it. Really is all about the flow of money and the number of investors that need yield and what the other yield alternatives are.\nRich Anderson: Okay. Great. Thanks very much.\nMichael Schall: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Chandni Luthra. Please proceed with your questions.\nChandni Luthra: Hi, good afternoon everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. Could you talk about the drivers behind sequential same-store revenue declines in some of your markets in fourth quarter? I am talking about markets like San Diego 3%, San Fran down \u2013 about 2%. Similarly, Contra Costa, I mean how much of this was perhaps a disappointment on return to offices? We were just crossing that Labor Day mark versus faced some seasonal factors that had a role to play here.\nAngela Kleiman: Sure, happy to. It\u2019s Angela here. The sequential revenue decline really was not a concern for us this time because it\u2019s really attributed to the timing of the lumpy delinquency recovery. And so what I mean by that is, in the third quarter, we have very favorable delinquency recovery. So, if you take San Diego, for example, if I back out delinquency, the sequential revenue growth would have been 1.6%. And so a similar relationship plays out for both Contra Costa and in San Francisco as well.\nChandni Luthra: Very helpful. Makes sense. And my follow-up question is around your collections operating model. Now you talked about rollout by the end of 2022. And you also said that you implemented this in Orange County and San Diego. So taking that sort of as an example, and let\u2019s say, thinking about 10% to 15% reduction in personnel to natural attrition across the portfolio. Is there a way to contextualize that in some cost savings, either in terms of dollars or in terms of margins? That would be very helpful.\nAngela Kleiman: Yes. I think the one example that we provided with the rollout and some of our other enhancements has already realized a saving of about 150 basis points in margin improvement and that represents about $15 million to the bottom line to NOI. And so my point in providing that context is that from a \u2013 if you look at the rollout, we are only a third way through and that was \u2013 that represents a rollout of really just two of our major regions. And so \u2013 which is why I provided indication of an additional 200 basis points to 300 basis points expectation of margin improvement just from the cost savings. And of course, with revenue, there is more to come on there, but that\u2019s several years down the road.\nChandni Luthra: Very helpful. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Yes. Hi. Just maybe wanted to explore your comments around being pushing further out in the suburbs. I guess how do you think about kind of identifying these new targets further out from the urban core? And does this also imply you will have more capital recycling for those assets closer in?\nAdam Berry: Hi Joshua. This is Adam. I can start off. As Mike noted previously, we have been somewhat rotating outside of the urban centers now here for a few years since \u2013 before the pandemic, and so we use our research team to assess. We look at all the top line metrics to see what areas within kind of our core footprint makes sense. And that\u2019s how to say, Sacramento, for instance, that deal was done pre-pandemic. And even at that point, the \u2013 between job growth and income and affordability, lack of affordability for single-family homes, it made sense on all of our metrics, which \u2013 that\u2019s what drives our investment decisions. So, we have a research team that reviews all those metrics amongst a number of both our more core markets as well as more secondary markets.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Michael Schall for any closing comments.\nMichael Schall: Thank you. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I appreciate your participation on the call, and we hope to see many of you in the not distant future at the Citi Conference. Thank you. Good day.\nOperator: This does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Schall",
            "content": "Good day and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Angela Kleiman and Barb Pak will follow me with comments and Adam Berry is here for Q&A. Today, I will provide an overview of fourth quarter and full year results, our expectations for 2022 and an overview of the apartment investment market. Essex experienced a strong recovery in 2021, following the unprecedented and extraordinary challenges of 2020. The fourth quarter was our second consecutive quarter of positive same-store results and core FFO exceeded our original guidance midpoint by $0.05 per share. Overall, net effective rents remain above pre-COVID levels, despite a modest seasonal slowdown that occurs every fourth quarter. In California, the pandemic and related regulation has led to an unprecedented divergence in apartment performance across our portfolio. The suburban areas that underperformed for most of the past 30 years are now our top performers and our historical top performers are now our ladders. To demonstrate, net effective rents in San Diego, Orange and Ventura counties are up at least 25% from pre-COVID levels, pushing rent-to-income ratios in these counties to all-time highs. Conversely, rents in the tech markets remain well below pre-COVID levels, especially San Francisco and San Mateo counties, which remained down at least 15% and now screen affordable relative to their much higher median household incomes. There is a similar divergence in performance in the large metros that contain both urban and suburban areas. For example, in Los Angeles County, Downtown LA net effective rents are flat from pre-COVID levels, while suburban areas, such as Long Beach and Santa Clarita are up 15% to 20%. We attribute the underperformance of the urban core to the damaging lockdowns in 2020, which resulted in severe job losses in restaurants and the service sectors. More broadly, recoveries in the urban core and major tech companies have been slowed by ongoing government restrictions, worker shortages and delayed return to office plans. While the large tech companies generally did not experience job losses, their hiring slowed during the pandemic and many employees relocated in the initial phase of the pandemic due to citywide shutdowns. As of December 2021, the U.S. has recovered about 96% of jobs lost in the pandemic compared to only 78% for the Essex markets. Obviously, we are disappointed that many tech employers pushed back their office re-openings during the surge of the Omicron variant over the holidays. However, the data indicates that most large tech employers will adopt a hybrid office environment and therefore, the return to office should be a significant catalyst for housing demand in our poorest performing markets. With job growth now exceeding the U.S. average, we believe that our recovery is well underway and several observations support our positive outlook. As highlighted on previous earnings calls, there has been many large investments in office space by the large tech companies this past year, contributing to positive net office absorption in 7 of our 8 major markets, representing 4.8 million square feet of space. Available office sublease space has begun to decline in San Francisco, San Jose, Los Angeles and Seattle, which supports our belief that many companies are moving forward with their return to office plans. As expected, there is a resurgence in service and hospitality-related hiring as our cities recover, with year-over-year increases in leisure hospitality employment ranging from about 29% in Ventura to about 56% in San Francisco. Recent immigration policy changes from the White House announced last week should also support the positive momentum that we are seeing in job growth at the higher income levels. For many years, Santa Clara and San Mateo counties disproportionately benefited from foreign immigration. However, during the COVID pandemic, stricter immigration policies during the previous administration drove net foreign immigration to a 30-year low. We suspect that the recently announced immigration policy changes will contribute to job growth, particularly in the Bay Area. Venture capital investment in the Essex markets continues unabated. In the fourth quarter, approximately $37.5 billion of capital was invested in West Coast-based companies or approximately 40% of the total venture capital deployed in the United States and representing 124% year-over-year increase. The West Coast remains a leader in venture capital, which is a driver of global innovation and in turn local economies and job growth. The top 10 tech employers in our markets continue to seek talent and with open positions listed in California or Washington reaching 47,000 in the fourth quarter, far exceeding the pre-COVID peak by 62%. Turning to our expectations for 2022, Page S-17 of our supplemental package summarizes our key operating expectations and assumptions. We continue to expect full year rent growth of 7.7% for Essex's West Coast markets. Our rent estimates are derived from a top-down and bottoms-up approach that we continue to refine with each passing year. We are expecting 4.1% job growth in our markets next year, suggesting moderation from the 5.5% trailing 3-month average Essex markets achieved as of December. Even at 4.1%, West Coast job growth should significantly outpace the nation. Our research team conducts its own fundamental analysis of apartment supply and they expect around 37,000 apartment deliveries in 2022. This is slightly higher compared to 2021 and should lead to a limited disruption at stabilized communities. Similar to 2020, there are pockets of apartment supply deliveries in some urban submarkets, notably CBD LA. Similar to 2021 for-sale housing deliveries will remain very muted at about 0.6% of total stock of for-sale homes. Continued improvement in apartment trends in 2022 maybe bolstered by inflationary pressures in the United States currently at the highest level since the early 1980s. While inflation and its countermeasures have the potential to slow the economy, it's worth noting that apartments are resilient with short lease durations and high operating margins. In addition, it is incredibly difficult to ramp up rental and for-sale housing production on the West Coast given long entitlement processes, government restrictions and construction labor shortages. Finally, we have a conservative debt structure characterized by minimal levels of variable rate debt, staggered debt maturities, and low leverage. Estimating future supply a few years from now is another important part of Essex's capital allocation process and Page S-17.1 of the supplemental highlights recent increases in housing permit activity in various prominent residential REIT markets. While supply \u2013 while future supply in the Essex markets is expected to drop in 2023 and remain at manageable levels thereafter, supply appears to be increasing in several other markets. It is also important to note that we have limited exposure to the institutional single-family rental market compared to other metros. We continue to believe that housing supply and demand is the fundamental driver of our business and our capital allocation priorities. I have a few brief comments on the apartment investment markets where the deal volume in our markets has now surpassed pre-COVID levels as institutional capital targets West Coast apartments. Cap rates are consistently in the low to mid 3% range and we have seen yields converge across markets, construction types, location and age. We sold 4 properties last year valued at $330 million, using the proceeds to fund stock repurchases early on and then acquisitions as the year progressed and our cost of capital improved. For the year, we acquired $432 million, with the majority of acquisitions completed in a co-investment format to conserve capital. Generally, we see greater deal volumes during uncertain conditions, so we are optimistic about more opportunities to create value in the transaction market in 2022 and Barb will detail our \u201822 guidance assumptions in a moment. With that, I will turn the call over to Angela Kleiman. Thanks, Rich. Hi, Alex, it's Mike. I'll start with this and then flip it to Angela maybe for some more comments. We think that there is a reversion underway, and it will draw people back to where the jobs were kind of pre pandemic. And so the pandemic caused a lot of disruption with respect to where people went and many people went to Southern California and elsewhere. And so we think as the pandemic winds down, people will go back to where they once were, again, hybrid model being the typical format for a lot of the big companies out here. So we think that some of the people will move from Southern California back to Northern California. But keep in mind, there were people from Southern California that moved to Phoenix and other places as well. So it's not just a one direction movement, and we think that the overall impact will be beneficial for California in total. So even though some people move from Southern California back to Northern California, that will be offset by potentially other people moving back for job reasons and/or lifestyle decisions. So with that, I'll turn it over to Angela. Anything to add, Angela? Yes, Alex, I would say that it's already happening. So it's not a future event necessarily. I think we're in the middle of the reversion. And I think to point to a statistic just look at job growth, and job growth is \u2013 trailing 3-month job growth is highest in Seattle, 6.2%, followed by Northern California at \u2013 I'm sorry, Southern California by 5.8% and Northern California by 5%. So jobs are coming back. People are starting to move. The Bay Area, obviously, is a step behind, but we think it will catch up given the strength and the uniqueness of the tech employers that are there. And so we think it's all underway, and it's just going to take some time to play out. I guess the question is, can it accelerate? I mean we actually expect it to accelerate, especially in the tech markets, which were, of course, those that were most impacted. By the end of the year, we expect that California will \u2013 or our markets will have about 93% of their jobs that they lost during the pandemic recovered. We're currently at about 78% now. So we expect, again, these trends to continue and pretty favorable for our markets given what the impact on jobs is. Thank you. I think quality of life considerations really come into play in the CBDs. The homelessness, concerns about defunding the police, etcetera, I think that is where quality of life issues are more manifest and obvious. And as I say, they are not creating any more beaches around here. So that's obviously a benefit. And so I think that the quality of life in suburbia is actually very high. And we're \u2013 as we said before, we're going to push out a little bit further strategically into some other \u2013 some different markets. And Adam's here can talk about this, which we've never bought invested before, but it represents one of those markets in suburbia. Good community, good decent schools in a very nice Northern San Diego submarket. And we're looking for that, and we think that we can find great quality of life in some of those markets, and there is great opportunity out there. Yes. Nick, I think it's about right, actually. So we have about $700 billion combined between preferred equity and the debt. And again, we don't want that business to get to be too large. We, I think, took advantage of an opportunity in 2020 to grow the business a bit given that there was very little else that was working. And I think that's helped, but it will be somewhat lumpy and that's the primary reason why the Board and all of us think that we should control its size and not let it get too large. So that's first and foremost on our mind. If in our \u2013 from our perspective, it is probably the best risk/reward of what we do in terms of how we generate income, and plus there are some other advantages. One of our investments this quarter was a joint venture that came out of the preferred business. So I thought that was having other types of business tied to that is important. Plus, we get we get a look at many development deals that are going on in the marketplace and that allows us to be more discerning with respect to our development pipeline. Thanks. Yes, it's a good question. And it's definitely something that's on our mind. And we will say that it's frustrating from time to time, but I guess we would ask that everyone take a balanced view of these regulatory risks and look at the other side. And then the other side is that limited housing supply really comes from all the regulations that make it difficult to build housing in these markets. And so we try to balance that equation as best we can and knowing that we are a beneficiary of the supply issues that California has because there is always another regulation that is making it more difficult for us to build housing right around the corner, which is what keep supply under control in California. So keep that in mind. And we know that we need to be a strong advocate with respect to sensible housing policies, and we're going to be active in that area going forward. But again, we would hate to trade away the unique benefits that we have given the supply restrictions in California. I'll start and then flip it to Barb. A lot of this \u2013 there was nothing in the pre-COVID period that indicated that there were any issues with delinquency. So I'll make that comment number one. Most of the issues that we have are really related to the government \u2013 the governmental agency, which is \u2013 there is a website called Housing Is Key. And they have very recently about 7 billion in applications and they paid out about 1.9 billion, so they are way behind. And so there is this delay in getting reimbursed for all these claims, and Barb has some information about what's in process, etcetera. But I guess the key here is that the state agencies are way behind, and there is a lot of money that has been submitted, and we don't know \u2013 we don't have control over what's going to happen with those funds. And so we're just going to have to wait, which led to what we hope to be is obviously conservative guidance. We weren't intending to be conservative, but we realize that some of these factors are out of our control and so that we are maybe to the conservative perspective, but we just don't know. Barb, with that said, I think you have some additional numbers. Thank you. Yes. This is Mike, and maybe Angela may have a comment too here. But generally speaking, the good news is that incomes are moving and that affects us in terms of our guidance, but it also helps us charge more rent or allows us to have higher rent levels and helps us much more than what it cost us on the operating expense side. So we're pleased with higher income levels, and we're seeing that throughout our portfolio. And in terms of numbers, so Southern California, for example, has a rent to median income. This is the median \u2013 this is not our data, this is a general data that comes from our data vendors, but using median rents and median incomes, we're currently at 26.9% rent to income in Southern California versus the long-term average of 22.3%, so well in excess of that average. And then conversely, in Northern California, we're currently at 22.1% rent to income versus a long-term average of 23.1%, so well below in that regard. Seattle is a little bit different. It's at 21.1% versus 18.7%, respectively. So it suggests that it's higher in the rent to income versus the long-term average, although that market has changed pretty dramatically in terms of it going from being a lower cost to a higher cost or higher rent market over the last 10 years or so. So I'd say, it's fundamentally changed its nature. Does that help answer your question? Yes, if that's the question, yes. No, we see \u2013 so take the leisure and hospitality segment, which lost a tremendous number of jobs because the state shutdown the restaurants and the hotel shut and travel were shutdown basically. So all those people that are generally pretty low wage earners left the Bay Area and went somewhere else. They migrated far and wide or went home with parents, etcetera. And so we're starting to see them come back. They are skewing the data in terms of their impact on rent income. It looks like we're bringing in a lot of lower-income workers, but it's just replacing what we lost a while ago. So there is nothing fundamentally wrong with the Bay Area or any of our markets with respect to income levels. I think they are still in very good shape. The tech companies continue to \u2013 they didn't lose a lot of employees, and they continue to hire at robust levels, at high income levels. And then those high income levels are what really drive the demand for the services, all the jobs that we lost early on in the pandemic. And the high incomes \u2013 people here make enough money that they can pay a little bit more for their dinner and some of these other services. And so we just don't see that as a key issue. The key issue is, how do you draw back people that left in the early parts of the pandemic, how do you draw them back now. And I think that's an ongoing process. Is that helps? This is Mike. Actually, I'm going to give it to Adam in a minute, but we \u2013 the answer is, we are, to some extent. In other words, we're not going to completely different markets that we're pushing into other markets. Adam, we want to give them a couple of examples of deals that we've done? Yes. Yes. The \u2013 could you repeat the question about the portfolio? Yes, the broader management objectives, yes. We continue to believe that we can add value in a variety of ways. And it isn't that we are necessarily going to dramatically increase our portfolio allocation to any one market or decrease it. I think that we are overall pretty happy. We want our to see how the pandemic recovery plays out. Like everyone else, there is a number of unknowns about portfolio transitions, and we would like to get into a more normal world. As I mentioned in the \u2013 in my prepared remarks, the laggards of the last 30 years from now are top-performing markets. Is that possible that, that continues, or does it revert back. And I suspect that there will be some fairly significant amount of reversion. As we think of the world, we think that probably the urban core \u2013 again, given issues with homelessness, crime, etcetera, are probably a mile \u2013 negative mile to significant negative. Hopefully, the cities get control over some of these issues. I think they can definitely do that with respect to crime. I am not so sure that there is a plan when it comes to homelessness. But again, that's pretty focused on the urban core, much less so in \u2013 throughout the suburban parts of our portfolio, which is where the vast majority of our property is located. We have commented actually before the pandemic on deemphasizing the city centers, partially due to what I just said. And so that remains something that we will take a look at and potentially transact around going forward. But overall, North South balance, Seattle, I think was doing really incredibly well, great job growth and couple of key drivers up there in Microsoft and Amazon are really pushing that market. So , we would like to increase our portfolio up there actually, but it's difficult to find the product at the price that adds value, so more to say, we have been there before. Yes. When we look at deals, our deal generation is sort of independent of how we capitalize or how we take the deal down. And where we believe that we are adding value to the company and that could be core FFO or cash flow and/or NAV per share to the company, we will take it down on the balance sheet. And at times like now where we don't think we can add value, we will do it in our \u2013 one of our co-investments where we are still a substantial owner. We still own about 50% of these transactions, and we manage it and therefore, we earn some \u2013 a small amount of fee income. But it's really driven by the capital side of the equation. And again, at this point, we probably wouldn't issue stock. We would prefer to transact in a co-investment format. John, it's a great question, and Adam, will you bring me 100 buildings in Northern California, please, at a 3.8% cap rate. That's the answer. It's not there. And if we could do it, we would. We did buy one property in Fremont, again, a co-investment. We would buy more if we could, John. But again, the markets are going to evolve and perhaps, we will continue to see more products hit the market. And we wouldn't \u2013 for high-quality property in the right areas of the Bay Area, we are not black lining the Bay Area by any means. I keep telling Adam. I say, Adam, well, interest rates are going up. So, what's going on with cap rates. And Adam keeps telling me, they are pushing down, right. I mean that's effectively what we have seen. Thanks John. Yes. Haendel, it's definitely a concern. But I don't think in terms of the STEM graduates and the workers that are in these fields, I don't think there is any shortage of positions that might be available to them. There is plenty of jobs out there. I was coming out of college, I worked for venture capital company. And so I was there for quite some time, and it's amazing how different the world is. And these companies are venture financed for a much longer period of time now, and the rounds are much larger. In fact, I think most of the money that was deployed that I discussed in the script was mega rounds, rounds exceeding $100 billion. So, we have some concern about it. Obviously, those companies are more vulnerable. And therefore, I think that's warranted. I have been through that in my career in the late \u201890s, where all these companies went public and without a product, and they didn't work out well. So, I think the current model of venture capital funding is much better and much more resilient. And a lot of these companies, the best ones will see it through. And the ones that don't succeed, I think the employees have plenty of opportunity out there at some of the other companies. That's what makes the Bay Area such a unique place from a technology employment standpoint. Yes, Rich, it's a good concept. People generally don't think they are landlord very much. We don't hear a great deal of appreciation. But having said that, I mean I think that tenants do appreciate it. Candidly, from my perspective, I worry that it's taking advantage of the system as opposed to we will offer a safety net, we are all for helping people out that it can go too far in trying to find that comfortable middle ground, I think is what they are trying to do. And I am very glad I am not managing that program, by the way. So, I think it's a good point. I think people do appreciate that part of California, and \u2013 but they are going to do what's best for them, which ultimately will come down to their job and their quality of life and those factors that we spend most of our time thinking about. Yes. No, it's a great question, great observation. And I think that the company is positioned sort of for the worst-case scenario, whatever might be in terms of the balance sheet and the overall structure. A world in which incomes are inflating and rents are inflating is a good world for us, I think. I mean I think that there will be opportunity. And even though our \u2013 probably, our interest costs would go up in that scenario, the vast majority of our debt is pretty well locked down in terms of maturities and rates. So, that would be a good world for us, and I think there is a reasonable chance that's where we are on. Yes, it's \u2013 I mean the comment I would make is that cap rates tend to be pretty sticky over time. So, they don't just change overnight just because interest rates move up or down. And I would say, back in those \u2013 the 2018 period you were referring to, we were maybe a little frustrated that cap rates weren't moving down somewhat given how much the tenure had rallied. But until the COVID period, they remain pretty sticky even though you had pretty significant reductions in interest rates over that period of time. I think that probably you are not going to see cap rates adjust upward quickly. There is too much money looking for a yield and yield investment and 3% versus some of the options is still 3% and is still in the scheme of things interesting to some investors. So, I wouldn't expect that to change it. Really is all about the flow of money and the number of investors that need yield and what the other yield alternatives are. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I appreciate your participation on the call, and we hope to see many of you in the not distant future at the Citi Conference. Thank you. Good day."

            "content": "Thanks, Angela. Today, I will discuss the key assumptions supporting our 2022 guidance and conclude with an update on the balance sheet. We ended 2021 with strong momentum in the fourth quarter as demonstrated by 4.7% same-property NOI growth and 7.6% core FFO growth. We believe the economic recovery has only just begun on the West Coast and thus, this positive momentum will continue throughout 2022. As such, we are forecasting core FFO per share growth of 9.7% at the midpoint, which is the highest growth in 6 years. We are pleased that our 2022 core FFO per share guidance is expected to exceed our pre-pandemic FFO achieved in 2019 despite the challenging operating environment. This is a testament to our disciplined operating strategy and capital allocation process, which is driving results to the bottom line. Our 2022 FFO growth is primarily driven by a 7.8% increase in our same-property revenues on a cash basis and 8.3% on a GAAP basis. For the year, we expect fewer concessions as compared to last year, but delinquency remains a challenge and we are expecting delinquency of 2.4% of scheduled rent in 2022, which is 30 basis points higher than 2021. We have two counties representing 50% of our total delinquency, where tenant protections remain in place. In addition, response times on tenant applications seeking emergency rental assistance remains slow and outside of our control, leading to large monthly swings in the delinquency line item. As a reminder, our historical annual delinquency has been around 35 basis points of scheduled rent. And given our long history of high collections, we believe we can ultimately return to this level once the various restrictions are lifted. We continue to assist residents in applying for federal tenant release funds and have received $29 million to-date, of which $12 million was in the fourth quarter. As for operating expenses, we are forecasting a 4% increase, which is above our historical average of 2% to 3%. This is the result of wage pressures in the market along with general inflation in the economy for materials. In total, same-property NOI is expected to grow 9.4% on a cash basis. Continuing with our investment expectations for 2022, as we have discussed throughout the past year, we have seen an elevated level of early redemptions of our preferred equity and subordinated loan investments due to high demand for West Coast apartments and low interest rates. In 2021, we had approximately $210 million of redemptions and our 2022 guidance contemplates another $350 million of redemptions. Some of this was pushed from the fourth quarter into this year. Over the past year, it has become more challenging to find new investments given the influx of capital to this segment. However, we were able to secure $117 million of new commitments, with an average yield of 11%, maintaining our disciplined approach to underwriting these projects. Our 2022 guidance contemplates an additional $100 million of new commitments at the midpoint, of which we assume $50 million will be funded during the second half of the year. The remainder of the preferred equity redemption proceeds will be used to fund new acquisitions. Finally, the balance sheet remains in a strong position. During the quarter, we saw continued improvement in our credit metrics and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio declined to 6.3x as EBITDA grew. We expect this trend to continue throughout 2022. Over the past 2 years, we have taken advantage of the low interest rate environment and refinanced nearly 40% of our debt, locking in low rates and reducing our weighted average interest rate by 70 basis points. As such, we have only 6% of our debt maturing over the next 2 years. In addition, we have minimal exposure to short-term rates, with only 4% of our consolidated debt subject to floating rates. As such, we have minimal risk to the rising interest rate environment. Given limited near-term maturities, no material development funding needs and ample liquidity, the company remains in a strong financial position. With that, I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions. Hi, Rich, it's Barb. In terms of the interest expense line, the biggest factor there is the reduction in cap interest as our development pipeline has substantially rolled off. And so that's a pretty substantial increase in the interest expense. We do have a couple of rate increases forecasted in the guidance, and we will \u2013 it's really why we have a range, but have a lot of variable rate debt. We only have 4% of our consolidated debt is variable rate. So that's a small impact to the numbers. It really is the cap interest side of the equation. I think that's a $4 million reduction. Yes, Rich. So in terms of our cumulative delinquency, we're at about $67 million. We have applied for reimbursement for 80% of that, so about $53 million. And of that amount, $33 million relates to our existing residents. However, the tenant \u2013 the timing and amount of being able to collect that is unknown because the program prioritizes based on the resident area meeting income, which is something that we're not fully privy to at the time they apply. The remainder is applications we apply for on behalf of past residents. Now our ability to collect on that is if the resident will engage, and that's unknown at this time, but we have applied for everything that we can. And as Mike said, the state of California has been slow to disburse funds, which is causing a lot of the noise in our numbers at this point. We actually are looking at these opportunities throughout the portfolio. So it's not skewed toward one region because we are seeing strong market rent growth in all of our portfolios in all of our regions. And as far as when they will be realized, less likely in 2022, just because, as you know, it takes time to renovate and then get them leased up until that time. By the time that occurs, you certainly wouldn't have a full year of revenue. So it's more likely going to impact 2023. Sure, Haendel. It's really more of a function of the year-over-year comparable. And so we expect the first half to be much stronger because first half of 2021, it was still quite soft. And of course, we started recovering in the second half of 2021. And so from a year-over-year perspective, this year, the second half will be harder comparable, and that's really what's driving the trends. Well, in terms of the spread, what we see is, in Seattle, would be the highest from a year-over-year on the second half because it has higher loss to lease and lower delinquency and better concession benefit. And Northern California and Southern California are pretty much very comparable. Southern California, because of the challenge by delinquency, while Northern California has that concessionary benefit and so they end up more similar, but in terms of spread, we are not talking \u2013 we are talking, say, 40 basis points versus not hundreds of basis points. So, they are all pretty not close. And Haendel, just one question, are you asking about market rent growth or same-store growth? I am just trying to understand? Okay. We didn't \u2013 let me take a quick look. So, on the renewals, we are sending out \u2013 hold on, 2022. Where is that, here. So, we are sending renewals out, portfolio average in the low teens, so around, say, 13%-ish. And with Seattle, the highest, followed by North Cal and in South Cal, around 10%-ish. Haendel, this is Barb. Like I mentioned earlier, we have applied for $52 million of our cumulative delinquency, $32 million of that is our existing tenants, and we feel good about that number. However, the timing is very uncertain. And what we do is, we forecast on a net basis. So, we have assumed that delinquency does increase this year because of the uncertainty related to the timing of payments on the \u2013 these applications as well as the California program, which the applications have exceeded the amount that's already been allocated to the State. So, there is a variety of things that led us to that assumption. So, in our guidance is a 2.4% delinquency as a percent of scheduled rent. That's what will drive our numbers. And one thing that we are seeing is our delinquency has gotten worse overall \u2013 our net delinquency has gotten more over the last couple of months as more of our tenants are applying for aid as the program has changed recently to allow tenant supply for three additional months. Therefore, applications are going up. So, there is a lot of moving parts on that front, but the net number is, we do expect delinquency to get slightly worse this year before it gets better."

            "name": "Angela Kleiman",
            "content": "Thanks Mike. First, I'd like to express my gratitude for the exceptional operations and support teams we have here at Essex. As the challenge to our business continue to evolve, our team has also continued to step up, which speaks to the dedication, work ethic and the can-do attitude across the organization. On to today's comments, I'll begin with key operational highlights of our major regions, then focus on our outlook for the year, followed by an update on the progress we are making by leveraging technology, data analytics and transforming our operating platform. We are pleased with our fourth quarter results of 4% year-over-year and 1.6% sequential growth in same-property revenues. We have detailed on S-16 of our supplement, which shows the fourth quarter year-over-year new and renewal rent spreads up by 17.1% and 10.7% respectively. The significant recovery in rents over the last year was bolstered by the occupancy and concession strategies we implemented throughout the pandemic. To review our markets by region, I will begin in Southern California, which represents almost 45% of our NOI and was our best performing region in 2021. Through many economic cycles, we have consistently relied on Southern California for steady performance. And during the pandemic, it had exceeded our expectations. The one caveat is the Los Angeles submarket. While it is also showing strong rent growth, this market faces offsetting challenges from the ongoing eviction moratorium and disproportionate bad debt. Notwithstanding these challenges, we remain optimistic with the broader Los Angeles submarket because of the continued strategic commercial investments by companies like Warner Bros, which is planning to develop a 1.3 million square feet of studio and office space in Burbank. This will be the largest studio development in the country and is expected to bring about 1,400 new jobs to the market. Film LA recently reported the production activity hit an all-time high in the fourth quarter and Apple recently proposed a 0.5 million square foot office development in Culver City, which should create approximately 2,500 new jobs. The continued job growth and high cost of homeownership amidst a slight increase in supply deliveries in Orange County and San Diego are factors considered in our expectation for demand for rental housing and the basis for our 2022 outlook for Southern California market rent growth of 7.1%. Moving north to the Bay Area and Northern California, it is no secret that Northern California's rents have lacked the nation and the Essex portfolio average. We view the region is in early stages of its recovery. Unlike most markets across the country, which are effectively back to normal economic levels, the Bay Area has yet to fully recover due to ongoing COVID regulations such as mask mandates and delayed return to office tempering the momentum of normal economic activities. We have seen communications by Bay Area companies informing employees of plans to return to office after Omicron case subsides and we remain encouraged by the large tech companies' expansion plans and commercial investments in our markets, as highlighted by Mike. Furthermore, our supply delivery forecast a decline in 2022. Thus, we anticipate rapid recovery in rent growth without requiring a comparable level of increased housing demand. Keep in mind, that our Northern California portfolio is mostly suburban and should benefit from those employees having fewer commuting days in a hybrid environment. These factors contribute to our expectation for Northern California to be one of our strongest rental markets in 2022, with market rent forecasted to increase by 8.7%. Turning to our Seattle portfolio, which continues to perform well, we anticipate a similar level of supply deliveries this year as last year with the majority concentrated in downtown Seattle. Because our portfolio skews to the east side in Bellevue and surrounding suburbs, the demand for our communities remain strong from the continued investments by several companies, most notably Amazon, which has committed to developing a second tower in Bellevue, with construction to start this year and is expected to create an additional 3,500 jobs. Therefore, we forecast Seattle's market rent growth at 7.2% for 2022. Moving on to the advancements in our operating model, by way of background, our disciplined focus of investing in high-quality submarkets has resulted in 70% of our properties being located within 5 miles of each other. With this competitive advantage in geographic concentration and innovation in technology and data analytics, we have re-envisioned Essex operating model with property collections. Essentially, we are transitioning from a dedicated team at an individual property to teams that will cover a collection of properties along with each associate to specialize in specific function and improving our ability to cross-sell among nearby properties. By organizing properties into collections and centralizing certain administrative duties, we expect to generate more efficiencies across the portfolio. We have already implemented this collections model in Orange County and San Diego and have achieved a reduction in personnel by approximately 10% to 15% through natural attrition. In addition, our data analytics has determined that our ability to cross-sell neighboring communities has increased by over 800 basis points following the adoption of the collections model. We plan to complete the rollout of the collections operating model to the remaining regions by the end of this year. While Essex has been efficient historically with each associate covering 40 units prior to 2019, with recent enhancements, we currently have each associate covering 43 units across the entire portfolio. Further benefits are expected in 2022 and thereafter as we complete our technology and other implementation plans. We are currently co-developing proprietary applications with partners from RET Ventures Fund and other software developers that will enhance the associate and customer experience. One example of advancements in our operating model over the past months has enabled 100% contactless tours, which currently consist of 92% self-guided tours and 8% virtual tours. As part of our technology initiative, we are starting the rollout of Alloy Access, a smart rent common area access solution, which will elevate the resident experience, while also further the productivity of our operations team by enhancing security, usability and monitoring, along with improving the effectiveness of the self-guided tours for prospective customers. In addition, we are working with Funnel to co-develop a tailored solution to further automate our platform, which we plan to rollout later this year. We believe this will directly benefit both the associates and customers through streamlined systems, on-demand features and link communications across properties, which will meaningfully accelerate the timetable to turn prospects into renters. We integrate these advancements with our data analytics platform to provide new operational insights. For example, leveraging newly available data on our leasing patterns from Funnel has improved the quality and effectiveness of our customer interactions. We have also applied advanced analytics with data from site plan to streamline our maintenance workflow, which reduced our unit churn times by 10% in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis despite COVID-related labor challenges. We expect that these initiatives will continue to provide us with additional levers and insights to improve our revenue growth and operating margins in the coming years. With that, I will turn the call over to Barb Pak. Sure, Rich. It's Angela here. So let me just give you a little context on the S-16 that shows our new lease it is terrific with 17%. But keep in mind, that's a year-over-year number to start. And we had communicated that between fourth quarter of 2020 to first quarter of 2021, so that comparable period, that's when market rent troughed. And so from a year-over-year perspective, we are really hitting kind of the greatest delta, if you will, from a differential perspective. So if we're talking about really the same-store guidance, what we probably \u2013 I think a better indicator is to look to the S-17 that Mike talked about earlier and you take that market rent of 7.7%, that market rent growth. And then you factor in the loss to lease at year-end. And I know we normally do \u2013 look to the September loss lease, but you might recall that we were \u2013 we had a typical seasonality and the seasonal peak was pushed. So we had caution against using the September loss lease. So if we look at the December loss lease, it's around 6%. And after and then some of these other factors such as legislation and delinquency, that's what ultimately drives our midpoint guidance of 7.8%. Maybe just a little historical context, Alex, with the Southern California portfolio and in particular, San Diego, Ventura and Orange County, these are markets that were at \u2013 that perform at a 97% occupancy even pre-COVID. So it's already a highly desirable place to be. And we combine that with this region having the most \u2013 the strongest loss to lease and it actually has, as far as we can see, pretty long legs. So in the interim, during the reversion that Mike is referring to, it may be more of a net neutral, but long-term, this market will still \u2013 we will see this market continue to perform well with a good tailwind from loss to lease. Sure, happy to. It's Angela here. The sequential revenue decline really was not a concern for us this time because it's really attributed to the timing of the lumpy delinquency recovery. And so what I mean by that is, in the third quarter, we have very favorable delinquency recovery. So, if you take San Diego, for example, if I back out delinquency, the sequential revenue growth would have been 1.6%. And so a similar relationship plays out for both Contra Costa and in San Francisco as well. Yes. I think the one example that we provided with the rollout and some of our other enhancements has already realized a saving of about 150 basis points in margin improvement and that represents about $15 million to the bottom line to NOI. And so my point in providing that context is that from a \u2013 if you look at the rollout, we are only a third way through and that was \u2013 that represents a rollout of really just two of our major regions. And so \u2013 which is why I provided indication of an additional 200 basis points to 300 basis points expectation of margin improvement just from the cost savings. And of course, with revenue, there is more to come on there, but that's several years down the road."

So we look slightly outside of our markets to where we think the fundamentals are still there. They \u2013 and so a couple of that we have done, we did one in Redland [ph], which is Inland Empire. That one is going well currently funded. And then we have one round trip in Sacramento. That market has obviously done very well. So we continue to track markets within our overall footprint, but a little outside, and we will consider a little further beyond that. Hi, Austin, this is Adam. I can start with that and then if Mike has any follow-ups. So we're seeing a different buyer pool for different vintages and different locations, but ultimately, what you said in your question is right. There is so much capital chasing these deals, whether it's coming from value-add funds or larger core funds or whomever that the compression between product age type, construction type and location has been significant and continues to remain today. As it relates \u2013 Mike, do you want to cover that? Just to tack on a little there. We see every deal that's marketed and every deal that's not marketed, and so it's always a relative game. And so we are underwriting consistently up and down the portfolio and jumping in where we see opportunity for that value add. Otherwise, we have seen deals in Bay Area closed at 3.1%, 3.2% cap, and that's not where we are going to compete. That's effectively right. And so John, it's not even going in. So that 3.1%, 3 2% cap that I quoted is economics. So, taking all units to market as of today. So, there is \u2013 it doesn't include any future growth, but that's still absorbing loss of lease, so, yes, very competitive. Hi Joshua. This is Adam. I can start off. As Mike noted previously, we have been somewhat rotating outside of the urban centers now here for a few years since \u2013 before the pandemic, and so we use our research team to assess. We look at all the top line metrics to see what areas within kind of our core footprint makes sense. And that's how to say, Sacramento, for instance, that deal was done pre-pandemic. And even at that point, the \u2013 between job growth and income and affordability, lack of affordability for single-family homes, it made sense on all of our metrics, which \u2013 that's what drives our investment decisions. So, we have a research team that reviews all those metrics amongst a number of both our more core markets as well as more secondary markets."

Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.  Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions, and beliefs, as well as information available to the Company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found on the Company's filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall. You may begin.\nMichael Schall: Good day, and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. Angela Kleiman and Barb Pak will follow me with comments, and Adam Berry is here for Q&A. I will provide an overview of our third quarter results, our initial operational outlook for 2022, apartment market conditions, and then conclude with the regulatory environment. Our third quarter results exceeded expectations, reflecting substantial improvement in West Coast economic conditions and housing demand. Net effective market rents are now 6.4% above pre-COVID levels and it's notable that we've exceeded pre-COVID market rents despite having recovered only about 63% of the jobs lost during the pandemic. As a result of improving market conditions, we reported quarterly core FFO of $3.12 per share, $0.08 per share above both our sequential results and guidance provided last quarter.  This is the first of likely many quarterly sequential improvements in core FFO. Southern California continues to deliver the strongest growth with net effective rents up 17.2% compared to pre-COVID while Northern California is still down 5.2%. Return to office delays at many tech companies and slower job growth compared to other West Coast areas were factors in the pace of recovery for Northern California. Overall, September job growth in the Essex markets was 5.2%, substantially above the U.S. average of 4%. Turning to our outlook for 2022, we published our initial market rent estimates on page S-17 of our supplemental package. We are expecting 7.7% net effective rent growth on average in 2022 with Northern California, the notable laggard in 2021, forecasted to lead the portfolio average in market rent growth next year.  A key assumption driving our outlook for 2022 is the return to a predominantly hybrid office environment occurring over the first half of the year, supporting our 2022 job growth outlook and our expectation that the West Coast markets will resume their long-term outperformance versus U.S. averages. Our confidence in the Bay Area recovery next year is partially driven by rental affordability following a year of solid income growth, lower effective rents, and exceptional growth in single-family home prices. Median for-sale home prices are up 17% in California and almost 16% in Seattle, making for-sale housing more costly relative to rental housing and often impeding the transition from renter to homeowner.  Finally, despite large increases in for-sale housing prices, our expectation for the production of for-sale housing in 2022 remains very muted at only 0.4% of the single-family housing stock. We previously noted that many large tech companies in our markets have delayed their office re-openings as a result of the Delta variant this fall, which we believe is the primary factor in the slow recovery of Northern California compared to other Essex markets. Nevertheless, recent tech Company announcements regarding office expansion, open positions in the Essex markets,  and new commitments to office space all support our belief that the leading employers remain fully committed to a hybrid office-centric environment on the West Coast. Page S-17.1 of our supplemental highlights recent investment by large tech companies which have continued throughout the pandemic and include Apple's 550,000 square foot recent expansion in Culver City, their new 490,000 square foot tech campus that will soon begin construction in North San Jose, and a recent acquisition of five office buildings with a total of 458,000 square feet in Cupertino. Google last quarter received needed approvals for its planned 80-acre campus near Downtown San Jose, and YouTube's 2.5 million square foot campus in San Bruno was just approved by the city last week.  We continue to track the large tech companies hiring in terms of open positions and job locations, giving us confidence that we continue to grow alongside the most dynamic sector of the U.S. economy. Our most recent survey of open positions indicates 38,000 job openings in the Essex markets for the 10 largest tech companies, up 9000 jobs or 26% as compared to the first quarter of 2020. Strong economic growth on the West Coast is further supported by venture capital investments which achieved new highs in Q3 '21 of $72 billion, of which 44% was directed to organizations in the Essex markets. Turning to our supply outlook for 2022, we are expecting 0.6% housing supply growth for the full year, including 0.9% growth for the multifamily stock which is manageable relative to our expectations for job growth of 4.1% in 2022.  Overall, our West Coast markets will remain well below the national rate of new housing supply growth and especially compared to the rapid accelerating pace of housing deliveries across many low-barrier markets next year. Longer term, residential building permits in Essex markets saw a modest 3.5% increase on a trailing 12-month basis, which is favorable compared to the U.S. where permits have increased 13.6% compared to one year ago. While our markets often temporarily underperform the national averages during recessions, we remain disciplined in our approach to capital allocation, including the cadence of housing supply deliveries with permitting data supporting our West Coast thesis.  Turning to the apartment transaction market, we continue to see strong demand from institutional capital to invest in the multi-family sector along the West Coast as evidenced by increasing transaction volume and cap rates in the mid-3% range. Apartment values across our markets are up approximately 15% on average compared to pre-COVID valuations. The Company has recently seen more development opportunities, and we were able to purchase two commercial properties in the third quarter. One located in South San Francisco that we expect to become a near-term apartment development opportunity, and another in Seattle that we will begin to entitle for apartments while earning an attractive 6% going in yield with a high-quality tenant. We also recently closed two apartment acquisitions as noted in the press release, and our acquisition pipeline is strong.  Barb, will discuss a new co-investment program in a moment, which is strategically important given our preference not to issue common stock at the current market price. Finally, the California statewide eviction moratorium ended September 30th. However, a few meaningful local jurisdictions have extended their separate eviction prohibitions. The net result is that a significant portion of our portfolio remains subject to eviction moratoria and other regulations that will slow the pace of scheduled rent growth in 2022. Fortunately, the federal tenant relief program has come to the aid of many of our residents, although the reimbursement process continues to be slow and require a significant coordination and support from the Essex team. I am grateful for this extensive team effort. With that, I'll turn the call over to Angela Kleiman.\nAngela Kleiman: Thanks, Mike. First, I'll start by expressing my appreciation for our operations team as we are in the midst of a strong recovery, our team has been busier and working harder than ever. I also want to thank the support departments, especially our delinquency collections team for their diligence to help our customers navigate the complex rent reimbursement legislations. On to today's comments, I'll provide an overview of our portfolio strategy relative to current market conditions, followed by some regional commentary and expectations for our markets. Our third quarter results reflect a combination of the operating strategy implemented early in the pandemic and a healthy recovery in net effective rents that began in the second quarter as California and Washington finally reopened from the pandemic shutdowns.  As you may recall, in the second quarter of 2020 when the pandemic-mandated shutdowns halted our economy, Essex quickly pivoted to a strategy that focused on maintaining high occupancy and coupon rents with the use of significant concessions. Now, over a year later, as our markets recover, we're starting to see the benefits of this strategy flow through our financial results. In the third quarter, same-property revenues grew by 2.7%, which is primarily attributable to a reduction in concessions compared to the previous period. By primarily utilizing concessions last year, we were able to limit the in-place rent decline to only 1.1% in the third quarter.  The benefit of this strategy is also coming through our sequential revenue growth, which increased 3.2% this quarter from the second quarter. With the market volatility we experienced over the past year, this is an extraordinary result and positions the Company well going forward. From a portfolio-wide perspective, market conditions remained strong compared to a year ago as demonstrated by the 12.6% blended net effective rent growth in the quarter. In addition, rents relative to pre-COVID levels have continued to improve, further enhanced by a delay to the typical seasonal slowdown in all our markets. Turning to some market-specific commentary from north to south, rents and jobs in the Seattle region have had a strong recovery with net effective rents up 8.3% compared to pre-COVID levels and year-over-year job growth of 5.5% in September.  New supply continues to be largely concentrated in the CBD, which is less impactful to Essex because 85% of our Seattle portfolio is located outside of CBD. Looking forward to 2022, as outlined in our S-17 of the supplemental, total housing supply deliveries for the region is expected to decline compared to 2021, and we anticipate job recovery to continue, led by Amazon, which recently announced plans to hire over 12,000 corporate and tech employees in Seattle. As such, we are forecasting market rent growth of 7.2% in 2022. Moving down to Northern California, which is our only region where net effective rents remain below pre-COVID levels.  Greater job loss and apartment supply deliveries caused net effective rents to fall further in Northern California since the onset of the pandemic. In addition, the job recovery in Northern California has been at a slower pace than our other regions, with only 4.4% year-over-year improvement compared to a 5.2% for the entire Essex portfolio as of September. We believe this is partly driven by the more onerous mandates delaying normal business activities. Apartment supply, particularly in San Mateo and Oakland CBD, are also presenting challenges for nearby properties, leading to financial concessions for stabilized properties of over a week in these markets in September.  On the other hand, we anticipate that Northern California will be our best performing region in 2022, with market rent growth forecast of 8.7% on our S-17. As Mike discussed, we expect hybrid office re-openings to continue, which will drive additional job growth and healthy demand for apartment units. With similar level of supply delivery expected in 2022 as this year, we are optimistic that Northern California is in its early stages of its recovery. Lastly, on Southern California, rent growth has continued to improve in the third quarter and net effective rents in September are 17.2% above pre-COVID levels. As we have mentioned in the past, Southern California is a tale of two markets, the urban areas in the Downtown L.A. versus the more suburban communities, which have generally outperformed.  In June, L.A. rents were still below pre-COVID levels, but as of September, they are now 6.8% above. While Orange County, San Diego, and Ventura have achieved rents between 17% to 30% above pre-COVID levels. Job growth in Southern California continues to progress well, up 5.9% in September as the region's economy continues to reopen and recover. With the exception of the Downtown L.A. area where concessions averaged one week in September, the rest of our Southern California markets has demonstrated solid fundamentals with no concessions recognized in September.  We expect Southern California strong rent growth to continue in 2022, led by Los Angeles, which has just begun to recover the jobs lost during the COVID recession. Apartment supply into region is forecasted to increase next year compared to this year and could present pockets of interim softness counterbalanced by a continued favorable job to supply ratio across the region. As you can see on our S-17 market rent growth for Southern California of 7.1%, we anticipate this region to perform at a comparable level as Seattle. With this backdrop of stable occupancy amidst a favorable supply demand relationship, our portfolio is well-positioned for the continued growth. I will now turn the call over to Barb Pak.\nBarbara Pak: Thanks, Angela. I'll start with a few comments on our third quarter results, discuss changes to our full year guidance, followed by an update on investments and the balance sheet. I'm pleased to report core FFO for the third quarter exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.08 per share. The favorable outcome was due to stronger operating results at both our consolidated and co-investment properties, higher commercial income and lower G&A expense. During the quarter, we saw an improvement in our delinquency rate, which declined to 1.4% of scheduled rent on a cash basis compared to 2.6% in the second quarter.  The decline is attributable to an increase in income from the federal tenant relief programs that were established to repay landlords for past due rents. Year-to-date through September, we have received $11.6 million from the various tenant relief programs, of which $9.5 million was received in the third quarter. Given the increased pace of reimbursements, we began to reduce our net accounts receivable balance in order to maintain our conservative approach to delinquencies and collections.  As a result of the strong third quarter results, we are raising the full year midpoint for same-property revenues by 20 basis points to minus 1.2%. It should be noted, this was the prior high end of our range. There are two factors I want to highlight as it relates to our fourth quarter guidance. First, as Angela discussed, we are seeing strong rent growth in our market. While there will be a small benefit to the fourth quarter, the vast majority of the benefit from higher rent growth won't be felt until 2022 when we have the opportunity to turn more leases. Second, our fourth quarter guidance assumes we continue to receive additional government reimbursements for past due rents and contemplates a continued reduction in our net accounts receivable balance.  Thus, we expect our reported delinquencies as a percent of scheduled rents to be above our cash delinquencies, which is consistent with the third quarter reported results. As it relates to full year core FFO, we are raising our midpoint by $0.11 per share to $12.44. This reflects the better-than-expected third quarter results and changes to our full year outlook. Year-to-date, we have raised core FFO by $0.28 or 2.3% at the midpoint. Turning to the investment markets, during the quarter, we raised a new institutional joint venture to fund acquisitions, as we believe this is the most attractive source of capital today to maximize shareholder value. The new venture will have approximately $660 million of buying power, a portion of which is expected to be invested by year-end.  As I discussed on our last call, we are seeing an elevated level of early redemptions of our preferred equity investments due to strong demand for West Coast apartments and inexpensive debt financing, which is leading to sales and recapitalizations. For the year, we expect redemptions to be around $290 million. Roughly 40% of these redemptions are expected to occur in the fourth quarter. Given the current environment, we could see continued elevated levels of early redemptions in 2022. In terms of new preferred equity and structured finance commitments, we are on track to achieve our 2021 objectives as outlined at the start of the year. Year-to-date, we have closed on approximately $110 million of new commitments. As a reminder, it typically takes 3-6 months post-closing to fund our commitments given they tend to be tied to development projects.  Moving to the balance sheet. As we expected, we are starting to see an improvement in our financial metrics, driven by a recovery in our operating results. In the third quarter, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio declined from 6.6 times last quarter to 6.4 times. We believe this ratio will continue to decline through growth in EBITDA over the next several quarters. With limited near-term debt maturities and ample liquidity, we remain in a strong financial position. That concludes my prepared remarks, and I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nic Joseph with Citi. Please proceed with your questions.\nNic Joseph: Thanks. As we look to 2022, how do you think about Essex's ability to capture that MSA market rent growth of 7.7% that you discussed? I know either from a regulatory standpoint or the lease roll perspective, just trying to tie the initial same-store expectations to the market rate data that you provided.\nMichael Schall: Hey, Nic. It's Mike, and Angela might follow me with comments. I think we're feeling very good about conditions around us. Again, we have high occupancy throughout and a very strong loss to lease, and that's been noted before. Everything looks like our markets are recovering. We expect to outperform the U.S. with respect to job growth, certainly going forward, and we view the catalyst of the return to office in Northern California as being the last piece that's probably the relative underperformance that we've had thus far relative to the peer group. We see that as still being a very strong part of our portfolio.  Historically, Northern California produces the highest CAGR of rent growth over long periods of time, and we expect that dominance to show itself and a lot of the reasons why we're embedded in the various comments that you heard from all of us, so hopefully, that all made sense. The number of open positions for tech companies, the big investments that the tech companies continue to make within the Northern California markets, etc., I think it bodes well, so we really feel great throughout our footprint. But the key piece going forward, I think, is Northern California, we feel very good about that, too.\nNic Joseph: Thanks. Maybe following up on that, the return on the office or hybrid. How do you think that impacts seasonality over the next few months as employees maybe move back into Northern California specifically?\nMichael Schall: I think that given that we carry high occupancy into this period of time, any incremental growth in jobs should have a very positive impact on market rents. So, again, our expectation is, I would say, Northern California was probably shut down to a greater level than most other markets, maybe L.A. would be number two, but it has had the most muted recovery, yet, it has, I would say, the strongest and most dynamic job base. So again, we're looking forward to that. We're hoping it would happen earlier.  But again, I think the Delta variant has postponed that. But again, we feel strong. We think all the things, all the conditions that we would expect to see from number of open positions for these companies, major commitments to campuses and lease commitments for office space, etc., all seem to be focused on a return-to-office program, probably in a hybrid sense for these companies. So I think that's before us in the not distant future.\nNic Joseph: Thank you.\nMichael Schall: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please proceed with your questions.\nHaendel St. Juste: Hey. Thanks for taking my question. So first question, I guess, is on the topic [Indiscernible] inflation and all the ways that it's impacting the business. How are you thinking about that impact in regards to payroll, R&M, utilities? What levers can you pull to offset some of those costs into next year? Then maybe some broader comments on your technology platform, where you are in terms of the rollout of that and how that could be a help here as well? Thanks.\nMichael Schall: Okay. Haendel, thanks for the question. It's a good one. I'll let Angela handle the technology piece of it. Help me. What was your first part of your question? I'm sorry.\nAngela Kleiman: Inflation.\nMichael Schall: Inflation, yes. Yes. So I mean, we've studied the inflation thing, the historical precedent going back a long time actually into the early 80s and no doubt, we are feeling quite a bit of pressure on the cost side. Certainly finding positions, especially on-site positions is challenging and compensation is going up, for sure. The one piece that's good in California, obviously, is property taxes because Prop. 13 limits that increase. I go back to rents. Rents are obviously the big thing. We're a high gross margin type of Company, and therefore, the rent growth really matters in this equation.  I think in an inflationary world, rents do very well. So I would expect that our rent growth would more than compensate for whatever cost increases that we have. I'm not saying, I want this to happen, but I think if we were in a more stronger inflationary period, I think it would be a net positive in terms of the financial performance of the Company. Obviously, if inflation goes up, all asset values decline in value. So maybe that would be one sticking point as well because probably cap rates change and some other things happen as well. Angela, do you want to comment on?\nAngela Kleiman: Sure. But I think Barb wants.\nBarbara Pak: Yes, I just want to follow up on that one point. Haendel, the other thing that we've done over the last several years is take advantage of the low interest rate environment and lock in our interest rates for long periods of time. We have very little debt maturing next year and the following year, so we're not susceptible to rising rates from that perspective. We've locked in our interest expense effectively, and we have very limited variable rate exposure as well. So we feel good about where the balance sheets stands from an inflationary perspective.\nAngela Kleiman: Great. On the technology front, Haendel, what we have been doing is to really focus on ramping up the contactless interactions which also allows for efficiency and then allows more flexibility for our site team. So we are going to continue that path and further refine and enhance those technology, and what that means is that it will allow our staff to probably specialize more and hopefully continue to be more efficient, and that will help. I don't think it will be, say, an immediate relief as far as the payroll expenses that you're looking for, but over time, it should benefit the business platform.\nHaendel St. Juste: So without putting words in your mouth, it sounds like the near-term outlook for inflation, does it necessarily spook you? Perhaps there's a little bit of pressure building in the business, but maybe not to the degree to perhaps put a mid-single-digit type of expense growth outlook for next year.\nMichael Schall: Well, we're not guiding yet for next year.\nBarbara Pak: Still working through the budget.\nMichael Schall: Barb drilled that into a prior to the call. Please don't give out any guidance for next year. So we're still working on this. Yes, I guess the point I would make is in high gross margin businesses, even if you get some expense pressure, the top line is so much more important. So I think in my view, we always look at rents. What's the relationship between rents and incomes? So in an inflationary environment, if incomes are going up, we're probably able to pass through most of that in the form of rent. If that happens, we will do very well on that scenario.\nHaendel St. Juste: Got it. Got it. Fair enough. The second question, if I could ask about the two office acquisitions here in the quarter. Maybe some comments around the math, the thought process. Should we think of these as opportunistic in more one-offs or perhaps more reflective of the low cap rates in your markets which could be making more conventional acquisitions more difficult? If that's the case, thoughts on calling some of the portfolio a bit or maybe taking advantage of some of the pricing? Thanks.\nAdam Berry: Hi, Haendel. This is Adam. So I'll touch on both of the two office acquisitions that Mike touched on in the opening remarks. They're both separate, which is why I'll cover them separately. The first one which is in South San Francisco, we've had that tied up for over 3 years, and so during that time, we work with the city to determine what zoning we could get. During that time, we're basically able to increase the density by over a 100 units. So when you take that, coupled with the cap rate compression that we've seen in the market, the deal made more sense than really, any development deal that we've penciled in the last couple of years.  So there is in-place income on the existing use, it's in the, call it, high three cap rate range, which is fine. That will get us through to entitlements which we would expect in nine months to a year or so. The other one, somewhat of an outlier. It's a single-tenant office deal in Seattle, really good location. There's still another nine years on the lease, and we have a partial guarantee for that for that term. So it's north of a six cap on current income. It does pencil on today's multifamily underwriting, and it is actually zoned for multifamily, but we'll revisit that in 5, 6, 7 years from now to see what makes the most sense. But for now, that's a very solid covered land play from our perspectives.\nHaendel St. Juste: Great. I appreciate the color. Thank you.\nAdam Berry: Sure.\nMichael Schall: Thanks, Haendel.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.\nJohn Kim: Hi, this [Indiscernible] for John Kim. Thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering a little bit about the regulatory risks in your market. I know you've touched on that here and there, but are these increased risks being priced into valuation? Some of your other peers were citing that as a recent reduced exposure in California, and I was just wondering how you guys are thinking about that?\nMichael Schall: Well, I'll start and I'll let Adam chime in here. Well, we've obviously dealt with regulatory issues over many, many years really, for the 35-years I've been here. Historically, the bigger the loss to lease gets because of rent roll, let's say, the more buyers and sellers will start pricing in a portion of it or want to higher cap rate given the delayed impact of rents. But generally speaking, all apartments are valued based on market rents today.  Then again, the loss to lease is a determination based on facts and circumstances. So with California rent control law, the statewide law, at CPI plus 5% max of 10% annual increase, I don't think that, that in and of itself will cause a significant valuation differential, and I think that's the key part that if you're moving your rents by CPI plus 5%, let's call that 8% or something like that, most buyers will think that that is plenty of compensation for the transaction. I don't think cap rates move all that much because of that. Adam, do you want to comment on that?\nAdam Berry: Just one additional comment. The most onerous rent controls within California, San Francisco, or Santa Monica, or Berkeley, there's just very little that trades there. So that's where you see that the larger loss to lease, the bigger gap between in-place and economic, and that's where pricing would fluctuate more. But as far as AB 1482 goes, the California statewide one, it doesn't really factor in to really anyone's models from what I can tell.\nJohn Kim: Okay. Thank you. Thanks for the color. Going back to the inflation piece too, how is that affecting your planned developments? I know you briefly talked about the other commercial acquisitions and how relative to multifamily, those are still good trades. But moving forward in the development pipeline, is that something that you are really thinking about?\nAdam Berry: It's something we consider in all of our strategic decisions. We're not focused on the office market. I want to be very clear that the two opportunities that we had are like fairly one-offs. But we look at all of those factors in determining where and what to invest in.\nMichael Schall: I think we estimated about 9% between today and when we would start construction, for example, on the South San Francisco deal that Adam talked about earlier. Could that be high? We don't know. But we build in an estimated cost escalation. But what really drives all these deals, if cap rates go from 4.25-ish down to 3.5 or so. The built-in value of those transactions, other development transaction until, of course, land sellers adjust their price. It makes a ton of sense and gives a lot more value created in that process. Adam, do you?\nAdam Berry: Yeah. So just one final follow-up there. We're always looking at the spread between where stabilized acquisitions or stabilized assets are trading versus our development yield. Whether deal is entitled or unentitled, we're going to look for a different spread between what in-place cap rates are, and so that escalation that Mike referred to, we assume on everything whether it's 3 months out, 6 months out, or 2 years out. Then that factors into the denominator. So with this cap rate compression, we've seen, especially on these two deals, and there are a couple of others potentially in the pipeline where that spread has increased, and those are the deals that we are pursuing aggressively.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.\nRich Hill : Hey, guys, just a quick question. Could you maybe provide us some details on your loss to lease across the various different markets so that we can compare them to the rental rates you disclosed for your macro forecasts?\nAngela Kleiman: Sure, happy to. It's Angela here. At September, the portfolio loss to lease was 9.8%, and it's a widespread, it's from Northern California into force to Southern California in the low single digits, around 13%. We understand that typically, analysts look to this loss of lease to model next year. So I want to just make sure that I provide a little more context on that because we want to consider a couple of factors.  First, this year was an unprecedented year because we started out the year with a huge negative rent growth and has turned positive. It's a very steep curve. This trajectory is not likely to repeat next year. Because of that, and the delay in the seasonal peak, it has created a small drag on revenue for next year. Secondly, some markets, those over 10%, which, broadly speaking, will be our Orange County, San Diego, and Ventura counties. They're above the 10% rent control cap. So that will be a factor as well.\nRich Hill : Got it. Angela, that was actually exactly what I was looking for. Just maybe one other question. When we think about the leasing spreads versus list rates, is there a lead lag there? Some of the data we look at is that listing rates seem to be a lot higher than the sign leasing spread. So I'm just wondering if the listing rate is the leading indicator on how you think about that?\nAngela Kleiman: I'm not sure if I am following your question.\nRich Hill : Yes. So what I am suggesting.\nAngela Kleiman: Are you talking about asking versus achieved? Is that what you mean?\nRich Hill : Yes. I'm suggesting, are you're asking in October, November, December higher than where you've been signed?\nAngela Kleiman: Yes, I see what you mean. Normally, let's put it this way for now. It has been higher, but that's pretty typical. What we try to do is forecast what the rent level is going to be one or two months out, whenever we sent a renewal. So what that means is sometimes it's higher, sometimes it's lower. So if we think that we're sending out renewals now for, say, December, January, it's not likely to be a whole lot higher. But back in, if we're sending renewals out in March for renewals in May or June, it tends to be higher. So it really depends on the timing and the market conditions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your questions.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Yes. Thanks, everybody. I was curious, just going back to the market rent growth forecast, if you could just give some additional detail of how you thought about baseline scenario that maybe doesn't include some type of hybrid back to office and how you went about determining what that additional growth would be layered on top with that back-to-office scenario playing out? We know you guys tend to take a conservative approach, so just trying to understand the baseline versus what would the upside look like.\nMichael Schall: Yes. It's a great question. Yeah, I'm not sure we approach it that way. I mean, our research group, Paul Morgan, they use a variety of data sets and they're not looking at any one thing, not creating some base case scenario. The simple part of it is looking at what we expect job growth to do and how many units of demand are represented by the job growth, and then how much supply do we have? So fortunately, again, we're 96% occupied in all these markets. So it is like we have a hole to fill before the demand over supply situation takes hold.  We're already there. But included in some of the things he looks at, which is, I think some pretty interesting data. For example, Seattle has recovered 79% of the jobs that they lost in the pandemic and he is expecting them to be at a 110% by the end of the fourth quarter. So they will actually be above their pre-COVID employment level. Whereas almost all the other markets are still below pre-COVID level by the end of 2022. So it's not that simple. He considers affordability, which affordability is a key part of what we do, and we look at things now because there's been such incredible growth in rents in Southern California, they screen, and the way we do affordability is on a market basis, not a property-by-property basis, because we're trying to look at the overall dynamic in the marketplace.  Southern California, because it has such great rent growth, is screening a little bit expensive, and Northern California, which has the highest incomes and rents that are pretty moderate given what's happened here. That's what leads to the better growth rate for Northern California next year. Just by way of background, I'll give you a quick comparison. So rents in Seattle and Los Angeles, the median rent, the market rent, not Essex portfolio is about $1,816 in both cases.  But in Seattle, the median household income is $102,000 and in LA, it's about $88,000. Paul would look at that relationship and say, that's a positive for Seattle. It has about the same rents, has a lot more room to run with respect to income, and that would factor into the equation in terms of what we expect market rents to do. That makes sense?\nAustin Wurschmidt: Yes. No, that's very helpful color. So in that scenario, if demand were to exceed just from a job growth perspective, you talked about kind of the jobs versus supply piece. So if back to office does drive incremental demand above and beyond that. Is it conceivable to think that you could benefit from a pricing cars perspective, but also see some upside to occupancy as well?\nMichael Schall: Well, occupancy is a little bit different element, and that really has to do with how aggressively we're pushing rents, and so occupancy, some have noted has actually declined a little bit, but that's really because we're pushing rents. When you push rents, you hold out a little bit longer and you are willing to accept a little bit lower occupancy level. But going back to our basic thesis, if we have 530,000 jobs created next year and the typical relationship between a household and a job is 2:1.  So we have somewhere around 265,000 units of demand for apartments, and we produce a total supply of 64,000 homes. We should do pretty darn well on that scenario. Again, affordability becomes the key issue, and affordability is different by market. We screen, relatively inexpensive in Northern California and relatively expensive than Southern California. But just looking at basic supply demand, we should be in great shape next year. We don't know exactly what's going to happen. We think 7.7% is a big number, but we'll wait and see.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Rich Hightower with Evercore. Please proceed with your questions.\nRich Hightower: Hi everybody. Thanks for taking my question here. I guess outside of restrictions within the confines of AB 1482 in California, are you guys self-limiting any markets or submarkets with respect to renewal rents, just kind of in that corporate spirit and being a good guy vis-a-vis your tenants that you guys have employed in the past, thereby sort of exacerbating that growth in the loss to lease as things go forward?\nAngela Kleiman: That's a good question, and this goes toward the social responsibilities part of our corporate governance, right? We have a self-imposed cap of 10% for many, many years, and really, the approach behind that is to avoid being viewed as anti-gouging, and that strategy has worked well for us for many, many years, and it really has not materially negatively impacted the returns of our shareholders.\nRich Hightower: Okay, and Angela, which markets are you employing that strategy at this moment, if you don't mind?\nAngela Kleiman: Well, it's broadly across the portfolio, and so it's wherever we have that hitting the loss of lease of up 10%, and so it happens to coincide with 1482. So it's Orange County, San Diego, and Ventura, because they're all above 10% loss of lease.\nRich Hightower: Then Seattle, perhaps?\nAngela Kleiman: Yes, Seattle as well.\nRich Hightower: Okay. All right. Great. Thank you.\nMichael Schall: Not 1482, but yeah.\nRich Hightower: Right. I mean, separate from 1482. That's what I meant. Yes. That's correct. yes. Thank you.\nMichael Schall: Thanks, Rich.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.\nBrad Heffern: Hey everyone. I was just curious in the Bay Area if you've seen any change on the move-in stats, if maybe more people are coming in from outside the metro versus what you've seen more recently?\nMichael Schall: It's a good question, and the granularity of that data is difficult to follow, and so it's hard to say exactly what's happening recently. We do have job growth, and the job growth is exceeding the national average. So from that statistic alone, we feel like there were some positive movement back to the Bay Area and clearly occupancy, etc., has confirmed that. But we don't think that the major shift has happened. We expect it to pick up here in the next couple of months as we approach year-end and hopefully accelerate into 2022, and that's the premise. But again, I'd say we need more job growth than what we have currently to achieve the 2022 forecast that is on S-17. But we'll do fine either way.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. Got it, and then on delinquency, can you walk through what the underlying trend has been? I know there's noise obviously related to the rental relief payments, but has the underlying level come down? How do you see that sort of playing out?\nBarbara Pak: Hi, Brad. This is Barb. So you can see we report our delinquencies. For the quarter, we were at 1.4% on a cash basis, and keep in mind, we did report in July last quarter and that was at 2.2%. So that implies August, September had come down. That was around 1% on a cash basis, and then October is about 1%, and that's really being driven by the reimbursements. As I mentioned during the call, we got 9.5 million in the third quarter. Most of that hit in August and September, and in October, we've seen a commensurate amount, so that's where we've been at. We've been stable, I would think, the last three month. It's been pretty stable in terms of our net delinquencies.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Neil Malkin with Capital One Securities. Please proceed with your questions.\nNeil Malkin: Hey, thank you. Still morning out there for you. Just on that last question, when you say the delinquencies is 1%, that is net of the amount that you collected from the delinquency reimbursements from California and other jurisdictions. Is that correct?\nBarbara Pak: Correct. Correct.\nNeil Malkin: So without that, it would still be in that like two plus range? Is that around where it would be?\nBarbara Pak: Yes. Exactly. It would be higher without those reimbursements. The reimbursements is what is driving that number lower, correct.\nNeil Malkin: Yes, sure. Yeah. I was trying to understand what's baked in, and if anything has changed and how you recognize bad debt and how that looks, I get you. Okay. Thank you for that. Okay, and just in terms of the people moving into San Francisco, I guess, we'll focus on that one. You mentioned that, in general, your portfolio is seeing people come back, and I wonder, just given the in San Francisco that rents are still down from pre-COVID levels, are the demographics changing a little bit from the people who are moving in? Are they the same in terms of income, jobs, or are more people who are coming in, moving in from the outskirts, looking for a deal of some kind that would potentially impact your ability to retain those once market rents come back?\nAngela Kleiman: This is Angela here. That's a good question. We have not seen any meaningful change in the demographic profile, and I think this question was also posed early on when rents declined or when we were giving out significant concessions. I think at the end of the day, it's all about jobs, and so while it's slightly more affordable, we just don't see people randomly moving into the city and then not being able to stay. Does that makes sense?\nNeil Malkin: Yeah, yeah. I appreciate that. Just the other one follow-up, maybe just talk about development and sort of mezz outlook. You kind of touched on this earlier, but given everyone understands there's a lot of inflation with input costs, supply chain disruptions, hard to get labor, etc. But you made the comment that you're seeing increase in developments and a commensurate increase then in mezz opportunities. Can you maybe elucidate that a little bit? You think that it would be a tougher environment, but can you talk about what's driving that, and then what kind of opportunities you're evaluating right now and potentially the size?\nMichael Schall: Actually, maybe, I think there are several parts to that, and I think we may need to clarify the question a bit here. But overall, we think 2022 will have roughly 4% more supply than 2021, and part of that is because there was the delivery delays caused by COVID, and eventually, they will catch up into 2022, but not enough to be really meaningful in the scheme of things, especially, again, when you go through the job numbers that we have and the implied demand from 530,000 new jobs across our footprint. Notably, on the supply side, Seattle is the one market that's down pretty substantially about 12%. So that's another gold star, let's say, for the Seattle market there. Barb, do you want to [Indiscernible] Yes.\nAdam Berry: Neil, as far as on the street opportunities that we're seeing to kind of echo your point with costs having risen. Now that being said, costs are well down from where we were at the lumber peak in mid-summer. But taking all that into account, we're seeing a steady flow of deals, but fewer deals, it seems that are penciling and that's both on the mezz and pref side as well as on the direct development side. The one point I made earlier with cap rates compressing on existing products, they're also diminishing some on the development yields. There are competing factors as to how deals are being made today, but like I started with, there is a flow of deals happening. But again, those that are actually penciling are, I would say, fewer and further between.\nAngela Kleiman: Then Neil, I just want to make sure that in my prepared comments, I did say that we had $290 million of preferred redemption this year, and given the current environment, if it is to continue low interest rates and high valuations for West Coast assets, we could expect early redemptions of a comparable amount in 2022, I would imagine. We could still face headwinds there, just given this environment. We're seeing a lot of developers able to take us out early for a variety of reasons. I wanted to make sure that you heard that as well.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street. Please proceed with your questions.\nJohn Pawlowski : Thanks. Maybe a question for Adam. I think in the prepared remarks, Mike referred to apartment values being up 15% versus pre-COVID levels. Curious in the hardest hit markets to the Bay Area where you think current values are relative to pre-COVID levels.\nAdam Berry: Yes. Thanks, John. As Mike pointed out in the opening remarks, that's an average. As it relates specifically to the Bay Area, there's been very little to trade, very little of substance. I think that number in the Bay Area is going to be anywhere between 5% and maybe upwards of 20%. But again, there's been really just two Class A deals that have traded and then some B and C deals that have traded. So we're talking about very limited data set.\nJohn Pawlowski : Sorry. To clarify, 5% to 20% down or up?\nAdam Berry: Up.\nJohn Pawlowski : Up. Okay.\nMichael Schall: [Indiscernible]\nAdam Berry: Yeah, John. I'm just kidding.\nJohn Pawlowski : [Indiscernible] Yes. Okay. One final question from me and then I'll jump out. I'd like to just drill down on San Mateo. Obviously, job growth improving, migrations up. But sequentially, each and every quarter, revenues keep declining in San Mateo. Can you just tell me what's going on in terms of the rental behavior, the durability of demand gains over the last few quarters, and when does it turn the corner?\nAngela Kleiman: Yes, that's an interesting question in that the data set itself, I want to just give a little context because I think that matters. Our San Mateo market only actually has four properties in the same store, and so because of that, you are going to see a lot more volatility, and in addition, there has been good job growth and it's a good market for us. There has been lease up competition in the area. We're talking about an interim period where you have competition from lease up, well their job growth is still at a slower pace relative to our other markets, and then you add that with a small data set. It's going to just be a lot more volatile. It's not that there's anything fundamentally that we're concerned about with this market.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions comes from the line of Amanda Sweitzer with Baird. Please proceed with your questions.\nAmanda Sweitzer: Thanks. Apologies if I missed this, but on your co-investment platform, has the interest from institutional capital to partner with you changed the economics of those deals at all? Or is the increase attractiveness that you talked about really been driven by lower debt cost in the market today and the higher LTVs that you can use in those agreements?\nBarbara Pak: Hi, Amanda. Thank you for it. We've used the co-investment platform for many, many years, and we like it because it is an alternative source of capital win. We don't like our equity, our stock price, and so we've used it from time-to-time. We do think it's a good source of capital for us, and in terms of economics, we were able to reduce the hurdle rates and improve the economics for Essex. Cap rates have come down over the past year, 75 to a 100 basis points, and we're able to change terms accordingly. So the economics of the joint venture didn't change materially from what we've done in the past, but we will continue to use this source of capital going forward depending on market conditions.\nAmanda Sweitzer: That's helpful. That's it for me.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nChandni Luthra : I think it's officially noon on the West Coast, so I will say, good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with your redevelopment program. If you could perhaps give some color. I believe you started that last quarter where you're at and how are you thinking about it in 2022.\nAngela Kleiman: Sure, happy to. It's Angela here. We started ramping up and I mentioned that last quarter, and we're going to continue to do so, especially in light of the recovery and the strength of the recovery, and of course, our expectations for market rent growth next year, and our goal at this point is really to double the number of renovations for next year compared to this year, and then ultimately, get back to pre-COVID levels because it does take a little more time to ramp up these activities, and as market conditions improve, we also make sure that we underwrite the improvements, and ensure we don't have capital destruction, and make sure that we're meeting the market, and optimizing our returns, and so it's not a turn the switch on, we just want to be diligent about it.\nChandni Luthra : Then Angela as you follow-up to that, how's ROI looking at on those redevelopments? Is that consistent with pre-COVID levels? Is there a big range to think about there? Just trying to understand that if you could throw some color on that as well, please.\nAngela Kleiman: Sure. I'm happy to. We target our ROI at pre-COVID levels. But keep in mind it's driven by market rents, and so what that means is that ROI, the way we approach it is that we wouldn't proceed with a reinvestment opportunity if we're not achieving our target ROI. Therefore, if you're concerned that there has been any compression or deterioration there, there has not been.\nChandni Luthra : Got you, and then my sort of second question would be, one of your peers talked about earlier today about some impact on leasing velocity from Amazon's policy shift on return to office. Just wanted to check with you what are you guys seeing from your standpoint? Thank you.\nAngela Kleiman: Let me make sure I understand your question. Are you asking about our leasing velocity whether it has changed because of Amazon?\nChandni Luthra : I mean, Amazon's policy shifts on return to office, the announcement a couple of age ago.\nAngela Kleiman: Oh, the policy. Yes. I see what you mean. So we have not seen the impact from the Amazon shift. Because keep in mind, while, yes, they have the corporate mandate, but they also have a lot of workers throughout the region. Of course, all the businesses that support Amazon. But practically speaking, we have not seen an impact on our turnover, we have not seen an impact in our occupancy and certainly not an impact on our ability to raise rents.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Daniel Santos with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your questions.\nDaniel Santos: Hey, good afternoon, and thank you for taking my questions. So my first one is on your stock price. You didn't issue equity in the third quarter yet on our estimate, and based on the Street's estimate of NAV, you're trading at a premium. Instead of issuing equities, are going to disposition and JV route. So I just was wondering if you could give more commentary on your views on your stock price and maybe using more equity going forward.\nBarbara Pak: Yes, that's a good question. We always remain very disciplined as it relates to what source of capital we use. So we look at a variety of different sources; one being the equity, one joint venture equity, and one disposition, and keep in mind, with values up 15% from pre-COVID levels that puts our NAV where we think the value of the Company is, is up quite a bit from where we were at the start of the pandemic, and so that's a factor that we look at when whether we want to issue equity today or not.  The other factor to keep in mind is we have a lot of money coming back from preferred equity redemptions. We're using that to fund the new investments we're making along with using the joint venture platform. We really do you think it creates a lot more value for our shareholders given the fees and the potential to promote hurdle and given where our stock price is trading. We don't believe we're at a material premium to NAV at this point.\nDaniel Santos: Okay. That's helpful, and then lastly, how much more are you expecting benefit from SmartRent? What's your timing on that?\nBarbara Pak: Yes, and that's a great question. The value of our SmartRent investment is about $75 million today, and our third quarter financials, there's a lag effect there because the shares are still held within RTV until we come out of lock out, and their financials are one quarter in arrears for us, and so we would expect a fairly substantial gain in the fourth quarter. It could be up to $40 million, and then we would also have to recognize an unrealized deferred tax provision as well. That could be up to $12 million. Both of those numbers are not reflected in our full year guidance for total FFO. Just given the uncertainty, there's a lot of other moving parts within RTV that we don't try to predict that gain or loss. But those are the numbers related to SmartRent in and of itself.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions comes from the line of Alex Kalmus with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your questions.\nAlex Kalmus: All right. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to touch on SB 9 and 10, and what you expect the long-term impact to be on California housing supply there / what you're seeing on the ground if anything yet?\nMichael Schall: Yeah. This is Mike, and good question. We are still waiting and guessing as to what might happen with SB 9 and 10, and of the two, the one that's more impactful is SB 9 because that would effectively have the state override local zoning laws as it relates to the development of ADU units, and so potentially allowing more ADU units to be built in the suburbs. So I want to note that there previously was a ADU law that was passed earlier this year, and this whole situation has been quite politically active with respect to the YIMBYs, the \"Yes, In My Back Yard\", versus the NIMBYs, the \"No, In My Back Yard\" groups, and that's going to be an ongoing battle.  So I think personally, given that there was an ADU law that was out there before and it had relatively little impact, that's going to continue to be the case. There was a L.A. Times article that was recently written and it estimate, I don't know where this estimate came from, but I'll just mention it for the sake of transparency. It mentioned that estimated 1.5% of single-family homes are likely to use SB 9. I suspect that will be high. But the backdrop of this is that Governor Newsom and various other sources have indicated that the state is short millions of homes, and the likelihood that SB 9 and SB 10 will change that, I think, is very unlikely.\nAlex Kalmus: Right. Thank you very much there, and I just wanted to touch on the trajectory of potential renewals going forward given the CPI regulation. Would you consider pushing on that lever in future rent negotiations to make sure that over the span of a few years, you're able to get some market quicker? Or do you see that being just playing out similarly how it has in the past in terms of the difference between renewals and new move-ins spreads?\nAngela Kleiman: Well, the CPI plus 5%, it's that, but it's cap to 10%. So it's not a metric that we have flexibility to push at our discretion, and we've been operating in this market even before AB 1482. We have assets that had rent control. Over a long period of time, it had comparable growth rates and we've operated well under these circumstances. So we don't think this is going to fundamentally change our ability to achieve our return targets.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Hey, guys, thanks for the question. I was just kind of curious how you're thinking about pushing rate in the fall winter. It looks like some of your markets you saw a little bit of an occupancy dip, and maybe it's a different strategy across markets, would be great to discuss that as well.\nAngela Kleiman: Yeah, happy to. So this is an unusual year in that normally, we peak around July, and so starting, end of July, we start to have a deceleration for six months. This is an unusual year in that we had this huge ramp-up. We went from a big negative, I think, like negative 10% of market rent growth in Q1, and we peaked around, it depends on which markets, but Seattle and Northern California peaked around August, and Southern California is just peaking now, as we speak. So it's very different from that perspective, having said that, that natural seasonality does play itself out, and so the question is really a magnitude issue.  What we're going to continue to do is focus on at this point, wherever we can push rents, but more likely as we head into November, December, now focusing on occupancy, and I think some people noted that in the third quarter, we allow occupancy to fall a bit, but I want to emphasize that was because of the strength of the market, and now we're going to preserve those rents and focus on occupancy if we see that deceleration continue to continue.\nJoshua Dennerlein: That's great, and maybe just a follow-up on that comment that SoCal is just peaking now. Is that late October peak? Has it been a leveling off or starting to see a little bit of pullback? Just curious where it is.\nAngela Kleiman: It's between mid-October and now. So, say, in the past week.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. Okay, great. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Michael Schall for any closing remarks.\nMichael Schall: Thank you, Operator, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. We look forward to seeing many of you, virtually speaking, at the upcoming NAREIT. Until then, stay well, and again, thank you for joining the call.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this point. Have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Schall",
            "content": "Good day, and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. Angela Kleiman and Barb Pak will follow me with comments, and Adam Berry is here for Q&A. I will provide an overview of our third quarter results, our initial operational outlook for 2022, apartment market conditions, and then conclude with the regulatory environment. Our third quarter results exceeded expectations, reflecting substantial improvement in West Coast economic conditions and housing demand. Net effective market rents are now 6.4% above pre-COVID levels and it's notable that we've exceeded pre-COVID market rents despite having recovered only about 63% of the jobs lost during the pandemic. As a result of improving market conditions, we reported quarterly core FFO of $3.12 per share, $0.08 per share above both our sequential results and guidance provided last quarter.  This is the first of likely many quarterly sequential improvements in core FFO. Southern California continues to deliver the strongest growth with net effective rents up 17.2% compared to pre-COVID while Northern California is still down 5.2%. Return to office delays at many tech companies and slower job growth compared to other West Coast areas were factors in the pace of recovery for Northern California. Overall, September job growth in the Essex markets was 5.2%, substantially above the U.S. average of 4%. Turning to our outlook for 2022, we published our initial market rent estimates on page S-17 of our supplemental package. We are expecting 7.7% net effective rent growth on average in 2022 with Northern California, the notable laggard in 2021, forecasted to lead the portfolio average in market rent growth next year.  A key assumption driving our outlook for 2022 is the return to a predominantly hybrid office environment occurring over the first half of the year, supporting our 2022 job growth outlook and our expectation that the West Coast markets will resume their long-term outperformance versus U.S. averages. Our confidence in the Bay Area recovery next year is partially driven by rental affordability following a year of solid income growth, lower effective rents, and exceptional growth in single-family home prices. Median for-sale home prices are up 17% in California and almost 16% in Seattle, making for-sale housing more costly relative to rental housing and often impeding the transition from renter to homeowner.  Finally, despite large increases in for-sale housing prices, our expectation for the production of for-sale housing in 2022 remains very muted at only 0.4% of the single-family housing stock. We previously noted that many large tech companies in our markets have delayed their office re-openings as a result of the Delta variant this fall, which we believe is the primary factor in the slow recovery of Northern California compared to other Essex markets. Nevertheless, recent tech Company announcements regarding office expansion, open positions in the Essex markets,  and new commitments to office space all support our belief that the leading employers remain fully committed to a hybrid office-centric environment on the West Coast. Page S-17.1 of our supplemental highlights recent investment by large tech companies which have continued throughout the pandemic and include Apple's 550,000 square foot recent expansion in Culver City, their new 490,000 square foot tech campus that will soon begin construction in North San Jose, and a recent acquisition of five office buildings with a total of 458,000 square feet in Cupertino. Google last quarter received needed approvals for its planned 80-acre campus near Downtown San Jose, and YouTube's 2.5 million square foot campus in San Bruno was just approved by the city last week.  We continue to track the large tech companies hiring in terms of open positions and job locations, giving us confidence that we continue to grow alongside the most dynamic sector of the U.S. economy. Our most recent survey of open positions indicates 38,000 job openings in the Essex markets for the 10 largest tech companies, up 9000 jobs or 26% as compared to the first quarter of 2020. Strong economic growth on the West Coast is further supported by venture capital investments which achieved new highs in Q3 '21 of $72 billion, of which 44% was directed to organizations in the Essex markets. Turning to our supply outlook for 2022, we are expecting 0.6% housing supply growth for the full year, including 0.9% growth for the multifamily stock which is manageable relative to our expectations for job growth of 4.1% in 2022.  Overall, our West Coast markets will remain well below the national rate of new housing supply growth and especially compared to the rapid accelerating pace of housing deliveries across many low-barrier markets next year. Longer term, residential building permits in Essex markets saw a modest 3.5% increase on a trailing 12-month basis, which is favorable compared to the U.S. where permits have increased 13.6% compared to one year ago. While our markets often temporarily underperform the national averages during recessions, we remain disciplined in our approach to capital allocation, including the cadence of housing supply deliveries with permitting data supporting our West Coast thesis.  Turning to the apartment transaction market, we continue to see strong demand from institutional capital to invest in the multi-family sector along the West Coast as evidenced by increasing transaction volume and cap rates in the mid-3% range. Apartment values across our markets are up approximately 15% on average compared to pre-COVID valuations. The Company has recently seen more development opportunities, and we were able to purchase two commercial properties in the third quarter. One located in South San Francisco that we expect to become a near-term apartment development opportunity, and another in Seattle that we will begin to entitle for apartments while earning an attractive 6% going in yield with a high-quality tenant. We also recently closed two apartment acquisitions as noted in the press release, and our acquisition pipeline is strong.  Barb, will discuss a new co-investment program in a moment, which is strategically important given our preference not to issue common stock at the current market price. Finally, the California statewide eviction moratorium ended September 30th. However, a few meaningful local jurisdictions have extended their separate eviction prohibitions. The net result is that a significant portion of our portfolio remains subject to eviction moratoria and other regulations that will slow the pace of scheduled rent growth in 2022. Fortunately, the federal tenant relief program has come to the aid of many of our residents, although the reimbursement process continues to be slow and require a significant coordination and support from the Essex team. I am grateful for this extensive team effort. With that, I'll turn the call over to Angela Kleiman. Hey, Nic. It's Mike, and Angela might follow me with comments. I think we're feeling very good about conditions around us. Again, we have high occupancy throughout and a very strong loss to lease, and that's been noted before. Everything looks like our markets are recovering. We expect to outperform the U.S. with respect to job growth, certainly going forward, and we view the catalyst of the return to office in Northern California as being the last piece that's probably the relative underperformance that we've had thus far relative to the peer group. We see that as still being a very strong part of our portfolio.  Historically, Northern California produces the highest CAGR of rent growth over long periods of time, and we expect that dominance to show itself and a lot of the reasons why we're embedded in the various comments that you heard from all of us, so hopefully, that all made sense. The number of open positions for tech companies, the big investments that the tech companies continue to make within the Northern California markets, etc., I think it bodes well, so we really feel great throughout our footprint. But the key piece going forward, I think, is Northern California, we feel very good about that, too. I think that given that we carry high occupancy into this period of time, any incremental growth in jobs should have a very positive impact on market rents. So, again, our expectation is, I would say, Northern California was probably shut down to a greater level than most other markets, maybe L.A. would be number two, but it has had the most muted recovery, yet, it has, I would say, the strongest and most dynamic job base. So again, we're looking forward to that. We're hoping it would happen earlier.  But again, I think the Delta variant has postponed that. But again, we feel strong. We think all the things, all the conditions that we would expect to see from number of open positions for these companies, major commitments to campuses and lease commitments for office space, etc., all seem to be focused on a return-to-office program, probably in a hybrid sense for these companies. So I think that's before us in the not distant future. Thank you. Okay. Haendel, thanks for the question. It's a good one. I'll let Angela handle the technology piece of it. Help me. What was your first part of your question? I'm sorry. Inflation, yes. Yes. So I mean, we've studied the inflation thing, the historical precedent going back a long time actually into the early 80s and no doubt, we are feeling quite a bit of pressure on the cost side. Certainly finding positions, especially on-site positions is challenging and compensation is going up, for sure. The one piece that's good in California, obviously, is property taxes because Prop. 13 limits that increase. I go back to rents. Rents are obviously the big thing. We're a high gross margin type of Company, and therefore, the rent growth really matters in this equation.  I think in an inflationary world, rents do very well. So I would expect that our rent growth would more than compensate for whatever cost increases that we have. I'm not saying, I want this to happen, but I think if we were in a more stronger inflationary period, I think it would be a net positive in terms of the financial performance of the Company. Obviously, if inflation goes up, all asset values decline in value. So maybe that would be one sticking point as well because probably cap rates change and some other things happen as well. Angela, do you want to comment on? Well, we're not guiding yet for next year. Barb drilled that into a prior to the call. Please don't give out any guidance for next year. So we're still working on this. Yes, I guess the point I would make is in high gross margin businesses, even if you get some expense pressure, the top line is so much more important. So I think in my view, we always look at rents. What's the relationship between rents and incomes? So in an inflationary environment, if incomes are going up, we're probably able to pass through most of that in the form of rent. If that happens, we will do very well on that scenario. Thanks, Haendel. Well, I'll start and I'll let Adam chime in here. Well, we've obviously dealt with regulatory issues over many, many years really, for the 35-years I've been here. Historically, the bigger the loss to lease gets because of rent roll, let's say, the more buyers and sellers will start pricing in a portion of it or want to higher cap rate given the delayed impact of rents. But generally speaking, all apartments are valued based on market rents today.  Then again, the loss to lease is a determination based on facts and circumstances. So with California rent control law, the statewide law, at CPI plus 5% max of 10% annual increase, I don't think that, that in and of itself will cause a significant valuation differential, and I think that's the key part that if you're moving your rents by CPI plus 5%, let's call that 8% or something like that, most buyers will think that that is plenty of compensation for the transaction. I don't think cap rates move all that much because of that. Adam, do you want to comment on that? I think we estimated about 9% between today and when we would start construction, for example, on the South San Francisco deal that Adam talked about earlier. Could that be high? We don't know. But we build in an estimated cost escalation. But what really drives all these deals, if cap rates go from 4.25-ish down to 3.5 or so. The built-in value of those transactions, other development transaction until, of course, land sellers adjust their price. It makes a ton of sense and gives a lot more value created in that process. Adam, do you? Yes. It's a great question. Yeah, I'm not sure we approach it that way. I mean, our research group, Paul Morgan, they use a variety of data sets and they're not looking at any one thing, not creating some base case scenario. The simple part of it is looking at what we expect job growth to do and how many units of demand are represented by the job growth, and then how much supply do we have? So fortunately, again, we're 96% occupied in all these markets. So it is like we have a hole to fill before the demand over supply situation takes hold.  We're already there. But included in some of the things he looks at, which is, I think some pretty interesting data. For example, Seattle has recovered 79% of the jobs that they lost in the pandemic and he is expecting them to be at a 110% by the end of the fourth quarter. So they will actually be above their pre-COVID employment level. Whereas almost all the other markets are still below pre-COVID level by the end of 2022. So it's not that simple. He considers affordability, which affordability is a key part of what we do, and we look at things now because there's been such incredible growth in rents in Southern California, they screen, and the way we do affordability is on a market basis, not a property-by-property basis, because we're trying to look at the overall dynamic in the marketplace.  Southern California, because it has such great rent growth, is screening a little bit expensive, and Northern California, which has the highest incomes and rents that are pretty moderate given what's happened here. That's what leads to the better growth rate for Northern California next year. Just by way of background, I'll give you a quick comparison. So rents in Seattle and Los Angeles, the median rent, the market rent, not Essex portfolio is about $1,816 in both cases.  But in Seattle, the median household income is $102,000 and in LA, it's about $88,000. Paul would look at that relationship and say, that's a positive for Seattle. It has about the same rents, has a lot more room to run with respect to income, and that would factor into the equation in terms of what we expect market rents to do. That makes sense? Well, occupancy is a little bit different element, and that really has to do with how aggressively we're pushing rents, and so occupancy, some have noted has actually declined a little bit, but that's really because we're pushing rents. When you push rents, you hold out a little bit longer and you are willing to accept a little bit lower occupancy level. But going back to our basic thesis, if we have 530,000 jobs created next year and the typical relationship between a household and a job is 2:1.  So we have somewhere around 265,000 units of demand for apartments, and we produce a total supply of 64,000 homes. We should do pretty darn well on that scenario. Again, affordability becomes the key issue, and affordability is different by market. We screen, relatively inexpensive in Northern California and relatively expensive than Southern California. But just looking at basic supply demand, we should be in great shape next year. We don't know exactly what's going to happen. We think 7.7% is a big number, but we'll wait and see. Not 1482, but yeah. Thanks, Rich. It's a good question, and the granularity of that data is difficult to follow, and so it's hard to say exactly what's happening recently. We do have job growth, and the job growth is exceeding the national average. So from that statistic alone, we feel like there were some positive movement back to the Bay Area and clearly occupancy, etc., has confirmed that. But we don't think that the major shift has happened. We expect it to pick up here in the next couple of months as we approach year-end and hopefully accelerate into 2022, and that's the premise. But again, I'd say we need more job growth than what we have currently to achieve the 2022 forecast that is on S-17. But we'll do fine either way. Actually, maybe, I think there are several parts to that, and I think we may need to clarify the question a bit here. But overall, we think 2022 will have roughly 4% more supply than 2021, and part of that is because there was the delivery delays caused by COVID, and eventually, they will catch up into 2022, but not enough to be really meaningful in the scheme of things, especially, again, when you go through the job numbers that we have and the implied demand from 530,000 new jobs across our footprint. Notably, on the supply side, Seattle is the one market that's down pretty substantially about 12%. So that's another gold star, let's say, for the Seattle market there. Barb, do you want to [Indiscernible] Yes. [Indiscernible] Yeah. This is Mike, and good question. We are still waiting and guessing as to what might happen with SB 9 and 10, and of the two, the one that's more impactful is SB 9 because that would effectively have the state override local zoning laws as it relates to the development of ADU units, and so potentially allowing more ADU units to be built in the suburbs. So I want to note that there previously was a ADU law that was passed earlier this year, and this whole situation has been quite politically active with respect to the YIMBYs, the \"Yes, In My Back Yard\", versus the NIMBYs, the \"No, In My Back Yard\" groups, and that's going to be an ongoing battle.  So I think personally, given that there was an ADU law that was out there before and it had relatively little impact, that's going to continue to be the case. There was a L.A. Times article that was recently written and it estimate, I don't know where this estimate came from, but I'll just mention it for the sake of transparency. It mentioned that estimated 1.5% of single-family homes are likely to use SB 9. I suspect that will be high. But the backdrop of this is that Governor Newsom and various other sources have indicated that the state is short millions of homes, and the likelihood that SB 9 and SB 10 will change that, I think, is very unlikely. Thank you, Operator, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. We look forward to seeing many of you, virtually speaking, at the upcoming NAREIT. Until then, stay well, and again, thank you for joining the call."

            "name": "Angela Kleiman",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. First, I'll start by expressing my appreciation for our operations team as we are in the midst of a strong recovery, our team has been busier and working harder than ever. I also want to thank the support departments, especially our delinquency collections team for their diligence to help our customers navigate the complex rent reimbursement legislations. On to today's comments, I'll provide an overview of our portfolio strategy relative to current market conditions, followed by some regional commentary and expectations for our markets. Our third quarter results reflect a combination of the operating strategy implemented early in the pandemic and a healthy recovery in net effective rents that began in the second quarter as California and Washington finally reopened from the pandemic shutdowns.  As you may recall, in the second quarter of 2020 when the pandemic-mandated shutdowns halted our economy, Essex quickly pivoted to a strategy that focused on maintaining high occupancy and coupon rents with the use of significant concessions. Now, over a year later, as our markets recover, we're starting to see the benefits of this strategy flow through our financial results. In the third quarter, same-property revenues grew by 2.7%, which is primarily attributable to a reduction in concessions compared to the previous period. By primarily utilizing concessions last year, we were able to limit the in-place rent decline to only 1.1% in the third quarter.  The benefit of this strategy is also coming through our sequential revenue growth, which increased 3.2% this quarter from the second quarter. With the market volatility we experienced over the past year, this is an extraordinary result and positions the Company well going forward. From a portfolio-wide perspective, market conditions remained strong compared to a year ago as demonstrated by the 12.6% blended net effective rent growth in the quarter. In addition, rents relative to pre-COVID levels have continued to improve, further enhanced by a delay to the typical seasonal slowdown in all our markets. Turning to some market-specific commentary from north to south, rents and jobs in the Seattle region have had a strong recovery with net effective rents up 8.3% compared to pre-COVID levels and year-over-year job growth of 5.5% in September.  New supply continues to be largely concentrated in the CBD, which is less impactful to Essex because 85% of our Seattle portfolio is located outside of CBD. Looking forward to 2022, as outlined in our S-17 of the supplemental, total housing supply deliveries for the region is expected to decline compared to 2021, and we anticipate job recovery to continue, led by Amazon, which recently announced plans to hire over 12,000 corporate and tech employees in Seattle. As such, we are forecasting market rent growth of 7.2% in 2022. Moving down to Northern California, which is our only region where net effective rents remain below pre-COVID levels.  Greater job loss and apartment supply deliveries caused net effective rents to fall further in Northern California since the onset of the pandemic. In addition, the job recovery in Northern California has been at a slower pace than our other regions, with only 4.4% year-over-year improvement compared to a 5.2% for the entire Essex portfolio as of September. We believe this is partly driven by the more onerous mandates delaying normal business activities. Apartment supply, particularly in San Mateo and Oakland CBD, are also presenting challenges for nearby properties, leading to financial concessions for stabilized properties of over a week in these markets in September.  On the other hand, we anticipate that Northern California will be our best performing region in 2022, with market rent growth forecast of 8.7% on our S-17. As Mike discussed, we expect hybrid office re-openings to continue, which will drive additional job growth and healthy demand for apartment units. With similar level of supply delivery expected in 2022 as this year, we are optimistic that Northern California is in its early stages of its recovery. Lastly, on Southern California, rent growth has continued to improve in the third quarter and net effective rents in September are 17.2% above pre-COVID levels. As we have mentioned in the past, Southern California is a tale of two markets, the urban areas in the Downtown L.A. versus the more suburban communities, which have generally outperformed.  In June, L.A. rents were still below pre-COVID levels, but as of September, they are now 6.8% above. While Orange County, San Diego, and Ventura have achieved rents between 17% to 30% above pre-COVID levels. Job growth in Southern California continues to progress well, up 5.9% in September as the region's economy continues to reopen and recover. With the exception of the Downtown L.A. area where concessions averaged one week in September, the rest of our Southern California markets has demonstrated solid fundamentals with no concessions recognized in September.  We expect Southern California strong rent growth to continue in 2022, led by Los Angeles, which has just begun to recover the jobs lost during the COVID recession. Apartment supply into region is forecasted to increase next year compared to this year and could present pockets of interim softness counterbalanced by a continued favorable job to supply ratio across the region. As you can see on our S-17 market rent growth for Southern California of 7.1%, we anticipate this region to perform at a comparable level as Seattle. With this backdrop of stable occupancy amidst a favorable supply demand relationship, our portfolio is well-positioned for the continued growth. I will now turn the call over to Barb Pak. Inflation. Sure. But I think Barb wants. Great. On the technology front, Haendel, what we have been doing is to really focus on ramping up the contactless interactions which also allows for efficiency and then allows more flexibility for our site team. So we are going to continue that path and further refine and enhance those technology, and what that means is that it will allow our staff to probably specialize more and hopefully continue to be more efficient, and that will help. I don't think it will be, say, an immediate relief as far as the payroll expenses that you're looking for, but over time, it should benefit the business platform. Sure, happy to. It's Angela here. At September, the portfolio loss to lease was 9.8%, and it's a widespread, it's from Northern California into force to Southern California in the low single digits, around 13%. We understand that typically, analysts look to this loss of lease to model next year. So I want to just make sure that I provide a little more context on that because we want to consider a couple of factors.  First, this year was an unprecedented year because we started out the year with a huge negative rent growth and has turned positive. It's a very steep curve. This trajectory is not likely to repeat next year. Because of that, and the delay in the seasonal peak, it has created a small drag on revenue for next year. Secondly, some markets, those over 10%, which, broadly speaking, will be our Orange County, San Diego, and Ventura counties. They're above the 10% rent control cap. So that will be a factor as well. I'm not sure if I am following your question. Are you talking about asking versus achieved? Is that what you mean? Yes, I see what you mean. Normally, let's put it this way for now. It has been higher, but that's pretty typical. What we try to do is forecast what the rent level is going to be one or two months out, whenever we sent a renewal. So what that means is sometimes it's higher, sometimes it's lower. So if we think that we're sending out renewals now for, say, December, January, it's not likely to be a whole lot higher. But back in, if we're sending renewals out in March for renewals in May or June, it tends to be higher. So it really depends on the timing and the market conditions. That's a good question, and this goes toward the social responsibilities part of our corporate governance, right? We have a self-imposed cap of 10% for many, many years, and really, the approach behind that is to avoid being viewed as anti-gouging, and that strategy has worked well for us for many, many years, and it really has not materially negatively impacted the returns of our shareholders. Well, it's broadly across the portfolio, and so it's wherever we have that hitting the loss of lease of up 10%, and so it happens to coincide with 1482. So it's Orange County, San Diego, and Ventura, because they're all above 10% loss of lease. Yes, Seattle as well. This is Angela here. That's a good question. We have not seen any meaningful change in the demographic profile, and I think this question was also posed early on when rents declined or when we were giving out significant concessions. I think at the end of the day, it's all about jobs, and so while it's slightly more affordable, we just don't see people randomly moving into the city and then not being able to stay. Does that makes sense? Then Neil, I just want to make sure that in my prepared comments, I did say that we had $290 million of preferred redemption this year, and given the current environment, if it is to continue low interest rates and high valuations for West Coast assets, we could expect early redemptions of a comparable amount in 2022, I would imagine. We could still face headwinds there, just given this environment. We're seeing a lot of developers able to take us out early for a variety of reasons. I wanted to make sure that you heard that as well. Yes, that's an interesting question in that the data set itself, I want to just give a little context because I think that matters. Our San Mateo market only actually has four properties in the same store, and so because of that, you are going to see a lot more volatility, and in addition, there has been good job growth and it's a good market for us. There has been lease up competition in the area. We're talking about an interim period where you have competition from lease up, well their job growth is still at a slower pace relative to our other markets, and then you add that with a small data set. It's going to just be a lot more volatile. It's not that there's anything fundamentally that we're concerned about with this market. Sure, happy to. It's Angela here. We started ramping up and I mentioned that last quarter, and we're going to continue to do so, especially in light of the recovery and the strength of the recovery, and of course, our expectations for market rent growth next year, and our goal at this point is really to double the number of renovations for next year compared to this year, and then ultimately, get back to pre-COVID levels because it does take a little more time to ramp up these activities, and as market conditions improve, we also make sure that we underwrite the improvements, and ensure we don't have capital destruction, and make sure that we're meeting the market, and optimizing our returns, and so it's not a turn the switch on, we just want to be diligent about it. Sure. I'm happy to. We target our ROI at pre-COVID levels. But keep in mind it's driven by market rents, and so what that means is that ROI, the way we approach it is that we wouldn't proceed with a reinvestment opportunity if we're not achieving our target ROI. Therefore, if you're concerned that there has been any compression or deterioration there, there has not been. Let me make sure I understand your question. Are you asking about our leasing velocity whether it has changed because of Amazon? Oh, the policy. Yes. I see what you mean. So we have not seen the impact from the Amazon shift. Because keep in mind, while, yes, they have the corporate mandate, but they also have a lot of workers throughout the region. Of course, all the businesses that support Amazon. But practically speaking, we have not seen an impact on our turnover, we have not seen an impact in our occupancy and certainly not an impact on our ability to raise rents. Well, the CPI plus 5%, it's that, but it's cap to 10%. So it's not a metric that we have flexibility to push at our discretion, and we've been operating in this market even before AB 1482. We have assets that had rent control. Over a long period of time, it had comparable growth rates and we've operated well under these circumstances. So we don't think this is going to fundamentally change our ability to achieve our return targets. Yeah, happy to. So this is an unusual year in that normally, we peak around July, and so starting, end of July, we start to have a deceleration for six months. This is an unusual year in that we had this huge ramp-up. We went from a big negative, I think, like negative 10% of market rent growth in Q1, and we peaked around, it depends on which markets, but Seattle and Northern California peaked around August, and Southern California is just peaking now, as we speak. So it's very different from that perspective, having said that, that natural seasonality does play itself out, and so the question is really a magnitude issue.  What we're going to continue to do is focus on at this point, wherever we can push rents, but more likely as we head into November, December, now focusing on occupancy, and I think some people noted that in the third quarter, we allow occupancy to fall a bit, but I want to emphasize that was because of the strength of the market, and now we're going to preserve those rents and focus on occupancy if we see that deceleration continue to continue. It's between mid-October and now. So, say, in the past week."

            "name": "Barbara Pak",
            "content": "Thanks, Angela. I'll start with a few comments on our third quarter results, discuss changes to our full year guidance, followed by an update on investments and the balance sheet. I'm pleased to report core FFO for the third quarter exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.08 per share. The favorable outcome was due to stronger operating results at both our consolidated and co-investment properties, higher commercial income and lower G&A expense. During the quarter, we saw an improvement in our delinquency rate, which declined to 1.4% of scheduled rent on a cash basis compared to 2.6% in the second quarter.  The decline is attributable to an increase in income from the federal tenant relief programs that were established to repay landlords for past due rents. Year-to-date through September, we have received $11.6 million from the various tenant relief programs, of which $9.5 million was received in the third quarter. Given the increased pace of reimbursements, we began to reduce our net accounts receivable balance in order to maintain our conservative approach to delinquencies and collections.  As a result of the strong third quarter results, we are raising the full year midpoint for same-property revenues by 20 basis points to minus 1.2%. It should be noted, this was the prior high end of our range. There are two factors I want to highlight as it relates to our fourth quarter guidance. First, as Angela discussed, we are seeing strong rent growth in our market. While there will be a small benefit to the fourth quarter, the vast majority of the benefit from higher rent growth won't be felt until 2022 when we have the opportunity to turn more leases. Second, our fourth quarter guidance assumes we continue to receive additional government reimbursements for past due rents and contemplates a continued reduction in our net accounts receivable balance.  Thus, we expect our reported delinquencies as a percent of scheduled rents to be above our cash delinquencies, which is consistent with the third quarter reported results. As it relates to full year core FFO, we are raising our midpoint by $0.11 per share to $12.44. This reflects the better-than-expected third quarter results and changes to our full year outlook. Year-to-date, we have raised core FFO by $0.28 or 2.3% at the midpoint. Turning to the investment markets, during the quarter, we raised a new institutional joint venture to fund acquisitions, as we believe this is the most attractive source of capital today to maximize shareholder value. The new venture will have approximately $660 million of buying power, a portion of which is expected to be invested by year-end.  As I discussed on our last call, we are seeing an elevated level of early redemptions of our preferred equity investments due to strong demand for West Coast apartments and inexpensive debt financing, which is leading to sales and recapitalizations. For the year, we expect redemptions to be around $290 million. Roughly 40% of these redemptions are expected to occur in the fourth quarter. Given the current environment, we could see continued elevated levels of early redemptions in 2022. In terms of new preferred equity and structured finance commitments, we are on track to achieve our 2021 objectives as outlined at the start of the year. Year-to-date, we have closed on approximately $110 million of new commitments. As a reminder, it typically takes 3-6 months post-closing to fund our commitments given they tend to be tied to development projects.  Moving to the balance sheet. As we expected, we are starting to see an improvement in our financial metrics, driven by a recovery in our operating results. In the third quarter, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio declined from 6.6 times last quarter to 6.4 times. We believe this ratio will continue to decline through growth in EBITDA over the next several quarters. With limited near-term debt maturities and ample liquidity, we remain in a strong financial position. That concludes my prepared remarks, and I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions. Yes, I just want to follow up on that one point. Haendel, the other thing that we've done over the last several years is take advantage of the low interest rate environment and lock in our interest rates for long periods of time. We have very little debt maturing next year and the following year, so we're not susceptible to rising rates from that perspective. We've locked in our interest expense effectively, and we have very limited variable rate exposure as well. So we feel good about where the balance sheets stands from an inflationary perspective. Still working through the budget. Hi, Brad. This is Barb. So you can see we report our delinquencies. For the quarter, we were at 1.4% on a cash basis, and keep in mind, we did report in July last quarter and that was at 2.2%. So that implies August, September had come down. That was around 1% on a cash basis, and then October is about 1%, and that's really being driven by the reimbursements. As I mentioned during the call, we got 9.5 million in the third quarter. Most of that hit in August and September, and in October, we've seen a commensurate amount, so that's where we've been at. We've been stable, I would think, the last three month. It's been pretty stable in terms of our net delinquencies. Correct. Correct. Yes. Exactly. It would be higher without those reimbursements. The reimbursements is what is driving that number lower, correct. Hi, Amanda. Thank you for it. We've used the co-investment platform for many, many years, and we like it because it is an alternative source of capital win. We don't like our equity, our stock price, and so we've used it from time-to-time. We do think it's a good source of capital for us, and in terms of economics, we were able to reduce the hurdle rates and improve the economics for Essex. Cap rates have come down over the past year, 75 to a 100 basis points, and we're able to change terms accordingly. So the economics of the joint venture didn't change materially from what we've done in the past, but we will continue to use this source of capital going forward depending on market conditions. Yes, that's a good question. We always remain very disciplined as it relates to what source of capital we use. So we look at a variety of different sources; one being the equity, one joint venture equity, and one disposition, and keep in mind, with values up 15% from pre-COVID levels that puts our NAV where we think the value of the Company is, is up quite a bit from where we were at the start of the pandemic, and so that's a factor that we look at when whether we want to issue equity today or not.  The other factor to keep in mind is we have a lot of money coming back from preferred equity redemptions. We're using that to fund the new investments we're making along with using the joint venture platform. We really do you think it creates a lot more value for our shareholders given the fees and the potential to promote hurdle and given where our stock price is trading. We don't believe we're at a material premium to NAV at this point. Yes, and that's a great question. The value of our SmartRent investment is about $75 million today, and our third quarter financials, there's a lag effect there because the shares are still held within RTV until we come out of lock out, and their financials are one quarter in arrears for us, and so we would expect a fairly substantial gain in the fourth quarter. It could be up to $40 million, and then we would also have to recognize an unrealized deferred tax provision as well. That could be up to $12 million. Both of those numbers are not reflected in our full year guidance for total FFO. Just given the uncertainty, there's a lot of other moving parts within RTV that we don't try to predict that gain or loss. But those are the numbers related to SmartRent in and of itself."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Adam Berry",
            "content": "Hi, Haendel. This is Adam. So I'll touch on both of the two office acquisitions that Mike touched on in the opening remarks. They're both separate, which is why I'll cover them separately. The first one which is in South San Francisco, we've had that tied up for over 3 years, and so during that time, we work with the city to determine what zoning we could get. During that time, we're basically able to increase the density by over a 100 units. So when you take that, coupled with the cap rate compression that we've seen in the market, the deal made more sense than really, any development deal that we've penciled in the last couple of years.  So there is in-place income on the existing use, it's in the, call it, high three cap rate range, which is fine. That will get us through to entitlements which we would expect in nine months to a year or so. The other one, somewhat of an outlier. It's a single-tenant office deal in Seattle, really good location. There's still another nine years on the lease, and we have a partial guarantee for that for that term. So it's north of a six cap on current income. It does pencil on today's multifamily underwriting, and it is actually zoned for multifamily, but we'll revisit that in 5, 6, 7 years from now to see what makes the most sense. But for now, that's a very solid covered land play from our perspectives. Sure. Just one additional comment. The most onerous rent controls within California, San Francisco, or Santa Monica, or Berkeley, there's just very little that trades there. So that's where you see that the larger loss to lease, the bigger gap between in-place and economic, and that's where pricing would fluctuate more. But as far as AB 1482 goes, the California statewide one, it doesn't really factor in to really anyone's models from what I can tell. It's something we consider in all of our strategic decisions. We're not focused on the office market. I want to be very clear that the two opportunities that we had are like fairly one-offs. But we look at all of those factors in determining where and what to invest in. Yeah. So just one final follow-up there. We're always looking at the spread between where stabilized acquisitions or stabilized assets are trading versus our development yield. Whether deal is entitled or unentitled, we're going to look for a different spread between what in-place cap rates are, and so that escalation that Mike referred to, we assume on everything whether it's 3 months out, 6 months out, or 2 years out. Then that factors into the denominator. So with this cap rate compression, we've seen, especially on these two deals, and there are a couple of others potentially in the pipeline where that spread has increased, and those are the deals that we are pursuing aggressively. Neil, as far as on the street opportunities that we're seeing to kind of echo your point with costs having risen. Now that being said, costs are well down from where we were at the lumber peak in mid-summer. But taking all that into account, we're seeing a steady flow of deals, but fewer deals, it seems that are penciling and that's both on the mezz and pref side as well as on the direct development side. The one point I made earlier with cap rates compressing on existing products, they're also diminishing some on the development yields. There are competing factors as to how deals are being made today, but like I started with, there is a flow of deals happening. But again, those that are actually penciling are, I would say, fewer and further between. Yes. Thanks, John. As Mike pointed out in the opening remarks, that's an average. As it relates specifically to the Bay Area, there's been very little to trade, very little of substance. I think that number in the Bay Area is going to be anywhere between 5% and maybe upwards of 20%. But again, there's been really just two Class A deals that have traded and then some B and C deals that have traded. So we're talking about very limited data set. Up. Yeah, John. I'm just kidding."

Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found on the company's filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall. You may begin.\nMichael Schall: Thank you for joining us today, and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. Angela Kleiman and Barbara Pak will follow me with prepared remarks and Adam Berry is here for Q&A. On today\u2019s call, I will start with our second quarter results which were driven by a strengthening economy and positive [indiscernible] underly a robust recovery on the West Coast. I will also discuss the status of reopening the West Coast economies and related factors, concluding with an overview of the West Coast Department Transaction Markets and Investments. Our second quarter results were ahead of our initial expectations entering the year as the economic recovery from the pandemic occurred faster than we expected. With a strong economy and high vaccination rates, we are now confident that the worst of the pandemic related impacts are behind us. As noted on previous calls, our strategy during the pandemic was to maintain high occupancy and scheduled rent, both necessary for rapid recovery. To that end, net effective rents surged during the second quarter, along with year-over-year improvement in occupancy, other income and delinquency. The recovery in net effective rents continued unabated in July and we are now pleased to announce the July net effective rents for the Essex portfolio have now surpassed pre-pandemic levels, with our suburban markets leading the way while the downtowns are improving, but still generally below pre-pandemic levels. Obviously, these higher rents will be converted into revenue as leases turned and Angela will provide additional details in a moment. Having passed the midpoint of 2021 and looking forward, we made a second set of positive revisions to our West Coast market forecast which can be found on Page S 17 of the supplemental. Driving the changes is an increase in 2021 GDP and job growth estimates to 7% and 5%, up from 4.3% and 3.2% respectively from our initial forecast. As a result, we now expect our average 2021 net effective rent growth to improve to minus 0.9% from minus 1.9% from the beginning of the year. To put this into perspective, consider that our net effective rents were down about 9% year-over-year in Q1 2021, given our current expectation of minus 0.9% rent growth for the year, year-over-year net effective market rents are now forecasted to increase about 6% in the fourth quarter of 2021. Cash delinquencies were up modestly on a sequential basis at 2.6% of scheduled rent for the quarter and well above our 30-year average delinquency rate of 30 to 40 basis points. The American rescue plan of 2021 provides funding for emergency rental assistance, which was allocated to the states for distribution to renters for pandemic related delinquencies. Through the second quarter collections of delinquent rents from the American rescue plan were negligible, as the pace of processing reimbursements has been slow since the program launched in March. We expect that to improve in the coming months. We expect delinquency rates to return to normal levels over time, as more workers enter the workforce and eviction protections lapse on September 30 in both California and Washington. At this point, only about 7 million of the 55 million in delinquent rent shown on Page S 16 of the supplemental has been recorded as revenue. Given uncertainty about the timing of collections, no additional revenues are contemplated in our financial guidance. Even with the approved job and economic outlook, the reopening process was gradual through the second quarter, with full reopening declared in mid and late June for California and Washington respectively. The unemployment rate was still 6.5% in the Essex markets as of May 2021. underperforming the nation. Through Q2, we have regained about half of the jobs lost in the early months of the pandemic. Employment in the Essex markets dropped over 15% in April 2020 and while job growth in our markets outpaced the nation in the second quarter, we're still 7.9% below pre-pandemic employment compared to 4.4% for the U.S. overall. We see the gap is an opportunity for growth to continue in the coming months as we benefit from the full reopening of the West Coast economies. We believe that many workers that exited the primary employment centers during pandemic related shutdowns and work from home programs will return as businesses reopen and resume expansion that was placed on hold during the pandemic. As we proceed through the summer months, we edge closer to the targeted office reopening date set by most large tech employers in early September. As recent reports about Apple and Google suggest the COVID-19 Delta variant could lead to temporary delays in this reopening process, our survey of job openings in the Essex markets for the largest tech companies continues to be very strong as we report 33,000 job openings as of July, a 99% increase over last year's [indiscernible]. New venture capital investment has set a record pace this year with Essex markets once again leading with respect to funds invested providing growth capital that supports future jobs. Generally, economic sectors that fell the furthest during the pandemic are now positioned for the strongest recovery in the reopening process led by restaurants, hotels, entertainment venues travel and so many. Returned to office plans which remain focused on hybrid approaches will continue to draw employees closer to corporate offices. Given that many workers won't be required to be in the office on a full time basis, we expect average commute distances to increase. As we highlight on Page S 17.1 of our supplemental, this transition has already started in recent months, as our hardest hit markets in the Bay Area once again experienced net positive migration from beyond the NorCal region. In particular, since the end of Q1, the sub markets surrounding San Francisco Bay have seen positive net migration that represents 18% of total move outs over the trailing three months compared to minus 8% a year ago. These inflows are led by residents returning from adjacent metros such as Sacramento and the Monterey Peninsula, as well as renewed flow of recent graduates arriving from college towns across the country, a notable positive turnaround from last year. In Seattle CBD, we've seen similar or even stronger recent inflows and were likewise experiencing a strong market rent recovery. On the supply outlet, we provided our semi-annual update to our 2021 forecasts on S 17 of the supplemental, with slight increases to 2021 supply as COVID related construction delays shifted incremental units from late 2020 into 2021. We expect modestly fewer apartment deliveries in the second half of 2021, with more significant declines in Los Angeles and Oakland. While it is still too early to quantify recent volatility in lumber prices and shortages for building materials may impact construction starts and the timing of deliveries in subsequent years, multifamily permitting activity in Essex markets also continues to trend favorably declining 200 basis points on a trailing 12-month basis as of May 2021, compared to the national average, which grew 230 basis points. Median single family home prices in Essex markets continued upward in California and Seattle grew 18% and 21% respectively on a trailing three-month basis. The escalating cost of homeownership combined with greater rental affordability from the pandemic have increased the financial incentive to rent. We suspect these trends will continue given muted single-family supply and limited permitting activity and believe these factors will be a key differentiator for our markets in the coming years compared to many U.S. markets with greater housing supply. Turning to apartment transactions. activity has steadily accelerated since the start of the year, with the majority of apartment trades occurring in the low to mid 3% cap rate range based on current rents. Generally, investors anticipate a robust rent recovery, especially in markets where current rents are substantially below pre-pandemic levels. With the recent improvement in our cost of capital, we have turned our focus once again to acquisitions and development while remaining disciplined with respect to FFO accretion targets. With respect to our preferred equity program, we continue to see new deals although the market is becoming more competitive. Lower cap rates from pre-pandemic levels have produced higher than anticipated market valuations which in turn has resulted in higher levels of early redemption. That concludes my comments. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to our COO, Angela Kleiman.\nAngela Kleiman: Thanks, Mike. My comments today will focus on our second quarter results and current market dynamics. With the reopening of the West Coast economy the recovery has generated improvements in demand and thus pricing power. Our operating strategy during COVID to favor occupancy while adjusting concessions to maintain schedule rents enabled us to optimize rent growth concurrent with the increase in demand, resulting in same-store net effective rent growth of 8.3% since January 1, and most of this growth occurred in the second quarter. A key contributor of this accomplishment is the fantastic job by our operations team and responding quickly to this dynamic market environment. While market conditions have improved rapidly during our second quarter -- driving our second quarter results to exceed expectations. I would like to provide some context for why sequential same property revenues declined by 90 basis points compared to the first quarter. The two major factors that drove this decline were 50 basis points in delinquency and 50 basis points in concessions. Delinquency in the first quarter was temporarily lifted by the one-time unemployment disbursements from the stimulus funds, as expected in the second quarter, delinquency reverted back to 2.6% of schedule rents versus the 2.1% in the first quarter. On concessions, the nominal amount increased from higher volume of leases in the second quarter relative to the first quarter of this year. To be clear concessions in our markets have declined substantially and are virtually non-existent except for select CBD markets. Our average concession for the stabilized portfolio is under one week in the second quarter compared to over a week in the first quarter and over two weeks in the fourth quarter. Although concessions have generally improved in the second quarter, they remain elevated ranging from two and a half to three weeks in certain CBD, such as CBD LA, San Jose and Oakland. Given the extraordinary pandemic related volatility in rents and concessions over the past year and a half, I thought it would be insightful to provide an overview of the change in net effective rent compared to pre-COVID levels. As of this June, our same-store average net effective rent compared to March of last year was down by 3.1%. Since then, we have seen continued strength and based on preliminary July results, our average net effects are now 1.5% above pre-COVID levels. It is notable that this 1.5% portfolio average diverged regionally, with both Seattle and Southern California up 5.8%, 9.3%, respectively, while Northern California has yet to fully recover, with net effective rents currently at 8% below pre-COVID levels. On a sequential basis, net effective rents or new leases has improved rapidly throughout the second quarter and preliminary July rent increased 4.7% compared to the month of June, led by CBD San Francisco and CBD Seattle both up about 11%. Not surprisingly, these two markets were hit hardest during the pandemic and are now experiencing the most rapid growth. Moving on to office development activities, which we view as an indicator of future job growth and according the housing demand. In general, the areas along the West Coast was the greatest amount of office developments have been San Jose and Seattle. Currently San Jose has 8.1% of total office dock under construction and similarly Seattle has 7% of office stock under construction. Notable activities include Apple leasing an additional 700,000 square feet and LinkedIn announced recent plans to upgrade their existing office in Sunnyvale. In the Seattle region, Facebook expanded their Bellevue footprint by 330,000 square feet, and Amazon announced 1400 new web service jobs in Redlands. We expect in the long-term areas with higher office deliveries, such as San Jose and Seattle will have capacity for greater apartment supply without impacting rental rates. While these normal relationships were disrupted during the pandemic, we anticipate conditions to normalize in the coming quarters. Lastly, as the economic recovery continues to gain momentum, we have restarted both our apartment renovation programs and technology initiatives including actively enhancing the functionality of our mobile leasing platform and smart rent home automation. Thank you and I will now turn the call over the Barbara Pak.\nBarbara Pak: Thanks, Angela. I'll start with a few comments on our second quarter results, discuss changes to our full year guidance, followed by an update on our investments and the balance sheet. I'm pleased to report core FFO for the second quarter exceeded the midpoint of the revised range we provided during the NAREIT conference by $0.08 per share. The favorable results are primarily attributable to stronger same property revenues, higher commercial income and lower operating expenses. Of the $0.08, $0.03 relates to the timing of operating expenses and G&A spend, which is now forecasted to occur in the second half of the year. As Angela discussed, we are seeing stronger rent growth in our markets than we expected just a few months ago. As such, we are raising the full year midpoint of our same property revenue growth by 50 basis points to minus 1.4%. It should be noted this was the high-end of the revised range route provided in June. In addition, we have lowered our operating expense growth by 25 basis points at the midpoint due to lower taxes in the Seattle portfolio. All of this results in an improvement in same property NOI growth by 80 basis points at the midpoint to minus 3%. Year-to-date, we have revived the same property revenue growth at the midpoint up 110 basis points and NOI by 160 basis points. As it relates to full year core FFO, we are raising our midpoint by $0.09 per share to $12.33. This reflects the stronger operating results partially offset by the impact of the early redemptions of preferred equity investments, which I will discuss in a minute. Year-to-date, we have raised core FFO by $0.17 or 1.4%. Turning to the investment market, as we discussed on previous calls, strong demand for West Coast apartments and inexpensive debt financing has led to sales and recapitalization of several properties underlying our preferred equity and subordinated loan investments, resulting in several early redemptions. During the quarter, we received 36 million from an early redemption of a subordinated loan, which included 4.7 million in prepayment fees, which have been excluded from core FFO. Year-to-date, we have been redeemed on approximately 150 million of investment and expect that number could grow to approximately 250 million by year end. This is significantly above the high end of the range provided at the start of the year. However, this speaks to the high valuation apartment properties are commanding today, which is good for Essex and the net asset value of the company. As for new preferred equity investments, we have a healthy pipeline of accretive deals, and we are still on track to achieve our original guidance of 100 million to 150 million in the second half of the year. As a reminder, our original guidance assume new investments would match redemptions during the year. However, the timing mismatch between the higher level of early reductions, coupled with funding of new investments expected later this year has led to an approximate $0.10 per share drag on our FFO for the year. Moving to the balance sheet, we remain in a strong financial position due to refinancing over 1/3 of our debt over the past year and a half taking advantage of the low interest rate environment to reduce our weighted average rate by 70 basis points to 3.1% and lengthening our maturity profile by an additional two years. We currently have only 7% of our debt maturing through the end of 2023. Given our [indiscernible] maturity schedule, limited near term funding needs and ample liquidity, we are in a strong position to take advantage of opportunities as they arise. This concludes my prepared remarks. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen at this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nic Joseph with Citi.\nNic Joseph: Maybe you started Barbara on the comments you just made on the preferred equity in the mez loan. In terms of the pipeline today, are you seeing any compression on yields or expected returns, already changes to the competition there?\nAdam Berry: Hey, Nic. This is Adam. To answer your question, yes. We're seeing compression on cap rates. We're seeing -- it's a much more competitive market now with proceeds going well above where we're typically comfortable and rates going significantly below where we've been in the market. So to sum, yes, we are seeing the absolute compression on valuations.\nNic Joseph: Thanks. So then in terms of the early redemption that you've seen? I mean, is there a risk of further early redemptions that could at least create an air pocket on the earning side?\nBarbara Pak: Hi, Nic. This is Barbara. At this point, I think we factored that all in and based on what we know today. And already -- almost in August. So I think we factor that into the current guidance. So I'm not expecting any more redemptions at this point for the rest of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.\nRich Hill: I wanted to just come back to sort of trends that you're seeing in your markets. And I appreciate all the color and commentary you gave us. But I'm hoping you can compare and contrast what you're seeing in your market specifically, versus maybe what someone typically thinks about in San Francisco, Los Angeles, the broader West Coast urban markets. So specifically, are you seeing people still continue to migrate in? Are you seeing people migrate out? One of those trends in your markets that give you confidence relative to maybe some of the urban markets are at trends?\nMichael Schall: Hi, Rich. It\u2019s Michael. I think I'll handle that one. And others may want to comment as well. But I think we feel really very good about what's happening here. Noted in my comments that we\u2019re fully recovered with respect to market rents, versus pre-pandemic levels, while only recovered about half the job so far, so that I think -- that's a powerful place to start. And if we look around the West Coast, we feel great about what's happening. And we expect good times to continue that, consumer is super optimistic. They've saved money via COVID versus COVID, by not traveling and a variety of other things. So millennials are forming households. And there's a lot of hiring here on the West Coast. So that's why we talk about the top 10 tech companies and how many open positions they have, they've come a long way in the past year, after what we perceived as them pulling back amid COVID, on their expansion plans, I think that they're now turning that corner, or have turned that corner hiring more people pursuing things that they put on hold a year ago. And so everything feels like it's in good order at this point in time. As you go to the cities, the main driver of job growth at this point in time has been the recovery of all the industries that have been so dramatically affected a year ago, including the leisure, hospitality, restaurants, filming in Southern California, et cetera. And as we look at the world, we're looking at, whether we believe these industries are poised for future growth and we think absolutely they are we think that, we're in a fluid areas, a fluid areas demand services, you're starting to see those services come back in terms of restaurants and a variety of other areas. And so we see this turning around nicely. And again, I wouldn't have expected to be fully back with respective rents at a time when we've only recovered about half the jobs that we lost. Make sense?\nRich Hill: Yes. It makes perfect sense. I was just waiting to see if anyone else was going to follow up. That's perfect, Mike. As we look forward, and at the risk of asking you to guide, which I'm not, we have this obviously a pretty significant trough that that came late last year and early this year. Is it sort of reasonable to think that 2022 will be the mirror image of that? And then maybe we can -- if we maybe even continue to push rents above a normal trend over the medium term?\nMichael Schall: It's a good question. And Barbara -- look at me very strangely, if we start talking about 22 at this point in time. So and how we are, we tend to be pretty careful in terms of guidance. And so we don't want to go too far out there. But I would say that, I would expect, certainly the return to office to be a good thing for the downtown locations, because most of the top 10 tech companies or most of tech companies in general have announced a hybrid type of approach, which means that people are going to have to be closer to the offices to show up let's say plus or minus three times per week. As a result of that, the people that move to the Hinterlands, the most suburban parts of our portfolio probably are going to need to come back. And I think about Ventura don't want to pick on Ventura, because it's done great. But, it's a long way on a commute pattern from Ventura into the where the jobs are in LA. And I don't think people are even going to want to do that three times a week. So I think that kind of frames the dynamics, those that had a year, given the pandemic to make a different choice about where to live, I think will likely make a different choice going forward, now that there's more clarity about what the company is going to do with respect to their work from home or return to office programs.\nBarbara Pak: The only other thing I would add is, Lisa's resigning today, we'll have half an impact to the rent this year to our rent roll, and that will carry forward into next year, too. I mean, look at Angela mentioned, we had a strong July, and so that is going to only affect part of this year's numbers.\nRich Hill: I got it. Thank you, guys. I'm not sure that's entirely what I wanted. But I appreciate the response. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Hey, guys, hope you're all doing well. I'm just kind of curious what your mark-to-market is in your portfolio? And maybe if you have it by region, like Seattle, Northern California, Southern California.\nBarbara Pak: Are we talking about lost lease?\nJoshua Dennerlein: Yeah, lost least.\nAngela Kleiman: That's all right. All right. Well, in terms of the loss lease, we actually are in a much better position at a level even better than pre-COVID. So if we look at July lost lease for the Essex portfolio, it's now at 7.4%. And so and that, of course, varies, Seattle at the highest at about 12. Southern California, in the middle of the pack at about eight, and Northern California at the lowest as well, three and a half.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay, awesome. And in your guidance range, what are you assuming as far as like a recovery for the rest of the year and rate for the Northern California market?\nMichael Schall: I'll start. The second half of the year, as each -- we have to turn leases in order to impact our same-store or our revenue. And so if you get toward the end of the year, it becomes less relevant and more relevant, obviously, next year. So, take a transaction in October, you only have three months of that new lease in 2021. The rest of this is going to be in 2022. So there's an inherent lagging, concept with respect to what's going on with marker rents with Angela just talked about versus how it shows up on the on the income statement. So I think that's important, in terms of just looking at market rents. We tried to provide a little bit of color on that. And with respect to S 17, is what we're trying to get out that, overall, our economic rent growth on S 17 is at minus 0.9%. And that's a 1/12 of every month throughout the year. So January 2021, versus January 2020, plus February through the year divided by 12, is what that number represents. So we started the year at a rate, in the minus nine to minus 10% range. And that implies to get minus 0.9%, on S 17, that the fourth quarter would be plus 6%. And that does not anticipate a lot of rent growth between now and then, which is pretty typical, we typically hit the peak of market rents in July, at the end of the peak lease season, and then flattens out for the rest of the year. So that's what's assumed in those numbers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Great, thanks, guys. It seems possible that your markets could experience an extended leasing season, it certainly come up on other calls, and some seem pretty optimistic about the prospects. But clearly, as you identify, there are some risks to take into consideration. So just wondering, kind of how you went about your back half guidance? And did you assume typical seasonality or sort of that another leg up in demand in the late summer, early fall timeframe?\nMichael Schall: Yes. This is Mike. And I agree with you, we did not -- we assume more or less the typical, trend with respect to market rents. So kind of peaking in July and not a lot of growth for the rest of the year. As we think about it, however, there are some things that are different, for example, will the tech companies continue hiring normally, what happens is hiring tails off at the end of the year, companies get business plans at the -- toward the third, fourth quarter, and then they start implementing them in the first quarter. That's what really drives the peak leasing season. So the question here is, will companies continue hiring at a higher level given COVID than they have in the past. I think there's a very good chance that could happen. I also, this work from home and returned to office concept could have an impact on that as well, if you have more people are moving back into the more urban areas from -- people that were displaced, as California and Washington were shutting down a year ago. If those people continue to come back, later this year that could possibly push rents higher in the second part of the year. So we've, again assumed based on our experience, and what typically happens to normal curve with respect to rents, but there are some things that are different here. And so we could end up with being surprised to the positive side.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Great. That's very helpful. And then, Angela, I think you mentioned that you're restarting the redevelopment program? Could you give us kind of the scale of that, or the annual run rate, and then maybe offer up some additional details on sort of the economics, that'd be really helpful.\nAngela Kleiman: Sure thing. Normally pre-COVID, our run rate was about in terms of units, about 4000 units a year. And what we did was scale back significantly last year. So second half of last year, we only renovated about 600 -- over 600 units, 650 units, so the target during the restart for the second half of this year is to double that. So say close to 1300 units this year. We are looking at a couple of large developments for the future -- for next year that will have no greater opportunities. But in terms of -- just the return on investments, we're actually looking at ranges pretty darn consistent with pre-COVID levels. And so while cost has gone up, but rents have gone up as well concurrently. So we think we're in a pretty good spot.\nAustin Wurschmidt: And what are those numbers on the economics?\nAngela Kleiman: They tend to range depending on the asset and the scope and the market but I'll give you a range that might be a little bit better than a hard number, they tend to range stay in the high single digits to the high double digits. So it's a pretty wide range.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Amanda Sweitzer with Robert W. Baird.\nAmanda Sweitzer: I know line up on some of your comments on ramping up your development spending. Can you provide an update on areas you're targeting for those potential projects, as well as underwritten yields you think you could achieve?\nAdam Berry: Hey, Amanda. This is Adam. Were you referring to redevelopment or development?\nAmanda Sweitzer: I had thought you mentioned ramping up development along with acquisitions earlier in the call, but I could be mistaken?\nAdam Berry: Okay, yes. I'm happy to take that one. So on development, yes, given where our stock is trading, and given some opportunities that we're seeing out there now where we can make sense of accretive transactions. We are definitely looking at ramping up the development pipeline. I\u2019d say our main areas of focus would be primarily Northern California, Seattle. Those I see is probably the two best markets in that respect. But we're looking throughout our portfolio and throughout our footprint for deals.\nAmanda Sweitzer: And then, any change in terms of underwritten yield, do you think you could achieve on most projects versus pre-COVID levels?\nAdam Berry: So yes, good question. So what we're saying, we've underwritten several dozen deals over the last few months. The deals that we see going down primarily, cap rates have definitely compressed. So on the development side, we're seeing on unthreaded rents, return on cost at about 4 to 4.25 basically. So still a gap between where existing deals are trading, which are on the call, 3.25 to 3.5. We're going to look at numbers higher than that. We've not -- we wouldn't transact at a call to four development yield. But we're going to -- we would be looking at those 4.5 to high 4s.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with SMBC.\nRich Anderson: So I'm interested in this 17 supplemental or S 17(1) I should say, the migration trends that you referenced in your prepared remarks. Is that everything? Or is it predominantly, kind of close in like Monterey, Sacramento type of net migration or in migration? And does it net out people that are leaving California entirely this? Is this the full number, number one? And number two, what do you think about this 18%? Is this like a sort of a knee jerk response to working remotely but closer to the office? And that probably this is peeking out at that this time? And it starts to come back down? What's the ceiling on this graph do you think?\nBarbara Pak: Hi, Rich. This is Barbara. Yes, S 17.1, the 18% is a net number. So if you look back a year ago, we did have out migration, and that's what's showing in the negative 8%. And now we have people moving back and they're really coming from Sacramento and some of the outer line areas within California. But we're also noticing people moving in from college towns. So people, recent college grads are coming here for jobs, and it's really geographically dispersed. I mean, there's no discernible pattern from where they're coming from. It's kind of all over. And we do think that it does speak to the strength of our markets and people coming back and returning after the services have reopened. And the economy has reopened, now we're seeing the people return. And so we think it's a good sign and a good leading indicator. You should note that this Seattle in our portfolio looks similar as well. We're seeing a big in migration in Seattle as well. So we didn't show it here, but it's Bay Area and Seattle both have a similar chart, where there's a big influx. And I think you're seeing it in the rent growth that Angela spoke to and San Fran being up 11% in the CBD and NorCal and some of the other suburban markets in NorCal having bigger sequential rent growth more recently is partly due to this in migration.\nMichael Schall: Rich, can I add -- make a broader comment and I would say the broader comment is that the migration out of the West Coast, our view was largely driven by businesses being shut down, and putting people in the position of not having a paycheck, and effectively forcing them to move to somewhere else. And I know that that sort of -- it doesn't fit the narrative, the narrative is that oh, all these people wanted to leave California. I think that reality is completely different from that. And therefore, I go back to my basic comment, which is do we feel comfortable with the businesses that are here and with job growth going forward? And when you look at the components of that, okay, the hotels are now mostly open here on the West Coast, the restaurants are opening, and but we were still at 50% of capacity, a month or two ago. So, we opened completely on June 15. But that process has been relatively slow. And I think that's why job growth has lagged the U.S. as we've come out of the pandemic. But I guess the key point here is, most of the migration that occurred was not voluntary migration, it was caused by shutting down businesses. And then if you look at the flip side of that, are those businesses likely to reopen given, COVID is mostly behind us. And we feel 100% absolutely convinced that that will occur. And so, when we look -- we have some more broader information on migration in general, and a lot of the same things that we talked about a year or two ago, are still in place, the inflows into our markets tend to be the high cost, East Coast, metros, and the outflows tend to be into lower cost Western areas. So those trends really haven't changed all that much. But Barbara, this S 17.1 is trying to address specifically, the cadence of what's coming in and what's going out. And to your point, yes, of course, everything's in there, right here to try to push a narrative that is not reality, because if we do that, we're just going to shoot ourselves in the foot. So there's no evidence I think of Essex trying to be overly optimistic. And so we're trying to communicate what's really happening out there and what we're really seeing. So I guess I would --\nRich Anderson: Wasn't implying that I just, you mentioned sort of nearing areas, just want to make sure I was looking at the same thing. So the second question, 15, 20 years ago, Mike Schall and Keith Guericke were the heroes with 10% plus growth. And California was the place to be now, if you would, at that point, make some investments in this sunbelt? You'd be a hero, so the torch has passed, at least for now. But I assume your reversion of the mean, is your mind that certainly sounds like what you're saying, and do you see now is a particularly interesting time to be investing in your markets, for all the reasons you just described, but also, it's particularly special because of what's happened outside of California and Washington and what you think might come back? And that will be sort of a narrowing of the performance gap over the next several years.\nMichael Schall: Yes, I know it's great question Rich. And our boards pretty focused on this geographic diversity issue, and some of the challenges that we've had more recently, with respect to regulation and other things. But we don't want to get too far away from sort of this longer term pattern, because, it isn't like, we're going to grow, every year the same, conditions change, but we remain focused in our analysis on which areas have the highest CAGRs or rent growth over time. And it may surprise you, because, you can say the West Coast has dropped off of that. More recently, yes, but if you look back 15 years, because I have these numbers right out of our strategic plan in front of us, Seattle, lead, all the major markets, with a 5.6%, 15-year rent growth CAGR, from 2004 to 2019. So, to the pre-COVID level. And Northern California was pretty close to that. And we start going down the list, and certainly Boston and Miami are pretty attractive in that respect, as is northern New Jersey. But then there are a lot of markets that really have fallen well below that. And so, our whole thesis here has been, let's try to identify the things that promote long-term rent growth and let's invest in those markets. And we can as you know, we've looked at some things on the East Coast before and we'll continue doing that. But I guess, as we think about thing, let me just make a simple comparison, let's compare San Jose with Austin. And, their cities have about the same size, same population. Austin has about 20,000 multifamily units in construction, whereas San Jose has about 8000. We also don't produce very much housing are for sale housing in San Jose, and the median price is well over a million dollars. So as an apartment owner, we look at that and say, are we better off being in San Jose, or in Austin, and we conclude that it's better to be in San Jose. I mean, Austin has to get extraordinary amounts of growth over and above San Jose, which, of course, is driven by the tech companies, which are doing really well, and they hire a lot of people. So I guess I would say the bloom is not off the West Coast. Yes, we grew really fast from 2011 through 2016. When, by the way, we had job growth in the 4% to 5% range on the West Coast, and then it slowed down because of affordability issues, because you can't have rents grow twice as fast as incomes over long periods of time without creating an affordability issue. So there is a long-term, approach to the business. And I think that making vast portfolio decisions based on -- with all the unique circumstances and COVID would be misguided.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Neil Malkin with Capital One Securities.\nNeil Malkin: First, Mike, seems like in a lot of your prepared comments, the risks of COVID or the Delta variant, throwing a wrench into the recovery seemed like, maybe I'm understanding wrong, like, lower or something that you're really not maybe waiting a lot. And I guess my question on that part is, are you -- have you thought about, the Delta variants, how -- it's spreading a lot quicker. I think I've just seen some studies that say, like, vaccinated people can also read it as well, like, as easily as unvaccinated. And the markets that you're in are most likely to re-shutdown or re-implement restrictions. If cases rise, hospitalizations rise, et cetera. So, given, that's likely to happen as the fall comes, what kind of waiting do you kind of give to that notion of potential hiccup from reimposed restrictions?\nMichael Schall: Yes, it is a good question. And an important question. And I guess I would say, unfortunately, we have no way to really figure out what COVID might do going forward. And but we were definitely aware of the risks. One thing that I think is a little bit different in California, clearly we've got population densities that are pretty high. And so the risk of COVID is perhaps greater given that, and I think the government actually has done a very good job here of trying to promote vaccination rates in the Essex markets. And I think our vaccination rates are pretty high relative to the rest of the world. So the information I have is that the people with at least one shot and are 12 years and older, were in California, Washington about 82% vaccinated versus 67% for the U.S. So, I think that what happened here is, we tried to -- the government has tried to react to that risk by really pushing the vaccination rate, and they've done a very good job of that. So I think that lowers our exposure to some extent, but no doubt, areas with high population density, have different COVID risk than some of the other areas. And in this case, I think it's been dealt with effectively.\nNeil Malkin: Okay. That's a really helpful stat. Thank you for that. Other ones for me is, your previous comment talked about, not making, I guess rash decisions or thinking about things on a historic level? And I guess if you look at to large peers, people don't like to say names, but coastal players have recently announced pretty significant capital plans in Raleigh, Charlotte, Atlanta, Dallas, Austin. And I would imagine they have boards and a lot of stakeholders that they probably consulted with before they allocate a lot of capital. So, kind of with that being said, does I mean, do you give credence to that at all? I mean, does that -- does it make you think, maybe a little bit more about that? I mean, you referenced that permitting is down in your markets? And maybe that isn't, like, a good thing? Maybe that's like, a bad thing of people are focusing their growth prospects and capital elsewhere?\nMichael Schall: Yes, it's a good question and very valid. And this is why we spend so much time in our prepared remarks talking about on with the top 10 tech companies we created that index, so that we could keep our eye on, where are the open positions for the top 10 tech companies? Are they moving more to some of these other locations? And if so, what do we do about it? So, I didn't mean to imply actually that, we're so focused on, 15 years CAGRs of rent growth? So definitely, the historical information is important. But we're trying to supplement that in 100 different ways, with a ton of data sources that, that are either confirming or raising questions about what the future looks like. That's why Angela is talking about how much office construction, if you're going to build office buildings, presumably they're going to be employees in there. And we're going to need to build apartments to house those employees. I mean, these are all indicators of what's happening in the future. Keep an eye on the top 10 tech companies and their hiring trends. Again, both within California and outside of California. Super important in in that regard. Again, I go back to the industries, what are the driving industries? And what are the industries and sort of drive the entire machine? We can -- it's certainly not the hospitality and the restaurant workers that are driving it, they are really the result of a fluent wealthy areas, demanding services. And guess what they pay a lot more than in other places of the country because of that. And so I think what's happening here is, we're growing the process of all those people that were just displaced, from shutting down restaurants and other services. We're going to need to draw them back into the area. But I think that given the demand for those services and given the wealth that is been created here, by the tech community, by motion pictures, in Southern California, and other people that want to live near a beach, let's say, those services are in demand and they're going to come back at some -- it'll take a little bit of time, perhaps to do that. But again, we're trying to say, okay, let's stay focused on what are the drivers of the economy here. And again, as I look at it, and hopefully everyone will agree, tech is not going away or hasn't gone away. Certainly all the information that we've given out with respect to the tech companies over time, confirms the thesis that they're here, they're not going away, they continue to invest in our markets. Motion Pictures in Southern California, you can't shoot films where you require 50 to 100 people on a set during COVID, completely shut down demand for content not going away anytime soon. Therefore, there's a very good chance that that is going to resume and I can go try to go on beyond that. But I think that sets the point. If the drivers are intact, the things that follow, the demand for services, restaurants, et cetera will follow. And the thesis of the company in terms of job growth remains intact, and then if don't produce enough housing supply, I would view that as a good day.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.\nAlexander Goldfarb: So, Mike, two questions. First, the data on S 17, that is super. So if we were out in the Bay Area, like a month ago and saw San Francisco sort of empty. Are you seeing that with this 18% increase that now like San Francisco would be active and all of the apartment REITs that have reported this quarter, who have all shown the San Francisco to be the weak link that will -- you're saying that we will see that changed substantially over the next few quarters?\nMichael Schall: Alex, so you're referring to be this -- move it back to the inner Bay Area portfolio on 17.1?\nAlexander Goldfarb: Yes.\nMichael Schall: Well, I would say that the trend has reversed and move it back to the Bay Area has begun. I would \u2013 yes, I caveat that, I think most of that is the service businesses, restaurants and leisure hospitality is the leader in terms of jobs coming back that was the area that was most severely disconnected during the pandemic. But and then we have coming out us in the not too distant future the tech companies and the return to office program. So I think if that continues that trend, and again, there are a lot of restaurants that converted to take-out-only mode. I think we'll go back to a more normal type of situation where those restaurant workers continue to come back as well. So yeah, I think it's mending not as fast as we want to, again I go back to the initial premise, which is we've gotten all the rents back to where they were pre-COVID with half the employment. I think that's a pretty powerful statement.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. If I'm just trying, I guess, Mike, if you look at like Manhattan, I know you guys are not in New York City. But the city came back a lot quicker than many expected even though work from home, only whatever 20% of buildings have people in them. But city rents and the occupancy rates have rebounded strongly, whereas San Francisco and Seattle Downtown respectively, we're still lagging. So I guess I'm curious if your view is that within a few quarters, we will see the downtown of San Francisco and downtown of Seattle rebound strongly like we've seen in New York based on what you guys are showing in this attachment S 17.\nMichael Schall: Yes, it's a good question, Alex. So, New York, if you look at trailing three month of job growth. In New York, it was 10.2%, San Francisco was 5.2% and San Jose was 5.2%. So you have a pretty dramatic underperformance with respect to overall job growth. So I attribute that to again the West Coast needing to open up yet. We were still well into June at like 50% of capacity in restaurants and that type of thing. Whereas I'm assuming that New York. I don't know exactly what they did, but it is something to cause a fairly dramatic difference in terms of their resurgence and employment that hasn't happened yet on the West Coast, I think it's coming, but we're just a little bit slower than some of the other metros, including New York.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then, the second question, Barb, on the guidance, you said that because of the mismatch in terms of accelerated debt and preferred equity, redemptions versus what you guys can put out. There is about a $0.10 drag. So is that $0.10 only in NAREIT FFO, but not in company FFO or is it in both?\nBarbara Pak: It\u2019s in both. Could the prepayment penalties or fees that we receive this year about $7.5 million. Those are only internal FFO not in core FFO. But what I'm referring to is just a timing issue. We've been redeemed gotten money back early. So we don't have any of the interest income from those investments. And we haven't put any money back to work and so that's the $0.10 that I'm referring to.\nMichael Schall: We're looking at -- since that prepayment penalty is just really compensated us for having our money outstanding for a certain period of time, I'm advocating with Barb to change out so that it's not a non-core item because it's really -- we have a minimum earned preferred return and unfortunately, it's showing up in the non-core category rather than core.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Yes, that, Mike -- that was going to be my point. You guys are very productive on this and whether you get paid out over time or you get it redeemed early, but they pay up and pay a penalty for that that is core part of your business. So that was my question is why you would exclude the positives that come from this platform and I mean it sounds like you guys are having that internal debate. But I mean you're successful at it and no point in not really showcasing the earnings potential there.\nBarbara Pak: Yes. We have looked at it. We have a sense of follow GAAP accounting rules and so it's more complicated than it appears on the surface. But yes, there is an internal debate internally. But what we booked year-to-date has all been non-core for the prepayment fee.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.\nJohn Kim: Thank you. Regarding Northern California and the recovery. I think, Angela mentioned in the prepared remarks that July effective rents are still 8% below pre-COVID levels and I'm not sure if that was a market rent concept or for Essex. But I was wondering if you're going against easier comps given you were more aggressive on concessions beginning in the third quarter last year. And if the recovery could be faster than we think.\nMichael Schall: Yes, I'll let Angela to comment on the number for San Jose. But I would say what's happened here is, and we had colors on previous calls that have said hey, with negative job growth, how are you able to maintain high levels of occupancy in the cities. And obviously, a great question and the answer is that was of course that we drew people because the price point was lower, we drew people from other places into some of the better locations. So they improved their location given lower rents and so now you look at this equation, 96% occupied people starting to come back and there is no availability and therefore market rents are doing what they're doing. So I think a lot of this is really driven by our strategy during the pandemic and now it will be interesting to see what happens over the next couple of years because with market rents now back to where they were pre-pandemic level, what is the movement within the portfolio yield, both in and out of those locations that have much higher rents. So in the case of San Jose. San Francisco and Oakland, there is still substantially below the prior rent. So there's still reason to believe that those people that moved in given lower rents will stay, but that may uncouple over the next several years.\nJohn Kim: And so, was that 8% figure that Angela quoted was that for Essex or the market overall?\nAngela Kleiman: But that was for Essex.\nJohn Kim: Okay. Mike, you mentioned cap rates in your markets are low to mid 3%, which sounds like it's compressed about 50 basis points at least from last quarter. Can you comment on the assumptions that you think the market is placing now that's changed whether it's rental growth or exit cap rate and whether or not you agree with those assumptions or I believe the rationale?\nMichael Schall: I'll start with the comment and the comparison in the last quarter and then flip to Adam to talk about cap rates more generally, but I think last quarter what we said was in some of the hard-hit areas that buyers will performing some rent recovery. So it probably wasn't a whole 50 basis point reduction. It was really that they were using really the current net effective rents. They were assuming a bit higher rent level. So that reconciles part of that. But Adam, you want to talk about cap rates in general?\nAdam Berry: Yes, sure. So I think the general assumption that buyers are making is that there will be a full recovery. And by that, I mean with rents greater than pre-pandemic levels. And we're already seeing those rents that we've already talked about during the call. So it's in the low threes, I think pretty robust rent growth over the next few years. And then probably knowing out is what I -- is the various people, I've talked to that with our modeling and then non-exit caps. I think this is as aggressive as ever. So I don't think there's much assumption that there is a big expansion on the exit side. So underwriting has definitely gotten more aggressive.\nJohn Kim: Is there a big difference between your markets or urban versus suburban?\nMichael Schall: Yes, good question. So going kind of north to south, Seattle, we've actually seen a pretty big pickup in transactional volume and that's probably among the most aggressive markets that we're seeing in the CBDs on kind of current net effective rents, we're seeing high-twos to low-threes and in the markets that really just too much of a hit on rents, we're seeing those like maybe in the 3.25 to 3.5 range and that is much more suburban outer markets. And then going down very little in Northern California is traded. So that the hard to really opine there, but it's in that probably low threes range and then down to San Diego, Orange County, those markets performed better from a rental aspects. So, those cap rates on current net effective aren't quite as low as what we've seen in those harder hit markets. So it's probably closer to that 3-4, 3-5 kind of range and very little in LA traded as well. So it's down in the kind of low threes but there is very few data points.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.\nBrad Heffern: On the federal funds, I think you mentioned in the prepared comments that there was a negligible amount received to-date and that there really isn't much in the guide either. I was curious if you had any figures around maybe what you have applications out for some sort of risk assessment of what you might receive on that?\nAngela Kleiman: Yes. Hi. Its Angela here. So out of, I think we reported that we have about $55 million of delinquencies out there and we've applied for about $18 million and to-date, we've received $4 million of it. So about 20 some percent recovery rate. As far as we could tell, it's really more of a slow going because California just has a more complicated and slower reimbursement process. So in our view, the $18 million. We don't view that $18 million as having significant risk from that perspective. The reason we didn't bake it into our guidance for this year is really the timing is the question and just given that the rate of the reimbursement has just been much slower. So that's really the key driver of why it's now in this year's guidance.\nBrad Heffern: Okay, got it. And that $4 million, I assume that's largely been this month just given you said there wasn't in the sort of negligible in the first half, is that right?\nAngela Kleiman: Yes. For the most part of this month.\nBrad Heffern: Okay, got it. And then just one administrative sort of one if I could, in the press release, there was a 6.3% blended rate number for July. But then in the commentary, I heard a 4.7 number, I just wanted to verify what those two things, we're talking about?\nAngela Kleiman: Sure. So the 4.7% is a sequential month-to-month. So what I was trying to do is provide a real time picture of what's happening in our markets. So comparing July to June of this month, it's already up sequentially 4.7% on a net effective basis. And so what's in our supplement, they blended lease rate is a year-over-year so that compares July of this year to July of last year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Kalmus with Zelman & Associates.\nAlex Kalmus: Looking at your Southern California occupancy is quite high and we've heard a lot this quarter from others that the delinquencies are in their portfolios or sort of concentrated in this part of the country. So I'm just curious, what would happen if -- once the moratoriums are up. Does that affect the occupancy levels on a physical basis in your mind, or how do you see that playing out there.?\nMichael Schall: Yes, this is Mike. It's a good question. Yes, we agree with the others that Southern California and really specifically Los Angeles is a big part of the delinquency, the largest part of the delinquency and therefore there is some question about what might happen, but it's not a huge percentage, and we expect to work with our residents to the extent we can. And so I don't think it will have a huge impact on occupancy overall. So, but it remains to be seen, because we can't envision exactly what that scenario is going to look like. And but it's just not enough, I think to really severely impact us.\nAlex Kalmus: Got it. Thank you very much. And just thinking about the regulations on your rent increases that are in place when you're sort of internally discussing the difference between holding occupancy or pushing rate. Is there any momentum to say you'd rather keep the base rates pretty high to then expand a little more there and maybe lose a little occupancy as a sacrifice or is still hold occupancy as a primary driver?\nMichael Schall: It's different by in each region and so there is a 1000 different pieces of that equation because there's been so much movement in rent. And so the answer is going to very varied by region, and so it's difficult to generalize throughout the portfolio. But we think that we will be able to work with residents. We've tried to do that in the past that will continue going on in the future and certainly with respect to any of the delinquency that's not covered by some of these programs to make good on the COVID-related delinquencies. We will try to work with our residents that as we have in the past. Again, it's a little bit difficult to try to figure out exactly what that means from different areas because sets of regulations and a variety of different places from emergency orders to state rent control and the like. And so it's sort of a case-by-case basis. It's difficult to generalize.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors.\nJohn Pawlowski: Adam, I appreciate on the cap rate commentary. I'm trying to square there is really low cap rates to the commentary about ramping or being more positive on external growth because from the cap rates quoted feels like you guys are trading at NAV discount. So can you maybe just help square the external growth appetite and the prevailing private market pricing.\nAdam Berry: Sure. Yes, I mean you hit the nail on the head. It's the reason why we haven't been super active on the external growth side, but most of the transactions that have gone down and have not been accretive and to your point from an NAV standpoint not accretive as well. We're seeing a few more opportunities out there that will fit and our stock is reasonably up although still I'd say when you're looking at the low threes that's still that puts us in the trading below NAV range. So we are underwriting everything being more aggressive, where we feel like we can make a difference on growth accretion as well as FFO. But I guess you that. that's why we haven't done much so far.\nMichael Schall: John, I would add to that. This is Mike. Obviously, I would add that we're closer now than we were 30 year or 45 days ago somewhere. We're getting close. I mean debt rates have come down quite substantially as you know, and so there at least is a hope that we will be more active, we are looking at a lot of deals, Adam\u2019s looking at a lot of deals. And so we're pricing things out and trying to make the numbers work and again we're going to remain disciplined to NAV of the company versus what we're seeing out there in the transaction area. We picked up the fundamental behind the success of the company over long periods of time.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. Now understood things are moving quickly. Maybe just Adam or Mike, pace of prevailing private market pricing today, if you had to double down on the market., you had to exit the market, what are the kind of the top and bottom fix.\nMichael Schall: Yes, I'll let Adam deal with that one.\nAdam Berry: Good question. Yes. Thanks, John. So double down. I'm a big fan of Seattle in general. I mean I would say East side especially given the jobs picture there. Even though supply is slightly elevated, I think the jobs picture there is significant and it's a lot of tailwinds. To exit a market, you have all of our markets, but maybe [indiscernible].\nMichael Schall: So we're definitely interested in actually to have -- that's one property.\nAdam Berry: I joke. Yes. Ventura has had a pretty good run here as of late and it continues to do fine but again if we had to pick a market. But like I said, we are focused on our entire footprint and so we'll go in where we see opportunities.\nOperator: There are no other questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks.\nMichael Schall: Okay, very good. Thank you, Doug. Appreciate that. And I want to thank everyone for joining us on the call today. I appreciate your time and we know we covered a lot of ground. If there are any follow-up questions, don't hesitate to reach out to us and we thought it was a great dialog and we look forward to seeing many of you hopefully at a conference and in-person in the near future. Thanks for joining the call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Schall",
            "content": "Thank you for joining us today, and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. Angela Kleiman and Barbara Pak will follow me with prepared remarks and Adam Berry is here for Q&A. On today's call, I will start with our second quarter results which were driven by a strengthening economy and positive [indiscernible] underly a robust recovery on the West Coast. I will also discuss the status of reopening the West Coast economies and related factors, concluding with an overview of the West Coast Department Transaction Markets and Investments. Our second quarter results were ahead of our initial expectations entering the year as the economic recovery from the pandemic occurred faster than we expected. With a strong economy and high vaccination rates, we are now confident that the worst of the pandemic related impacts are behind us. As noted on previous calls, our strategy during the pandemic was to maintain high occupancy and scheduled rent, both necessary for rapid recovery. To that end, net effective rents surged during the second quarter, along with year-over-year improvement in occupancy, other income and delinquency. The recovery in net effective rents continued unabated in July and we are now pleased to announce the July net effective rents for the Essex portfolio have now surpassed pre-pandemic levels, with our suburban markets leading the way while the downtowns are improving, but still generally below pre-pandemic levels. Obviously, these higher rents will be converted into revenue as leases turned and Angela will provide additional details in a moment. Having passed the midpoint of 2021 and looking forward, we made a second set of positive revisions to our West Coast market forecast which can be found on Page S 17 of the supplemental. Driving the changes is an increase in 2021 GDP and job growth estimates to 7% and 5%, up from 4.3% and 3.2% respectively from our initial forecast. As a result, we now expect our average 2021 net effective rent growth to improve to minus 0.9% from minus 1.9% from the beginning of the year. To put this into perspective, consider that our net effective rents were down about 9% year-over-year in Q1 2021, given our current expectation of minus 0.9% rent growth for the year, year-over-year net effective market rents are now forecasted to increase about 6% in the fourth quarter of 2021. Cash delinquencies were up modestly on a sequential basis at 2.6% of scheduled rent for the quarter and well above our 30-year average delinquency rate of 30 to 40 basis points. The American rescue plan of 2021 provides funding for emergency rental assistance, which was allocated to the states for distribution to renters for pandemic related delinquencies. Through the second quarter collections of delinquent rents from the American rescue plan were negligible, as the pace of processing reimbursements has been slow since the program launched in March. We expect that to improve in the coming months. We expect delinquency rates to return to normal levels over time, as more workers enter the workforce and eviction protections lapse on September 30 in both California and Washington. At this point, only about 7 million of the 55 million in delinquent rent shown on Page S 16 of the supplemental has been recorded as revenue. Given uncertainty about the timing of collections, no additional revenues are contemplated in our financial guidance. Even with the approved job and economic outlook, the reopening process was gradual through the second quarter, with full reopening declared in mid and late June for California and Washington respectively. The unemployment rate was still 6.5% in the Essex markets as of May 2021. underperforming the nation. Through Q2, we have regained about half of the jobs lost in the early months of the pandemic. Employment in the Essex markets dropped over 15% in April 2020 and while job growth in our markets outpaced the nation in the second quarter, we're still 7.9% below pre-pandemic employment compared to 4.4% for the U.S. overall. We see the gap is an opportunity for growth to continue in the coming months as we benefit from the full reopening of the West Coast economies. We believe that many workers that exited the primary employment centers during pandemic related shutdowns and work from home programs will return as businesses reopen and resume expansion that was placed on hold during the pandemic. As we proceed through the summer months, we edge closer to the targeted office reopening date set by most large tech employers in early September. As recent reports about Apple and Google suggest the COVID-19 Delta variant could lead to temporary delays in this reopening process, our survey of job openings in the Essex markets for the largest tech companies continues to be very strong as we report 33,000 job openings as of July, a 99% increase over last year's [indiscernible]. New venture capital investment has set a record pace this year with Essex markets once again leading with respect to funds invested providing growth capital that supports future jobs. Generally, economic sectors that fell the furthest during the pandemic are now positioned for the strongest recovery in the reopening process led by restaurants, hotels, entertainment venues travel and so many. Returned to office plans which remain focused on hybrid approaches will continue to draw employees closer to corporate offices. Given that many workers won't be required to be in the office on a full time basis, we expect average commute distances to increase. As we highlight on Page S 17.1 of our supplemental, this transition has already started in recent months, as our hardest hit markets in the Bay Area once again experienced net positive migration from beyond the NorCal region. In particular, since the end of Q1, the sub markets surrounding San Francisco Bay have seen positive net migration that represents 18% of total move outs over the trailing three months compared to minus 8% a year ago. These inflows are led by residents returning from adjacent metros such as Sacramento and the Monterey Peninsula, as well as renewed flow of recent graduates arriving from college towns across the country, a notable positive turnaround from last year. In Seattle CBD, we've seen similar or even stronger recent inflows and were likewise experiencing a strong market rent recovery. On the supply outlet, we provided our semi-annual update to our 2021 forecasts on S 17 of the supplemental, with slight increases to 2021 supply as COVID related construction delays shifted incremental units from late 2020 into 2021. We expect modestly fewer apartment deliveries in the second half of 2021, with more significant declines in Los Angeles and Oakland. While it is still too early to quantify recent volatility in lumber prices and shortages for building materials may impact construction starts and the timing of deliveries in subsequent years, multifamily permitting activity in Essex markets also continues to trend favorably declining 200 basis points on a trailing 12-month basis as of May 2021, compared to the national average, which grew 230 basis points. Median single family home prices in Essex markets continued upward in California and Seattle grew 18% and 21% respectively on a trailing three-month basis. The escalating cost of homeownership combined with greater rental affordability from the pandemic have increased the financial incentive to rent. We suspect these trends will continue given muted single-family supply and limited permitting activity and believe these factors will be a key differentiator for our markets in the coming years compared to many U.S. markets with greater housing supply. Turning to apartment transactions. activity has steadily accelerated since the start of the year, with the majority of apartment trades occurring in the low to mid 3% cap rate range based on current rents. Generally, investors anticipate a robust rent recovery, especially in markets where current rents are substantially below pre-pandemic levels. With the recent improvement in our cost of capital, we have turned our focus once again to acquisitions and development while remaining disciplined with respect to FFO accretion targets. With respect to our preferred equity program, we continue to see new deals although the market is becoming more competitive. Lower cap rates from pre-pandemic levels have produced higher than anticipated market valuations which in turn has resulted in higher levels of early redemption. That concludes my comments. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to our COO, Angela Kleiman. Hi, Rich. It's Michael. I think I'll handle that one. And others may want to comment as well. But I think we feel really very good about what's happening here. Noted in my comments that we're fully recovered with respect to market rents, versus pre-pandemic levels, while only recovered about half the job so far, so that I think -- that's a powerful place to start. And if we look around the West Coast, we feel great about what's happening. And we expect good times to continue that, consumer is super optimistic. They've saved money via COVID versus COVID, by not traveling and a variety of other things. So millennials are forming households. And there's a lot of hiring here on the West Coast. So that's why we talk about the top 10 tech companies and how many open positions they have, they've come a long way in the past year, after what we perceived as them pulling back amid COVID, on their expansion plans, I think that they're now turning that corner, or have turned that corner hiring more people pursuing things that they put on hold a year ago. And so everything feels like it's in good order at this point in time. As you go to the cities, the main driver of job growth at this point in time has been the recovery of all the industries that have been so dramatically affected a year ago, including the leisure, hospitality, restaurants, filming in Southern California, et cetera. And as we look at the world, we're looking at, whether we believe these industries are poised for future growth and we think absolutely they are we think that, we're in a fluid areas, a fluid areas demand services, you're starting to see those services come back in terms of restaurants and a variety of other areas. And so we see this turning around nicely. And again, I wouldn't have expected to be fully back with respective rents at a time when we've only recovered about half the jobs that we lost. Make sense? It's a good question. And Barbara -- look at me very strangely, if we start talking about 22 at this point in time. So and how we are, we tend to be pretty careful in terms of guidance. And so we don't want to go too far out there. But I would say that, I would expect, certainly the return to office to be a good thing for the downtown locations, because most of the top 10 tech companies or most of tech companies in general have announced a hybrid type of approach, which means that people are going to have to be closer to the offices to show up let's say plus or minus three times per week. As a result of that, the people that move to the Hinterlands, the most suburban parts of our portfolio probably are going to need to come back. And I think about Ventura don't want to pick on Ventura, because it's done great. But, it's a long way on a commute pattern from Ventura into the where the jobs are in LA. And I don't think people are even going to want to do that three times a week. So I think that kind of frames the dynamics, those that had a year, given the pandemic to make a different choice about where to live, I think will likely make a different choice going forward, now that there's more clarity about what the company is going to do with respect to their work from home or return to office programs. I'll start. The second half of the year, as each -- we have to turn leases in order to impact our same-store or our revenue. And so if you get toward the end of the year, it becomes less relevant and more relevant, obviously, next year. So, take a transaction in October, you only have three months of that new lease in 2021. The rest of this is going to be in 2022. So there's an inherent lagging, concept with respect to what's going on with marker rents with Angela just talked about versus how it shows up on the on the income statement. So I think that's important, in terms of just looking at market rents. We tried to provide a little bit of color on that. And with respect to S 17, is what we're trying to get out that, overall, our economic rent growth on S 17 is at minus 0.9%. And that's a 1/12 of every month throughout the year. So January 2021, versus January 2020, plus February through the year divided by 12, is what that number represents. So we started the year at a rate, in the minus nine to minus 10% range. And that implies to get minus 0.9%, on S 17, that the fourth quarter would be plus 6%. And that does not anticipate a lot of rent growth between now and then, which is pretty typical, we typically hit the peak of market rents in July, at the end of the peak lease season, and then flattens out for the rest of the year. So that's what's assumed in those numbers. Yes. This is Mike. And I agree with you, we did not -- we assume more or less the typical, trend with respect to market rents. So kind of peaking in July and not a lot of growth for the rest of the year. As we think about it, however, there are some things that are different, for example, will the tech companies continue hiring normally, what happens is hiring tails off at the end of the year, companies get business plans at the -- toward the third, fourth quarter, and then they start implementing them in the first quarter. That's what really drives the peak leasing season. So the question here is, will companies continue hiring at a higher level given COVID than they have in the past. I think there's a very good chance that could happen. I also, this work from home and returned to office concept could have an impact on that as well, if you have more people are moving back into the more urban areas from -- people that were displaced, as California and Washington were shutting down a year ago. If those people continue to come back, later this year that could possibly push rents higher in the second part of the year. So we've, again assumed based on our experience, and what typically happens to normal curve with respect to rents, but there are some things that are different here. And so we could end up with being surprised to the positive side. Rich, can I add -- make a broader comment and I would say the broader comment is that the migration out of the West Coast, our view was largely driven by businesses being shut down, and putting people in the position of not having a paycheck, and effectively forcing them to move to somewhere else. And I know that that sort of -- it doesn't fit the narrative, the narrative is that oh, all these people wanted to leave California. I think that reality is completely different from that. And therefore, I go back to my basic comment, which is do we feel comfortable with the businesses that are here and with job growth going forward? And when you look at the components of that, okay, the hotels are now mostly open here on the West Coast, the restaurants are opening, and but we were still at 50% of capacity, a month or two ago. So, we opened completely on June 15. But that process has been relatively slow. And I think that's why job growth has lagged the U.S. as we've come out of the pandemic. But I guess the key point here is, most of the migration that occurred was not voluntary migration, it was caused by shutting down businesses. And then if you look at the flip side of that, are those businesses likely to reopen given, COVID is mostly behind us. And we feel 100% absolutely convinced that that will occur. And so, when we look -- we have some more broader information on migration in general, and a lot of the same things that we talked about a year or two ago, are still in place, the inflows into our markets tend to be the high cost, East Coast, metros, and the outflows tend to be into lower cost Western areas. So those trends really haven't changed all that much. But Barbara, this S 17.1 is trying to address specifically, the cadence of what's coming in and what's going out. And to your point, yes, of course, everything's in there, right here to try to push a narrative that is not reality, because if we do that, we're just going to shoot ourselves in the foot. So there's no evidence I think of Essex trying to be overly optimistic. And so we're trying to communicate what's really happening out there and what we're really seeing. So I guess I would -- Yes, I know it's great question Rich. And our boards pretty focused on this geographic diversity issue, and some of the challenges that we've had more recently, with respect to regulation and other things. But we don't want to get too far away from sort of this longer term pattern, because, it isn't like, we're going to grow, every year the same, conditions change, but we remain focused in our analysis on which areas have the highest CAGRs or rent growth over time. And it may surprise you, because, you can say the West Coast has dropped off of that. More recently, yes, but if you look back 15 years, because I have these numbers right out of our strategic plan in front of us, Seattle, lead, all the major markets, with a 5.6%, 15-year rent growth CAGR, from 2004 to 2019. So, to the pre-COVID level. And Northern California was pretty close to that. And we start going down the list, and certainly Boston and Miami are pretty attractive in that respect, as is northern New Jersey. But then there are a lot of markets that really have fallen well below that. And so, our whole thesis here has been, let's try to identify the things that promote long-term rent growth and let's invest in those markets. And we can as you know, we've looked at some things on the East Coast before and we'll continue doing that. But I guess, as we think about thing, let me just make a simple comparison, let's compare San Jose with Austin. And, their cities have about the same size, same population. Austin has about 20,000 multifamily units in construction, whereas San Jose has about 8000. We also don't produce very much housing are for sale housing in San Jose, and the median price is well over a million dollars. So as an apartment owner, we look at that and say, are we better off being in San Jose, or in Austin, and we conclude that it's better to be in San Jose. I mean, Austin has to get extraordinary amounts of growth over and above San Jose, which, of course, is driven by the tech companies, which are doing really well, and they hire a lot of people. So I guess I would say the bloom is not off the West Coast. Yes, we grew really fast from 2011 through 2016. When, by the way, we had job growth in the 4% to 5% range on the West Coast, and then it slowed down because of affordability issues, because you can't have rents grow twice as fast as incomes over long periods of time without creating an affordability issue. So there is a long-term, approach to the business. And I think that making vast portfolio decisions based on -- with all the unique circumstances and COVID would be misguided. Yes, it is a good question. And an important question. And I guess I would say, unfortunately, we have no way to really figure out what COVID might do going forward. And but we were definitely aware of the risks. One thing that I think is a little bit different in California, clearly we've got population densities that are pretty high. And so the risk of COVID is perhaps greater given that, and I think the government actually has done a very good job here of trying to promote vaccination rates in the Essex markets. And I think our vaccination rates are pretty high relative to the rest of the world. So the information I have is that the people with at least one shot and are 12 years and older, were in California, Washington about 82% vaccinated versus 67% for the U.S. So, I think that what happened here is, we tried to -- the government has tried to react to that risk by really pushing the vaccination rate, and they've done a very good job of that. So I think that lowers our exposure to some extent, but no doubt, areas with high population density, have different COVID risk than some of the other areas. And in this case, I think it's been dealt with effectively. Yes, it's a good question and very valid. And this is why we spend so much time in our prepared remarks talking about on with the top 10 tech companies we created that index, so that we could keep our eye on, where are the open positions for the top 10 tech companies? Are they moving more to some of these other locations? And if so, what do we do about it? So, I didn't mean to imply actually that, we're so focused on, 15 years CAGRs of rent growth? So definitely, the historical information is important. But we're trying to supplement that in 100 different ways, with a ton of data sources that, that are either confirming or raising questions about what the future looks like. That's why Angela is talking about how much office construction, if you're going to build office buildings, presumably they're going to be employees in there. And we're going to need to build apartments to house those employees. I mean, these are all indicators of what's happening in the future. Keep an eye on the top 10 tech companies and their hiring trends. Again, both within California and outside of California. Super important in in that regard. Again, I go back to the industries, what are the driving industries? And what are the industries and sort of drive the entire machine? We can -- it's certainly not the hospitality and the restaurant workers that are driving it, they are really the result of a fluent wealthy areas, demanding services. And guess what they pay a lot more than in other places of the country because of that. And so I think what's happening here is, we're growing the process of all those people that were just displaced, from shutting down restaurants and other services. We're going to need to draw them back into the area. But I think that given the demand for those services and given the wealth that is been created here, by the tech community, by motion pictures, in Southern California, and other people that want to live near a beach, let's say, those services are in demand and they're going to come back at some -- it'll take a little bit of time, perhaps to do that. But again, we're trying to say, okay, let's stay focused on what are the drivers of the economy here. And again, as I look at it, and hopefully everyone will agree, tech is not going away or hasn't gone away. Certainly all the information that we've given out with respect to the tech companies over time, confirms the thesis that they're here, they're not going away, they continue to invest in our markets. Motion Pictures in Southern California, you can't shoot films where you require 50 to 100 people on a set during COVID, completely shut down demand for content not going away anytime soon. Therefore, there's a very good chance that that is going to resume and I can go try to go on beyond that. But I think that sets the point. If the drivers are intact, the things that follow, the demand for services, restaurants, et cetera will follow. And the thesis of the company in terms of job growth remains intact, and then if don't produce enough housing supply, I would view that as a good day. Alex, so you're referring to be this -- move it back to the inner Bay Area portfolio on 17.1? Well, I would say that the trend has reversed and move it back to the Bay Area has begun. I would \u2013 yes, I caveat that, I think most of that is the service businesses, restaurants and leisure hospitality is the leader in terms of jobs coming back that was the area that was most severely disconnected during the pandemic. But and then we have coming out us in the not too distant future the tech companies and the return to office program. So I think if that continues that trend, and again, there are a lot of restaurants that converted to take-out-only mode. I think we'll go back to a more normal type of situation where those restaurant workers continue to come back as well. So yeah, I think it's mending not as fast as we want to, again I go back to the initial premise, which is we've gotten all the rents back to where they were pre-COVID with half the employment. I think that's a pretty powerful statement. Yes, it's a good question, Alex. So, New York, if you look at trailing three month of job growth. In New York, it was 10.2%, San Francisco was 5.2% and San Jose was 5.2%. So you have a pretty dramatic underperformance with respect to overall job growth. So I attribute that to again the West Coast needing to open up yet. We were still well into June at like 50% of capacity in restaurants and that type of thing. Whereas I'm assuming that New York. I don't know exactly what they did, but it is something to cause a fairly dramatic difference in terms of their resurgence and employment that hasn't happened yet on the West Coast, I think it's coming, but we're just a little bit slower than some of the other metros, including New York. We're looking at -- since that prepayment penalty is just really compensated us for having our money outstanding for a certain period of time, I'm advocating with Barb to change out so that it's not a non-core item because it's really -- we have a minimum earned preferred return and unfortunately, it's showing up in the non-core category rather than core. Yes, I'll let Angela to comment on the number for San Jose. But I would say what's happened here is, and we had colors on previous calls that have said hey, with negative job growth, how are you able to maintain high levels of occupancy in the cities. And obviously, a great question and the answer is that was of course that we drew people because the price point was lower, we drew people from other places into some of the better locations. So they improved their location given lower rents and so now you look at this equation, 96% occupied people starting to come back and there is no availability and therefore market rents are doing what they're doing. So I think a lot of this is really driven by our strategy during the pandemic and now it will be interesting to see what happens over the next couple of years because with market rents now back to where they were pre-pandemic level, what is the movement within the portfolio yield, both in and out of those locations that have much higher rents. So in the case of San Jose. San Francisco and Oakland, there is still substantially below the prior rent. So there's still reason to believe that those people that moved in given lower rents will stay, but that may uncouple over the next several years. I'll start with the comment and the comparison in the last quarter and then flip to Adam to talk about cap rates more generally, but I think last quarter what we said was in some of the hard-hit areas that buyers will performing some rent recovery. So it probably wasn't a whole 50 basis point reduction. It was really that they were using really the current net effective rents. They were assuming a bit higher rent level. So that reconciles part of that. But Adam, you want to talk about cap rates in general? Yes, good question. So going kind of north to south, Seattle, we've actually seen a pretty big pickup in transactional volume and that's probably among the most aggressive markets that we're seeing in the CBDs on kind of current net effective rents, we're seeing high-twos to low-threes and in the markets that really just too much of a hit on rents, we're seeing those like maybe in the 3.25 to 3.5 range and that is much more suburban outer markets. And then going down very little in Northern California is traded. So that the hard to really opine there, but it's in that probably low threes range and then down to San Diego, Orange County, those markets performed better from a rental aspects. So, those cap rates on current net effective aren't quite as low as what we've seen in those harder hit markets. So it's probably closer to that 3-4, 3-5 kind of range and very little in LA traded as well. So it's down in the kind of low threes but there is very few data points. Yes, this is Mike. It's a good question. Yes, we agree with the others that Southern California and really specifically Los Angeles is a big part of the delinquency, the largest part of the delinquency and therefore there is some question about what might happen, but it's not a huge percentage, and we expect to work with our residents to the extent we can. And so I don't think it will have a huge impact on occupancy overall. So, but it remains to be seen, because we can't envision exactly what that scenario is going to look like. And but it's just not enough, I think to really severely impact us. It's different by in each region and so there is a 1000 different pieces of that equation because there's been so much movement in rent. And so the answer is going to very varied by region, and so it's difficult to generalize throughout the portfolio. But we think that we will be able to work with residents. We've tried to do that in the past that will continue going on in the future and certainly with respect to any of the delinquency that's not covered by some of these programs to make good on the COVID-related delinquencies. We will try to work with our residents that as we have in the past. Again, it's a little bit difficult to try to figure out exactly what that means from different areas because sets of regulations and a variety of different places from emergency orders to state rent control and the like. And so it's sort of a case-by-case basis. It's difficult to generalize. John, I would add to that. This is Mike. Obviously, I would add that we're closer now than we were 30 year or 45 days ago somewhere. We're getting close. I mean debt rates have come down quite substantially as you know, and so there at least is a hope that we will be more active, we are looking at a lot of deals, Adam's looking at a lot of deals. And so we're pricing things out and trying to make the numbers work and again we're going to remain disciplined to NAV of the company versus what we're seeing out there in the transaction area. We picked up the fundamental behind the success of the company over long periods of time. Yes, I'll let Adam deal with that one. So we're definitely interested in actually to have -- that's one property. Okay, very good. Thank you, Doug. Appreciate that. And I want to thank everyone for joining us on the call today. I appreciate your time and we know we covered a lot of ground. If there are any follow-up questions, don't hesitate to reach out to us and we thought it was a great dialog and we look forward to seeing many of you hopefully at a conference and in-person in the near future. Thanks for joining the call."

            "content": "Thanks, Mike. My comments today will focus on our second quarter results and current market dynamics. With the reopening of the West Coast economy the recovery has generated improvements in demand and thus pricing power. Our operating strategy during COVID to favor occupancy while adjusting concessions to maintain schedule rents enabled us to optimize rent growth concurrent with the increase in demand, resulting in same-store net effective rent growth of 8.3% since January 1, and most of this growth occurred in the second quarter. A key contributor of this accomplishment is the fantastic job by our operations team and responding quickly to this dynamic market environment. While market conditions have improved rapidly during our second quarter -- driving our second quarter results to exceed expectations. I would like to provide some context for why sequential same property revenues declined by 90 basis points compared to the first quarter. The two major factors that drove this decline were 50 basis points in delinquency and 50 basis points in concessions. Delinquency in the first quarter was temporarily lifted by the one-time unemployment disbursements from the stimulus funds, as expected in the second quarter, delinquency reverted back to 2.6% of schedule rents versus the 2.1% in the first quarter. On concessions, the nominal amount increased from higher volume of leases in the second quarter relative to the first quarter of this year. To be clear concessions in our markets have declined substantially and are virtually non-existent except for select CBD markets. Our average concession for the stabilized portfolio is under one week in the second quarter compared to over a week in the first quarter and over two weeks in the fourth quarter. Although concessions have generally improved in the second quarter, they remain elevated ranging from two and a half to three weeks in certain CBD, such as CBD LA, San Jose and Oakland. Given the extraordinary pandemic related volatility in rents and concessions over the past year and a half, I thought it would be insightful to provide an overview of the change in net effective rent compared to pre-COVID levels. As of this June, our same-store average net effective rent compared to March of last year was down by 3.1%. Since then, we have seen continued strength and based on preliminary July results, our average net effects are now 1.5% above pre-COVID levels. It is notable that this 1.5% portfolio average diverged regionally, with both Seattle and Southern California up 5.8%, 9.3%, respectively, while Northern California has yet to fully recover, with net effective rents currently at 8% below pre-COVID levels. On a sequential basis, net effective rents or new leases has improved rapidly throughout the second quarter and preliminary July rent increased 4.7% compared to the month of June, led by CBD San Francisco and CBD Seattle both up about 11%. Not surprisingly, these two markets were hit hardest during the pandemic and are now experiencing the most rapid growth. Moving on to office development activities, which we view as an indicator of future job growth and according the housing demand. In general, the areas along the West Coast was the greatest amount of office developments have been San Jose and Seattle. Currently San Jose has 8.1% of total office dock under construction and similarly Seattle has 7% of office stock under construction. Notable activities include Apple leasing an additional 700,000 square feet and LinkedIn announced recent plans to upgrade their existing office in Sunnyvale. In the Seattle region, Facebook expanded their Bellevue footprint by 330,000 square feet, and Amazon announced 1400 new web service jobs in Redlands. We expect in the long-term areas with higher office deliveries, such as San Jose and Seattle will have capacity for greater apartment supply without impacting rental rates. While these normal relationships were disrupted during the pandemic, we anticipate conditions to normalize in the coming quarters. Lastly, as the economic recovery continues to gain momentum, we have restarted both our apartment renovation programs and technology initiatives including actively enhancing the functionality of our mobile leasing platform and smart rent home automation. Thank you and I will now turn the call over the Barbara Pak. That's all right. All right. Well, in terms of the loss lease, we actually are in a much better position at a level even better than pre-COVID. So if we look at July lost lease for the Essex portfolio, it's now at 7.4%. And so and that, of course, varies, Seattle at the highest at about 12. Southern California, in the middle of the pack at about eight, and Northern California at the lowest as well, three and a half. Sure thing. Normally pre-COVID, our run rate was about in terms of units, about 4000 units a year. And what we did was scale back significantly last year. So second half of last year, we only renovated about 600 -- over 600 units, 650 units, so the target during the restart for the second half of this year is to double that. So say close to 1300 units this year. We are looking at a couple of large developments for the future -- for next year that will have no greater opportunities. But in terms of -- just the return on investments, we're actually looking at ranges pretty darn consistent with pre-COVID levels. And so while cost has gone up, but rents have gone up as well concurrently. So we think we're in a pretty good spot. They tend to range depending on the asset and the scope and the market but I'll give you a range that might be a little bit better than a hard number, they tend to range stay in the high single digits to the high double digits. So it's a pretty wide range. But that was for Essex. Yes. Hi. Its Angela here. So out of, I think we reported that we have about $55 million of delinquencies out there and we've applied for about $18 million and to-date, we've received $4 million of it. So about 20 some percent recovery rate. As far as we could tell, it's really more of a slow going because California just has a more complicated and slower reimbursement process. So in our view, the $18 million. We don't view that $18 million as having significant risk from that perspective. The reason we didn't bake it into our guidance for this year is really the timing is the question and just given that the rate of the reimbursement has just been much slower. So that's really the key driver of why it's now in this year's guidance. Yes. For the most part of this month. Sure. So the 4.7% is a sequential month-to-month. So what I was trying to do is provide a real time picture of what's happening in our markets. So comparing July to June of this month, it's already up sequentially 4.7% on a net effective basis. And so what's in our supplement, they blended lease rate is a year-over-year so that compares July of this year to July of last year."

            "name": "Barbara Pak",
            "content": "Thanks, Angela. I'll start with a few comments on our second quarter results, discuss changes to our full year guidance, followed by an update on our investments and the balance sheet. I'm pleased to report core FFO for the second quarter exceeded the midpoint of the revised range we provided during the NAREIT conference by $0.08 per share. The favorable results are primarily attributable to stronger same property revenues, higher commercial income and lower operating expenses. Of the $0.08, $0.03 relates to the timing of operating expenses and G&A spend, which is now forecasted to occur in the second half of the year. As Angela discussed, we are seeing stronger rent growth in our markets than we expected just a few months ago. As such, we are raising the full year midpoint of our same property revenue growth by 50 basis points to minus 1.4%. It should be noted this was the high-end of the revised range route provided in June. In addition, we have lowered our operating expense growth by 25 basis points at the midpoint due to lower taxes in the Seattle portfolio. All of this results in an improvement in same property NOI growth by 80 basis points at the midpoint to minus 3%. Year-to-date, we have revived the same property revenue growth at the midpoint up 110 basis points and NOI by 160 basis points. As it relates to full year core FFO, we are raising our midpoint by $0.09 per share to $12.33. This reflects the stronger operating results partially offset by the impact of the early redemptions of preferred equity investments, which I will discuss in a minute. Year-to-date, we have raised core FFO by $0.17 or 1.4%. Turning to the investment market, as we discussed on previous calls, strong demand for West Coast apartments and inexpensive debt financing has led to sales and recapitalization of several properties underlying our preferred equity and subordinated loan investments, resulting in several early redemptions. During the quarter, we received 36 million from an early redemption of a subordinated loan, which included 4.7 million in prepayment fees, which have been excluded from core FFO. Year-to-date, we have been redeemed on approximately 150 million of investment and expect that number could grow to approximately 250 million by year end. This is significantly above the high end of the range provided at the start of the year. However, this speaks to the high valuation apartment properties are commanding today, which is good for Essex and the net asset value of the company. As for new preferred equity investments, we have a healthy pipeline of accretive deals, and we are still on track to achieve our original guidance of 100 million to 150 million in the second half of the year. As a reminder, our original guidance assume new investments would match redemptions during the year. However, the timing mismatch between the higher level of early reductions, coupled with funding of new investments expected later this year has led to an approximate $0.10 per share drag on our FFO for the year. Moving to the balance sheet, we remain in a strong financial position due to refinancing over 1/3 of our debt over the past year and a half taking advantage of the low interest rate environment to reduce our weighted average rate by 70 basis points to 3.1% and lengthening our maturity profile by an additional two years. We currently have only 7% of our debt maturing through the end of 2023. Given our [indiscernible] maturity schedule, limited near term funding needs and ample liquidity, we are in a strong position to take advantage of opportunities as they arise. This concludes my prepared remarks. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions. Hi, Nic. This is Barbara. At this point, I think we factored that all in and based on what we know today. And already -- almost in August. So I think we factor that into the current guidance. So I'm not expecting any more redemptions at this point for the rest of the year. The only other thing I would add is, Lisa's resigning today, we'll have half an impact to the rent this year to our rent roll, and that will carry forward into next year, too. I mean, look at Angela mentioned, we had a strong July, and so that is going to only affect part of this year's numbers. Are we talking about lost lease? Hi, Rich. This is Barbara. Yes, S 17.1, the 18% is a net number. So if you look back a year ago, we did have out migration, and that's what's showing in the negative 8%. And now we have people moving back and they're really coming from Sacramento and some of the outer line areas within California. But we're also noticing people moving in from college towns. So people, recent college grads are coming here for jobs, and it's really geographically dispersed. I mean, there's no discernible pattern from where they're coming from. It's kind of all over. And we do think that it does speak to the strength of our markets and people coming back and returning after the services have reopened. And the economy has reopened, now we're seeing the people return. And so we think it's a good sign and a good leading indicator. You should note that this Seattle in our portfolio looks similar as well. We're seeing a big in migration in Seattle as well. So we didn't show it here, but it's Bay Area and Seattle both have a similar chart, where there's a big influx. And I think you're seeing it in the rent growth that Angela spoke to and San Fran being up 11% in the CBD and NorCal and some of the other suburban markets in NorCal having bigger sequential rent growth more recently is partly due to this in migration. It's in both. Could the prepayment penalties or fees that we receive this year about $7.5 million. Those are only internal FFO not in core FFO. But what I'm referring to is just a timing issue. We've been redeemed gotten money back early. So we don't have any of the interest income from those investments. And we haven't put any money back to work and so that's the $0.10 that I'm referring to. Yes. We have looked at it. We have a sense of follow GAAP accounting rules and so it's more complicated than it appears on the surface. But yes, there is an internal debate internally. But what we booked year-to-date has all been non-core for the prepayment fee."

            "content": "Hey, Nic. This is Adam. To answer your question, yes. We're seeing compression on cap rates. We're seeing -- it's a much more competitive market now with proceeds going well above where we're typically comfortable and rates going significantly below where we've been in the market. So to sum, yes, we are seeing the absolute compression on valuations. Hey, Amanda. This is Adam. Were you referring to redevelopment or development? Okay, yes. I'm happy to take that one. So on development, yes, given where our stock is trading, and given some opportunities that we're seeing out there now where we can make sense of accretive transactions. We are definitely looking at ramping up the development pipeline. I'd say our main areas of focus would be primarily Northern California, Seattle. Those I see is probably the two best markets in that respect. But we're looking throughout our portfolio and throughout our footprint for deals. So yes, good question. So what we're saying, we've underwritten several dozen deals over the last few months. The deals that we see going down primarily, cap rates have definitely compressed. So on the development side, we're seeing on unthreaded rents, return on cost at about 4 to 4.25 basically. So still a gap between where existing deals are trading, which are on the call, 3.25 to 3.5. We're going to look at numbers higher than that. We've not -- we wouldn't transact at a call to four development yield. But we're going to -- we would be looking at those 4.5 to high 4s. Yes, sure. So I think the general assumption that buyers are making is that there will be a full recovery. And by that, I mean with rents greater than pre-pandemic levels. And we're already seeing those rents that we've already talked about during the call. So it's in the low threes, I think pretty robust rent growth over the next few years. And then probably knowing out is what I -- is the various people, I've talked to that with our modeling and then non-exit caps. I think this is as aggressive as ever. So I don't think there's much assumption that there is a big expansion on the exit side. So underwriting has definitely gotten more aggressive. Sure. Yes, I mean you hit the nail on the head. It's the reason why we haven't been super active on the external growth side, but most of the transactions that have gone down and have not been accretive and to your point from an NAV standpoint not accretive as well. We're seeing a few more opportunities out there that will fit and our stock is reasonably up although still I'd say when you're looking at the low threes that's still that puts us in the trading below NAV range. So we are underwriting everything being more aggressive, where we feel like we can make a difference on growth accretion as well as FFO. But I guess you that. that's why we haven't done much so far. Good question. Yes. Thanks, John. So double down. I'm a big fan of Seattle in general. I mean I would say East side especially given the jobs picture there. Even though supply is slightly elevated, I think the jobs picture there is significant and it's a lot of tailwinds. To exit a market, you have all of our markets, but maybe [indiscernible]. I joke. Yes. Ventura has had a pretty good run here as of late and it continues to do fine but again if we had to pick a market. But like I said, we are focused on our entire footprint and so we'll go in where we see opportunities."

Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found on the company's filings with the SEC.  It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall. You may begin.\nMichael Schall: Thank you for joining us today, and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. Angela Kleiman and Barb Pak will follow me with prepared remarks; and Adam Berry, our Chief Investment Officer, is here for Q&A. I'll start today with our first quarter results and expectations for the remainder of the year, including factors that lead us to believe that 2021 will be a year of recovery from the pandemic and then conclude with an overview of the transaction market.  I am pleased to note that Essex was founded 50 years ago in 1971 by our Chairman, George Marcus, and we are very proud of all the company has accomplished. George remains keenly focused on the company's mission, strategy and business plan execution. I also want to recognize the extraordinary effort of the Essex team, which has allowed us to emerge from the pandemic in a position of strength and ready to seek opportunity that often comes from associated uncertainty. The Board and senior leadership team greatly appreciate this collaborative effort. Finally, the company's commitment to the balance sheet strength and a growing dividend was reaffirmed with our recent announcement of our 27th consecutive annual dividend increase.  Turning to our first quarter results. Severe lockdowns in California and Washington remained a headwind in the quarter after intensifying last November amid a surge in COVID cases and hospitalizations that has only recently abated. Our very strong results in the first quarter of 2020 and a plethora of pandemic-related regulations and associated job loss were significant impediments to the company's performance this past year, as reflected in this quarter's results, with same-property revenues and core FFO down 8.1% and 11.8%, respectively, compared to a year ago. On a sequential basis, same-property revenues improved by 10 basis points, driven by growth in several suburban areas and particularly in San Diego, Orange and Ventura counties of Southern California.  As noted in our earnings release, we reaffirmed our full year 2021 guidance ranges, and we continue to expect improvements in same-property revenue growth, driven by job growth and easier year-over-year comparisons. Apartment demand continues to be strongest in properties farthest from the urban centers and weakest in the cities, both being a function of new apartment supply and pandemic-related job losses. On a trailing 3-month basis as of March 2021, year-over-year job losses were 9.2% and 5.4%, respectively, for the Essex markets and the nation, marking significant progress compared to the 14% decline we saw in the Essex market shortly after the onset of the pandemic and also suggesting that our markets remain early in the recovery process.  Fortunately, the recovery of jobs appears to be accelerating as reflected in preliminary job losses for the month of March 2021, which were down 7.9% for the Essex markets and 4.4% for the nation. On a sequential basis, California and Washington outpaced the nation in March, gaining nearly 150,000 jobs, representing over 16% of the U.S. job growth with less than 13% of the employment base. As we suggested several quarters ago, we expect rents to recover on the West Coast as we recapture pandemic-related job losses that were directly impacted by shelter-in-place orders, including hospitality and service sectors, entertainment and filming and video production and tech jobs that were displaced to remote locations.  Hospitality and service jobs were disproportionately concentrated in the urban areas and wealthy suburbs. For the nation, jobs in hospitality and other services have recovered about 2/3 of their post COVID job losses. By comparison, to date, Essex metros have recovered less than 1/3 of these losses. Given the widespread recent reopening of California cities, these service sectors are again growing and their potential upside represents a promising differentiator for Essex markets over the next several quarters.  Film and video production was disrupted, once again by the COVID shutdowns over the winter months, followed more recently by a surge in film permit applications. Overall, production activity remains below normal for this time of year. However, data released last week from FilmLA highlighted a 45% month-over-month increase in film permit applications for March, as the industry benefited from the recent relaxation of stay at home measures in Los Angeles County. We expect the rebound in production to continue this year due to pent-up demand for content that has been disrupted due to COVID-19. This recovery should provide a positive tailwind for the industry and for rental demand in the LA market.  We are also pleased that many of the top tech companies have announced return to office plans supporting our belief that the hybrid model for offices will prevail with most employees spending a significant amount of time in the office for team building, collaboration, career advancement and related necessities. The largest tech employers in our markets had significantly reduced their hiring plans early in the pandemic, while also allowing many of their employees to work from home. With the cities largely shut down, many tech workers moved to suburban or rural locations or back home with their parents. This trend began to reverse late last year, and we expect to see further momentum in the coming quarters as more tech employers reopen their offices.  As before, we track the announcements of the largest tech companies, and we have provided a time line of planned office reopenings based on public disclosures on Slide S-17.1 of our supplemental. We also provide a graph indicating the strong recovery in job postings for the top 10 tech companies with open positions in the Essex markets now above pre-COVID levels. We also track the job locations for open positions, noting that about 57% of their U.S. job postings was California or Washington as the office location. As of last week, California and Washington have dispensed at least the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine to approximately 47% and 45% of their adult populations, respectively.  Overall, accelerating vaccine deployment and pent-up demand for services gives us confidence that we are now on a solid path to recovery. California's counties have begun to remove restrictions on commerce. And Governor Newsom recently announced that California is expected to effectively reopen on June 15, including key indoor and outdoor activities such as conventions and sporting events. These plans are subject to several protective measures tied to continued low hospitalization rates and sufficient vaccine supplies.  On the supply outlook, total housing permits, both single and multifamily, in our West Coast markets have declined 9.2% on a trailing 12-month basis compared to the national average increase of 6.4%. The national increase in permits is being driven by a 13.9% increase in single-family housing permits, mostly in markets with low barriers to entry and rising home prices. In California, the median price of a single-family home increased 12.4% year-over-year as of February. Normally, one would assume that higher home values would lead to increased production.  However, single-family permits in the Essex markets are down 7.7%, which we attribute to a challenging regulatory environment and limited land availability, ultimately leading to fewer deliveries in late '22 and 2023. With large increases in for-sale housing prices, down payments have increased and the transition from a renter to homeownership has become more challenging. At the same time, the combination of lower rents from the pandemic and higher average incomes in the Essex markets has improved apartment rental affordability. We have seen these forces in previous recoveries, and they often result in periods of higher-than-average rent growth.  Turning to the transaction market. We successfully sold 3 apartment communities in the first quarter for $275 million at values that were similar to the pre-COVID period when our consensus NAV was almost $300 per share. As a result, we use property sales proceeds to fund preferred equity investments and repurchase common stock, both accretive to per share core FFO and offsetting a portion of COVID-related NOI declines. The strong rebound in REIT valuations over the past 6 months makes stock buybacks less attractive today, and we are now looking for undervalued or mismanaged property in our core markets to grow externally.  There were relatively few property sales during the pandemic, and most were completed by highly motivated buyers using 1031 exchange proceeds and other sources of attractively priced capital. Several of our suburban markets have rent levels that have increased on a year-over-year basis, and recent transactions have priced in the high 3% cap rate range. In the hard hit cities, buyers appear to be looking beyond the COVID impacts with apartments selling near a 4% cap rate using pre-COVID rents and NOI, roughly equivalent to a cap rate in the low 3% range based on current rents.  Strong apartment values have led to a greater level of redemptions in our preferred equity portfolio, the impact of which Barb will discuss in a moment. As conditions normalize, we are starting to see more properties being listed for sale. The unprecedented changes and uncertainty experienced during the pandemic will likely lead to a robust apartment transaction market as property owners adjust their strategies going forward.  I will now turn the call over to our COO, Angela Kleiman.\nAngela Kleiman: Thanks, Mike. First, a special recognition to the Essex operating team for their continued focus on delivering solid results under these extraordinary conditions. Thank you for your efforts. As for my comments, I will focus the discussion on our first quarter results and current market dynamics. In general, our markets continue to improve as the economy gradually reopens with the vaccine rollouts, easing of COVID restrictions and the recent announcements for a phased or partial office reopening by the major employers, which has contributed to job growth.  Our goal amidst the pandemic was to focus on maintaining occupancy and managing scheduled rent, which will position us favorably for revenue growth in the future. Accordingly, we adjusted our concession strategy to match the improvements in demand, which has enabled our same-property revenues to perform slightly better than our expectations. We have been successful with this strategy. And as a result, we maintained occupancy with scheduled rents decline, representing only 3.2% of the 8.1% total revenue decline for the quarter.  You may recall the underlying fundamentals in the first quarter of last year consisted of a strong economic backdrop prior to the COVID pandemic. In fact, our first quarter year-over-year same-property revenue growth back then was 3.2%, with revenue levels at historical highs throughout the entire portfolio. The strength of first quarter last year created a more difficult year-over-year comparable, which is also the reason why our new lease rates declined by 9.7% in the first quarter, as shown on the S-16, compared to the fourth quarter where the new lease rate declined by 8.9%. Consistent with the discussion on our last earnings call, the year-over-year decline in our major markets was primarily attributed to a combination of job losses from the pandemic, particularly impacting urban CBDs, which also had a greater concentration of supply deliveries.  Here are a few key highlights of the first quarter year-over-year performance by markets. In Seattle, the 7% revenue decline was primarily driven by Seattle CBD, down 15.7%, whereas the remaining submarkets averaged a 5.2% decline. In Northern California, the 10.9% revenue decline was led by CBD, San Francisco and Oakland and San Mateo, averaging a 15.9% decline, contrasted with a 5% decline in Contra Costa County. In Southern California, the 5.8% revenue decline continues to be primarily driven by L.A. CBD and West L.A., which were down by an average of 13%, while our suburban Southern California submarkets of Ventura, Orange County and San Diego averaged a 2.1% decline.  As you can see, our suburban portfolio continues to significantly outperform the urban markets. On the other hand, there are signs of improvement in our tech-centric urban markets. For example, first quarter sequential financial occupancies in San Francisco and Seattle CBD increased by 2.7% and 4.2%, respectively. In addition, the sequential quarterly turnover rates declined at an average of 5.4% in these markets. We continue to anticipate that the urban CBD markets, particularly in downtown Seattle, Oakland and L.A., will remain impacted by greater concentration of supply deliveries, resulting in elevated level of concessions, which will moderate the recovery.  Although we typically do not place significant focus on sequential performance, because of the seasonality embedded in our business under normal market conditions, as we emerge from the pandemic, we view the sequential cost trend as a better indicator of our recovery progress. From this perspective, we have delivered 2 consecutive quarters of modest total same-property revenue growth, supported by comparable periods of job growth in our markets, which began in the fourth quarter of last year and has continued through the first quarter of this year.  More notable is the 110 basis points in sequential improvement of our average net effective market rent per unit, with Southern California continue to lead our portfolio growth. On average, new lease concessions improved from low over 2 weeks in the fourth quarter to about 1.5 weeks in the first quarter. While the magnitude may vary, this trend is in line with our forecast, where we had expected that market rents in our portfolio, on average, would trough between the fourth quarter and the first quarter. Lastly, although office rental market has softened, major tech employers are continuing to expand in our markets.  Google recently procured the rights to build an additional 1.3 million square feet of space in Mountain View and Amazon in Bellevue began construction on a brand-new office tower as well as signing new lease and a development for an additional 600,000 square feet. With our economy approaching 50% reopening, we remain mindful of the market and legislative uncertainties as we continue on the path to recovery. In conclusion, our portfolio is stable with current same-store portfolio occupancy at 96.7%. Our availability 30-day out is at 4.4%.  Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Barb Pak.\nBarbara Pak: Thanks, Angela. I'll start with a few comments on our first quarter results, followed by an update on our recent capital markets activities and the balance sheet. I'm pleased to report core FFO for the first quarter exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.04 per share, of which $0.02 is from consolidated operations and the other $0.02 relate to the joint venture portfolio and lower interest expense. Of the $0.02 beat on operations, $0.01 relates to higher same-property revenues and the other $0.01 is from lower operating expenses, which is timing related.  For the second quarter, we expect core FFO to be $2.92 at the midpoint, a $0.15 per share decline sequentially. Half of the decline is attributable to the loss of income on the early redemption of $110 million preferred equity investment, which occurred at the end of March and the $276 million of dispositions that closed at the end of February. There is a temporary mismatch on the timing of the use of a portion of the proceeds. And as such, this is causing a $0.07 decline sequentially.  In addition, we expect commercial income to be $0.02 lower as we had onetime benefits related to better delinquency collections in the first quarter that we do not expect to repeat in the second quarter. The remaining decline relates to lower same-property NOI due to higher expected operating expenses and delinquency and higher G&A. For the full year, we are reaffirming our guidance ranges for same-property revenue, expense and NOI growth and core FFO per share.  Turning to investments. During the quarter, we received $120 million for the redemption of 2 preferred equity investments. One of the investments totaling $110 million was redeemed early as the developer was able to sell the property for a price that exceeded our pre-COVID valuation. We estimate the cap rate at 3.6% on pre-COVID rents and 3.25% on current net effective rents. As a result of the early redemption, the company received $3.5 million in prepayment penalties or $0.05 per share, which compensates us for the lost income on the portion of the investment that was made in the fourth quarter of 2020. However, for FFO purposes, we book this income as a noncore item. Given the strong demand to invest in apartments and cheap financing alternatives currently available, we may experience additional early redemptions of preferred equity investments in 2021.  Moving to the balance sheet. During the quarter, we issued $450 million of unsecured bonds with a 7-year term at an effective yield of 1.8%. The proceeds were used to refinance most of our unsecured term loans that matured over the next 2 years, allowing us to extend our maturity profile with no impact to interest expense. We now have less than $200 million of debt maturing between now and the end of 2022. Since the beginning of 2020, we have refinanced nearly 30% of our debt, taking advantage of the low interest rate environment and reducing our weighted average interest rate by 60 basis points to 3.2%. This is leading to a significant reduction in interest expense in 2021 and can be seen in the first quarter results via the $4 million reduction to interest expense compared to the prior year.  During the quarter, we raised our common dividend by 60 basis points to $8.36 per share on an annual basis, our 27th consecutive dividend increase. This is a sign of our strong balance sheet and cash flow coverage despite the effects of the pandemic. With approximately $1.4 billion of liquidity and minimum near-term funding needs, our balance sheet remains strong, and we will remain disciplined as we look for ways to invest accretively to create shareholder value.  With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question has come from the line of Nick Joseph with Citi.\nNicholas Joseph: Maybe just starting on guidance. We saw two of your peers increase guidance today. And I guess everyone sets guidance differently initially. So some could be more conservative than others. But just curious, as you thought about revisiting guidance this quarter, in light of the 1Q beat, how things are trending the rest of the year versus your original expectations? Or are you trying to be a little more conservative and just wait for more operating results to come through?\nBarbara Pak: Nick, it's Barb. Yes, we did have a good first quarter, and we did see some favorable outcome on our same-store growth. However, it is early in the year, and there is some uncertainty related to delinquency in eviction moratorium. So that play a factor into it. And then on the preferred equity redemptions, we do have some uncertainty there. We're likely going to exceed the high end of our guidance range on the redemption side. So we're just working through some of the timing on that, and we'll revisit it in the second quarter.\nNicholas Joseph: And how are you seeing the opportunities to redeploy those proceeds into either preferred equity or mezzanine investments?\nAdam Berry: Nick, this is Adam. We have a number of deals in our pref pipeline right now that we're working through. The inherent challenge with pref deals is the timing and the lumpiness of when that money comes back and when it goes out. So we are working through that pipeline. We're also looking -- as more deals hit the market on the investment side, on the acquisition side, we're looking at all those as well. So working through it.\nOperator: Our next question has come from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Just first off on renewals, wanted to touch on that. We saw some softness greater than what we saw earlier in the year. And just wondering when you think with concessions coming down, occupancy holding stable and as we start to lap easier comps, when do you think we can start to see renewal lease rates begin to improve?\nAngela Kleiman: Yes. That's a good question there. On the renewals, I think with -- to your point, with a year-over-year comp, that will improve as we lap the pandemic. What we actually are seeing is sequential improvement on our market rents. And so that is starting. And so as concessions continue to abate, and we have built a solid foundation with a strong level of occupancy, I do expect our performance to continue to trend better. But as Barb noted earlier, there are certain factors, right? There's delinquency that's unknown. There's legislative impact that's still uncertain there. And so we wanted to make sure that we factor all those items.\nAustin Wurschmidt: So your comments, Angela, just as a quick follow-up on the occupancy levels. I mean, are you looking to push occupancy higher before starting to push harder on lease rates? Or is it at a level where maybe as we get into the peak leasing season, you'd feel more comfortable beginning to push a little bit harder on the lease rate front?\nAngela Kleiman: At this point -- at this occupancy level, we're very comfortable holding it. And to us, we see that as a sign of strength to allow us to start pushing rents. But once again, I do want to make sure that we're cautious on our concessions land because that is a function of concentration of supply as well. So there are a couple of different factors. But to your point, yes, we are -- with the occupancy level where they are, we do feel comfortable to start pushing rents as we head into peak leasing season.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Okay. Got it. And then could you just provide an update on what percent of leases are receiving a concession today and sort of what the average concession is? And then maybe compare that to what it's been over the last several months?\nAngela Kleiman: Sure, sure. I can give you quarter-by-quarter trends. And if you want to go into more granularly than that, we could talk about that. But we talked about in third quarter of last year, we had -- our concessions was somewhere around 3.5 weeks that represented about 75% of our portfolio. In the fourth quarter, that improved to about 60% of the portfolio at a little over 2 weeks. In the first quarter, now a further improvement, slightly below 50% of our portfolio at a little over 1 -- about 1.5 weeks. So that's where things are trending.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Do you have any update for April by chance?\nAngela Kleiman: I do. April is looking a little bit better, although keep in mind, this is the first 28 days. But April is now down to about a 1 week and at about 45% of our portfolio on average. So things are moving in the right direction.\nOperator: Our next question has come from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.\nAlexander Goldfarb: So first question is on the accelerated time line of the California reopening of June 15. Just curious. If you spoke about it in the early part of the call, my apologies. I was still on another multifamily call. Are you seeing an acceleration down in Southern Cal with all the service jobs reopening? Or is the tech hiring, growth in tech still outpacing the demand for apartments versus the recovery of service-based jobs that are trying to quickly reopen as we head to that June 15 time lines?\nMichael Schall: Alex, it's Mike. That's a good question. We look at -- we all look at it a little bit differently. And 1 of the ways that we're looking at this now is take our portfolio and divide it into 3 categories: the large cities; let's say, the midsize cities; and suburban -- most suburban markets. And clearly, the most suburban markets have outperformed the cities and -- both on actually a year-over-year basis and on a sequential basis. For example, our best suburban market is Torrance, which sequentially is up 4.3%. And when you look into the midsized cities, we see improvement. I'd say, it's pretty clear that the improvement in our markets is starting in suburbia and moving towards the cities and unfortunately hasn't really benefited the cities to any great extent at this point in time.  So best-performing clearly is all the suburban markets. And it doesn't matter whether they're suburban Seattle or suburban Los Angeles. And then the midsized cities are sort of second best in terms of recovery trajectory. And then the large cities are lagging pretty substantially. And again, large city hampered by supply, which is greater in the cities, along with these job levers, which improved pretty significantly for the -- the 3-month trailing average job growth was minus 9.2%. And March was minus 7.9%. So there was actually a lot of improvement in the quarter, but we need that to continue. We feel like California got a bit of a late start coming out of in this reopening process. And so maybe from that perspective, we're a step behind where we thought we were, but we're making up ground and things are looking better. Hope that makes sense.\nAlexander Goldfarb: I guess, Mike, what you're saying is -- yes, but what you're saying, if I heard you correctly, it doesn't matter what the industry is in the market. The bigger driver of the apartment performance is simply where the property is located. Suburban then midsized cities, and then the last is the urban area. So is that fair?\nMichael Schall: Yes, that's fair. And again, the urban areas are where you lost these service jobs, which are concentrated, of course, in the cities, and they have more supply. So it's really that confluence of both of those factors that is causing this. Those -- as you move from the large cities into the midsized cities and into suburban markets, suburban markets have very little supply. So we don't have someone competing with you in a new property next door offering 2 months free plus whatever else they might throw in. So that dynamic occurs mostly in the cities, and that is what is preventing our pricing power in the cities from improving substantially.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then the second question is, I think it's you guys and UDR and Mid-America are all part of this SmartRent. You obviously had the news last week in The Journal. What is the impact to you guys? Obviously, great to have your investment -- to hit big on an investment. But beyond making money, which is awesome, what is the practical impact as far as operations or the way you guys interact with SmartRent, et cetera?\nMichael Schall: Yes. Yes. Thanks for that question. I'd say SmartRent was 1 of the first investments that was made by this consortium of companies that were started by the 3 REITs that are equal partners plus other owners of apartments aggregating -- I think we started with 1 million -- owners of 1 million units of apartments. And now I think it's -- Fund II is up to like 2 million units of apartments. So some pretty substantial ownership. And again, the original concept was to create technology improvements in the industry, operating improvements using technology and rolling them out through the portfolio of apartments that the ownership group together controlled. So that's worked out great. And it's interesting because SmartRent is 1 of the first investments that we made.  And as you noted, The Wall Street Journal announced that SmartRent has entered into an agreement with a SPAC to merge for $2.2 billion, less about $500 million in working capital, which would value the company on a net basis at about $1.65 billion we believe. But there are many steps you noted to complete that process. SPACs have been pretty volatile in the recent past. And so there's no assurance that this is going to -- this will go through. But it seems like the sponsorship of the SPAC is pretty well aligned and very motivated for this to happen. So I feel, ultimately, pretty good about that.  And so there will be some financial benefits. We were -- RET Ventures was an early investor -- seed round investor and then invested all the way through the B and C rounds of SmartRent, so it's a substantial owner. I don't want to get into all the details, but there will be pretty significant potential gain there. But I guess, maybe more fundamentally in terms of the impact, it goes back to the vision of RET Ventures in the beginning, which is to try to bring technologies -- better technology into these companies to improve efficiency and the way we interact with our customer. And SmartRent is an example of that, but there are many other investments.  I think there are 12 additional investments in addition to SmartRent that were made by Fund I and we're on Fund II currently, and we're utilizing a number of those. So I'll give you an example of one, which is a -- it's a -- the customer relationship management function. And we're currently piloting, for example, and we've done several hundred leases in a product that essentially allows you to do the entire lease process from your smartphone and/or from a computer. So we are pretty far into the testing of that. We're also continuing our rollout of SmartRent, which we think is a long-term benefit to both the company and the industry. And so from a technology perspective, we're very excited about what's happening recently.\nOperator: Our next question has come from the line of Jeff Spector with Bank of America.\nJeffrey Spector: Great. Just listening to the comments on the call, and again, the sequential improvements you're seeing, Mike, it feels like from at least where I'm sitting compared to coming out of the tech crash, early 2000s, that there's a pretty good backdrop here. And I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I do remember, I don't know how long it took after the tech crash, but at a pretty nice boom. What are your thoughts? And if you disagree, I guess, what's the big negative regulatory issues today? I mean, what's the negative?\nMichael Schall: Yes. Let me hold that negative for a second here. And each of these crash and recovery periods is a little bit different. The thing that was unique about the Internet boom and then the bust period that followed was in Northern California we had roughly 40% growth in market rents before the bust. So you had this huge surge of market rents because these small tech companies, many of which didn't even have a product identified, let alone revenue, were bringing people to the West Coast. And there were no -- we couldn't produce apartments fast enough to keep up with that demand, and we had spiked 40%. Well, we gave all of that back plus then some in the ensuing few years after that period ended in the bust period. And I remember that period very well because we started selling Northern California and buying Southern California, which Southern California had no discernible benefit from that Internet boom and so assets appeared to be really cheap in Southern California, really expensive in Northern California.  So -- and then it took a long time for markets to recover from that period. I think that set back from the -- from -- essentially the lack of real businesses that went public was a dramatic setback. I think the IPO markets -- it's 20 years later, and I think the IPO markets are only started to recover a year or 2 ago from all of that. So it's taken a long time. Fast forward to today, it appears that this pandemic -- I'd say the response to it has been much different. The governmental response in terms of pumping money into -- and liquidity into the markets and making sure that a pandemic doesn't morph into a credit or financial crisis. And so I give the governmental entities a lot of credit for that.  So it feels like we're through the worst of this and we're coming out the other side, and there's a lot of money chasing deals and asset values are increasing. And so I'd say all of that's a good thing. I'd say maybe if there is a negative, it goes back to what do you do now with the new knowledge and with what you have? Basically you're worse markets historically in terms of growth rates over the last 20 years and now you're best markets. Does that continue on? Or what does it mean for your portfolio? And we all spend a lot of time on that. And Adam is in the middle of transacting around it. So -- but for us, I think that means that we sell some of our lesser properties, some of the properties that, for whatever reason, we think will underperform.  Notably, last quarter, we sold Hidden Valley, which is a property that has 25% very low BMR units, which makes it very difficult to grow. The property is great. It's in a great location, but if you have 25% very low BMR units, the growth rate just can't keep up. So we sell that property, and then we will look for an ability to repurpose those funds into something that has a good long-term growth rate, is in a better area. So that process is ongoing. And as noted -- as Barb noted, there's a little bit of FFO dilution in Q2 as a result of those transactions occurring before we reinvest those proceeds. There's a little bit of drag. And so I'd say that is perhaps a downside, I think. However, the long-term benefits will be very apparent.\nJeffrey Spector: Okay. And then my 1 follow-up -- and I'm sorry if I missed this. I know you talked a lot about the increase in jobs and hybrid, how that should benefit the portfolio. Did you specifically discuss tech workers and the return to your portfolio? Are you seeing tech employees return as renters of the portfolio or benefits from these IPOs? Like where is the demand coming from?\nMichael Schall: Yes, Jeff. I think we're starting to see it, but if you -- we have S-17.1 that talks about the reopening. Most of these reopenings are still months or a quarter or 2 away. So yes, I don't think that, that's where we're seeing the benefit. I think it's been recovery as noted in, let's say, the Motion Picture industry is now opening up and there are some service jobs coming back. And so jobs have grown. We're still off a big number, but jobs have grown. I think that the -- in terms of specifically coming back to the office, I think that's been a slow process at this point in time. I don't think it's any -- to any significant degree, it's actually occurred. I think it's ahead of us.\nOperator: Our next question has come from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors.\nJohn Pawlowski: Maybe, Adam, a follow-up on the preferred equity or mezz business. Have the increases in construction costs reached a point where it start -- you think it's going to start dampen -- to dampen deal volume over the coming years? And then a follow-up. Are costs getting to a point where any developers in your current portfolio are having issues covering that service?\nAdam Berry: John, yes. So to answer your question, we have definitely seen, as we're working through our pref pipeline, most of the developments have been in the more suburban areas. So they've been lower density, more garden-style product. And so when you look at the increases specifically to lumber, but also to some of the other materials, it is absolutely having an effect on how these deals underwrite and whether or not they'll get built. So we're seeing it, and this is the beginning of it. And developers are trying to work their way through it, and we're working with them. But we definitely see this as an obvious headwind for new supply. And then, John, what was the second part of your question?\nJohn Pawlowski: Yes. Just in terms of ongoing projects, any concerns about debt service coverage for in-process deals?\nAdam Berry: No. We don't have any of those concerns. Nothing that we see forthcoming.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. Great. And then just final one for me. Angela, any early reads on how retention is faring on leases signed a year ago with generous concessions? Or are you expecting some occupancy slippage or they have to follow up with another round of concessions to keep people signed a year ago in their homes?\nAngela Kleiman: Yes. That's a good question. As we go through our renewals and releases and heading into the peak leasing season, what we're seeing is a more normalized behavior relative to pre-COVID. So when I look at numbers like our turns and applications and so that does not lead us to think that concessions itself will be significantly challenging. But keep in mind, concessions is really more of a function of the competitive supply and what the economy is doing. So it's not so much the lease duration itself. And so right now, our markets are only at approximately 50% of the open compared to the rest of the country that is mostly reopened. And so that's more of a factor. And of course, in certain CBD locations like the L.A. and Seattle, where there are still going to be continued supply pressure, we're going to see more because that will be in a more concessionary environment regardless of the lease term.\nOperator: Our next question has come from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.\nJohn Kim: Just a follow-up on the return to work environment with tech companies. Office utilization is the lowest or among the lowest in some of your major markets, including San Francisco, San Jose and L.A. Is this something you track as far as the Castle weekly data? And is that something that you see having a high correlation to applications or interest level in your properties?\nMichael Schall: John, it's Mike. It's -- we don't really know how to track it exactly. So we do try to triangulate across the company with -- we track jobs and we track where our residents are coming from. And certainly, we track migration patterns. But trying to do this at sort of very granular level, I think, is pretty difficult. So what we have tried to do is say, hey, let's keep track of the big tech companies and when they plan to come back to the office. And then we should be able to see the traffic increase as they start coming back in greater volumes. At this point in time, as noted a minute ago, we just haven't seen a whole -- we haven't seen a lot of it. We don't think that's a major part of this recovery at this point in time.\nJohn Kim: What about students returning back to the classroom? Are you seeing it as a tailwind? And can you remind us what your typical student profile is pre pandemic versus today?\nMichael Schall: That's another good question. I don't have that granular detail. We track supply-demand mostly by jobs and obviously supply. And we know that there's some demographic tailwinds. And obviously, we know that the students are out there and -- but they're a relatively small part of our occupancy. So they're not big enough to be a driving factor in the broader scheme. The big picture is jobs, I would say, demographics, i.e., people who living longer and therefore consuming homes longer than they have jobs and the overall supply numbers. So we don't get down to that granular level.\nOperator: Our next question has come from the line of Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.\nRichard Hill: I wanted to come back to the guide. And maybe just breaking a part into its components a little bit more. 1Q was a pretty strong quarter for you. I think you beat FFO -- your FFO guide by about $0.04. Yet you maintained the guide for a full year, which implies somewhat of a cut. And the reason I bring that up is our channel check suggests 2Q is off to a pretty strong start and certainly stronger than 1Q, at least on effective rent growth. I don't know where renewals are, but effective rent growth of new leases looks pretty strong.  So I'm trying to figure out, is it really driven by one-timers that you included in your bridge, that's making you a little bit more conservative? Or is there something in the business that we should be thinking about? Because as I think about in the economy, our economists certainly increased their projections for GDP growth. I recognize you have and you typically don't in 1Q. But I'm hoping you can square that away. I know it's a mouthful, but I'm trying to understand 1Q, what's happening in 2Q fundamentals versus onetimers and what that means for the full year?\nBarbara Pak: Rich, this is Barb. So yes, 1Q was strong. And like we mentioned, we are tracking favorable on same-store through the first quarter. And I think what Angela alluded to in her opening remarks was that we just hit 50% reopening at this point within California. And so while we feel good about where we're at, we've had a lot of stops and starts within California over the past year, which leads us to just take a little bit more conservative approach, and we'll revisit in the second quarter. We do feel good about where things are, where fundamentals are. The wildcard is really delinquency, which we've talked about in the past. And you can see in our numbers April did increase from where we were in Q1. And so those are the things that were -- that weighed on us when we looked at our guidance. But it was -- we did trend favorably in the first quarter from a same-property perspective.\nMichael Schall: Barb, maybe I can add just 1 quick thing based on what you said. Because in Q1, we think that we benefited from stimulus payments, specifically because we saw delinquency improve kind of in the light of January, February time frame. And so now we get into SB 91, which is the federal stimulus money, and we haven't seen very much of that at all. That remains a big question mark in terms of what its impact is going to be going forward. And we have no way to -- no historical precedent or even way to anticipate that.  So I think that we've always been a little bit conservative and wait to see what happens and let the events occur and then report them as opposed to trying to build them into our guidance. And so I think that's -- it's kind of a philosophical bias that we have. And with respect to delinquencies, specifically, I think it's just hard to predict what's going to happen, not that we think anything bad is going to happen. We'd say SB 91 ultimately can only be good news, but we just don't have a way to time it, to get the timing, nor the magnitude given that we've never seen it before.\nRichard Hill: Okay. That's helpful. And the reason I ask because I think a lot of us, both on sell-side investors themselves, are just trying to understand if this is inherently you being conservative, which, as you noted, is in your DNA versus something that's maybe different on the West Coast. But it sounds like maybe just a little bit of a conservative approach, recognizing that the operating metrics are trending in the right direction.\nMichael Schall: Right. Fairly put, yes.\nOperator: Our next question has come from the line of Neil Malkin with Capital One Securities.\nNeil Malkin: Mike, I think this one is for you. The job growth assumptions that you put in your supplement, is that from like the government? Or is that an internal projection?\nMichael Schall: Are you referring to Page S-17, I'm guessing?\nNeil Malkin: Yes, I think it's $396,000 for this year?\nMichael Schall: Yes, $396,000. Yes. That's from S-17. No, we do our own fundamental research on our markets. Yes, so definitely ours.\nNeil Malkin: Okay. Great. Because the reason I'm asking in that, I'm just in general -- I know it's like a million-dollar question, but trying to understand what the path back -- the recovery path or the back to pre COVID looks like. Looking at your markets, I think you're still down 1.2 million jobs from pre COVID. And so using 400,000, that's basically like 3 years to get back to, I guess, pre COVID employment. Yes, I mean, is that -- does that math not really work because of when people come back to their tech jobs? Or how do you guys kind of think about that? Or I don't know maybe underwriting that from an operating standpoint, particularly in your kind of urban areas or your bigger kind of coastal markets, how you see the ability to push rents or the absolute level of rents over the next, call it, 24 months?\nMichael Schall: Yes. Connecting those dots is definitely observant. Good question. I would say that what happens is people make different choices when rents increase or decrease. And this goes back to kind of our theories as it relates to rent to income and other things. So when rents decline in the cities as much as they have, people come and fill those units. Now where does it exactly come from? I would suspect that a lot of them come from areas that are generally considered less good. I think now people can move into the cities and because rents are pretty dramatically different than -- lower than they were before. So they were priced out previously and now that they can move in.  And so that presumes that if you're in the markets, this is our theory -- portfolio theory for a long time. If you're in the markets that have good schools, safety, quality of life, et cetera, those will be the beneficiaries because people will move there as long as they can afford it. And then people that can't afford it will be pushed out to the very periphery of these markets. So -- and I know that this seems contra -- everything about what we're saying about suburbia doing so well. But there are select really good suburban markets, the beach cities, for example, in Southern California or even Northern California that are doing really well that are still pretty high-quality areas.  They're just farther from the market. So we're not necessarily talking about them. We're talking about cities that are less quality cities. And people moving out of those cities in order to move into a good location because you would have to say, well, how can you be 97% occupied almost with all those jobs lost? And the answer is people move based on a better value -- rental value or a better life situation in the better quality assets. So -- and I think that's the key is we are not almost 97% occupied. And given that there's not that many vacant units within our portfolio and as people come back, it's not going to take hundreds of thousands of jobs in order to get to the point where we're eliminating concessions and we have more pricing power, because our base is strong. So that's, in the practical world, how it works. So it's not just jobs. It's the consumer choice, given changes in rev levels. Makes sense?\nNeil Malkin: Okay. Yes, yes. I see where you're going there. Other one for me is you guys have done a really good job in most of the REITs, have done a good job minimizing delinquency, kind of taking it to the chin early in terms of concessions and letting people leave or paying people to leave, et cetera. But you're also impacted by your surrounding properties and owners, et cetera. So there's obviously a big, I guess, you call it, storm coming in terms of the amount of people who have 6-plus months of back rent that \"has to be paid back eventually.\"  I have my doubts about that in California, but how do you guys see that playing out when that check needs to be written or the sort of the protection abate? And again, not really a big deal in your specific assets, but a lot of people, I'm sure, operators that you compete against have maybe a lot of that. I guess, do you guys think that's going to have a big impact on vacancy? Could that bring more people to the market for selling their assets? Any commentary there would be great.\nMichael Schall: Yes. That's an extraordinarily good question. And it's 1 that causes us a fair amount of sleeplessness at night, and we don't have the answer to it. We know that the existing eviction moratoriums lapsed on June 30. And we also know that there is a pretty significant number of renters that over that -- the last year, it's more than 6 months, over the last year or by the time we get to June, it will be almost a year, that will not have paid us even the 25% rent that's required to maintain their eviction protection under SB 91.  So we know that this is going to be a problem. I would also say that there's no way that the courts can keep up with foreclosure processing. So I don't know exactly how that's going to work itself out either. So unfortunately, I'm going to have to say that we're going to work through it. We're going to -- we are obviously a public company. Obviously, we have sort of an obligation to treat our residents thoughtfully and carefully. And so we will do our best to work through that. But I can't tell you exactly what we're going to run into as we get into that period of time. We are absolutely very concerned about it. and we'll have to take it a step at a time, I guess, what I'd say.\nNeil Malkin: Okay. And is that why you're maybe a little bit more cautious on your guidance just out of curiosity? Is that 1 of the things that -- I know you didn't talk about it, but could that be 1 of the things that are making you kind of in pain?\nMichael Schall: Yes, it is. But at the same time, the people that have -- let's say, we know that there are people that have received various forms of benefits and/or payments and haven't paid their rents. So finally, we'll be in a position to reconcile some of those situations where people are using the laws to shield themselves from paying anything. So it isn't all bad. There is a good element to it as well. And maybe people face with -- if they want to maintain their eviction protection, they're going to have to pay us the 25% of rents that have accrued from September 1 through June 30, to the extent they haven't already paid it. So it's not all bad. It's sort of a -- I would say it's kind of a time for reconciliation come June 30. And again, it's difficult to predict exactly what that's going to look like.\nOperator: Our next question has come from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.\nDennis McGill: You've talked a bit about some of the extremes as far as suburbs outperforming urban and some of the markets doing better than other markets geographically. Can you maybe just put some numbers behind it and maybe use the down 6% blended rent number from April? How wide are those extremes? And can you give a sense of which markets are most negative and which are most positive?\nMichael Schall: Yes. Dennis, it's a good question. I don't think I necessarily haven't broken out the way that you're referring to it. So let me give you some sense of what we're seeing. So let's take the most suburban parts of our market. The best on a sequential basis -- so sequential quarters is Torrance at 4.3% plus rent -- revenue growth. And Snohomish County up there in Seattle, again, there's a Boeing issue in Snohomish, which is minus 0.4%. And then year-over-year Oceanside is plus 2.7%, and San Ramon is minus 4.2%. So that kind of gives you the brackets around what's happening in those most suburban markets.  In the midsized cities, the best sequential growth is in actually the city of Long Beach and the worst is in sort of North City, San Diego, Long Beach up 3.4%; North City down 0.5%. And year-over-year, Long Beach is the best at minus 2.3%. and San Jose is the worst at minus 10.5%. Again, Long Beach doesn't get a lot of supply, and it's a decent -- a very decent place to live. So I think it's benefited from that. Then in the large cities, the sequential -- on a sequential basis, the best there is West L.A. at plus 3.5%, and Seattle is the worst at minus 2.5%. And then year-over-year, the best is West L.A. again, at minus 11.9% and San Francisco at minus 20.7%. Does that give you some idea of what's going on?\nDennis McGill: Yes. I think that does. And those were revenue numbers or those were at least great numbers?\nMichael Schall: Those are total revenue. Same-store revenue.\nDennis McGill: Perfect. And then a separate question, just as you look at the -- each distribution of your renters. I'm not sure if you have this in front of you if you have a way to summarize it. But if you were to look at the distribution of your residents pre COVID end segment them by age, is there any difference between that and what you're seeing on new move-ins today?\nMichael Schall: I don't think that we have that data. We have move-outs occurred and what categories, but we're not tracking it by age cohort.\nDennis McGill: Okay. What about -- depending on how you do track it, just the makeup of the tenant base, whether it be income or demographic circumstance, anything that would speak to, whether it's differing from what was common before COVID versus now?\nMichael Schall: There is some difference. I don't have any data in front of me. There are some differences in that. Again, because the cities have had such a dramatic drop in rents, a different kind of renter is moving into the cities. And there's definitely more tech workers that are -- given work from home that are occupying housing in the suburbs. But I don't have any of that demographic data. We have it. We just -- I just don't have it with me. So apologize. We can follow-up with you on if we -- if you want to on this.\nOperator: Our next question has come from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.\nBradley Heffern: Yes. Just going back to the delinquencies again. I just want to make sure I understand the April number. So you had the 2.1% in the first quarter and then the April number is 2.7%. I assume that over time, you collect more of that. So are you, I guess, more concerned about delinquency now than you were a couple of months ago because the payments that continue to come in are maybe less than the tailwind that you saw in the first quarter? And I guess how confident are you that, that was really a stimulus tailwind just because it seems like it wasn't really enough to cover a month of rents? And is that really something that -- is that going to be the first source of that capital for people when you have the tenant protections that you do in California?\nAngela Kleiman: Yes. That's a good question. And it's a complicated 1 because there's quite a few different moving pieces, right, because this involves legislation, involves behavior and, of course, people's view about their jobs and prospects. And so -- but in terms of -- if you look at the first quarter delinquency, we actually published January and February, and that was about 2.6%. And so March came in significantly better to the point that allowed the first quarter average to be down -- that went down to 2.1%. So April pops back up to 2.7%, which is more of the normalized run rate. And that is why -- while we don't obviously have the exact reason for the sudden improvement in Q1, that is why we can pretty safely point to March, which is when the stimulus was distributed.  And so it's not a perfect science, but it's pretty darn good correlation from that perspective. And where we're at is we don't think it's going to deteriorate further. But at the same time, before looking at -- people are asking us, say, Q1 sequential to Q2 sequential gross revenue is where is that headed. You have to factor into the delinquency, which is a 2.1%, just going back to the more normalized level of 2.7%. So that's 1 piece of it. And as far as the delinquency, Mike talked about SB 91, and we have a team that has really put forth a robust effort to work with our tenants and actively engaging with them to help them apply for this relief.  And so while we are going through that and we're seeing -- we're being able to -- we're able to help our tenants and with their eligibility, the question is the timing, when will we get the reimbursement from the government? And that is -- every city has a different time line. Every city has a different process, and every city approaches the reimbursement differently. And so for us, our view is not so much that it's a huge [Technical Difficulty] is when. And so you back that into, well, what does that mean for guidance? That's going to be lumpy. It's going to be variable. And therefore, we just felt that it was prudent to give it a few more months and see what numbers come in. Does that make sense?\nBradley Heffern: Appreciate the color. Yes, it does. I knew it would be complicated. And then I guess moving over to sort of the dispositions that you've had and the redemptions, it's about $400 million of capital or so there. I guess, do you have pretty good line of sight on what the deployment is going to be for that? Or I guess, more generally, what's your confidence in being able to redeploy that just given that obviously assets on the West Coast haven't become distressed or anything like that? And it seems like there are a lot of willing buyers out there. So I'm curious your confidence in being able to redeploy that accretively.\nAdam Berry: Brad, this is Adam. So a couple of things. The 3 dispositions that happened earlier this quarter. Those -- I actually mentioned them in last quarter's call. Those were essentially baked in Q4 of last year. And so we used most of those proceeds at the time to buy back stock as well as deploy new prefs at that point. What's changed within -- from that time until now is the redemptions. And so with that, that's $120 million that was unexpected to come back this soon. So my confidence level on redeploying that money is very high. Like I mentioned earlier, the pipeline on the prefs -- pref equity deals is pretty robust. And it does take time to work through them, but we are highly motivated to do so. And so that money will be redeployed. It's just getting there and moving as quickly as we can.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. And with that, we do thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Schall",
            "content": "Thank you for joining us today, and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. Angela Kleiman and Barb Pak will follow me with prepared remarks; and Adam Berry, our Chief Investment Officer, is here for Q&A. I'll start today with our first quarter results and expectations for the remainder of the year, including factors that lead us to believe that 2021 will be a year of recovery from the pandemic and then conclude with an overview of the transaction market.  I am pleased to note that Essex was founded 50 years ago in 1971 by our Chairman, George Marcus, and we are very proud of all the company has accomplished. George remains keenly focused on the company's mission, strategy and business plan execution. I also want to recognize the extraordinary effort of the Essex team, which has allowed us to emerge from the pandemic in a position of strength and ready to seek opportunity that often comes from associated uncertainty. The Board and senior leadership team greatly appreciate this collaborative effort. Finally, the company's commitment to the balance sheet strength and a growing dividend was reaffirmed with our recent announcement of our 27th consecutive annual dividend increase.  Turning to our first quarter results. Severe lockdowns in California and Washington remained a headwind in the quarter after intensifying last November amid a surge in COVID cases and hospitalizations that has only recently abated. Our very strong results in the first quarter of 2020 and a plethora of pandemic-related regulations and associated job loss were significant impediments to the company's performance this past year, as reflected in this quarter's results, with same-property revenues and core FFO down 8.1% and 11.8%, respectively, compared to a year ago. On a sequential basis, same-property revenues improved by 10 basis points, driven by growth in several suburban areas and particularly in San Diego, Orange and Ventura counties of Southern California.  As noted in our earnings release, we reaffirmed our full year 2021 guidance ranges, and we continue to expect improvements in same-property revenue growth, driven by job growth and easier year-over-year comparisons. Apartment demand continues to be strongest in properties farthest from the urban centers and weakest in the cities, both being a function of new apartment supply and pandemic-related job losses. On a trailing 3-month basis as of March 2021, year-over-year job losses were 9.2% and 5.4%, respectively, for the Essex markets and the nation, marking significant progress compared to the 14% decline we saw in the Essex market shortly after the onset of the pandemic and also suggesting that our markets remain early in the recovery process.  Fortunately, the recovery of jobs appears to be accelerating as reflected in preliminary job losses for the month of March 2021, which were down 7.9% for the Essex markets and 4.4% for the nation. On a sequential basis, California and Washington outpaced the nation in March, gaining nearly 150,000 jobs, representing over 16% of the U.S. job growth with less than 13% of the employment base. As we suggested several quarters ago, we expect rents to recover on the West Coast as we recapture pandemic-related job losses that were directly impacted by shelter-in-place orders, including hospitality and service sectors, entertainment and filming and video production and tech jobs that were displaced to remote locations.  Hospitality and service jobs were disproportionately concentrated in the urban areas and wealthy suburbs. For the nation, jobs in hospitality and other services have recovered about 2/3 of their post COVID job losses. By comparison, to date, Essex metros have recovered less than 1/3 of these losses. Given the widespread recent reopening of California cities, these service sectors are again growing and their potential upside represents a promising differentiator for Essex markets over the next several quarters.  Film and video production was disrupted, once again by the COVID shutdowns over the winter months, followed more recently by a surge in film permit applications. Overall, production activity remains below normal for this time of year. However, data released last week from FilmLA highlighted a 45% month-over-month increase in film permit applications for March, as the industry benefited from the recent relaxation of stay at home measures in Los Angeles County. We expect the rebound in production to continue this year due to pent-up demand for content that has been disrupted due to COVID-19. This recovery should provide a positive tailwind for the industry and for rental demand in the LA market.  We are also pleased that many of the top tech companies have announced return to office plans supporting our belief that the hybrid model for offices will prevail with most employees spending a significant amount of time in the office for team building, collaboration, career advancement and related necessities. The largest tech employers in our markets had significantly reduced their hiring plans early in the pandemic, while also allowing many of their employees to work from home. With the cities largely shut down, many tech workers moved to suburban or rural locations or back home with their parents. This trend began to reverse late last year, and we expect to see further momentum in the coming quarters as more tech employers reopen their offices.  As before, we track the announcements of the largest tech companies, and we have provided a time line of planned office reopenings based on public disclosures on Slide S-17.1 of our supplemental. We also provide a graph indicating the strong recovery in job postings for the top 10 tech companies with open positions in the Essex markets now above pre-COVID levels. We also track the job locations for open positions, noting that about 57% of their U.S. job postings was California or Washington as the office location. As of last week, California and Washington have dispensed at least the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine to approximately 47% and 45% of their adult populations, respectively.  Overall, accelerating vaccine deployment and pent-up demand for services gives us confidence that we are now on a solid path to recovery. California's counties have begun to remove restrictions on commerce. And Governor Newsom recently announced that California is expected to effectively reopen on June 15, including key indoor and outdoor activities such as conventions and sporting events. These plans are subject to several protective measures tied to continued low hospitalization rates and sufficient vaccine supplies.  On the supply outlook, total housing permits, both single and multifamily, in our West Coast markets have declined 9.2% on a trailing 12-month basis compared to the national average increase of 6.4%. The national increase in permits is being driven by a 13.9% increase in single-family housing permits, mostly in markets with low barriers to entry and rising home prices. In California, the median price of a single-family home increased 12.4% year-over-year as of February. Normally, one would assume that higher home values would lead to increased production.  However, single-family permits in the Essex markets are down 7.7%, which we attribute to a challenging regulatory environment and limited land availability, ultimately leading to fewer deliveries in late '22 and 2023. With large increases in for-sale housing prices, down payments have increased and the transition from a renter to homeownership has become more challenging. At the same time, the combination of lower rents from the pandemic and higher average incomes in the Essex markets has improved apartment rental affordability. We have seen these forces in previous recoveries, and they often result in periods of higher-than-average rent growth.  Turning to the transaction market. We successfully sold 3 apartment communities in the first quarter for $275 million at values that were similar to the pre-COVID period when our consensus NAV was almost $300 per share. As a result, we use property sales proceeds to fund preferred equity investments and repurchase common stock, both accretive to per share core FFO and offsetting a portion of COVID-related NOI declines. The strong rebound in REIT valuations over the past 6 months makes stock buybacks less attractive today, and we are now looking for undervalued or mismanaged property in our core markets to grow externally.  There were relatively few property sales during the pandemic, and most were completed by highly motivated buyers using 1031 exchange proceeds and other sources of attractively priced capital. Several of our suburban markets have rent levels that have increased on a year-over-year basis, and recent transactions have priced in the high 3% cap rate range. In the hard hit cities, buyers appear to be looking beyond the COVID impacts with apartments selling near a 4% cap rate using pre-COVID rents and NOI, roughly equivalent to a cap rate in the low 3% range based on current rents.  Strong apartment values have led to a greater level of redemptions in our preferred equity portfolio, the impact of which Barb will discuss in a moment. As conditions normalize, we are starting to see more properties being listed for sale. The unprecedented changes and uncertainty experienced during the pandemic will likely lead to a robust apartment transaction market as property owners adjust their strategies going forward.  I will now turn the call over to our COO, Angela Kleiman. Alex, it's Mike. That's a good question. We look at -- we all look at it a little bit differently. And 1 of the ways that we're looking at this now is take our portfolio and divide it into 3 categories: the large cities; let's say, the midsize cities; and suburban -- most suburban markets. And clearly, the most suburban markets have outperformed the cities and -- both on actually a year-over-year basis and on a sequential basis. For example, our best suburban market is Torrance, which sequentially is up 4.3%. And when you look into the midsized cities, we see improvement. I'd say, it's pretty clear that the improvement in our markets is starting in suburbia and moving towards the cities and unfortunately hasn't really benefited the cities to any great extent at this point in time.  So best-performing clearly is all the suburban markets. And it doesn't matter whether they're suburban Seattle or suburban Los Angeles. And then the midsized cities are sort of second best in terms of recovery trajectory. And then the large cities are lagging pretty substantially. And again, large city hampered by supply, which is greater in the cities, along with these job levers, which improved pretty significantly for the -- the 3-month trailing average job growth was minus 9.2%. And March was minus 7.9%. So there was actually a lot of improvement in the quarter, but we need that to continue. We feel like California got a bit of a late start coming out of in this reopening process. And so maybe from that perspective, we're a step behind where we thought we were, but we're making up ground and things are looking better. Hope that makes sense. Yes, that's fair. And again, the urban areas are where you lost these service jobs, which are concentrated, of course, in the cities, and they have more supply. So it's really that confluence of both of those factors that is causing this. Those -- as you move from the large cities into the midsized cities and into suburban markets, suburban markets have very little supply. So we don't have someone competing with you in a new property next door offering 2 months free plus whatever else they might throw in. So that dynamic occurs mostly in the cities, and that is what is preventing our pricing power in the cities from improving substantially. Yes. Yes. Thanks for that question. I'd say SmartRent was 1 of the first investments that was made by this consortium of companies that were started by the 3 REITs that are equal partners plus other owners of apartments aggregating -- I think we started with 1 million -- owners of 1 million units of apartments. And now I think it's -- Fund II is up to like 2 million units of apartments. So some pretty substantial ownership. And again, the original concept was to create technology improvements in the industry, operating improvements using technology and rolling them out through the portfolio of apartments that the ownership group together controlled. So that's worked out great. And it's interesting because SmartRent is 1 of the first investments that we made.  And as you noted, The Wall Street Journal announced that SmartRent has entered into an agreement with a SPAC to merge for $2.2 billion, less about $500 million in working capital, which would value the company on a net basis at about $1.65 billion we believe. But there are many steps you noted to complete that process. SPACs have been pretty volatile in the recent past. And so there's no assurance that this is going to -- this will go through. But it seems like the sponsorship of the SPAC is pretty well aligned and very motivated for this to happen. So I feel, ultimately, pretty good about that.  And so there will be some financial benefits. We were -- RET Ventures was an early investor -- seed round investor and then invested all the way through the B and C rounds of SmartRent, so it's a substantial owner. I don't want to get into all the details, but there will be pretty significant potential gain there. But I guess, maybe more fundamentally in terms of the impact, it goes back to the vision of RET Ventures in the beginning, which is to try to bring technologies -- better technology into these companies to improve efficiency and the way we interact with our customer. And SmartRent is an example of that, but there are many other investments.  I think there are 12 additional investments in addition to SmartRent that were made by Fund I and we're on Fund II currently, and we're utilizing a number of those. So I'll give you an example of one, which is a -- it's a -- the customer relationship management function. And we're currently piloting, for example, and we've done several hundred leases in a product that essentially allows you to do the entire lease process from your smartphone and/or from a computer. So we are pretty far into the testing of that. We're also continuing our rollout of SmartRent, which we think is a long-term benefit to both the company and the industry. And so from a technology perspective, we're very excited about what's happening recently. Yes. Let me hold that negative for a second here. And each of these crash and recovery periods is a little bit different. The thing that was unique about the Internet boom and then the bust period that followed was in Northern California we had roughly 40% growth in market rents before the bust. So you had this huge surge of market rents because these small tech companies, many of which didn't even have a product identified, let alone revenue, were bringing people to the West Coast. And there were no -- we couldn't produce apartments fast enough to keep up with that demand, and we had spiked 40%. Well, we gave all of that back plus then some in the ensuing few years after that period ended in the bust period. And I remember that period very well because we started selling Northern California and buying Southern California, which Southern California had no discernible benefit from that Internet boom and so assets appeared to be really cheap in Southern California, really expensive in Northern California.  So -- and then it took a long time for markets to recover from that period. I think that set back from the -- from -- essentially the lack of real businesses that went public was a dramatic setback. I think the IPO markets -- it's 20 years later, and I think the IPO markets are only started to recover a year or 2 ago from all of that. So it's taken a long time. Fast forward to today, it appears that this pandemic -- I'd say the response to it has been much different. The governmental response in terms of pumping money into -- and liquidity into the markets and making sure that a pandemic doesn't morph into a credit or financial crisis. And so I give the governmental entities a lot of credit for that.  So it feels like we're through the worst of this and we're coming out the other side, and there's a lot of money chasing deals and asset values are increasing. And so I'd say all of that's a good thing. I'd say maybe if there is a negative, it goes back to what do you do now with the new knowledge and with what you have? Basically you're worse markets historically in terms of growth rates over the last 20 years and now you're best markets. Does that continue on? Or what does it mean for your portfolio? And we all spend a lot of time on that. And Adam is in the middle of transacting around it. So -- but for us, I think that means that we sell some of our lesser properties, some of the properties that, for whatever reason, we think will underperform.  Notably, last quarter, we sold Hidden Valley, which is a property that has 25% very low BMR units, which makes it very difficult to grow. The property is great. It's in a great location, but if you have 25% very low BMR units, the growth rate just can't keep up. So we sell that property, and then we will look for an ability to repurpose those funds into something that has a good long-term growth rate, is in a better area. So that process is ongoing. And as noted -- as Barb noted, there's a little bit of FFO dilution in Q2 as a result of those transactions occurring before we reinvest those proceeds. There's a little bit of drag. And so I'd say that is perhaps a downside, I think. However, the long-term benefits will be very apparent. Yes, Jeff. I think we're starting to see it, but if you -- we have S-17.1 that talks about the reopening. Most of these reopenings are still months or a quarter or 2 away. So yes, I don't think that, that's where we're seeing the benefit. I think it's been recovery as noted in, let's say, the Motion Picture industry is now opening up and there are some service jobs coming back. And so jobs have grown. We're still off a big number, but jobs have grown. I think that the -- in terms of specifically coming back to the office, I think that's been a slow process at this point in time. I don't think it's any -- to any significant degree, it's actually occurred. I think it's ahead of us. John, it's Mike. It's -- we don't really know how to track it exactly. So we do try to triangulate across the company with -- we track jobs and we track where our residents are coming from. And certainly, we track migration patterns. But trying to do this at sort of very granular level, I think, is pretty difficult. So what we have tried to do is say, hey, let's keep track of the big tech companies and when they plan to come back to the office. And then we should be able to see the traffic increase as they start coming back in greater volumes. At this point in time, as noted a minute ago, we just haven't seen a whole -- we haven't seen a lot of it. We don't think that's a major part of this recovery at this point in time. That's another good question. I don't have that granular detail. We track supply-demand mostly by jobs and obviously supply. And we know that there's some demographic tailwinds. And obviously, we know that the students are out there and -- but they're a relatively small part of our occupancy. So they're not big enough to be a driving factor in the broader scheme. The big picture is jobs, I would say, demographics, i.e., people who living longer and therefore consuming homes longer than they have jobs and the overall supply numbers. So we don't get down to that granular level. Barb, maybe I can add just 1 quick thing based on what you said. Because in Q1, we think that we benefited from stimulus payments, specifically because we saw delinquency improve kind of in the light of January, February time frame. And so now we get into SB 91, which is the federal stimulus money, and we haven't seen very much of that at all. That remains a big question mark in terms of what its impact is going to be going forward. And we have no way to -- no historical precedent or even way to anticipate that.  So I think that we've always been a little bit conservative and wait to see what happens and let the events occur and then report them as opposed to trying to build them into our guidance. And so I think that's -- it's kind of a philosophical bias that we have. And with respect to delinquencies, specifically, I think it's just hard to predict what's going to happen, not that we think anything bad is going to happen. We'd say SB 91 ultimately can only be good news, but we just don't have a way to time it, to get the timing, nor the magnitude given that we've never seen it before. Right. Fairly put, yes. Are you referring to Page S-17, I'm guessing? Yes, $396,000. Yes. That's from S-17. No, we do our own fundamental research on our markets. Yes, so definitely ours. Yes. Connecting those dots is definitely observant. Good question. I would say that what happens is people make different choices when rents increase or decrease. And this goes back to kind of our theories as it relates to rent to income and other things. So when rents decline in the cities as much as they have, people come and fill those units. Now where does it exactly come from? I would suspect that a lot of them come from areas that are generally considered less good. I think now people can move into the cities and because rents are pretty dramatically different than -- lower than they were before. So they were priced out previously and now that they can move in.  And so that presumes that if you're in the markets, this is our theory -- portfolio theory for a long time. If you're in the markets that have good schools, safety, quality of life, et cetera, those will be the beneficiaries because people will move there as long as they can afford it. And then people that can't afford it will be pushed out to the very periphery of these markets. So -- and I know that this seems contra -- everything about what we're saying about suburbia doing so well. But there are select really good suburban markets, the beach cities, for example, in Southern California or even Northern California that are doing really well that are still pretty high-quality areas.  They're just farther from the market. So we're not necessarily talking about them. We're talking about cities that are less quality cities. And people moving out of those cities in order to move into a good location because you would have to say, well, how can you be 97% occupied almost with all those jobs lost? And the answer is people move based on a better value -- rental value or a better life situation in the better quality assets. So -- and I think that's the key is we are not almost 97% occupied. And given that there's not that many vacant units within our portfolio and as people come back, it's not going to take hundreds of thousands of jobs in order to get to the point where we're eliminating concessions and we have more pricing power, because our base is strong. So that's, in the practical world, how it works. So it's not just jobs. It's the consumer choice, given changes in rev levels. Makes sense? Yes. That's an extraordinarily good question. And it's 1 that causes us a fair amount of sleeplessness at night, and we don't have the answer to it. We know that the existing eviction moratoriums lapsed on June 30. And we also know that there is a pretty significant number of renters that over that -- the last year, it's more than 6 months, over the last year or by the time we get to June, it will be almost a year, that will not have paid us even the 25% rent that's required to maintain their eviction protection under SB 91.  So we know that this is going to be a problem. I would also say that there's no way that the courts can keep up with foreclosure processing. So I don't know exactly how that's going to work itself out either. So unfortunately, I'm going to have to say that we're going to work through it. We're going to -- we are obviously a public company. Obviously, we have sort of an obligation to treat our residents thoughtfully and carefully. And so we will do our best to work through that. But I can't tell you exactly what we're going to run into as we get into that period of time. We are absolutely very concerned about it. and we'll have to take it a step at a time, I guess, what I'd say. Yes, it is. But at the same time, the people that have -- let's say, we know that there are people that have received various forms of benefits and/or payments and haven't paid their rents. So finally, we'll be in a position to reconcile some of those situations where people are using the laws to shield themselves from paying anything. So it isn't all bad. There is a good element to it as well. And maybe people face with -- if they want to maintain their eviction protection, they're going to have to pay us the 25% of rents that have accrued from September 1 through June 30, to the extent they haven't already paid it. So it's not all bad. It's sort of a -- I would say it's kind of a time for reconciliation come June 30. And again, it's difficult to predict exactly what that's going to look like. Yes. Dennis, it's a good question. I don't think I necessarily haven't broken out the way that you're referring to it. So let me give you some sense of what we're seeing. So let's take the most suburban parts of our market. The best on a sequential basis -- so sequential quarters is Torrance at 4.3% plus rent -- revenue growth. And Snohomish County up there in Seattle, again, there's a Boeing issue in Snohomish, which is minus 0.4%. And then year-over-year Oceanside is plus 2.7%, and San Ramon is minus 4.2%. So that kind of gives you the brackets around what's happening in those most suburban markets.  In the midsized cities, the best sequential growth is in actually the city of Long Beach and the worst is in sort of North City, San Diego, Long Beach up 3.4%; North City down 0.5%. And year-over-year, Long Beach is the best at minus 2.3%. and San Jose is the worst at minus 10.5%. Again, Long Beach doesn't get a lot of supply, and it's a decent -- a very decent place to live. So I think it's benefited from that. Then in the large cities, the sequential -- on a sequential basis, the best there is West L.A. at plus 3.5%, and Seattle is the worst at minus 2.5%. And then year-over-year, the best is West L.A. again, at minus 11.9% and San Francisco at minus 20.7%. Does that give you some idea of what's going on? Those are total revenue. Same-store revenue. I don't think that we have that data. We have move-outs occurred and what categories, but we're not tracking it by age cohort. There is some difference. I don't have any data in front of me. There are some differences in that. Again, because the cities have had such a dramatic drop in rents, a different kind of renter is moving into the cities. And there's definitely more tech workers that are -- given work from home that are occupying housing in the suburbs. But I don't have any of that demographic data. We have it. We just -- I just don't have it with me. So apologize. We can follow-up with you on if we -- if you want to on this."

            "name": "Angela Kleiman",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. First, a special recognition to the Essex operating team for their continued focus on delivering solid results under these extraordinary conditions. Thank you for your efforts. As for my comments, I will focus the discussion on our first quarter results and current market dynamics. In general, our markets continue to improve as the economy gradually reopens with the vaccine rollouts, easing of COVID restrictions and the recent announcements for a phased or partial office reopening by the major employers, which has contributed to job growth.  Our goal amidst the pandemic was to focus on maintaining occupancy and managing scheduled rent, which will position us favorably for revenue growth in the future. Accordingly, we adjusted our concession strategy to match the improvements in demand, which has enabled our same-property revenues to perform slightly better than our expectations. We have been successful with this strategy. And as a result, we maintained occupancy with scheduled rents decline, representing only 3.2% of the 8.1% total revenue decline for the quarter.  You may recall the underlying fundamentals in the first quarter of last year consisted of a strong economic backdrop prior to the COVID pandemic. In fact, our first quarter year-over-year same-property revenue growth back then was 3.2%, with revenue levels at historical highs throughout the entire portfolio. The strength of first quarter last year created a more difficult year-over-year comparable, which is also the reason why our new lease rates declined by 9.7% in the first quarter, as shown on the S-16, compared to the fourth quarter where the new lease rate declined by 8.9%. Consistent with the discussion on our last earnings call, the year-over-year decline in our major markets was primarily attributed to a combination of job losses from the pandemic, particularly impacting urban CBDs, which also had a greater concentration of supply deliveries.  Here are a few key highlights of the first quarter year-over-year performance by markets. In Seattle, the 7% revenue decline was primarily driven by Seattle CBD, down 15.7%, whereas the remaining submarkets averaged a 5.2% decline. In Northern California, the 10.9% revenue decline was led by CBD, San Francisco and Oakland and San Mateo, averaging a 15.9% decline, contrasted with a 5% decline in Contra Costa County. In Southern California, the 5.8% revenue decline continues to be primarily driven by L.A. CBD and West L.A., which were down by an average of 13%, while our suburban Southern California submarkets of Ventura, Orange County and San Diego averaged a 2.1% decline.  As you can see, our suburban portfolio continues to significantly outperform the urban markets. On the other hand, there are signs of improvement in our tech-centric urban markets. For example, first quarter sequential financial occupancies in San Francisco and Seattle CBD increased by 2.7% and 4.2%, respectively. In addition, the sequential quarterly turnover rates declined at an average of 5.4% in these markets. We continue to anticipate that the urban CBD markets, particularly in downtown Seattle, Oakland and L.A., will remain impacted by greater concentration of supply deliveries, resulting in elevated level of concessions, which will moderate the recovery.  Although we typically do not place significant focus on sequential performance, because of the seasonality embedded in our business under normal market conditions, as we emerge from the pandemic, we view the sequential cost trend as a better indicator of our recovery progress. From this perspective, we have delivered 2 consecutive quarters of modest total same-property revenue growth, supported by comparable periods of job growth in our markets, which began in the fourth quarter of last year and has continued through the first quarter of this year.  More notable is the 110 basis points in sequential improvement of our average net effective market rent per unit, with Southern California continue to lead our portfolio growth. On average, new lease concessions improved from low over 2 weeks in the fourth quarter to about 1.5 weeks in the first quarter. While the magnitude may vary, this trend is in line with our forecast, where we had expected that market rents in our portfolio, on average, would trough between the fourth quarter and the first quarter. Lastly, although office rental market has softened, major tech employers are continuing to expand in our markets.  Google recently procured the rights to build an additional 1.3 million square feet of space in Mountain View and Amazon in Bellevue began construction on a brand-new office tower as well as signing new lease and a development for an additional 600,000 square feet. With our economy approaching 50% reopening, we remain mindful of the market and legislative uncertainties as we continue on the path to recovery. In conclusion, our portfolio is stable with current same-store portfolio occupancy at 96.7%. Our availability 30-day out is at 4.4%.  Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Barb Pak. Yes. That's a good question there. On the renewals, I think with -- to your point, with a year-over-year comp, that will improve as we lap the pandemic. What we actually are seeing is sequential improvement on our market rents. And so that is starting. And so as concessions continue to abate, and we have built a solid foundation with a strong level of occupancy, I do expect our performance to continue to trend better. But as Barb noted earlier, there are certain factors, right? There's delinquency that's unknown. There's legislative impact that's still uncertain there. And so we wanted to make sure that we factor all those items. At this point -- at this occupancy level, we're very comfortable holding it. And to us, we see that as a sign of strength to allow us to start pushing rents. But once again, I do want to make sure that we're cautious on our concessions land because that is a function of concentration of supply as well. So there are a couple of different factors. But to your point, yes, we are -- with the occupancy level where they are, we do feel comfortable to start pushing rents as we head into peak leasing season. Sure, sure. I can give you quarter-by-quarter trends. And if you want to go into more granularly than that, we could talk about that. But we talked about in third quarter of last year, we had -- our concessions was somewhere around 3.5 weeks that represented about 75% of our portfolio. In the fourth quarter, that improved to about 60% of the portfolio at a little over 2 weeks. In the first quarter, now a further improvement, slightly below 50% of our portfolio at a little over 1 -- about 1.5 weeks. So that's where things are trending. I do. April is looking a little bit better, although keep in mind, this is the first 28 days. But April is now down to about a 1 week and at about 45% of our portfolio on average. So things are moving in the right direction. Yes. That's a good question. As we go through our renewals and releases and heading into the peak leasing season, what we're seeing is a more normalized behavior relative to pre-COVID. So when I look at numbers like our turns and applications and so that does not lead us to think that concessions itself will be significantly challenging. But keep in mind, concessions is really more of a function of the competitive supply and what the economy is doing. So it's not so much the lease duration itself. And so right now, our markets are only at approximately 50% of the open compared to the rest of the country that is mostly reopened. And so that's more of a factor. And of course, in certain CBD locations like the L.A. and Seattle, where there are still going to be continued supply pressure, we're going to see more because that will be in a more concessionary environment regardless of the lease term. Yes. That's a good question. And it's a complicated 1 because there's quite a few different moving pieces, right, because this involves legislation, involves behavior and, of course, people's view about their jobs and prospects. And so -- but in terms of -- if you look at the first quarter delinquency, we actually published January and February, and that was about 2.6%. And so March came in significantly better to the point that allowed the first quarter average to be down -- that went down to 2.1%. So April pops back up to 2.7%, which is more of the normalized run rate. And that is why -- while we don't obviously have the exact reason for the sudden improvement in Q1, that is why we can pretty safely point to March, which is when the stimulus was distributed.  And so it's not a perfect science, but it's pretty darn good correlation from that perspective. And where we're at is we don't think it's going to deteriorate further. But at the same time, before looking at -- people are asking us, say, Q1 sequential to Q2 sequential gross revenue is where is that headed. You have to factor into the delinquency, which is a 2.1%, just going back to the more normalized level of 2.7%. So that's 1 piece of it. And as far as the delinquency, Mike talked about SB 91, and we have a team that has really put forth a robust effort to work with our tenants and actively engaging with them to help them apply for this relief.  And so while we are going through that and we're seeing -- we're being able to -- we're able to help our tenants and with their eligibility, the question is the timing, when will we get the reimbursement from the government? And that is -- every city has a different time line. Every city has a different process, and every city approaches the reimbursement differently. And so for us, our view is not so much that it's a huge [Technical Difficulty] is when. And so you back that into, well, what does that mean for guidance? That's going to be lumpy. It's going to be variable. And therefore, we just felt that it was prudent to give it a few more months and see what numbers come in. Does that make sense?"

            "name": "Barbara Pak",
            "content": "Thanks, Angela. I'll start with a few comments on our first quarter results, followed by an update on our recent capital markets activities and the balance sheet. I'm pleased to report core FFO for the first quarter exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.04 per share, of which $0.02 is from consolidated operations and the other $0.02 relate to the joint venture portfolio and lower interest expense. Of the $0.02 beat on operations, $0.01 relates to higher same-property revenues and the other $0.01 is from lower operating expenses, which is timing related.  For the second quarter, we expect core FFO to be $2.92 at the midpoint, a $0.15 per share decline sequentially. Half of the decline is attributable to the loss of income on the early redemption of $110 million preferred equity investment, which occurred at the end of March and the $276 million of dispositions that closed at the end of February. There is a temporary mismatch on the timing of the use of a portion of the proceeds. And as such, this is causing a $0.07 decline sequentially.  In addition, we expect commercial income to be $0.02 lower as we had onetime benefits related to better delinquency collections in the first quarter that we do not expect to repeat in the second quarter. The remaining decline relates to lower same-property NOI due to higher expected operating expenses and delinquency and higher G&A. For the full year, we are reaffirming our guidance ranges for same-property revenue, expense and NOI growth and core FFO per share.  Turning to investments. During the quarter, we received $120 million for the redemption of 2 preferred equity investments. One of the investments totaling $110 million was redeemed early as the developer was able to sell the property for a price that exceeded our pre-COVID valuation. We estimate the cap rate at 3.6% on pre-COVID rents and 3.25% on current net effective rents. As a result of the early redemption, the company received $3.5 million in prepayment penalties or $0.05 per share, which compensates us for the lost income on the portion of the investment that was made in the fourth quarter of 2020. However, for FFO purposes, we book this income as a noncore item. Given the strong demand to invest in apartments and cheap financing alternatives currently available, we may experience additional early redemptions of preferred equity investments in 2021.  Moving to the balance sheet. During the quarter, we issued $450 million of unsecured bonds with a 7-year term at an effective yield of 1.8%. The proceeds were used to refinance most of our unsecured term loans that matured over the next 2 years, allowing us to extend our maturity profile with no impact to interest expense. We now have less than $200 million of debt maturing between now and the end of 2022. Since the beginning of 2020, we have refinanced nearly 30% of our debt, taking advantage of the low interest rate environment and reducing our weighted average interest rate by 60 basis points to 3.2%. This is leading to a significant reduction in interest expense in 2021 and can be seen in the first quarter results via the $4 million reduction to interest expense compared to the prior year.  During the quarter, we raised our common dividend by 60 basis points to $8.36 per share on an annual basis, our 27th consecutive dividend increase. This is a sign of our strong balance sheet and cash flow coverage despite the effects of the pandemic. With approximately $1.4 billion of liquidity and minimum near-term funding needs, our balance sheet remains strong, and we will remain disciplined as we look for ways to invest accretively to create shareholder value.  With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for questions. Nick, it's Barb. Yes, we did have a good first quarter, and we did see some favorable outcome on our same-store growth. However, it is early in the year, and there is some uncertainty related to delinquency in eviction moratorium. So that play a factor into it. And then on the preferred equity redemptions, we do have some uncertainty there. We're likely going to exceed the high end of our guidance range on the redemption side. So we're just working through some of the timing on that, and we'll revisit it in the second quarter. Rich, this is Barb. So yes, 1Q was strong. And like we mentioned, we are tracking favorable on same-store through the first quarter. And I think what Angela alluded to in her opening remarks was that we just hit 50% reopening at this point within California. And so while we feel good about where we're at, we've had a lot of stops and starts within California over the past year, which leads us to just take a little bit more conservative approach, and we'll revisit in the second quarter. We do feel good about where things are, where fundamentals are. The wildcard is really delinquency, which we've talked about in the past. And you can see in our numbers April did increase from where we were in Q1. And so those are the things that were -- that weighed on us when we looked at our guidance. But it was -- we did trend favorably in the first quarter from a same-property perspective."

            "name": "Adam Berry",
            "content": "Nick, this is Adam. We have a number of deals in our pref pipeline right now that we're working through. The inherent challenge with pref deals is the timing and the lumpiness of when that money comes back and when it goes out. So we are working through that pipeline. We're also looking -- as more deals hit the market on the investment side, on the acquisition side, we're looking at all those as well. So working through it. John, yes. So to answer your question, we have definitely seen, as we're working through our pref pipeline, most of the developments have been in the more suburban areas. So they've been lower density, more garden-style product. And so when you look at the increases specifically to lumber, but also to some of the other materials, it is absolutely having an effect on how these deals underwrite and whether or not they'll get built. So we're seeing it, and this is the beginning of it. And developers are trying to work their way through it, and we're working with them. But we definitely see this as an obvious headwind for new supply. And then, John, what was the second part of your question? No. We don't have any of those concerns. Nothing that we see forthcoming. Brad, this is Adam. So a couple of things. The 3 dispositions that happened earlier this quarter. Those -- I actually mentioned them in last quarter's call. Those were essentially baked in Q4 of last year. And so we used most of those proceeds at the time to buy back stock as well as deploy new prefs at that point. What's changed within -- from that time until now is the redemptions. And so with that, that's $120 million that was unexpected to come back this soon. So my confidence level on redeploying that money is very high. Like I mentioned earlier, the pipeline on the prefs -- pref equity deals is pretty robust. And it does take time to work through them, but we are highly motivated to do so. And so that money will be redeployed. It's just getting there and moving as quickly as we can."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Essex Property Trust Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the Company at this time.A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found on the Company's filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall, you may begin.\nMichael Schall: Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Angela Kleiman and Barb Pak will follow me with comments, and Adam Berry is here for Q&A. Today, I will touch briefly on our full year results, expectations for 2023 and why we believe that our West Coast rental markets are positioned to outperform over the next several years. I will conclude with comments on the transaction market and the upcoming CEO transition. Overall, 2022 was a positive year for Essex as we generated full year core FFO per share growth of 16.2%, our highest year-over-year increase in a decade and 9.3% above pre-COVID levels. We attribute these strong results to relentless execution by the Essex team, improved efficiencies from the implementation of our property collections model and the strong recovery in our West Coast markets for the better part of the year. Our positive results were achieved despite the challenges associated with COVID-19 regulations in our markets. Our near-term results will remain impacted by elevated delinquency, which we estimate will represent a $0.60 per share drag on FFO in 2023 compared to our pre-COVID levels of delinquency. Notwithstanding the impact of delinquency in 2023, we believe we are entering the final phase of these challenges and that our COVID-related headwinds will be behind us in 2024. For 2023, we reaffirm our 2% market rent growth expectation across the Essex markets as shown on Page S-17 of the supplemental package, which is predicated on consensus assumptions for a slowdown in the U.S. economy driven by higher interest rates. Macroeconomic visibility is limited by a variety of factors, which translates into a wider-than-normal range of potential outcomes this year. Recent economic data highlights continued resiliency in the labor market with solid reports for job growth and unemployment claims even with elevated layoff announcements. In Essex markets, preliminary job growth for December was 3.8%, and the recent unemployment rate was only 3.2%, both outperforming national averages. Looking ahead, layoff announcements and lower job openings among large tech companies signal a softer employment outlook for 2023, which we incorporated into our forecast assumptions shown on Page S-17. Our primary challenge since early 2020 relates to the massive layoffs that occurred as a direct result of the government's response to the pandemic, which eliminated nearly 3 million jobs in California alone and force people out of densely populated areas in search of work. It has taken over two years to recover those jobs lost during the pandemic, and I'm pleased to say that the Essex markets have now fully recovered those losses. It is notable that each of the eight major metros in the Essex portfolio have now recovered from 98.8% to 100.9% of the jobs lost in the early part of the pandemic, leading us to believe that most of the slack in the housing supply-demand relationship from the pandemic no longer exists. We believe that this is a major milestone which should lead us back to our pre-pandemic growth profile once the economy stabilizes. As with past economic slowdowns, a frequent concern involves the tech companies that dominate Northern California and Seattle with nearly daily reminders of tech layoffs amplified in the newspapers. The tech sector is often volatile yet over longer periods, the industry has reliably generated top paying jobs and wealth creation that are at the foundation of a strong rental growth. A core strength of the tech industries is their ability to evolve in a cyclical process of reinvention, where the groundwork for new rounds of innovation are laid while the prior cycle is slowing. I am confident that this is what is occurring today. Going back to the 1980s, Big Tech was focused on IBM PCs and R&D efforts to improve semiconductor manufacturing, and that phase ended with the recession in the early 1990s. Growth of the Internet and e-commerce soon emerged and then later boomed and busted capping the dot-com era from which many believe tech would never recover. Instead, a wave of social and mobile products emerged 20 years ago, including Facebook, YouTube and the iPad and iPhone, setting up a much larger and more profitable era of growth. Then following the Great Recession, cloud computing and machine learning added to the next period of rapid growth, both for new start-ups and for sector leaders like Amazon, Google and Microsoft. And now despite a very similar set of concerns, many of you will have followed the explosive recent adoption of new AI products such as ChatGPT and DALL\u00b7E.Consistent with the transformative technologies of the past, the innovators and investors in artificial intelligence are overwhelmingly concentrated in our markets including OpenAI in San Francisco and Google Brain in Mountain View. And despite a broad BC slowdown last year, funding for AI increased 70% and is now poised to grow vastly more in 2023. In a recent search of the leaving 100 start-ups in artificial intelligence, we found that more are headquartered in the Bay Area than in the entire rest of the United States. Thus, it is a combination of entrepreneurial spirit, financial capital and technical talent down on the West Coast as well as housing supply constraints that drives our expectation for the West Coast to generate superior rent growth over the long term. Turning to the apartment investment markets. We continue to see muted deal volume in our West Coast markets as buyers and sellers seek to compromise on their expectations for property values and yields. A relatively small number of apartment sales indicate that property values and cap rates have not changed materially since last quarter, and cap rates generally are in the mid- to high 4% range for high-quality suburban apartments. At this point, we've seen pockets of distress mostly focused on owners subject to variable rate debt and maturing short-term loans. It's possible that an extended period of elevated interest rates and slower rent growth could create new opportunities to generate FFO and NAV per share. We sold 1 property in the fourth quarter, and we are working on other potential sales. In conclusion, assuming my math is correct, this is my 115th consecutive conference call on behalf of Essex, which will be my last given my pending retirement as CEO at the end of March. I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity to be part of the highly skilled, disciplined and focused leadership team for this great company. I'm taking a step back with full confidence in Angela's ability to lead the Company along with her determined and like-minded team. Thank you all. Finally, I have enjoyed working with so many of you in the investment community, and I thank you for your trust and support over many years. I remain confident that many great years for the Company are on the horizon. With that, I'll turn the call over to Angela Kleiman.\nAngela Kleiman: Thank you, Mike. The evolution of Essex under your 37-year leadership has been remarkable. I and the senior team are grateful for your mentorship and we'll continue to diligently serve this company as we move forward. My comments today will start with brief operational highlights of our fourth quarter performance followed by our current operating strategy and updates on key operational initiatives. Essex had a productive 2022, which included optimizing the strong leasing momentum heading into our peak leasing season, addressing delinquency and recapturing units from non-paying tenants while transforming our operating business model. These accomplishments are the results of the exceptionally hardworking operations and support teams thoughtfully executing our business strategy amidst highly dynamic market conditions. Great job, team. Moving on to the fourth quarter. We shifted to an occupancy-focused strategy in late September in anticipation of softening demand and elevated move-outs related to eviction activity. The confluence of these factors created a challenging operating environment in the final months of 2022. Our switch to favoring occupancy helped us moderate the seasonal weakness and the elevated turnover caused by higher evictions. Excluding L.A. and Alameda Counties, I am pleased to report that we have made significant progress recapturing approximately 50% of delinquent units compared to one year ago. In addition, as we start the new year, demand fundamentals have improved in line with our expectations. Our net effective new lease rates troughed at the end of November, and we have been able to reduce concessions while gradually increasing new lease rates from December to January on a sequential basis. In the near term, we will maintain our occupancy-focused strategy as we continue to make progress on eviction-related turnover. Our portfolio sits at a healthy 96.4% financial occupancy today, and we are well positioned to increase rents if demand exceeds our expectations. Turning to key operations initiatives. We continue to make progress with our property collections operating model. Phase 1 is now complete, which centralized administrative and leasing functions, which combine nearby properties into onecentrally managed business unit. The efficiency benefit can be seen in our financial results with administrative expense growth of only 0.7% last year. And for 2023, we anticipate only a 3% increase despite inflationary pressures. Phase 2 expands the same operating principles to the maintenance function.We expect numerous benefits, including savings from reduction in third-party vendor contracts in unit churn efficiencies. The maintenance collections pilot is progressing well and is expected to conclude midyear. At that point, we will provide additional details on the rollout. Lastly, on the technology front, we continue to make excellent progress, most recently with the launch of our proprietary revenue management software. We have been developing this capability over the past two years and are excited for a platform with an integrated pricing and operating strategy tailored for the nuances in our markets. This concludes my remarks, and I will now turn the call over to Barb Pak.\nBarb Pak: Thanks, Angela. Today, I will focus on our 2023 guidance, followed by comments on investments and the balance sheet. Our 2023 guidance assumes same-property revenue growth of 4% at the midpoint on a cash basis. Overall, we expect healthy top line growth and stable occupancy to be partially offset by 70 basis points of higher delinquency. The reason we believe delinquency will be higher than 2022 is due to uncertainty around the timing of evictions in all of our markets. In addition, we do not expect to receive much in the way of Emergency Rental Assistance as compared to $34 million we received last year on a same-store basis. As it relates to operating expenses, we are forecasting a 5% increase at the midpoint, which is above our historical run rate. There are a couple of reasons for the higher-than-expected increase. First, controllable expenses are forecasted to increase 4%, which is driven by wage inflation and elevated eviction-related costs, partially offset by savings we achieved via the rollout of our property collections model last year. Second, we are experiencing elevated cost pressures within utilities and insurance. In total, we expect same-property NOI growth of [3.6%] at the midpoint. In terms of core FFO, our midpoint assumes 1.6% growth. The primary reasons for the modest increase include higher interest expense and delinquency and lower structured finance income, which are outlined on Page 6 of the earnings release.In total, these items equate to a $0.57 per share headwind, representing nearly a 4% reduction to growth on a year-over-year basis. Turning to investments. Given the challenging investment environment and our elevated cost of capital, we have not provided specific estimates for new acquisitions as it is difficult to generate accretion today given the significant disconnect between public and private market pricing. Given this disconnect, the best way to create value today is through asset sales and share buybacks or via preferred equity investments all of which we completed in 2022. It should be noted that we have a long track record of finding ways to create NAV and FFO per share in all environments, and we will maintain that discipline going forward, while at the same time, match funding our investments on a leverage-neutral basis. As it relates to the structured finance portfolio, during the quarter, we completed a comprehensive review of our investments performing a wide range of sensitivity analysis on a variety of key metrics. The analysis confirmed the portfolio is performing as expected with the exception of two investments, both located within the Oakland submarket. One of the investments was redeemed in the fourth quarter, resulting in a $2 million impairment. For the other investment, we took a conservative approach given the uncertainty around fundamentals in Oakland due to high apartment deliveries, which is leading to an elevated concessionary environment. As a result, we stopped accruing on this investment during the fourth quarter, resulting in a $0.06 reduction to our 2023 guidance. Overall, we have a long successful track record of investing in structured finance investments. Over the past 12 years, we have invested approximately $690 million in structured finance investments that have been fully redeemed, achieving a 13% average annual return for our shareholders. Lastly, on to the balance sheet. During the quarter, we saw a continued improvement in our credit metrics with net debt-to-EBITDA returning to pre-COVID levels at a healthy 5.6x, with no debt maturing on our consolidated balance sheet until 2024, limited development funding needs and ample liquidity, our balance sheet remains in a strong position. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citi.\nNick Joseph: First of all, congratulations again, Mike and Angela. Mike, I appreciate the comments on kind of the tech cycle and future thoughts there. But what gives you the comfort that the benefit for any recovery or the eventual recovery, I guess, in tech will accrue mostly to the West Coast markets like we've seen in the past versus maybe some of the more newer tech markets or Sun Belt markets given population and job growth trends that we've seen there?\nMichael Schall: Well, thank you for the congratulations. I appreciate it. I think tech is just growing in terms of its share of the overall employment base. So we expect tech to grow throughout the United States and certainly wouldn't exclude the Sun Belt. But I think that as with the past, most of the cutting-edge technology and the people that are really driving innovation will be located as they have been in the past here on the West Coast. So that gives us a great deal of comfort. And I went through that relatively long description of my career here and what tech has done really because of that because we've seen it reinvent itself so many times over and over again. And I would have a hard time believing that, that is anywhere close to being at an end. And -- and finally, I guess I would add that the prospects and the importance of AI to almost any -- every application from businesses to consumers, et cetera. is pretty extraordinary. So I think this is going to continue onward. And I think that we'll be right in the center of that innovation here on the West Coast.\nNick Joseph: Yes. AI innovation is pretty exciting. And then just on the structured finance program, I guess two questions. Just number one, for the asset in Oakland that you're not accruing income. Can you walk through how that potentially could play out going forward in terms of your role there? And then it sounds like you're in an analysis across everything and everything -- all the other are performing as expected. But are there any on the watch list or potentially maybe could become issues?\nBarb Pak: Hi, Nick.It's Barb. Yes, we did a comprehensive review. And on the rest of the portfolio, we don't have any other assets that are on the watch list. Keep in mind, we leaned-in heavily in 2020 and prior when cap rates were higher, NOI has grown significantly since we started this portfolio. And so none of the other properties screened high on the capital stack. The one in Oakland is really a function of the high concessionary environment right now. Net effective rents are lower, NOI is lower than how we underwrote it. And so we're higher in the stack than what we'd like to be. So that's why we took a conservative approach to stop accruing. We have constant dialogue with the sponsor and they're very engaged in our participating rating checks as needed. And so we don't see any other fall out at this time from that asset.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan.\nAnthony Paolone: Thank you. And add my well wishes and congrats to you, Mike, as well. First question is I think last quarter and at NAREIT, you talked about a week of free rent, I think, in Seattle, in a couple of weeks in San Francisco. And just wondering where those numbers sit today? And whether or not you feel like you've seen the effect of all the layoffs that have really been announced since the fall?\nAngela Kleiman: It's Angela here. On the concessions, we have seen it essentially taper off throughout the portfolio since December, which is basically I've mentioned earlier that our portfolio trough late November and it significantly improved as an overall average in the fourth quarter, particularly in December. We were running about two weeks concessions. And right now, it's a portfolio average, we're running less than a week. So that gives you an indication of directionally how things have improved pretty quickly.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. And then just one follow-up for Barb. You gave us the bad debt, like the per share drag and the 70 basis points on growth. But if I look at the fourth quarter, it was 1.1%, I think,is there a way to express it in those terms in terms of where your expectations are for 2023?\nBarb Pak: Yes, Tony. For 2023, we're expecting bad debt as a percent of schedule rent to be 2%. Now keep in mind, we don't expect any Emergency Rental Assistance in 2023 as compared to the $34 million we received on a same-store basis in 2022. And so that's why the net number is going to increase. We were at 1.3% in 2022, and it's going to 2%. Now the underlying gross delinquency is improving because we are able to evict. It's just taking longer than we had initially expected, but we are making progress on that front, as Angela mentioned in her script.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with Robert W. Baird.\nWesley Golladay: Good morning, everyone, and congrats again, Mike. I'm curious how the supply pressure changed throughout the year? And at what point did you start to push rate?\nMichael Schall: Wes, thank you for the congrats. I appreciate that. In terms of supply pressure, there are pots of supply in a few places. We noted Oakland earlier, I think there are multiple lease-ups in Oakland, which are really having the effect of pushing down price. Seattle has more supply deliveries this year and especially the fourth quarter because it's generally a seasonally weak period, and Seattle tends to be weaker than the California markets, primarily because demand goes to zero in the fourth quarter or close to zero, and Seattle has more supply of apartments. But going forward, the supply picture looks like it's declining. And this is a result of obviously lack of rent growth for the last few years. So the ability to produce housing at an accretive level is pretty challenged, and we see that in our preferred equity book as well. And so I think it's going to be -- we're going to be in a period where there's relatively not a lot of supply. And if we get any demand, we'll be in good shape.\nWesley Golladay: Got it. And then just curious, what happened to all these people that are evicted, if you have a new tenant coming in, say, in June, will you know if they were a nonpayer if they're a prior apartment? Or is just everyone going to swap non-paying tenants?\nAngela Kleiman: Well, on the tenants renting front, we have a pretty robust process there. Having said that, we, of course, will do credit checks and that will let us know if they are not -- or they have any prior debt that needs to be paid. And so that's our best indicator on that front.\nWesley Golladay: Okay. So that would be a relatively timely event. I guess there's like the ties that are not paying -- it's already in the books for you as a delinquent tenant?\nAngela Kleiman: Right, right. And in fact, even for us, for tenants who have left, we have -- we immediately have updated the credit report as well on our end. And there is, of course, ongoing report on ongoing debt. So there are various resources that we can use and we have used.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc.\nAustin Wurschmidt: I wanted to revisit the delinquency. I think last quarter, you referenced L.A. County was, I believe, 40% of the overall delinquency. What is that figure today? And then I'm curious on the $0.60 per share, what is the annualized run rate that you'll be running at or that you're assuming by the fourth quarter of 2023?\nAngela Kleiman: I'll just touch on the delinquency population.It\u2019s Angela here. In the past, L.A. is about 40%, and it's ticked up to about 50% L.A. delinquency, and that doesn't surprise us given the eviction moratorium has not been lifted. We had expected L.A. to continue to accrue under the delinquency basis. However, the good news is that the new tenants coming in, we're not seeing those tenants [indiscernible] prior tenants.\nBarb Pak: And then Austin, this is Barb. On the $0.60 that Mike referred to, that is compared to our pre-COVID historical run rate for not only the revenue piece, but also the expense piece because we have elevated eviction and turnover costs associated with the delinquency. And so it's both pieces. What we are expecting in the back half of the year is our delinquency.Our gross delinquency will be around 1.5% for the second half of the year, 2% for the full year. So we do expect to make progress, but given the timing on these evictions is very difficult to predict at this point. We don't expect to be to our normalized run rate by the end of the year.\nAustin Wurschmidt: That's fair. Just trying to understand what sort of the earnings power going into 2024 is, but we'll haveto revisit that later this year. Second question, you referenced your shift to favouring occupancy late last year. And you highlighted some month-over-month improvement from December to January. I guess what would it take for you guys to pivot towards going back to pushing rate? And would that mean that the 5.5% renewal rate growth that you are at in January could stabilize or even reaccelerate from here or would the benefit accret more towards new lease rates?\nAngela Kleiman: That's a good question. In terms of the occupancy strategy, and when we would shift, it's going to be a little bit different in each of the markets. So for example, we actually are seeing great strength in our Southern California portfolio. However, we are running a little bit higher occupancy in anticipation of the eviction and the opportunities to vacate non-paying units that's coming our way. So we're building that not because we're seeing a market softness issue, it's more of a strategic play to ensure that we are well positioned. And so for example, in places like Seattle, which is, as we noted, highly seasonal, when we see demand come back as it typically does during peak leasing season. We would expect that we should be able to switch back to favoring rent growth, especially now that we've been able to reduce our concessions in a meaningful way.\nAustin Wurschmidt: And is it safe to assume that Northern California has a similar setup as Seattle in terms of some seasonality, maybe and the opportunity being to be able to push a little bit harder as we come out of the seasonal low, if you will?\nAngela Kleiman: Yes, that makes sense. And the one caveat is, of course, the supply conversation that we talked earlier, right? So for example, places like Oakland that will continue to probably take a little bit longer, because of the supply. But in areas where we are not trying to manage through pockets of supply, there are some good opportunities there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore.\nSteveSakwa: Mike, offer my congratulations as well to you and to Angela on the transition. I guess the question, when you think about the cadence and timing of revenue growth, can you maybe just talk about how you think that progresses throughout the year and maybe what the first half looks like versus the second half? I realize there are some shifts in the delinquency numbers that Barb just spoke about. But when you kind of look at that sort of midpoint, say, 4% on a CAC basis, how heavy is that in the first half? And I guess, how light is that in the second half?\nBarb Pak: Yes, Steve, it's Barb. I would say the first half we expect to be higher than the second half. We're about 5% in the first half. The first quarter will probably be north of that, and then it will trend down throughout the year with 3% on average in the second half of the year. And that's really a function of the year-over-year comps because last year, while rents accelerated, it didn't fully hit our revenue growth line.And so, we expect to capture that this year. First half will be higher than the second half.\nSteveSakwa: Okay. And you talked a lot about -- well, I guess, let me just say on occupancy for kind of the second question. But when you think about some of the potential soft points that Mike talked about in tech, I guess how are you thinking about maybe some of the potential occupancy loss in either Seattle or San Francisco or what have you baked in, I guess, specifically for the Bay Area and Seattle from an occupancy perspective?\nAngela Kleiman: So from an occupancy perspective, we're not running at a whole lot different than prior periods. The one caveat is really more focused on Southern California particularly L.A. because we're anticipating some vacancies there from eviction. So for example, we saw the similar headwind in Northern California in the fourth quarter, and we anticipated that. So we employ the same strategy. So it's really more focused on some of these unique situation as we come out of COVID related legislation really to position us for better growth.\nBarb Pak: And Mike, do you want to talk about employment?\nMichael Schall: Yes. Let me just add one more quick thing. Steve, a big question here is what is going to happen to the pace of employment. As I noted in the prepared remarks, job growth has been really strong. However, maybe some of the layoffs or the warm notices haven't actually showed up in job growth yet. So our expectation for the year -- just to remind everyone, on S-17 was for minus 2% -- 0.2% job growth for the U.S. And so, we're going to be watching job growth over the next several months. But it seems like we are running stronger than we expected, certainly with respect to January's job growth number. And if that continues, then you get to a point where maybe our U.S. job growth estimate on S-17 is too conservative. So we'll watch that closely.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Good morning out there and just joining in. Mike, congratulations on your tenure,on your last earnings call; and Angela, best on taking the helm next quarter. So two questions. First, maybe just sticking with that job rebound, Mike, you had mentioned early on in COVID when everything in California was shut down, a lot of the service industries, those jobs literally had a fleet because they were closed down. They could work whereas a lot of tech people could work from home. As you talked about that really strong job rebound in December in the benefit, California has recovered all of its jobs. How would you rate -- when we see these headlines of the layoffs versus it sounds like there is pretty good job growth. Is it more of the job growth coming from the service jobs and maybe that's what you're seeing more demand in your apartments? Or as you look at your resident mix profile, you're like, look, our resident mix profile today is really no different than it was back in 2019.\nMichael Schall: Yes, Alex. I think things are normalizing from the pandemic period. And -- but I would say, yes, we are recovering leisure, hospitality and other service jobs at a very high rate, and that continues onward. And -- but it appears to be normalizing. But also the tech job growth during the pandemic was incredibly strong. And we think that some of the more recent tech announcements are just sort of giving back a small portion of the job gains that occurred during the pandemic. So we don't even considered tech to be all that weak at this point in time. I think it's just transitioning from what it was and taking the next step or the next chapter of things. So overall, we think jobs are on the right track. Again, our S-17 was based on the consensus estimates of all the big economists in the U.S. and it's possible, and it almost seems like whatever weakness we might have is be a pushback because we're stronger earlier, which would probably be a net benefit for this year if that continues. And so we'll be paying close attention to that. And I want to maybe go into the -- two more things actually. One is the warn notices, and we had our data analytics team do an analysis of the major, the largest layoffs announced and what portion of them are in California and Washington versus the total. So this is Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Salesforce and Cisco. They globally have 1.6 million employees and the layoff rate is about 4% or 64,000 announced layoffs. In the California, Washington market, the employees of those companies in these markets are about 335,000 people, and there's about 10,000 layoffs. So the percentage of layoff is lower actually in California and Washington as compared to the broader enterprise. So I think that is important. And finally, it's interesting, the unemployment rates are so low. San Francisco, 2.2%, in San Jose, 2.4% and everyone under the U.S. average, except for Los Angeles, which is at 4.5%, no doubt that's because people are drawing benefits and able to stay in our apartment subject to the eviction moratorium.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then the second question is just getting back to the delinquencies, I think you guys have highlighted obviously L.A. and Oakland. Is that the bulk of what's driving delinquencies this year? And then as a consequence, especially in L.A. with the good cause of eviction, should we assume that you guys will look to pair your exposure to L.A. County?\nMichael Schall: Yes, let me talk about that and Angela or someone else may have a comment. But the two really difficult eviction moratoria are in Alameda County, which is Oakland and L.A., L.A. City expired. However, L.A. County extended to March 31. Actually, L.A. City was a really horrible ordinance. L.A. County is not nearly as restrictive. For example, it only applies to 80% median income tenants, for example. And so there's a little bit of relief in L.A. And in terms of exiting L.A., I think that, that is -- it depends. I mean, we will exit -- enter and exit markets as we deem necessary using a much broader set of criteria for supply-demand analysis, rent growth expectations, cap rates, et cetera. And so that will drive that discussion as well as jobs and some of these other issues.\nBarb Pak: Yes, Alex, on the delinquent unit front, L.A. and Alameda are the bulk of our delinquent units over 60% our delinquent units long term greater than three months or in LA Alameda. And so that's a factor as well as the slowdown in the court, courts are really bogged down. It's taking longer to vice in our other markets, and that is a factor as well in the '23 guidance to recapture those units.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nBrad Heffern: Mike, last quarter, you said that the 2% rent growth forecast seemed pretty dire at the time, and it was more based on what the Fed was doing and projections from economists and what you're actually seeing on the ground. I know you reiterated the 2%, but your commentary around employment seems to suggest that you still think it's a somewhat pessimistic outlook. Am I interpreting that right?\nMichael Schall: I think Angela and Barb will kick me if I do anything that I say anything that's inconsistent with our published position. I mean the reality is, I don't know. And in the comments I referred to a range of outcomes that's broader than historically we've been able to triangulate in the past for most of the past, the relationship of supply and demand much more -- much better than we can this year. So, there are more moving pieces and given that inherent uncertainty, I still think that is within the range of potential outcomes. But again, we'll be watching job growth and more notices and all those various items for better visibility. Notably, a warm notice out there may not have hit the layoff part of the reported job growth. So, there's a lag there. And so it's a little bit unfair to comment on that until we see how that plays out.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. Fair enough. And then non-revenue-generating CapEx seemed elevated in the fourth quarter. And I think the 2022 total was up about 40% year-over-year. What's driving that? And can you give any expectation for where '23 will shake out?\nAngela Kleiman: Sure. It's Angela here. The -- I think it may be helpful to just talk about how we look at CapEx because looking at a one-year number can be misleading. Our CapEx program is for each property on a 10-year plan. And so, on years where there is a large improvement that we made in replacement, for example, it's going to show up and it's going to look lumpy. So -- but having said that, in 2022, we also had to catch up from the -- when we paused the activities in 2020. So for example, pre-COVID, we're running closer to about $1,700 per door. And in 2020, we were down to like $1,300. So, over 20% increase. And so you play that forward a couple of years later, there is that lag effect. So that's what you're seeing as well. If you look at a, say, 10-year average, our CapEx per door is pretty similar to where our peers are. Now we do have a little older portfolio on average. So, it naturally we should run a slightly higher CapEx per door. So that's -- sorry for the long winter answer, but there's just a little bit more to it than just one number per year. And next year, we're evaluating the expectations you have also inflation. So, it's probably going to be similar to 2023, I mean 2022, but like I said, over a period of time, over a long period of time, it should revert to a long-term average.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Kim: Congrats to everyone. I wanted to ask about the pricing of Anavia, which seemed better than expected given the interest rate environment. Any commentary you could provide on this pricing if it's reflective of other asset sales that you're working on? And sort of on a related topic, the matching tax in L.A., what do you think that's going to have the impact that we'll have on both the transaction market near term and pricing?\nAdam Berry: Sure. John, this is Adam. So, beginning with Anavia. Anavia was, I'd say, an opportunistic sale to -- there was a very specific buyer and which -- that's reflected in the pricing. Generally speaking, we're seeing cap rates kind of trading in the market in the mid- to high fours. So Anavia, I'd say, outperform that by a bit again just because this very specific situation. Regarding the mansion tax in L.A., so we've seen a slight elevated potential transaction volume in L.A. due to the mansion tax coming into effect April 1. For the most part, I think most of those deals probably won't trade just given they were all on very short runways and pricing expectations just doesn't seem like they are being met. Going forward, I think we've seen this in Washington when they their transfer tax up. It actually did not affect transaction volume generally at all. I think the one thing that may be an outcome of the L.A. management tax is, it could potentially hinder development within Los Angeles, any significant headwind to development returns, especially from merchant builders, that's just going to affect their back end and make it that much harder to build.\nJohn Kim: Okay. My second question is just a follow-up on delinquencies. It looks like it's going to be $40 million on a gross basis this year. How does that compare to last year? We estimated at about $57 million just based on your disclosure. I just wanted to make sure that was accurate. And as part of that, can the ERA surprise to the upside, there's not much baked in guidance?\nBarb Pak: John, I may have to follow up with you on those numbers. I want to get back to my office and have the model in front of me. So I don't know if I want to quote the numbers here on the call. In terms of ERA, that would be upside if we were to collect some, but we've exhausted most of that so that we don't expect much in the way of ERA. The one thing I would keep in mind though, is we do have $90 million uncollected bad debt cumulative since the start of COVID. We only have a $3.4 million accounts receivable balance. We think we'll collect more than $3.4 million. It's just a timing of when we're going to collect that. So that is upside to the numbers. It's just -- we don't have that baked into our forecast given the inherent nature of when we're going to collect that. But that's really the upside is on that front more so than even ERA, I would say.\nJohn Kim: Okay. Just -- I'll follow up with you off-line, but that $57 million we calculated from the change in cumulative plus the ERA you received last year, but I'll follow up offline.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Sorry if I missed it, but did you guys say we're sending out new and renewal notices today?\nAngela Kleiman: It's Angela here. No, we haven't talked about that. Our new and renewals are sending out somewhere between say, 4% to 5% depending on the market. So this is for very March. But keep in mind that does get negotiated. So if we're sending a renewal, say, north of 5%, we assume maybe 100 basis points negotiation depending on when and in some of these markets, we're sending out well in advance. So for example, Seattle, it goes out six months in advance. So hopefully, that gives you a better sense of the range of outcomes.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. Yes. No, that's helpful. And then Fiber, I wanted to touch base on -- you mentioned prediction costs and same-store expenses and I guess those from being elevated. I guess how are those showing up in same-store expenses? And then if you kind of normalize for those, what would your same-store expense look like?\nBarb Pak: Yes. So, eviction costs show up in our administrative line. And obviously, we have elevated turnover as well, and that's in the R&M line. So it's in both lines. So, I would say in total relative to our historical average. Our controllables are forecasted to be 4% this year, but without the elevated eviction and turnover costs, we think we'd be closer to 3%. So it's about 100 basis points impact to the controllable line item for the year.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. That's awesome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.\nNick Yulico: First question is just in terms of when you're looking at some of your data on move-outs, maybe you could talk about how that's trending in terms of reasons for move-outs, job losses versus rents being too high or even move out to other regions?\nAngela Kleiman: It's Angela here. That's interesting because we keep expecting big shifts coming out of COVID under the move-out reasons. And moving out to buy home really still hasn't changed from long-term average. I think because the cost of housing here is just a lot less affordable job transfers or other reasons, pretty darn similar and to our historical averages. And so, we have not seen any material change on move-out.\nNick Yulico: Okay. And then just other question is on move-ins. Whether you're seeing any benefit from return to office, which has been a little bit of a slower process in some markets on the West Coast. I mean are you seeing any benefit from that in recent months, whether it's specific cities in the portfolio or even from your move-in data, if you are seeing any instances of people relocating back into your markets because we're now required to be in some sort of hybrid job in an office in your markets increasingly. And I'll just as well, congrats Angela and Mike as well.\nAngela Kleiman: Congrats and once again, another good question on the in-migration. It's -- so I have mentioned that in the third quarter, we saw a pretty big uptick on the immigration to our market, 30% to 35% on average between Northern and Southern California. And of course, part of that is attributed to return to office. We have seen that trend continue in the fourth quarter. But keep in mind, fourth quarter is typically just a low demand period. So it's really difficult for us to be a particular trend. The only thing I can tell you is that compared to the first quarter, the in-migration is still better marginally, we're not talking huge numbers from that perspective, once again, fourth quarter is just a tough time to trying to get an indication of that. Mike, do you have anything you want to add?\nMichael Schall: Yes. I just wanted to maybe add, we do some work, again, data analytics team that deals with micro com-patterns. And I guess I want to make a comment that it seems to be normalizing as well. Again, you had that mass exodus early on in the pandemic. And we been making progress and just back to the point where we've effectively placed all those jobs, but the places where people are coming from and going to, again, using LinkedIn data, not our own data appear to be pretty similar to what they were in the past. So generally speaking, the migration pattern here is we give people from the large Eastern and Midwestern metros. And actually, more recently, Dallas and Atlanta are on that list of incoming in the top and the place where people go, typically, people will retire, sell their house in California, their expensive house a new part of their retirement plan. And so, they go to a less expensive West Coast cities, notably Phoenix, Denver, Las Vegas.\nNick Yulico: Appreciate that, Mike. Any plans to move or you stay in California?\nMichael Schall: I'm staying and I'm looking forward to spending some time with the grandkids and that type of stuff. And I'm still going to be around, if Angela will have me, a role to be determined. So I love the Company and love what I do here. So not ready to completely check in this whole thing is really driven by Angela being ready, and that's what's important. And so do a great job. I'm very confident.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nAdam Kramer: And congrats again. Look, I just wanted to ask about, obviously, tech markets overall, right, where you guys are located, but maybe just kind of specifically, the tech exposure among your tenant base, if you have that number. Look, I get that they're kind of secondary, secondary tech jobs and secondary exposures to kind of tech jobs within your markets, but maybe just kind of explicitly tenants who are employed by tech employers if you kind of have that percentage for your residents.\nAngela Kleiman: Yes, that's a good question. What we do is we track the top six because everything else is just too fungible on that number. So currently, we're about 7% of our tenant base is linked -- directly linked to the top six tech companies. And of course, it's much more concentrated in Northern California and Seattle relatively speaking. But that's a very manageable base. And of course, in certain assets or properties are -- that has a much closer proximity to the headquarters, the percentage will be disproportionately higher.\nNick Yulico: And how does that 7% kind of compared to maybe pre-COVID or last year historical average types of numbers?\nBarb Pak: Not a big change. We tend to kind of run between, say, 5% to 7%, and it kind of hovers around there?\nAdam Kramer: Got it. That's really helpful. And maybe just switching gears, wondering kind of the new versus renewal trends new lease kind of modestly negative and then kind of still in the 5% range for renewals for January, look, I think conceptually, if I understand correctly, if that trend kind of continues maybe would form kind of a game lease. So wondering maybe your thoughts on that, if you could kind of see that happening or maybe kind of renewal and new converge over time and kind of that gain to lease is informed?\nAngela Kleiman: Yes, A couple of things. I just want to give you a little background first on the new lease rates. That, of course, is heavily impacted by our concessionary strategy, which is related to our occupancy strategy. And so part of that is not as much a market issue versus a strategy issue, and of course, that is something that we shift quickly away from the concessionary environment in January. And so, I don't want you to think that this is something permanent here to stay. And so -- but ultimately, with the renewal rate in an environment where new leases are on our S-16 expected to be about 2%, there is going to be a convergence of new lease and renewal rates and it'll probably take this full year to have that play out.\nAdam Kramer: Really appreciate it.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Goldsmith: My first question is when is FX current exposure to corporate housing? And then how do we reconcile the impact of job losses with a return to the office?\nAngela Kleiman: I'm sorry. Can you repeat the first part on corporate housing?\nMichael Goldsmith: What is your current exposure to corporate housing?\nAngela Kleiman: Corporate exposure. Got it. Got it. So our current exposure is about 3%. And what's interesting about that number is during COVID, it actually went down to zero. And so we've been building that up. So last year, it was around -- got up to about 2.5%. Now keep in mind, in Seattle, it's going to move around because they -- it's a temporary nature, right? It comes in pretty heavy during the seasonal peak around July, and that can ramp the portfolio up to 7% and then goes back down around October as they leave. So, there's inherent -- there's an inherent cyclicality to that tenant basis.\nMichael Goldsmith: Got it. And my second question relates to the regulatory environment. Obviously, the markets that you operate and have gotten increasingly difficult -- increasingly difficult, whether it's rent controlled, Prop. 13, Seattle and Washington State potentially becoming an issue. So maybe can you walk through kind of your updated thoughts around this? And then whether you would look to diversify your portfolio over time, just given some -- given the more challenging operating environment?\nMichael Schall: Yes. No, that's a great question, and I'll handle that one. Yes, we have been maybe a little bit surprised just how aggressive some of these actions are. We have a pretty strong advocacy effort that is driven by CAA in California and the local -- one of the local groups up in the Washington area. And so, we spend a lot of time working with those organizations and trying to advocate against those policies. Almost always those policies are sold on the basis of being good for the housing industry. And when, of course, we all know that, in fact, is exactly 100% wrong. It's the exact opposite. So, unfortunately, it's something that we have to deal with, and it is concerning to us and we spend a lot of time on it. The proposal in Washington is still very early on in the process. It's in the house, and it hasn't come out of committees. And as a result of that, I think there's still a long way to go. Again, we will be monitoring that. And -- but all of these different proposals tend to make California less appealing to a landlord and increase the risk of that occurring. So, to your point about other markets, I think I want to reiterate what I said before, which is we are tracking more markets now, 25 major metros across the country. We are looking for specific things. The things that essentially attracted us to California 30 years ago, let's say, and trying to rank those markets in terms of appeal and whether they can compete with the California markets. And we have some interest in some of them. I don't want to get into great detail at this point in time. But as I've said before, and I think actually, this last couple of quarters has played this out why this is important, it's about timing, and it's about making a shift at the appropriate time when our cost of capital is appealing, and we can enter at a point where we can feel like rent growth is going to continue in any of the markets across the country, including our market, San Diego, notably, Orange County, et cetera, if you get 30% to 40% rent increases, you're going to have a lot of supply that we'll hit. And you just can't keep growing. There has to be some change. The markets become unaffordable. The average person can't afford the rent in that location that causes people to move further out to find more affordable housing. The markets, in a certain sense, have a self-correcting mechanism in them. And this has always been the case. It's true here, it's true everywhere. And so we're going to thoughtfully make that decision at the appropriate time. Does that help?\nMichael Goldsmith: No, that was really helpful. Congratulations, everyone.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Pawlowski: Adam, I wanted to follow up on your transaction market comments. Just curious, how you see the depth of the bid at the cap rates you throw out there. It'd be brought a substantial number of assets to the market, do you think they would trade in those then to high four cap rates you suggest?\nAdam Berry: We're still seeing a gap between the bid and the ask. But we are we are seeing, I'd say, a muted volume of deals going down in that mid- to high 4s. So yes, if we got back to, I'd say, kind of normal volume, I think that's where we shake out today.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. Just so, I understand those cap rates, are those kind of initial buyer cap rates? Or are those your disposition yields?\nAdam Berry: Well, so for Anavia specifically, what we quoted in the statement was disposition yield. What I'm saying the mid to high 4s, that's more of a buyer cap rate.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. Last question for me. Just Angela, curious for your thoughts on just the topic of just COVID impacts fully reversing. So as COVID in the rearview mirror, would you expect market rents in any of your Southern California markets that have seen huge cumulative rent growth to actually see absolute declines in market rents over the next few years?\nAngela Kleiman: Keep in mind that market rent growth is a function of demand and supply. And so at this point, even looking out the next couple of years, supply is still relatively muted in Southern California and pre-COVID environment Southern California have performed really well. And so Southern California has similar employer base as the broad U.S. market. That's why we like it. It's less volatile, but it has a higher level of professional services, so better earning power. And for that reason, Southern California continues to be stable. And so, we wouldn't expect that because of COVID, absent the fact it's going to just suddenly fall apart.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nAnthony Powell: Just a question on the impact of return to work on the outlook in the -- on the West Coast. A lot of the technology firms have announced the office space rationalization, office space sales, could that be a headwind for rent growth in the next couple of years even if you have higher job growth, fewer people are in the cities because they're doing more hybrid work as these firms kind of reduce their footprint?\nMichael Schall: Yes. Anthony, it's Mike here. Most of our portfolio actually is suburban in nature. So we have relatively little in cities -- and but we're thinking that return to office is something that will slowly evolve -- and there will be -- maybe we go from an average of two days a week in the office to three days a week in the office. And that will all -- anything that is more office-centric will pull people closer to our apartment community. So that would be a positive impact in our view. And so at this point in time, because people have moved further from the offices and that has cause us to readjust sort of our template for looking for potential acquisitions and other things. But over time, I think that all of us, including, I'd say, here at Essex, we have some of the same issues that we're better off. We're more productive. We make better decisions when we're together as a management group -- senior leadership group and super important to the overall results of the Company. So we think that return to office will be ultimately a tailwind.\nAnthony Powell: Maybe one more in terms of just been on buybacks, you made some good promise there last year. Do you think if fire-sell starts to agree that you can maybe increase the buyback amount year-over-year as you sell more assets?\nBarb Pak: Yes. This is Barb. We'll assess that based on deal volume and whether we can create NAV and FFO per share. It's hard for me to tell you right now that we can do that in this environment. But it is something that we're cognizant of we have shown that we can run the machine and reverse many times over many different cycles. And so we'll be willing to do that if the right opportunities present themselves.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.\nHaendel St. Juste: And my congratulations on a fantastic career and all the best of your next chapter and best of luck Angela. So I just had a couple of follow-up questions left here on our list. I guess, first, I want to go back to expenses. Barb, I think you mentioned controllable expenses, you're expecting to be at 4% this year as part of the 5% guide, which I think is higher than a lot of us expected. So maybe can you go through a bit more of the building blocks of that 5% expense growth and maybe if there is any contrast versus say, Seattle, which doesn't have the Prop 13 benefit that California does? And if there is any benefit from the rollout of the property collections platform you mentioned earlier? Thanks.\nBarb Pak: Yes, Haendel, on the expense growth, the 5%, really the biggest driver of that is non-controllables. That's up 5.5% to 6%. And really, the key factors are in utilities, were up 10% this year. We do expect high single-digit increases next year. Insurance is expected to be up 20% next year, is a very difficult insurance market. And then on real estate taxes, we've budgeted a 4.25% increase and that's really being driven by Seattle reverting more to our historical norms. So, those are the key building blocks on the non-controllable piece. On the controllable piece, 4% at the midpoint, and we do expect admin to be up only 3%. Once again, we do have elevated eviction costs in that line, which is masking some of the benefits from the rollout of the central services or the property collections model that we rolled out last year that centralized some of those functions. So, it's masking it a little bit this year. But overall, that should give you the major building blocks for why we have a little bit elevated expense growth.\nHaendel St. Juste: No, that's helpful. I appreciate that. But just so we're clear, how much impact in a more normalized environment would that property collections platform have?\nBarb Pak: Well, so I said the eviction costs are about a 1% impact to controllable. So that's the factor you can use is it would be 1% lower.\nHaendel St. Juste: Appreciate it. What's the assumption built into the guide for turnover this year and year-end occupancy?\nBarb Pak: Occupancy, we've assumed is stable year-over-year, so flat, no change there. And then in terms of turnover, we did see elevated turnover in the fourth quarter. And given the eviction headwinds that we expect to face in getting the delinquent units back, we do expect turnover to be a little bit more elevated than historical norms. But it's good because then we get tenants in that are paying rent. So, we think that's actually a good thing.\nHaendel St. Juste: Okay. That's all for me.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nJamie Feldman: I just want to go back to a comment you made earlier in the call about distressed acquisitions, distressed acquisition opportunities coming up with some owners with floating rate debt. Can you talk more about what you're seeing, the magnitude? And do you think that's going to be something that pros as an opportunity set?\nAdam Berry: Jamie, this is Adam. So we haven't seen much of that to date. We are -- it's more on the structured finance platform where we're seeing more opportunities on existing deals with maturing debt or with expiring rate caps. We do think this will accelerate into the year and provide potentially more opportunities like I said, probably more focused on the truck and finance platform versus acquisitions, but looking at it from everyday.\nJamie Feldman: Okay. And then I guess, sticking with structured finance, the impairments you took, how should we think about that, the risk profile of those investments versus the rest of the book or even deals going forward? Like was that just kind of at the higher end of your risk profile? Or the market conditions really just change that quickly that led to the impairments?\nBarb Pak: Yes, I would say it's the latter. We didn't change our underwriting on that investment. We didn't go out wider on the risk spectrum or the curve. It really is a function of the Oakland market highly concessionary the developer wanted to sell, and we ultimately agreed to the sale. Now keep in mind, we actually made money on our investment for shareholders. We invested $11.5 million in this project, and we got redeemed $14 million. So, we made 7% annually for our shareholders, the coupon was 10%. So, we didn't quite earn what we thought we were going to earn, but we thought it was in the best interest of shareholders to take their money back and redeploy elsewhere. And so, we didn't lose money. And I think it is a unique function of that market. Right now, given I think there's 16 lease-ups in the market right now.\nJamie Feldman: Okay. And then finally, just thinking about the -- just in terms of the moratoriums, like how much of that is actually baked into your guidance, the upside, potential upside from LA and Alameda County?\nBarb Pak: Well, what we have in our guidance is we do assume that gross delinquency will continue to trend down throughout the year as we are able to recapture our delinquent units. So right now, we have about 3% of our units are delinquent. That's down from 5% at the start of the year of 2022. And we expect that to continue to trend down. By the back half of the year, we expect to be in the 1.5 or lower range for the second half of the year. So, it is a function of the guidance. We do -- we have baked that in, that we'll get more of our units back this year.\nJamie Feldman: Okay. But in terms of the revenue upside, you also have that in really -- I'm just thinking if maybe they get extended past March 31. Is that a downside risk to the guidance or no?\nBarb Pak: I don't -- we don't see that as being a downside risk because keep in mind what Mike said earlier about L.A. County, which is the new eviction moratorium is actually more strict than L.A. City was. And so, we don't see that being a hindrance to us. In addition, we are making progress. It's just -- it's taking a little longer than we expected. So, we don't see that as a significant downside at this point.\nOperator: There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks.\nMichael Schall: Thank you, operator. I want to thank everyone for joining us today. Hope to see many of you at the Citi conference, and we definitely appreciate all the well-wishing for Angela and me. I want to note that it's been an absolute honor to work with so many of you. And so have a great day. Thank you for joining.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at the time and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Michael Schall",
            "content": "Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Angela Kleiman and Barb Pak will follow me with comments, and Adam Berry is here for Q&A. Today, I will touch briefly on our full year results, expectations for 2023 and why we believe that our West Coast rental markets are positioned to outperform over the next several years. I will conclude with comments on the transaction market and the upcoming CEO transition. Overall, 2022 was a positive year for Essex as we generated full year core FFO per share growth of 16.2%, our highest year-over-year increase in a decade and 9.3% above pre-COVID levels. We attribute these strong results to relentless execution by the Essex team, improved efficiencies from the implementation of our property collections model and the strong recovery in our West Coast markets for the better part of the year. Our positive results were achieved despite the challenges associated with COVID-19 regulations in our markets. Our near-term results will remain impacted by elevated delinquency, which we estimate will represent a $0.60 per share drag on FFO in 2023 compared to our pre-COVID levels of delinquency. Notwithstanding the impact of delinquency in 2023, we believe we are entering the final phase of these challenges and that our COVID-related headwinds will be behind us in 2024. For 2023, we reaffirm our 2% market rent growth expectation across the Essex markets as shown on Page S-17 of the supplemental package, which is predicated on consensus assumptions for a slowdown in the U.S. economy driven by higher interest rates. Macroeconomic visibility is limited by a variety of factors, which translates into a wider-than-normal range of potential outcomes this year. Recent economic data highlights continued resiliency in the labor market with solid reports for job growth and unemployment claims even with elevated layoff announcements. In Essex markets, preliminary job growth for December was 3.8%, and the recent unemployment rate was only 3.2%, both outperforming national averages. Looking ahead, layoff announcements and lower job openings among large tech companies signal a softer employment outlook for 2023, which we incorporated into our forecast assumptions shown on Page S-17. Our primary challenge since early 2020 relates to the massive layoffs that occurred as a direct result of the government's response to the pandemic, which eliminated nearly 3 million jobs in California alone and force people out of densely populated areas in search of work. It has taken over two years to recover those jobs lost during the pandemic, and I'm pleased to say that the Essex markets have now fully recovered those losses. It is notable that each of the eight major metros in the Essex portfolio have now recovered from 98.8% to 100.9% of the jobs lost in the early part of the pandemic, leading us to believe that most of the slack in the housing supply-demand relationship from the pandemic no longer exists. We believe that this is a major milestone which should lead us back to our pre-pandemic growth profile once the economy stabilizes. As with past economic slowdowns, a frequent concern involves the tech companies that dominate Northern California and Seattle with nearly daily reminders of tech layoffs amplified in the newspapers. The tech sector is often volatile yet over longer periods, the industry has reliably generated top paying jobs and wealth creation that are at the foundation of a strong rental growth. A core strength of the tech industries is their ability to evolve in a cyclical process of reinvention, where the groundwork for new rounds of innovation are laid while the prior cycle is slowing. I am confident that this is what is occurring today. Going back to the 1980s, Big Tech was focused on IBM PCs and R&D efforts to improve semiconductor manufacturing, and that phase ended with the recession in the early 1990s. Growth of the Internet and e-commerce soon emerged and then later boomed and busted capping the dot-com era from which many believe tech would never recover. Instead, a wave of social and mobile products emerged 20 years ago, including Facebook, YouTube and the iPad and iPhone, setting up a much larger and more profitable era of growth. Then following the Great Recession, cloud computing and machine learning added to the next period of rapid growth, both for new start-ups and for sector leaders like Amazon, Google and Microsoft. And now despite a very similar set of concerns, many of you will have followed the explosive recent adoption of new AI products such as ChatGPT and DALL\u00b7E.Consistent with the transformative technologies of the past, the innovators and investors in artificial intelligence are overwhelmingly concentrated in our markets including OpenAI in San Francisco and Google Brain in Mountain View. And despite a broad BC slowdown last year, funding for AI increased 70% and is now poised to grow vastly more in 2023. In a recent search of the leaving 100 start-ups in artificial intelligence, we found that more are headquartered in the Bay Area than in the entire rest of the United States. Thus, it is a combination of entrepreneurial spirit, financial capital and technical talent down on the West Coast as well as housing supply constraints that drives our expectation for the West Coast to generate superior rent growth over the long term. Turning to the apartment investment markets. We continue to see muted deal volume in our West Coast markets as buyers and sellers seek to compromise on their expectations for property values and yields. A relatively small number of apartment sales indicate that property values and cap rates have not changed materially since last quarter, and cap rates generally are in the mid- to high 4% range for high-quality suburban apartments. At this point, we've seen pockets of distress mostly focused on owners subject to variable rate debt and maturing short-term loans. It's possible that an extended period of elevated interest rates and slower rent growth could create new opportunities to generate FFO and NAV per share. We sold 1 property in the fourth quarter, and we are working on other potential sales. In conclusion, assuming my math is correct, this is my 115th consecutive conference call on behalf of Essex, which will be my last given my pending retirement as CEO at the end of March. I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity to be part of the highly skilled, disciplined and focused leadership team for this great company. I'm taking a step back with full confidence in Angela's ability to lead the Company along with her determined and like-minded team. Thank you all. Finally, I have enjoyed working with so many of you in the investment community, and I thank you for your trust and support over many years. I remain confident that many great years for the Company are on the horizon. With that, I'll turn the call over to Angela Kleiman. Well, thank you for the congratulations. I appreciate it. I think tech is just growing in terms of its share of the overall employment base. So we expect tech to grow throughout the United States and certainly wouldn't exclude the Sun Belt. But I think that as with the past, most of the cutting-edge technology and the people that are really driving innovation will be located as they have been in the past here on the West Coast. So that gives us a great deal of comfort. And I went through that relatively long description of my career here and what tech has done really because of that because we've seen it reinvent itself so many times over and over again. And I would have a hard time believing that, that is anywhere close to being at an end. And -- and finally, I guess I would add that the prospects and the importance of AI to almost any -- every application from businesses to consumers, et cetera. is pretty extraordinary. So I think this is going to continue onward. And I think that we'll be right in the center of that innovation here on the West Coast. Wes, thank you for the congrats. I appreciate that. In terms of supply pressure, there are pots of supply in a few places. We noted Oakland earlier, I think there are multiple lease-ups in Oakland, which are really having the effect of pushing down price. Seattle has more supply deliveries this year and especially the fourth quarter because it's generally a seasonally weak period, and Seattle tends to be weaker than the California markets, primarily because demand goes to zero in the fourth quarter or close to zero, and Seattle has more supply of apartments. But going forward, the supply picture looks like it's declining. And this is a result of obviously lack of rent growth for the last few years. So the ability to produce housing at an accretive level is pretty challenged, and we see that in our preferred equity book as well. And so I think it's going to be -- we're going to be in a period where there's relatively not a lot of supply. And if we get any demand, we'll be in good shape. Yes. Let me just add one more quick thing. Steve, a big question here is what is going to happen to the pace of employment. As I noted in the prepared remarks, job growth has been really strong. However, maybe some of the layoffs or the warm notices haven't actually showed up in job growth yet. So our expectation for the year -- just to remind everyone, on S-17 was for minus 2% -- 0.2% job growth for the U.S. And so, we're going to be watching job growth over the next several months. But it seems like we are running stronger than we expected, certainly with respect to January's job growth number. And if that continues, then you get to a point where maybe our U.S. job growth estimate on S-17 is too conservative. So we'll watch that closely. Yes, Alex. I think things are normalizing from the pandemic period. And -- but I would say, yes, we are recovering leisure, hospitality and other service jobs at a very high rate, and that continues onward. And -- but it appears to be normalizing. But also the tech job growth during the pandemic was incredibly strong. And we think that some of the more recent tech announcements are just sort of giving back a small portion of the job gains that occurred during the pandemic. So we don't even considered tech to be all that weak at this point in time. I think it's just transitioning from what it was and taking the next step or the next chapter of things. So overall, we think jobs are on the right track. Again, our S-17 was based on the consensus estimates of all the big economists in the U.S. and it's possible, and it almost seems like whatever weakness we might have is be a pushback because we're stronger earlier, which would probably be a net benefit for this year if that continues. And so we'll be paying close attention to that. And I want to maybe go into the -- two more things actually. One is the warn notices, and we had our data analytics team do an analysis of the major, the largest layoffs announced and what portion of them are in California and Washington versus the total. So this is Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Salesforce and Cisco. They globally have 1.6 million employees and the layoff rate is about 4% or 64,000 announced layoffs. In the California, Washington market, the employees of those companies in these markets are about 335,000 people, and there's about 10,000 layoffs. So the percentage of layoff is lower actually in California and Washington as compared to the broader enterprise. So I think that is important. And finally, it's interesting, the unemployment rates are so low. San Francisco, 2.2%, in San Jose, 2.4% and everyone under the U.S. average, except for Los Angeles, which is at 4.5%, no doubt that's because people are drawing benefits and able to stay in our apartment subject to the eviction moratorium. Yes, let me talk about that and Angela or someone else may have a comment. But the two really difficult eviction moratoria are in Alameda County, which is Oakland and L.A., L.A. City expired. However, L.A. County extended to March 31. Actually, L.A. City was a really horrible ordinance. L.A. County is not nearly as restrictive. For example, it only applies to 80% median income tenants, for example. And so there's a little bit of relief in L.A. And in terms of exiting L.A., I think that, that is -- it depends. I mean, we will exit -- enter and exit markets as we deem necessary using a much broader set of criteria for supply-demand analysis, rent growth expectations, cap rates, et cetera. And so that will drive that discussion as well as jobs and some of these other issues. I think Angela and Barb will kick me if I do anything that I say anything that's inconsistent with our published position. I mean the reality is, I don't know. And in the comments I referred to a range of outcomes that's broader than historically we've been able to triangulate in the past for most of the past, the relationship of supply and demand much more -- much better than we can this year. So, there are more moving pieces and given that inherent uncertainty, I still think that is within the range of potential outcomes. But again, we'll be watching job growth and more notices and all those various items for better visibility. Notably, a warm notice out there may not have hit the layoff part of the reported job growth. So, there's a lag there. And so it's a little bit unfair to comment on that until we see how that plays out. Yes. I just wanted to maybe add, we do some work, again, data analytics team that deals with micro com-patterns. And I guess I want to make a comment that it seems to be normalizing as well. Again, you had that mass exodus early on in the pandemic. And we been making progress and just back to the point where we've effectively placed all those jobs, but the places where people are coming from and going to, again, using LinkedIn data, not our own data appear to be pretty similar to what they were in the past. So generally speaking, the migration pattern here is we give people from the large Eastern and Midwestern metros. And actually, more recently, Dallas and Atlanta are on that list of incoming in the top and the place where people go, typically, people will retire, sell their house in California, their expensive house a new part of their retirement plan. And so, they go to a less expensive West Coast cities, notably Phoenix, Denver, Las Vegas. I'm staying and I'm looking forward to spending some time with the grandkids and that type of stuff. And I'm still going to be around, if Angela will have me, a role to be determined. So I love the Company and love what I do here. So not ready to completely check in this whole thing is really driven by Angela being ready, and that's what's important. And so do a great job. I'm very confident. Yes. No, that's a great question, and I'll handle that one. Yes, we have been maybe a little bit surprised just how aggressive some of these actions are. We have a pretty strong advocacy effort that is driven by CAA in California and the local -- one of the local groups up in the Washington area. And so, we spend a lot of time working with those organizations and trying to advocate against those policies. Almost always those policies are sold on the basis of being good for the housing industry. And when, of course, we all know that, in fact, is exactly 100% wrong. It's the exact opposite. So, unfortunately, it's something that we have to deal with, and it is concerning to us and we spend a lot of time on it. The proposal in Washington is still very early on in the process. It's in the house, and it hasn't come out of committees. And as a result of that, I think there's still a long way to go. Again, we will be monitoring that. And -- but all of these different proposals tend to make California less appealing to a landlord and increase the risk of that occurring. So, to your point about other markets, I think I want to reiterate what I said before, which is we are tracking more markets now, 25 major metros across the country. We are looking for specific things. The things that essentially attracted us to California 30 years ago, let's say, and trying to rank those markets in terms of appeal and whether they can compete with the California markets. And we have some interest in some of them. I don't want to get into great detail at this point in time. But as I've said before, and I think actually, this last couple of quarters has played this out why this is important, it's about timing, and it's about making a shift at the appropriate time when our cost of capital is appealing, and we can enter at a point where we can feel like rent growth is going to continue in any of the markets across the country, including our market, San Diego, notably, Orange County, et cetera, if you get 30% to 40% rent increases, you're going to have a lot of supply that we'll hit. And you just can't keep growing. There has to be some change. The markets become unaffordable. The average person can't afford the rent in that location that causes people to move further out to find more affordable housing. The markets, in a certain sense, have a self-correcting mechanism in them. And this has always been the case. It's true here, it's true everywhere. And so we're going to thoughtfully make that decision at the appropriate time. Does that help? Yes. Anthony, it's Mike here. Most of our portfolio actually is suburban in nature. So we have relatively little in cities -- and but we're thinking that return to office is something that will slowly evolve -- and there will be -- maybe we go from an average of two days a week in the office to three days a week in the office. And that will all -- anything that is more office-centric will pull people closer to our apartment community. So that would be a positive impact in our view. And so at this point in time, because people have moved further from the offices and that has cause us to readjust sort of our template for looking for potential acquisitions and other things. But over time, I think that all of us, including, I'd say, here at Essex, we have some of the same issues that we're better off. We're more productive. We make better decisions when we're together as a management group -- senior leadership group and super important to the overall results of the Company. So we think that return to office will be ultimately a tailwind. Thank you, operator. I want to thank everyone for joining us today. Hope to see many of you at the Citi conference, and we definitely appreciate all the well-wishing for Angela and me. I want to note that it's been an absolute honor to work with so many of you. And so have a great day. Thank you for joining."

            "content": "Thanks, Angela. Today, I will focus on our 2023 guidance, followed by comments on investments and the balance sheet. Our 2023 guidance assumes same-property revenue growth of 4% at the midpoint on a cash basis. Overall, we expect healthy top line growth and stable occupancy to be partially offset by 70 basis points of higher delinquency. The reason we believe delinquency will be higher than 2022 is due to uncertainty around the timing of evictions in all of our markets. In addition, we do not expect to receive much in the way of Emergency Rental Assistance as compared to $34 million we received last year on a same-store basis. As it relates to operating expenses, we are forecasting a 5% increase at the midpoint, which is above our historical run rate. There are a couple of reasons for the higher-than-expected increase. First, controllable expenses are forecasted to increase 4%, which is driven by wage inflation and elevated eviction-related costs, partially offset by savings we achieved via the rollout of our property collections model last year. Second, we are experiencing elevated cost pressures within utilities and insurance. In total, we expect same-property NOI growth of [3.6%] at the midpoint. In terms of core FFO, our midpoint assumes 1.6% growth. The primary reasons for the modest increase include higher interest expense and delinquency and lower structured finance income, which are outlined on Page 6 of the earnings release.In total, these items equate to a $0.57 per share headwind, representing nearly a 4% reduction to growth on a year-over-year basis. Turning to investments. Given the challenging investment environment and our elevated cost of capital, we have not provided specific estimates for new acquisitions as it is difficult to generate accretion today given the significant disconnect between public and private market pricing. Given this disconnect, the best way to create value today is through asset sales and share buybacks or via preferred equity investments all of which we completed in 2022. It should be noted that we have a long track record of finding ways to create NAV and FFO per share in all environments, and we will maintain that discipline going forward, while at the same time, match funding our investments on a leverage-neutral basis. As it relates to the structured finance portfolio, during the quarter, we completed a comprehensive review of our investments performing a wide range of sensitivity analysis on a variety of key metrics. The analysis confirmed the portfolio is performing as expected with the exception of two investments, both located within the Oakland submarket. One of the investments was redeemed in the fourth quarter, resulting in a $2 million impairment. For the other investment, we took a conservative approach given the uncertainty around fundamentals in Oakland due to high apartment deliveries, which is leading to an elevated concessionary environment. As a result, we stopped accruing on this investment during the fourth quarter, resulting in a $0.06 reduction to our 2023 guidance. Overall, we have a long successful track record of investing in structured finance investments. Over the past 12 years, we have invested approximately $690 million in structured finance investments that have been fully redeemed, achieving a 13% average annual return for our shareholders. Lastly, on to the balance sheet. During the quarter, we saw a continued improvement in our credit metrics with net debt-to-EBITDA returning to pre-COVID levels at a healthy 5.6x, with no debt maturing on our consolidated balance sheet until 2024, limited development funding needs and ample liquidity, our balance sheet remains in a strong position. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions. Hi, Nick.It's Barb. Yes, we did a comprehensive review. And on the rest of the portfolio, we don't have any other assets that are on the watch list. Keep in mind, we leaned-in heavily in 2020 and prior when cap rates were higher, NOI has grown significantly since we started this portfolio. And so none of the other properties screened high on the capital stack. The one in Oakland is really a function of the high concessionary environment right now. Net effective rents are lower, NOI is lower than how we underwrote it. And so we're higher in the stack than what we'd like to be. So that's why we took a conservative approach to stop accruing. We have constant dialogue with the sponsor and they're very engaged in our participating rating checks as needed. And so we don't see any other fall out at this time from that asset. Yes, Tony. For 2023, we're expecting bad debt as a percent of schedule rent to be 2%. Now keep in mind, we don't expect any Emergency Rental Assistance in 2023 as compared to the $34 million we received on a same-store basis in 2022. And so that's why the net number is going to increase. We were at 1.3% in 2022, and it's going to 2%. Now the underlying gross delinquency is improving because we are able to evict. It's just taking longer than we had initially expected, but we are making progress on that front, as Angela mentioned in her script. And then Austin, this is Barb. On the $0.60 that Mike referred to, that is compared to our pre-COVID historical run rate for not only the revenue piece, but also the expense piece because we have elevated eviction and turnover costs associated with the delinquency. And so it's both pieces. What we are expecting in the back half of the year is our delinquency.Our gross delinquency will be around 1.5% for the second half of the year, 2% for the full year. So we do expect to make progress, but given the timing on these evictions is very difficult to predict at this point. We don't expect to be to our normalized run rate by the end of the year. Yes, Steve, it's Barb. I would say the first half we expect to be higher than the second half. We're about 5% in the first half. The first quarter will probably be north of that, and then it will trend down throughout the year with 3% on average in the second half of the year. And that's really a function of the year-over-year comps because last year, while rents accelerated, it didn't fully hit our revenue growth line.And so, we expect to capture that this year. First half will be higher than the second half. And Mike, do you want to talk about employment? Yes, Alex, on the delinquent unit front, L.A. and Alameda are the bulk of our delinquent units over 60% our delinquent units long term greater than three months or in LA Alameda. And so that's a factor as well as the slowdown in the court, courts are really bogged down. It's taking longer to vice in our other markets, and that is a factor as well in the '23 guidance to recapture those units. John, I may have to follow up with you on those numbers. I want to get back to my office and have the model in front of me. So I don't know if I want to quote the numbers here on the call. In terms of ERA, that would be upside if we were to collect some, but we've exhausted most of that so that we don't expect much in the way of ERA. The one thing I would keep in mind though, is we do have $90 million uncollected bad debt cumulative since the start of COVID. We only have a $3.4 million accounts receivable balance. We think we'll collect more than $3.4 million. It's just a timing of when we're going to collect that. So that is upside to the numbers. It's just -- we don't have that baked into our forecast given the inherent nature of when we're going to collect that. But that's really the upside is on that front more so than even ERA, I would say. Yes. So, eviction costs show up in our administrative line. And obviously, we have elevated turnover as well, and that's in the R&M line. So it's in both lines. So, I would say in total relative to our historical average. Our controllables are forecasted to be 4% this year, but without the elevated eviction and turnover costs, we think we'd be closer to 3%. So it's about 100 basis points impact to the controllable line item for the year. Not a big change. We tend to kind of run between, say, 5% to 7%, and it kind of hovers around there? Yes. This is Barb. We'll assess that based on deal volume and whether we can create NAV and FFO per share. It's hard for me to tell you right now that we can do that in this environment. But it is something that we're cognizant of we have shown that we can run the machine and reverse many times over many different cycles. And so we'll be willing to do that if the right opportunities present themselves. Yes, Haendel, on the expense growth, the 5%, really the biggest driver of that is non-controllables. That's up 5.5% to 6%. And really, the key factors are in utilities, were up 10% this year. We do expect high single-digit increases next year. Insurance is expected to be up 20% next year, is a very difficult insurance market. And then on real estate taxes, we've budgeted a 4.25% increase and that's really being driven by Seattle reverting more to our historical norms. So, those are the key building blocks on the non-controllable piece. On the controllable piece, 4% at the midpoint, and we do expect admin to be up only 3%. Once again, we do have elevated eviction costs in that line, which is masking some of the benefits from the rollout of the central services or the property collections model that we rolled out last year that centralized some of those functions. So, it's masking it a little bit this year. But overall, that should give you the major building blocks for why we have a little bit elevated expense growth. Well, so I said the eviction costs are about a 1% impact to controllable. So that's the factor you can use is it would be 1% lower. Occupancy, we've assumed is stable year-over-year, so flat, no change there. And then in terms of turnover, we did see elevated turnover in the fourth quarter. And given the eviction headwinds that we expect to face in getting the delinquent units back, we do expect turnover to be a little bit more elevated than historical norms. But it's good because then we get tenants in that are paying rent. So, we think that's actually a good thing. Yes, I would say it's the latter. We didn't change our underwriting on that investment. We didn't go out wider on the risk spectrum or the curve. It really is a function of the Oakland market highly concessionary the developer wanted to sell, and we ultimately agreed to the sale. Now keep in mind, we actually made money on our investment for shareholders. We invested $11.5 million in this project, and we got redeemed $14 million. So, we made 7% annually for our shareholders, the coupon was 10%. So, we didn't quite earn what we thought we were going to earn, but we thought it was in the best interest of shareholders to take their money back and redeploy elsewhere. And so, we didn't lose money. And I think it is a unique function of that market. Right now, given I think there's 16 lease-ups in the market right now. Well, what we have in our guidance is we do assume that gross delinquency will continue to trend down throughout the year as we are able to recapture our delinquent units. So right now, we have about 3% of our units are delinquent. That's down from 5% at the start of the year of 2022. And we expect that to continue to trend down. By the back half of the year, we expect to be in the 1.5 or lower range for the second half of the year. So, it is a function of the guidance. We do -- we have baked that in, that we'll get more of our units back this year. I don't -- we don't see that as being a downside risk because keep in mind what Mike said earlier about L.A. County, which is the new eviction moratorium is actually more strict than L.A. City was. And so, we don't see that being a hindrance to us. In addition, we are making progress. It's just -- it's taking a little longer than we expected. So, we don't see that as a significant downside at this point."

            "name": "Angela Kleiman",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. The evolution of Essex under your 37-year leadership has been remarkable. I and the senior team are grateful for your mentorship and we'll continue to diligently serve this company as we move forward. My comments today will start with brief operational highlights of our fourth quarter performance followed by our current operating strategy and updates on key operational initiatives. Essex had a productive 2022, which included optimizing the strong leasing momentum heading into our peak leasing season, addressing delinquency and recapturing units from non-paying tenants while transforming our operating business model. These accomplishments are the results of the exceptionally hardworking operations and support teams thoughtfully executing our business strategy amidst highly dynamic market conditions. Great job, team. Moving on to the fourth quarter. We shifted to an occupancy-focused strategy in late September in anticipation of softening demand and elevated move-outs related to eviction activity. The confluence of these factors created a challenging operating environment in the final months of 2022. Our switch to favoring occupancy helped us moderate the seasonal weakness and the elevated turnover caused by higher evictions. Excluding L.A. and Alameda Counties, I am pleased to report that we have made significant progress recapturing approximately 50% of delinquent units compared to one year ago. In addition, as we start the new year, demand fundamentals have improved in line with our expectations. Our net effective new lease rates troughed at the end of November, and we have been able to reduce concessions while gradually increasing new lease rates from December to January on a sequential basis. In the near term, we will maintain our occupancy-focused strategy as we continue to make progress on eviction-related turnover. Our portfolio sits at a healthy 96.4% financial occupancy today, and we are well positioned to increase rents if demand exceeds our expectations. Turning to key operations initiatives. We continue to make progress with our property collections operating model. Phase 1 is now complete, which centralized administrative and leasing functions, which combine nearby properties into onecentrally managed business unit. The efficiency benefit can be seen in our financial results with administrative expense growth of only 0.7% last year. And for 2023, we anticipate only a 3% increase despite inflationary pressures. Phase 2 expands the same operating principles to the maintenance function.We expect numerous benefits, including savings from reduction in third-party vendor contracts in unit churn efficiencies. The maintenance collections pilot is progressing well and is expected to conclude midyear. At that point, we will provide additional details on the rollout. Lastly, on the technology front, we continue to make excellent progress, most recently with the launch of our proprietary revenue management software. We have been developing this capability over the past two years and are excited for a platform with an integrated pricing and operating strategy tailored for the nuances in our markets. This concludes my remarks, and I will now turn the call over to Barb Pak. It's Angela here. On the concessions, we have seen it essentially taper off throughout the portfolio since December, which is basically I've mentioned earlier that our portfolio trough late November and it significantly improved as an overall average in the fourth quarter, particularly in December. We were running about two weeks concessions. And right now, it's a portfolio average, we're running less than a week. So that gives you an indication of directionally how things have improved pretty quickly. Well, on the tenants renting front, we have a pretty robust process there. Having said that, we, of course, will do credit checks and that will let us know if they are not -- or they have any prior debt that needs to be paid. And so that's our best indicator on that front. Right, right. And in fact, even for us, for tenants who have left, we have -- we immediately have updated the credit report as well on our end. And there is, of course, ongoing report on ongoing debt. So there are various resources that we can use and we have used. I'll just touch on the delinquency population.It's Angela here. In the past, L.A. is about 40%, and it's ticked up to about 50% L.A. delinquency, and that doesn't surprise us given the eviction moratorium has not been lifted. We had expected L.A. to continue to accrue under the delinquency basis. However, the good news is that the new tenants coming in, we're not seeing those tenants [indiscernible] prior tenants. That's a good question. In terms of the occupancy strategy, and when we would shift, it's going to be a little bit different in each of the markets. So for example, we actually are seeing great strength in our Southern California portfolio. However, we are running a little bit higher occupancy in anticipation of the eviction and the opportunities to vacate non-paying units that's coming our way. So we're building that not because we're seeing a market softness issue, it's more of a strategic play to ensure that we are well positioned. And so for example, in places like Seattle, which is, as we noted, highly seasonal, when we see demand come back as it typically does during peak leasing season. We would expect that we should be able to switch back to favoring rent growth, especially now that we've been able to reduce our concessions in a meaningful way. Yes, that makes sense. And the one caveat is, of course, the supply conversation that we talked earlier, right? So for example, places like Oakland that will continue to probably take a little bit longer, because of the supply. But in areas where we are not trying to manage through pockets of supply, there are some good opportunities there. So from an occupancy perspective, we're not running at a whole lot different than prior periods. The one caveat is really more focused on Southern California particularly L.A. because we're anticipating some vacancies there from eviction. So for example, we saw the similar headwind in Northern California in the fourth quarter, and we anticipated that. So we employ the same strategy. So it's really more focused on some of these unique situation as we come out of COVID related legislation really to position us for better growth. Sure. It's Angela here. The -- I think it may be helpful to just talk about how we look at CapEx because looking at a one-year number can be misleading. Our CapEx program is for each property on a 10-year plan. And so, on years where there is a large improvement that we made in replacement, for example, it's going to show up and it's going to look lumpy. So -- but having said that, in 2022, we also had to catch up from the -- when we paused the activities in 2020. So for example, pre-COVID, we're running closer to about $1,700 per door. And in 2020, we were down to like $1,300. So, over 20% increase. And so you play that forward a couple of years later, there is that lag effect. So that's what you're seeing as well. If you look at a, say, 10-year average, our CapEx per door is pretty similar to where our peers are. Now we do have a little older portfolio on average. So, it naturally we should run a slightly higher CapEx per door. So that's -- sorry for the long winter answer, but there's just a little bit more to it than just one number per year. And next year, we're evaluating the expectations you have also inflation. So, it's probably going to be similar to 2023, I mean 2022, but like I said, over a period of time, over a long period of time, it should revert to a long-term average. It's Angela here. No, we haven't talked about that. Our new and renewals are sending out somewhere between say, 4% to 5% depending on the market. So this is for very March. But keep in mind that does get negotiated. So if we're sending a renewal, say, north of 5%, we assume maybe 100 basis points negotiation depending on when and in some of these markets, we're sending out well in advance. So for example, Seattle, it goes out six months in advance. So hopefully, that gives you a better sense of the range of outcomes. It's Angela here. That's interesting because we keep expecting big shifts coming out of COVID under the move-out reasons. And moving out to buy home really still hasn't changed from long-term average. I think because the cost of housing here is just a lot less affordable job transfers or other reasons, pretty darn similar and to our historical averages. And so, we have not seen any material change on move-out. Congrats and once again, another good question on the in-migration. It's -- so I have mentioned that in the third quarter, we saw a pretty big uptick on the immigration to our market, 30% to 35% on average between Northern and Southern California. And of course, part of that is attributed to return to office. We have seen that trend continue in the fourth quarter. But keep in mind, fourth quarter is typically just a low demand period. So it's really difficult for us to be a particular trend. The only thing I can tell you is that compared to the first quarter, the in-migration is still better marginally, we're not talking huge numbers from that perspective, once again, fourth quarter is just a tough time to trying to get an indication of that. Mike, do you have anything you want to add? Yes, that's a good question. What we do is we track the top six because everything else is just too fungible on that number. So currently, we're about 7% of our tenant base is linked -- directly linked to the top six tech companies. And of course, it's much more concentrated in Northern California and Seattle relatively speaking. But that's a very manageable base. And of course, in certain assets or properties are -- that has a much closer proximity to the headquarters, the percentage will be disproportionately higher. Yes, A couple of things. I just want to give you a little background first on the new lease rates. That, of course, is heavily impacted by our concessionary strategy, which is related to our occupancy strategy. And so part of that is not as much a market issue versus a strategy issue, and of course, that is something that we shift quickly away from the concessionary environment in January. And so, I don't want you to think that this is something permanent here to stay. And so -- but ultimately, with the renewal rate in an environment where new leases are on our S-16 expected to be about 2%, there is going to be a convergence of new lease and renewal rates and it'll probably take this full year to have that play out. I'm sorry. Can you repeat the first part on corporate housing? Corporate exposure. Got it. Got it. So our current exposure is about 3%. And what's interesting about that number is during COVID, it actually went down to zero. And so we've been building that up. So last year, it was around -- got up to about 2.5%. Now keep in mind, in Seattle, it's going to move around because they -- it's a temporary nature, right? It comes in pretty heavy during the seasonal peak around July, and that can ramp the portfolio up to 7% and then goes back down around October as they leave. So, there's inherent -- there's an inherent cyclicality to that tenant basis. Keep in mind that market rent growth is a function of demand and supply. And so at this point, even looking out the next couple of years, supply is still relatively muted in Southern California and pre-COVID environment Southern California have performed really well. And so Southern California has similar employer base as the broad U.S. market. That's why we like it. It's less volatile, but it has a higher level of professional services, so better earning power. And for that reason, Southern California continues to be stable. And so, we wouldn't expect that because of COVID, absent the fact it's going to just suddenly fall apart."

            "name": "Adam Berry",
            "content": "Sure. John, this is Adam. So, beginning with Anavia. Anavia was, I'd say, an opportunistic sale to -- there was a very specific buyer and which -- that's reflected in the pricing. Generally speaking, we're seeing cap rates kind of trading in the market in the mid- to high fours. So Anavia, I'd say, outperform that by a bit again just because this very specific situation. Regarding the mansion tax in L.A., so we've seen a slight elevated potential transaction volume in L.A. due to the mansion tax coming into effect April 1. For the most part, I think most of those deals probably won't trade just given they were all on very short runways and pricing expectations just doesn't seem like they are being met. Going forward, I think we've seen this in Washington when they their transfer tax up. It actually did not affect transaction volume generally at all. I think the one thing that may be an outcome of the L.A. management tax is, it could potentially hinder development within Los Angeles, any significant headwind to development returns, especially from merchant builders, that's just going to affect their back end and make it that much harder to build. We're still seeing a gap between the bid and the ask. But we are we are seeing, I'd say, a muted volume of deals going down in that mid- to high 4s. So yes, if we got back to, I'd say, kind of normal volume, I think that's where we shake out today. Well, so for Anavia specifically, what we quoted in the statement was disposition yield. What I'm saying the mid to high 4s, that's more of a buyer cap rate. Jamie, this is Adam. So we haven't seen much of that to date. We are -- it's more on the structured finance platform where we're seeing more opportunities on existing deals with maturing debt or with expiring rate caps. We do think this will accelerate into the year and provide potentially more opportunities like I said, probably more focused on the truck and finance platform versus acquisitions, but looking at it from everyday."

Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the Company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found on the Company\u2019s filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you. Mr. Schall, you may begin.\nMichael Schall: Thank you for joining us today, and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. Angela Kleiman and Barb Pak will follow me with prepared remarks, and Adam Berry is here for Q&A. I will begin by congratulating Angela for her appointment to the Essex Board and for chosen as the next CEO of the Company following my planned retirement in March 2023. I\u2019ve known Angela for almost two decades and we have worked closely together since she joined the Company 13 years ago. Angela embraces and exemplifies Essex\u2019s strategy and core values and is a dedicated thoughtful leader as well as an excellent negotiator. Our recent leadership announcement was a combination of the multiyear succession plan administered by the Essex Board, and I appreciate each participant\u2019s commitment to the plan that resulted in its success. It has been an honor to lead this awesome company made possible by my great leadership team and the coordinated effort of every Essex associate. My thanks to all of you. Today, I will touch on our third quarter results, introduce our initial market level rent forecast for 2023 and provide an update on the apartment investment markets. Our third quarter results represent our fifth consecutive quarter of improving core FFO per share. On a year-over-year basis, we reported core FFO per share and NOI growth of 18.3% and 15.4%, respectively, with core FFO exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by $0.04 per share. The positive results are reflective of the team\u2019s execution and the continued recovery throughout our markets, largely driven by the ongoing rebound in Northern California and Seattle with Southern California remaining a consistent and strong performer. Year-to-date, the economy on the West Coast has shown resiliency with job growth as of September 2022 of 4.3% in Southern California and significantly higher in the tech markets of Northern California and Seattle. The positive job growth is partly attributable to the recovery of workers lost amid the significant shutdowns early in the pandemic, especially leisure, hospitality and service jobs that were added throughout the summer. As a result, it is not surprising that the unemployment rate in each Essex market with the exception of Los Angeles is under 4%, including San Francisco and San Jose in the mid 2% range. The unemployment rate in Los Angeles is higher at 4.5%, likely related to the ongoing eviction moratorium in the city of Los Angeles, which is expected to run -- to end in February 2023. Job openings at the large tech companies have declined from record levels during the pandemic, although they remain significant with approximately 20,000 jobs available, roughly consistent with the number of job openings they reported between 2016 and early 2020. Thus, while we recognize that tech job growth is slowing, the large tech companies are well-capitalized and continue to expand and hire in our markets. As in previous years, we\u2019ve included our initial forecast for 2023 market level rent growth on page, S-17 in the supplemental. Our forecast begins with the consensus estimates of third-party economists for the national economy with respect to GDP and job growth, indicated at the top left of page S-17. Based on these estimates, our data analytics team estimates job growth in each Essex metro. On the supply side, we use our ground up fundamental research to estimate apartment deliveries, which is proven to be highly accurate over many years. Everyone\u2019s visibility into next year is limited by uncertainty related to past and future Fed actions and their impact on the overall U.S. economy, and therefore the forecasted rent growth may vary if the key assumptions prove inaccurate. In summary, housing supply across the Essex markets is expected to grow at 0.6% of existing housing stock with the greatest increase occurring in Seattle with a 1.1% increase. Job growth is expected to be new next year, growing at 0.4% overall in the Essex market, with the best job growth expected to be in San Francisco at just over 1%. As a result of these demand and supply assumptions, we expect net effective new lease rents to increase 2% in 2023 with our California markets expected to marginally outperform Seattle. On a year-over-year basis, we expect apartment supply to decline about 10% in 2023 with Northern California having the largest expected reduction down 45%. We also expect 2023 single family deliveries to be similar to 2022, even with permits growing modestly given much higher mortgage rates. With respect to for-sale housing, declining housing production and reduced affordability are tailwinds for apartments in the Essex markets, representing a small positive factor, contributing to our rent outlook next year. Given economists\u2019 expectations for a modest recession in 2023, I\u2019d like to summarize our historical experience about operating our portfolio in previous economic downturns. Generally, in each significant past recession, our weakest market has been Seattle, which is due to the confluence of negative job growth and higher levels of housing supply deliveries. Northern California follows a similar pattern to Seattle with respect to job losses during recessions, although with significantly less supply that results in outperformance relative to Seattle. Finally, Southern California is our best performer during recessions, given its diverse economy and minimal supply. That being said, each recession is unique and there are several factors that could lead to a different outcome. First, most of the previous recessions followed a long economic expansion where rents grew substantially. And it\u2019s those higher rents that pressures affordability that fosters higher level of apartment supply. On the West Coast, rents plummeted in the early part of the pandemic and our recovery was much delayed compared to the rest of the country with Southern California\u2019s recovery beginning in mid-2021, and Northern California and Seattle in early 2022. As a result, the West Coast is still in the early stages of its from the 2020 recession and housing supply has not had sufficient time to fully recover. In addition, with many offices closed during the pandemic, it was common to hire remotely with the expectation that workers would need to relocate closer to offices upon re-openings, which is now occurring. The relocation of employees back to the West Coast pursuant to return to office programs, represents demand for apartments that is generally not included in job growth. Finally, we expect less outward migration in the next few years, primarily because those that typically leave California, such as the newly retired, probably left early in the pandemic when businesses were shut down. In a moment, Angela will comment further on migration. Turning to the apartment transaction market. We have recently seen a few deals close at valuations that were negotiated before the most recent increase in interest rates, and conditions have changed enough since then to significantly impact transactions. As expected, the immediate impact of higher interest rates will result in diverging buyer and seller expectations for property values, resulting in a larger bid-ask spread. Generally, it takes more than higher interest rates to create financial distress, especially with recent strong rent growth given inflationary pressures. However, pockets of distress may develop from credit or liquidity events or excessive Fed tightening, although no major issues are apparent at this point. Broker price talks with respect to apartment transactions indicates that cap rates for high-quality and well-located apartments are in the mid-4% range in the Essex markets. Finally, I wanted to note that, our balance sheet is in great condition, thanks to the unwavering urgency of Barb and the finance team over the past several years. When the markets turn positive, we expect excellent opportunities to invest creatively, and we will be in a position to be opportunistic. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Angela Kleiman.\nAngela Kleiman: Thank you, Mike. I will begin by expressing my sincere gratitude to Mike for his mentorship and guidance over the past 13 years. I am honored to have the opportunity to lead this organization and to build upon the Company\u2019s long history of thoughtful capital allocation and operational excellence. My comments today will focus on our third quarter performance, followed by some regional highlights, then wrap up with the key operational initiatives that we are excited about. Starting with the third quarter, during much of this period, we capitalized on the strength of the underlying fundamentals in our markets by pushing rents and achieved 10.3% year-over-year growth in new lease rates in the third quarter. Although this is a deceleration compared to the 20% growth in the second quarter, keep in mind that new lease rates in the first half of last year declined by about 6%, but in the second half new lease rates surged to positive 17%. The tough year-over-year comps is the key driver of the deceleration. And the third quarter results are in line with our expectations. In general, we have seen a normal seasonal rent pattern. Accordingly, as we approached the end of the third quarter, we shifted to an occupancy focus strategy. Turning to the delinquency. In recent months, we have begun to recapture more units from nonpaying tenants. With the ending of eviction moratorium, it is no surprise that the number of move-outs related to nonpaying tenants have increased. Looking forward, we plan for a higher volume of move-outs, which may create a temporary headwind in occupancy for the rest of the year and into 2023. For this reason, even though we have shifted to favor occupancy, we anticipate our occupancy to be slightly lower than historical levels. The good news is that regulations are being pulled back, which is allowing us to finally make progress on delinquency. Moving on to regional highlights, starting with Pacific Northwest. After a strong start to the year, rents in this region have peaked in late July. The seasonality through the third quarter, which includes the typical decline in market rents subsequent to the peak is consistent with what we have experienced between 2016 and 2019. However, since mid-September, we\u2019ve been facing softer demand along with higher level of supply deliveries in the second half of the year. So, we are monitoring this market closely.  As for Northern California, this region has led our growth in net effective new lease rates since the start of the year. Strong job growth and return to office are two key contributing factors. Bay Area net in-migration has continued to accelerate this year. In the third quarter, over 35% of move-ins were primarily from outside of our markets, which is an increase from 15% in the first quarter. Notably, we are seeing positive migration trends from markets as diverse as Dallas and Boston. Consistent with our previous commentary on commitment of tech giants to continue to expand in Northern California, we are excited to see Google break ground last week on its massive mixed use development in San Jose. This development is expected to bring 25,000 high-paying jobs and effectively doubling the amount of office space in Downtown San Jose. This will be a long-term benefit for Essex as we own almost 6,000 units in this region. On to Southern California, healthy job growth is continuing to drive incremental demand for rental housing. As such, this region continues to perform well. We\u2019re also seeing positive in-migration to Southern California, with 30% of our third quarter movies coming from outside the region compared to 17% in the first quarter. Turning to key operations initiatives, we have completed the rollout of first phase of our property collections operating model, which focused on leasing, administration and customer service. By way of background, this model optimizes our geographic density and transforms our business from operating each property individually to a collection of around 9 to 12 properties. The shift in business strategy enables us to leverage our team and technology to improve the customer experience and achieve significant efficiencies. I\u2019m pleased to announce that Phase 1 is fully rolled out across the entire portfolio, ahead of plan and the progress is beginning to show up in our financial results. Year-to-date administrative expenses were up only by 1.4%. Despite a significantly higher wage increases, along with other inflationary pressures on expenses. The next step is to apply the collections operating model to the maintenance function. As we have demonstrated previously, this model has created more career advancement opportunities for employees through specialization, while improving efficiency and customer service. The maintenance collections highlight is currently underway and rollout is planned to start by mid next year. Lastly, on the technology front, the implementation of Funnel software suite is progressing well. As you may recall, Funnel is RET Ventures company with whom we have chosen to co-develop applications to enhance our platform. The Funnel product will handle the end to end customer experience from initial prospect inquiries through the full resident lifecycle, which will result in better experience for our customers. From an employee perspective, this technology will streamline or automate the manual tasks associated with roughly 60,000 transactions each year. Our initial pilot showed a promising 35% reduction in task time associated with these activities. Continued refinements are underway, and we are excited to work toward a full deployment by the end of 2023. With that, I will turn the call over to Barb Pak.\nBarb Pak: Thanks, Angela. Today I\u2019ll discuss our third quarter results followed by an update on investments and the balance sheet. I\u2019m pleased to report third quarter core FFO per share a $3.69, a $0.04 beat to the midpoint of our guidance range. Half of the outperformance was due to lower operating expenses, which is timing related and the other half was from higher co-investment income due to better NOI growth at the joint venture properties and higher preferred equity income. For the full year, we are raising the midpoint of core FFO by $0.02 per share to $14.47, representing approximately 16% growth compared to last year. As it relates to delinquency, we are seeing continued improvement in our gross delinquency, which is helping to offset less emergency rental assistance funds. The same-property portfolio gross delinquency improved sequentially from 4.5% in the second quarter to approximately 3.5% in the third quarter. October improved further to around 2%. We suspect the gross delinquency trends will continue to improve as we work to recapture delinquent units. However, the improvement is unlikely to be linear. One additional positive development that recently occurred is the City of LA approved removing eviction protection starting on February 1st of next year. This will allow us to recapture delinquent units in an area that accounts for approximately 40% of our outstanding bad debt and will allow us to finally get back to our historical level of delinquency. However, it will take time to achieve this goal, and we would expect delinquency will remain elevated through the first half of 2023, with the expectation that we will get closer to our historical average of 35 basis points of scheduled rent by the end of next year. Turning to our stock repurchase and investments. Consistent with last quarter, investing in our own portfolio and select preferred equity investments offers the best risk-adjusted returns in today\u2019s market. In the third quarter, we repurchased $97 million of common stock at a significant discount to our internal NAV, which we plan to match fund on a leverage-neutral basis with proceeds from a disposition expected to close in the fourth quarter. As it relates to other transactions, we closed $65 million of new preferred equity and subordinated loan investments during the quarter and committed to one additional investment in October. These new commitments are expected to be match funded with redemptions of two structured finance investments that are slated to close in the fourth quarter. Finally, I want to provide some additional color on the strength of the balance sheet. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio remains healthy at 5.8 times and we expect this to further improve as EBITDA continues to grow. It should be noted that we operated around these same leverage levels before the pandemic and our balance sheet metrics are strong. In addition, we are well positioned from a capital needs perspective. In October, we closed a delayed draw term loan that will be fully drawn in April of 2023 with proceeds intended to repay $300 million in bonds that mature next year. We have swapped this debt to an all-in fixed rate of 4.2%. As a result of this transaction, we have all our known funding needs addressed until May of 2024. The company has no significant unfunded development needs and can fund the dividend, operations and capital expenditure needs from free cash flow. Additionally, our variable rate exposure excluding our line of credit is minimal at less than 4% of our consolidated debt. With over $1.1 billion in liquidity, no funding needs for the next 18 months and access to a variety of capital sources, the balance sheet remains well positioned. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citi.\nNick Joseph: Thank you. And congratulations, both Mike and Angela. Maybe just starting on the building blocks for next year. Obviously, you provided the market rent growth of 2%. What\u2019s the earn-in expected from 2022 lease in? And then where is the loss per lease today, and where would you expect it to be at the end of the year?\nAngela Kleiman: Hey Nick, it\u2019s Angela here. So, on the earn-in for 2023, I think -- if it\u2019s okay with you, I wanted to step back and make sure we\u2019re using a consistent definition. For us, the way we look at earn-in is we look to the September loss-to-lease, it\u2019s not too hot and not too cold, and take 50% of that. So, in this case, September loss-to-lease was close to 7%, taking half of it would be about 3.5%, and that will be our earning, and we assume no market rent growth. Now, what we\u2019ve heard is there\u2019s a question about 2023 revenue growth and how does the earn-in applied to that. And so what we\u2019ve done in the past is explain that by saying, you take your earn-in and then we look at our 2023 S17 market rent growth and take 50% of that. So, that would be -- the market rent growth is 2%, so half of that would be 1%. You add that to the 3.5% earn-in, that gives you a proxy of about 4.5% for revenue growth for 2023. And so, as far as the loss-to-lease, where we are is we\u2019re about 2.5% loss-to-lease in October for the portfolio. And of course, it varies by region, but that\u2019s coming from a loss-to-lease in September of 6.7%, so definitely a deceleration. But it is expected and loss-to-lease at this level for October is actually better than our historical patterns. Typically, around this time of the year, we\u2019re at about 1% loss-to-lease and heading towards zero by year-end. So at 2.8, we\u2019re feeling pretty darn good about the portfolio.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. That was very helpful. And then maybe just on the transaction market, given kind of the expected rent growth and where debt costs are today, does the 4.5% cap rate make sense for most buyers, or how are they thinking about getting to their unlevered IRRs, given maybe the negative leverage situation initially right now?\nAdam Berry: Yes. Hey Nick, this is Adam. As Mike mentioned in his opening comments, the transaction volume is definitely down from where it was a quarter ago. But there are still deals being priced. There are still deals going non-contingent. And in talking to buyers who are still active in the market, they\u2019re willing to take a certain level of negative leverage for 18 to 24 months is the number that I\u2019m hearing now. And so, with various assumptions about rent growth, repositioning and those types of strategies, that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing in the market.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore.\nSteve Sakwa: Yes. Thanks. Look, I guess the biggest thing that everyone\u2019s focused on is the 2%. And Angela, you walked through the math, and I know this is not trying to get this into a debate about \u201823, but the math that you just walked through would, I think, basically imply your revenue growth is several hundred basis points below several of your peers. And I guess I\u2019m just trying to understand, is that really a function of market mix; is that a function of the conservatism, the 2%? I don\u2019t know what the history of that number is. And if you start low and kind of work that number high over time, but it just strikes me as your implicit growth for next year is kind of well below the peers.\nMichael Schall: Hey Steve, let me try to handle that one. So S-17, beginning a few years ago, decided to start with the consensus of third-party economists as to the U.S. and then drilled down from there into what that means for our markets. And we obviously have -- Chairman Powell there talking about breaking things and pain to come at a mild recession, which is what this is based on. And so rather than using our own how we feel, we think it\u2019s important that we create a scenario that\u2019s based on the consensus of the people that are really studying these things and certainly not ignoring what they\u2019re saying. And so, that\u2019s where this macro scenario comes from. Do we feel like that\u2019s a little bit dire? Yes, we do. But again, several years ago, we made the decision to start basing S-17 on the macroeconomists view of the world, which, in fact, is pretty dire. And it seems to us that we shouldn\u2019t ignore the Fed\u2019s comments about pain to be had, et cetera. So, that\u2019s where that scenario comes from. Do we feel like things are a little bit better than that? Well, yes, we do. And if we were basing this on how we feel, we would come up with something that is more optimistic than this. But again, we shouldn\u2019t ignore the Fed, and that seems like it\u2019s what\u2019s happening out there. And we think that\u2019s fundamentally misguided, I guess. Does that make sense?\nSteve Sakwa: Yes. No, look, I agree that they\u2019re storm clouds. It would seem like you would need to see negative job growth occurring in order to really diminish the pricing power that\u2019s out there. And so, when I look at your job growth forecast or the market\u2019s job growth forecast of 40 basis points, again, supply growth of 60 basis points, those are largely in lockstep with each other. There\u2019s not big dislocations on the supply front in your market. So, it would feel like occupancy is going to be relatively stable. And so, I would have thought that rent growth wouldn\u2019t be off to the races, but that it might be better than 2%. If you told me job growth was very negative, I would agree with you.\nMichael Schall: Well, that -- and that\u2019s exactly what the third-party economists are saying. So, up there in the upper left-hand corner is the consensus of the -- again, third-party macroeconomists that say, job is going to be minus 0.2% next year. And so that forms the basis of what we think. So, we outperform in terms of job growth the U.S. economy. And in fact, that minus 2% for the U.S. is translating into 0.4% job growth for us. So not a lot. But again, it\u2019s a pretty dire scenario. And so, that\u2019s where that comes from. Again, we don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s this bad. I mean based on what we see in front of us today, we\u2019re having some seasonality here in October. We expect that. Loss-to-lease typically goes negative by the end of the year, and it probably will this year. Keep in mind, the demand side of the equation is driven by jobs. And obviously, we pay attention to the seasonally adjusted jobs. But the reality is, if you look at total nonfarm employment, it gets pretty soft in the fourth quarter. And so, these things can happen. So basically, we don\u2019t feel -- we feel like this is a pretty draconian scenario, but we\u2019re trying to maintain some consistency with respect to what we are trying to put out there with respect to S-17. And just following through on the historical pattern, and looking at what the economists out there are saying, we think this is that scenario. Could it be different? Absolutely it could be different, and we hope it\u2019s different. But again, I don\u2019t want to ignore the elephant in the room. It seems pretty important to actually consider what the macro economists are saying and what it means for us. And I would add to that, everyone across the nation is going to feel the same pain if this occurs. It\u2019s not just a West Coast thing. It\u2019s a national thing. It starts with the U.S. job growth. And then, we look at historical relationships to try to determine what it means for the West Coast. And that\u2019s where these numbers are coming from.\nSteve Sakwa: I appreciate that. Thanks. And then, I guess, maybe just in terms of return hurdle hurdles and how you\u2019re thinking about underwriting. Can you just give us a sense for how you guys have altered either acquisition hurdles, development hurdles in light of given where stock prices have gone, where bond yields have gone? I mean, how much have you raised your cap rates, IRRs in today\u2019s environment?\nAdam Berry: Hey Steve, this is Adam again. So, consistent with what we just talked about the 4.5% range is kind of where we see the market. We\u2019re probably not buyers at that range, we have a better use for our capital and development yields will need to move off of that base, if not maybe slightly higher. So, when we look at development deals, depending on where they are in the entitlement process, we\u2019re looking at a 20% to 25% spread over to adjust for the risk related to development.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Kramer: Hey. I just wanted to maybe dive a little bit deeper into some of the markets. Looking kind of at the October new lease growth, kind of the 2.8% figure. Wondering if you can maybe just give some color just on performance across kind of the different markets. I think that would be helpful.\nAngela Kleiman: Sure, happy to. So, on the new lease rates for October at 2.8%, it\u2019s actually a pretty wide range. With starting -- I\u2019ll just go from North to South. Pacific Northwest, it\u2019s negative, about 90 basis points, and that\u2019s consistent with my earlier commentary about the softness in that market. And then, Northern California, the strongest at about 4.5% and Southern California close to 2%. So, Southern continues to be the steady Eddie. And Northern California is rebounding as we have anticipated.\nAdam Kramer: Got it. That\u2019s really helpful. And just looking at the occupancy figure, it looks consistent kind of October versus third quarter. Maybe just comment a little bit about kind of -- are concessions being used, and I\u2019d imagine maybe in kind of the weaker Northwest market, maybe they are being used. But I would love to just kind of hear are concessions being used, is that kind of used as a tool to kind of maintain occupancy here?\nAngela Kleiman: Sure. We -- concession usage is -- for us, we focus on where there\u2019s a competitive supply. So, of course, during our -- if we\u2019re doing our own lease-up, we use concessions, we line that as part of our pricing tool. But absent of that, it\u2019s a function of how many lease-up do you have near property, and how do we remain competitive and meet the market? So, in terms of the concessions usage, just the change between October and the third quarter, it has ticked up, and it\u2019s primarily driven by Seattle. So Seattle -- in the third quarter. And as mentioned that we had a very normal third quarter, was less than a week. And it is now about two weeks, and that\u2019s the biggest change. With all the other markets, it\u2019s incremental a couple of days more, which is consistent with what we expected. And so, portfolio overall, our concessions has gone up from say half a week to about a week portfolio-wise, and with the key driver being Seattle.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Angela, congrats. And I guess now you get the joy of answering directly to George after each earnings season. So, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll enjoy that part. So, question -- two questions for you. And going back, Steve -- to Steve\u2019s question. Traditionally, you guys are a conservative team, I don\u2019t want to say -- yes, I won\u2019t characterize it any more than that. But traditionally, you guys are an under promise over deliver. Mike, I hear you on the economic forecast in S-17 that this is independent consensus, this isn\u2019t your world. But when we think about just bottom line earnings growth because obviously the stats get worked with the COVID rebound, it sounds like you guys are saying that revenue was 4.5% while your lost lease right now is 7%. But you\u2019re only saying, hey, next year, maybe 4% -- 4.5% for revenue. Prop 13 helps on the taxes next year. So, your OpEx should be probably a little bit better than the national average because you don\u2019t have the OpEx, the property tax pressure. But as we think about bottom line FFO growth, should 2023, assuming that it\u2019s not a blood bath recession, should be sort of more of a normal type earnings growth? Or I\u2019m just trying to figure out how much the year-over-year stats are impacting our clouding the FFO growth that is implied by what you guys have presented?\nAngela Kleiman: Yes. Hey Alex, there\u2019s obviously lots of moving pieces here, and you\u2019re asking good questions, kind of what does that mean for the bottom line? Let me just clarify a few things and then I\u2019ll flip it back to Mike to talk about S-17 and maybe follow-up on the FFO. The 7% that you\u2019re referring to is September loss-to-lease. And what we normally do is take half of that with earn-in. So, that\u2019s how we got to the 3.5%. And so, that\u2019s pretty consistent math for proxy purposes. And as far as the expense comment, I do want to address that for a minute. I do think that we should perform a little better than inflation on average. And especially on the administrative side of it, that should be quite a bit below inflation. And with -- since we have not yet rolled out maintenance collections that will be higher than the admin growth. And so, we expect controllables to come in comparable to this year at about 4% for next year. So that\u2019s uncontrollable. And so, that\u2019s some of the building blocks from the P&L perspective. And then Mike?\nMichael Schall: Yes. Alex, I just wanted to add a couple of things perhaps. So first thing is that Angela, she thinks for next year the kind of proxy formula is that 3.5 plus half the growth of next year, which is the 2%, which is the pretty dire scenario. So, I\u2019d say there\u2019s some potential upside if that dire scenario doesn\u2019t take place. So that would be one thing. And then I just want to mention that we feel pretty good about where the Company is positioned right now. Core FFO right now is at the high end of the bicoastal peers when you go back and compare it to Q4 2019. So, we feel good about that. And we\u2019ve accomplished that with really Southern California at sort of full recovery -- in full recovery mode, not Northern California and Seattle. And we attribute that to the fact that both of them fell further and have a longer period of time that\u2019s required for recovery. In Northern California, for example, rent levels right now are roughly equivalent to where they were at pre-COVID. So, there\u2019s been no rent -- in Northern California. And historically, the tech markets are the driver of growth, and I suspect that they will be the driver of growth going forward. We\u2019re just not there yet. So, we feel good about this. When we think about some of the other things, incomes, median incomes \u2013 household incomes in San Francisco, San Jose are now over $145,000 a year. That\u2019s the median, which is pretty amazing and screens very affordable as it relates to rental value. And that\u2019s what draws people to the West Coast. Everyone talks about, well, the costs are higher on the West Coast, but the reality is they\u2019re drawn by the incomes that are much higher as well. And so, we think that there\u2019s going to continue to be a recovery as we recovered jobs lost in the recession in Northern California and Seattle. We think that they will once again become the drivers of the Company going forward, and very little of that is priced into the stock, which makes us think that there\u2019s very good upside here.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. The second question is on your debt and preferred equity programs, obviously, one of your peers had a default and they\u2019re taking the property back here in New York, the office company, converted two DPE [ph] positions. You guys have a number of investments. Do you see the risk profile of DPE [ph] or your view is that as you monitor the deals, they\u2019re all financially performing the way you expect them, meaning nothing -- you haven\u2019t seen anything outside of what you\u2019ve been monitoring along the way, both in performance as well as in the developer\u2019s ability to get to secure financing?\nAdam Berry: Yes. Hey Alex. So at this point, we\u2019re not seeing any potential for material defaults. We constantly assess our preferred equity book. So, the short answer is no, we\u2019re not seeing anything at this point. A little more background behind it. Over 75% of our pref and mezz book was underwritten in 2020 or before. So, we really -- we didn\u2019t go down to the depths of the mid-3 caps, chasing deals. We did very few deals during that time. And so, with this recent expansion in cap rates, it really doesn\u2019t impact where we are in the stack. And then, you couple that with pretty significant NOI growth, and we feel like we\u2019re in a pretty good position.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America.\nJoshua Dennerlein: I\u2019m wondering for one of the comments I think Angela said in her opening remarks on the higher move-outs is, I think, what you\u2019re expecting going forward. Are those higher move-outs from non-payers who I guess you\u2019ll be able to address with LA restriction going away? Just trying to get a sense of like, will that lower occupancy kind of impact same-store revenue.\nAngela Kleiman: Sure, sure. We -- there\u2019s two things happening on the move-outs. The higher turnover is driven by two factors. One is, of course, the Seattle softness that I\u2019ve talked about earlier. And it\u2019s attributed mostly to an elevated level of supply in Seattle in the second half. And of course, when there\u2019s more supply, there\u2019s more concessions, and that draws people out of stabilized properties. That\u2019s not usual during a period where corporate hirings are slowing, once again. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening in Seattle. As far as California, the higher move-out is attributed to the nonpaying tenants moving out, which we see is a good thing. And so, with the LA moratorium expiring next year, we do see another opportunity there. So, we\u2019re able to make good progress on the delinquency front there. So, that\u2019s -- hopefully, that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Yes. No, that\u2019s helpful. And then you -- I think another comment you mentioned was just shifting more to focus on occupancy. Is -- I guess, what\u2019s driving that? Is it just like you want to hang on to occupancy assuming like -- it sounds like you guys are taking the big picture macro view that there might be like a recession\u2026\nAngela Kleiman: I see what you\u2019re saying. Yes. So, the -- normally, when we see market strength, which is usually during a period of strong demand, we push rents. And as we head toward the end of the third quarter and into our seasonal low in the fourth quarter, we historically switch that strategy to push occupancy. And so, what we\u2019re doing here is consistent with what we\u2019ve always done in the past. And what we\u2019re seeing is this is -- what I\u2019m trying to convey there is that this is a normalized market that\u2019s stable, and we\u2019re essentially shifting this strategy to maximize revenue during this period of time. And the reason -- so normally, what you will see is in the fourth quarter, our occupancy may run, say, in the mid to high 96%. But because of this eviction headwind, it may run a little bit lower. So maybe in the low 96%. But I wanted to signal to the community that that\u2019s not because there\u2019s any problem here, this is actually a good thing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Kim BMO Capital Markets.\nJohn Kim: Angela, I wanted to ask your methodology on the earn-in. I realize this is somewhat of a new figure, at least to us on the outside. And your use of taking the September loss-to-lease and approximating it by using half of loss-to-lease. [Ph] I would have thought the earn-in was basically the rent contribution this year versus next year on rent that you\u2019ve signed to date. So, I was just wondering how this earn-in compares maybe to prior years and then also how accurate you think the September loss-to-lease divided by two -- how good is that to the actual contribution?\nAngela Kleiman: Yes. So, if I look at the September loss-to-lease and use 50% as a proxy. And then look at that number relative to prior periods, pre-COVID, this -- the September number is actually about twice as high as the normalized period. Normally, around September, the loss-to-lease is around 3%. And so, this is one of the reasons why we feel good about where our portfolio sits and as we head into next year. Absent, of course, a recession, we certainly should do quite well.\nJohn Kim: So historically, your earn-in is about 1.5% per year?\nAngela Kleiman: Yes, that sounds about right. Now the one thing I do want to clarify is that everybody calculates it a little bit differently. And so for us, we are not including concessions. So, if we include concessions, that earn-in number, obviously, will be much higher. But we\u2019re trying to just keep it apples-to-apples, so to minimize confusion. So, it\u2019s the same baseline.\nJohn Kim: Okay. And I know this has been asked a few different times. But on your 2% rent forecast, I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of what kind of range that you see is at and how difficult it was to forecast job growth for next year versus prior years when you come out with this initial forecast?\nMichael Schall: Hi John, it\u2019s Mike. So again, we\u2019re trying to start with third-party economists as to the macro scenario. And then what happens in the -- across the country will be a function of that. And again, typically, we outperform the national economy with respect to job growth. And so, the consensus of the big economists is for U.S. job growth to be at minus 2% next year. And we think we\u2019ll do better than that. We\u2019re plus 0.4%, but 9,500 new jobs under the 0.4 scenario, it is about 4,800 households against 50,000-plus new supply in the marketplace. So again, do we think that will happen? I mean, as of now and given what Angela just said, it seems like that\u2019s pretty dire. But again, we should not ignore what the economists are saying and we should not ignore the Fed talking about wrecking things and pain points. So, we don\u2019t know. Our visibility into next year is no better than yours. And whereas we feel pretty good today, as I said earlier, we can\u2019t ignore these numbers. So again, I\u2019d rather have this discussion so you guys know where we\u2019re coming from than to just create a scenario out of thin air because that doesn\u2019t sound relevant. When we do our budgeting process, we start with economic rent growth. I don\u2019t know how you do a budget without that because you can\u2019t leave it to the property teams to try to decide what rents are going to do. You have to have some macro view of the world. And based on that, you populate your budgets based on supply and demand at the local level. I don\u2019t know how else to do it. And I\u2019m not saying our budgets are based on this scenario because that -- because again, it does seem somewhat dire. However, we are mindful of the macro economy. We\u2019re mindful of what the Fed is saying, and we\u2019re going to adjust accordingly. Does that make sense?\nJohn Kim: It does. I know it\u2019s difficult time, too. I appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.\nNick Yulico: Thanks. First question is just in terms of your portfolio, I was wondering if you\u2019re seeing any differences right now in the operating trends and recognizing you have a broad portfolio that\u2019s different price points, suburban, urban. As we think about return to office being most challenged on the West Coast, in San Francisco proper, in Seattle proper, in downtown LA, may be downtown San Diego, too. How -- are you seeing a different performance of your apartment assets in those urban cores than the rest of the portfolio?\nMichael Schall: Yes. It\u2019s Mike. I\u2019ll start and then flip it to Angela here in a minute. The answer is yes, of course. We see all kinds of differences out there. And I\u2019m going to give you the broader perspective of what our portfolio is and why it is the way it is, which is we hope to have properties throughout the fastest growing metros. And again, we look at supply demand to try to get to those numbers. That\u2019s how we deploy capital. We generally want to be in the B or renter by necessity category. Because when new supply hits, or when you have a supply-demand imbalance, which could happen next year, the properties that are hit the hardest are those that are near the new supply, because the new -- when someone down the street has eight weeks free, and you\u2019re a brand new apartment competing with that -- competing directly with that, you may be impacted to a much greater extent. So, our portfolio is mostly suburban in nature. Again, we\u2019re not trying to be in San Francisco and San Jose, we\u2019re trying to be in the whole Northern California, metroplex, within let\u2019s say one hour commute distance from the major job nodes. That is our portfolio composition. And we think there are -- there\u2019s inherent safety in the Bs, because you can\u2019t produce the quality property. And in a world where the -- as are more concentrated in the downtown, and the newer product is more susceptible to the impact of concessions if they increase substantially, we think those are the areas going to get hit the hardest. And the B quality property will do quite well. So Angela, I\u2019ll flip it to you?\nAngela Kleiman: Well, I think maybe I\u2019ll just give you a quick example of what Mike is talking about. Concessions in downtown LA is about 1.5 weeks, and concessions throughout the rest of the LA area averages about a week. And so that gives you the magnitude impact of the downtown versus the market.\nNick Yulico: My other question is just in terms of move-out activity that you\u2019re seeing on like a real time basis in the portfolio. I mean, how much of that would you attribute to people who have tech jobs? And are you seeing any signs yet of tech freezing, layoffs, hitting your portfolio?\nMichael Schall: Nick, I\u2019m going to start with that too. I mean, our portfolio is not positioned to be near the tech companies per se or to cater to the tech employees. We are trying to cater to the broad range of employment within our market. So, we do have a couple buildings that are predominantly tech related employees, but it\u2019s the exception, and actually not even close to the average. So, we are a reflection of the broader economy. And therefore, the tech component in Northern California and Seattle will be more, but there is a lot of -- there\u2019s a pretty diverse job base there in general. And so again, that goes into the philosophy of the company. So I don\u2019t think that, we are particularly exposed to tech. We are more exposed to supply-demand imbalances and which we hope won\u2019t happen. But again, the dire financial scenario on the S-17 sort of contemplates that scenario.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nChandni Luthra: Mike, first of all, congrats on the retirement and Angela, congratulations on the new role. Team, what are you guys seeing on the preferred book? You obviously raised your commitments for the year. How do you see appetite for your investments next year, obviously with higher interest rates and how have returns changed? I know this came up briefly on the call, but do you see any distress related opportunities generally in the broader market as you think ahead?\nMichael Schall: So, a couple of questions in there. I\u2019ll try to go backward. As far as distressed opportunities, we\u2019re not seeing them as of yet. There is talk of the potential for rate caps expiring and a need for that kind of rescue capital. We are not seeing it yet. And I haven\u2019t really heard from anyone else who has seen it. There is definitely talk but haven\u2019t seen any of those opportunities come to fruition yet. As far as -- let\u2019s see, I think your other question was just what we are seeing right now on our pref side. We have increased returns. So, for deals that we are currently pursuing, we have increased returns between 100 and 150 basis points. I would say where the market is today, there are opportunities given the difficulty of debt today. But underwriting is a little more opaque. So I think for the fourth quarter, there is probably -- we have one or two deals in our pipeline right now. I don\u2019t probably see more than that coming into the fourth quarter. I think things will slow down a little and people may take a pause. And then going into next year, I think, it will start back up and we will see more opportunities.\nChandni Luthra: Okay. And this one is going to be very quick follow-up. So, I completely understand and appreciate the use of third-party economists and kind of the view of the world that is out there right now. But if we don\u2019t go into a full blown recession next year, is it fair to say that there is more potential for rent growth in 2023, given the market never fully recovered for some of your key markets or is that a fair assessment?\nMichael Schall: Of course, it is. Yes. I mean, I would say when I look at supply, at around 0.6% of stock, that looks like it\u2019s probably the lowest anywhere in the U.S. that\u2019s what I\u2019m guessing, are on the low-end, let\u2019s say. And supply is the enemy in our view. And trying to avoid supply is a key part of why we are in these markets. So, if we get a little bit of demand growth, I think we will do just fine, and/or if the recession is just a short recession, and we\u2019re in and then back out of it, that scenario would be better than what is on page S-17. So, we -- it appears as S-17 is probably close to the worst case scenario, but of course, none of us really know.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the of line of Robyn Luu with Green Street.\nRobyn Luu: Congratulations, Mike and Angela, and thanks for taking my question. So, I want to start off with the preferred investments, and subordinated loan business. So, are you seeing any capital providers that you\u2019d normally see in bidding terms drop off, as you I guess pursue the preferred deals going forward?\nAdam Berry: Great question. The answer is, yes. Predominantly the debt funds, they have disappeared. We would go into some of these deals, and especially to debt funds, they would provide what we call stretch seniors. So, it would be zero to, call it, 75%. They\u2019re no longer in competition. So, we\u2019re seeing more opportunities coming to us because of that.\nRobyn Luu: Do you mind expanding whether those debt funds are purely domestic players, as opposed to also foreign players?\nMichael Schall: Yes. This is Mike. I think most of them were domestic players. I mean, I\u2019m not sure that we know exactly where they\u2019re coming from. But, we know that we were refinanced out of several deals with high yield funds. And I didn\u2019t -- don\u2019t know exactly who they were, but it seemed like they were domestic funds, high -- domestic high yield funds. So, and there were a lot of them out there. So, we were -- these redemptions have come to an end, consistent with what Adam said, and it looks like the market is much less competitive now and going forward, which we think is a good thing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Neil Malkin with Capital One Securities.\nNeil Malkin: Yes, Mike, I\u2019ll echo everyone\u2019s sentiment. Congrats, enjoy not having to prepare for earnings. And Angela, looking forward to continuing to work with you. I guess, just along those lines. I think that California struggles aren\u2019t lost on people and you\u2019re still kind of working through that and there\u2019s still a lot of uncertainty. And I guess, Angela, do you think that the Angela climbing era will see Essex venture out from California, maybe like a Phoenix, Denver, Salt Lake, maybe even a Texas, where a lot of the businesses and populations are going? I understand that it\u2019s easier to build supply. But, some of the markets are supposed to have -- I mean, have been outperforming you guys for like the last three years and luckily, they\u2019re going to again in \u201823 and they have a lot of supply. So, just that you can maybe comment on how the Angela climb-in era could look regarding portfolio composition?\nAngela Kleiman: This is kind of a broader strategy question. And so, let me start with why we are here. And that\u2019s to -- you even said it, the Sunbelt has outperformed for three years. Well, to us, three years isn\u2019t exactly long-term. And what drove these three years is a pandemic. And so, the way we look at the world is we don\u2019t expect to have regular pandemics that will completely change behavior and legislation. But, in terms of this general discussion about other markets, this won\u2019t -- looking at other markets is not a Angela Kleiman era, specific pointing to that. It\u2019s a discipline that we\u2019ve always had. Mike\u2019s been doing this for a very long time and I will continue that work and make sure that we are in the right place and where we can generate the highest long-term CAGR for our shareholders. And supply is definitely something that we cannot ignore, because that is a key reason of our outperformance combined with being in a center of innovation that drives demand and income growth and job growth and they\u2019re all interrelated. And so, we\u2019ll continue that discipline. And if we do end up venturing outside of California, we will also do it in a very thoughtful way. And they all consider our cost of capital, consider future growth and of course, the basic supply demand dynamics.\nNeil Malkin: And then, I guess, the other one is on -- I don\u2019t know, if we talked a lot about the delinquency in California. The February 23, is that for sure going to burn out? Because I know that throughout the pandemic, there have been a lot of fits and starts and lines in the sand that have been quickly erased? Is that like a firm date? It just seems like, obviously, every company is different. But people have had pretty varied opinions on how long it will take to sort of get back to pre-COVID bad debt. So I don\u2019t know. Do you guys? Is that like a certainty? I mean, how do you think about that? And potentially did that go into any of your market rent forecasts by chance?\nBarb Pak: The February 1, \u201823 date is set with LA, the city council has approved that, so that is not changing at this point. So, if a tenant is not -- has not paid current as of February 1st, we can start eviction proceedings. We do think delinquency could remain elevated in the first half of next year as we work through LA and the rest of our portfolio and getting tenants out. We are making progress, but it\u2019s going to take time. We think the second half of the year, things trend closer to our long term average as we get the non-paying tenants out and replace them with paying tenants. And as Angela said, there could be some temporary impacts to occupancy, but we don\u2019t expect it to have a huge impact to the market and to our results. We think the delinquency trend is favorable. The one offset to 2023 that you have to keep in mind is we don\u2019t expect to receive emergency rental assistance next year, which we received quite a bit this year. So, that\u2019s why we think delinquency won\u2019t be a significant positive or a significant negative in 2023. That should be pretty much a push we think at this point.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC. Please proceed with your question.\nBrad Heffern: Hey, everyone. Just going back to an earlier question, are you seeing any sort of elevated levels of move-outs to lost jobs, not necessarily tech specifically, but just in general?\nAngela Kleiman: No, we really haven\u2019t. What we are seeing the move out is really attributed to just normal market activities and then layer on to that, the other dynamics that I mentioned earlier.\nBrad Heffern: Okay, got it. And then I heard concession stats for the Pacific Northwest and for Southern California. Can you give where things stand in Northern California?\nAngela Kleiman: Sure. Northern California is sitting about a week, and that is a slight, like two days uptick from last quarter. So, it\u2019s just not a meaningful change.\nOperator: Our next question -- oh, go ahead. I\u2019m sorry.\nAngela Kleiman: That\u2019s okay. I was just going to add that keep in mind, our Northern California portfolio is mostly suburban and San Francisco consists only about 2.5% of our portfolio.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Great. Thank you. Mike or Angela, I know you guys are talking about that 2% market rent growth feeling a bit dire, but I guess how do we get comfortable with the fact that the loss-to-lease was 7% in September of this year versus a historical level of 3%. Yet you still expect the loss-to-lease to go negative in December, which would imply kind of a disproportionate slowdown here. So, how do we get comfortable with that? And then, why do we expect it to get better as we enter into early next year?\nMichael Schall: Yes, I\u2019ll start and maybe Angela will have a comment. It\u2019s a seasonal pattern every year, and it\u2019s not the same every year. There are variations. It\u2019s really defined by the drop-off in demand i.e. jobs from October to December and supply continues on being delivered during that period of time. And so, that causes the seasonal slowdown. And so, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s lumpy and all that other stuff. And so, we are just commenting on the historical patterns. So, by the end of the year, probably loss-to-lease is zero or negative gain-to-lease. And then January hits and we start getting all the new budgets, all the new hiring, et cetera, that occurs in that first quarter, and that makes the markets recover. So, that\u2019s how it works. It\u2019s been like that for many years. Is there anything, Angela, specific to this year that looks different?\nAngela Kleiman: No, other than that, it\u2019s so far better than historical patterns. I don\u2019t see anything different.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Okay. And then just secondly, certainly congrats to you both, and I\u2019m just curious Angela, with you moving into the CEO role, what are sort of the plans, or are you planning to elevate somebody internally to take your place to oversee operations? And how should we think about sort of the timing of that announcement?\nAngela Kleiman: Well, the transition is about six months. And so, Mike is still the CEO until March 31st, and I\u2019m going to -- I plan to enjoy every single day of that until that. As far as the team is concerned, I am not -- we are not going to make any changes to the operating team. We have a terrific team and great bench. And if you look at our company history for my first nine years as CEO, we did not have a COO. So, this is not -- we\u2019re not doing anything unprecedented.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Richard Anderson with SMBC.\nRichard Anderson: Congratulations to both of you, Mike and Angela. Angela may be the first order of business. Can you simplify the page numbering, S-18.2? There\u2019s an infinite number of numbers just so you know, you can make it a little simpler, all of us. But that\u2019s just a little side note. When I think about this 2% number that we\u2019re all talking about, if you were to go back and say in a normal time and you were to look at S-17, and you look at the supply number that you\u2019re referencing of 0.6, and the job forecast at 0.4, and it\u2019s a normal time, what would what would be the number. So, what\u2019s backing into that? What would be the Fed impact that\u2019s come to the 2% number? But, if it were more of a normal type of world, would that be 4, would that be 5, would that be 8? Could you comment on that?\nMichael Schall: Hey, Rich, I just want to make sure I understand the question. So, we have this 0.4 and 0.6, and that results in a 2% rent growth, primarily because we\u2019re mostly in the B area. Well, most of the stock on the West Coast is a B, by definition. And there\u2019s just a huge housing shortage. It\u2019s the backdrop behind all of this. And so, we think that we can get some rent growth. Obviously, moving into for-sale housing is people are locked into the rental renter pool in the B space. And as a result of that, we think we can get a little bit. So I think that\u2019s -- so no matter what we think we can get about somewhere around 2%. And then we\u2019d never, except in recessions, we always have job growth and household growth, using sort of a 2 to 1 ratio, we\u2019ve -- it\u2019s almost always well above the supply. So, it\u2019s only in a in a recession scenario that that occurs. If there isn\u2019t a recession next year, then we would expect and we\u2019d expect the job to be much better. And that pretty quickly covers supply. And again, in other markets, you\u2019re going to have a lot more supply, and they\u2019re going to have the same demand issue. So on a run basis, we still think we do better. Does that answer?\nRichard Anderson: Yes. Not really. The 2% is impacted by Fed action, as you described. I\u2019m just asking, you know, what\u2019s the factor in that 2% and what would it be if in the absence of this environment, based on the building blocks? But, if you don\u2019t have an answer to that...\nMichael Schall: Well, I\u2019ll go back to what Angela said, then, you start with the earn-in, which is somewhere around 3.5 using the methodology that she gets to, and then you would take roughly half of the economic rent forecasts that would be based on the better scenario. So, if the supply-demand is better next year and that 2% becomes 4%, we would expect the building blocks to be 3.5 plus to -- or 5.5.\nRichard Anderson: Second question is, we did some work on where all the REITs stack up relative to the entirety of their markets, not just competitive to your existing portfolio, but the entirety of the market. And you guys registered the best in my opinion, running from a rent perspective, just below the market average. I think that\u2019s a good place to be if people trade down to a cheaper alternative. If you\u2019re operating at the very top of the market, you could lose some people not have others coming in the front door. I assume you agree with that. And second, do you see any of that happening where people are coming from a more expensive unit, and coming to you or more Class B varietal? And that creates an extra leg of demand for you guys, as we go into this rough patch?\nMichael Schall: Yes. I think Rich, you have to throw -- that is great question, by the way. I think you have to throw affordability into the mix. So incomes are, especially in the tech markets, they\u2019re extraordinarily high. And the screening on rent to income is very low as a result of that. I mean, during the pandemic, as I said earlier, rents in Northern California about where they were pre-COVID, but the median household income has moved materially. And so, it screens very affordable. That\u2019s not the case in Southern California. And so, I would expect to see and I don\u2019t have any direct indication or reporting on this, but I would expect to see some doubling up and/or move moving to more affordable units, given the very large rent growth, 35%, from pre-COVID roughly, at that level. Even with some income growth, there still property is affordability pressure in Southern California, and I would definitely start to see some of those other things that happen, people move farther away, they double up, they trade down, et cetera. So, I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re getting at, and I totally agree with the premise. \nOperator: That concludes our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to hand it back to management for closing remarks.\nMichael Schall: This is Mike. Once again, I want to thank you for joining our call. We -- Angela and I both really appreciate all the congratulatory sentiment out there. Much appreciated. We look forward to seeing many of you at NAREIT in a few weeks, and have a good day. Thank you. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Schall",
            "content": "Thank you for joining us today, and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. Angela Kleiman and Barb Pak will follow me with prepared remarks, and Adam Berry is here for Q&A. I will begin by congratulating Angela for her appointment to the Essex Board and for chosen as the next CEO of the Company following my planned retirement in March 2023. I've known Angela for almost two decades and we have worked closely together since she joined the Company 13 years ago. Angela embraces and exemplifies Essex's strategy and core values and is a dedicated thoughtful leader as well as an excellent negotiator. Our recent leadership announcement was a combination of the multiyear succession plan administered by the Essex Board, and I appreciate each participant's commitment to the plan that resulted in its success. It has been an honor to lead this awesome company made possible by my great leadership team and the coordinated effort of every Essex associate. My thanks to all of you. Today, I will touch on our third quarter results, introduce our initial market level rent forecast for 2023 and provide an update on the apartment investment markets. Our third quarter results represent our fifth consecutive quarter of improving core FFO per share. On a year-over-year basis, we reported core FFO per share and NOI growth of 18.3% and 15.4%, respectively, with core FFO exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by $0.04 per share. The positive results are reflective of the team's execution and the continued recovery throughout our markets, largely driven by the ongoing rebound in Northern California and Seattle with Southern California remaining a consistent and strong performer. Year-to-date, the economy on the West Coast has shown resiliency with job growth as of September 2022 of 4.3% in Southern California and significantly higher in the tech markets of Northern California and Seattle. The positive job growth is partly attributable to the recovery of workers lost amid the significant shutdowns early in the pandemic, especially leisure, hospitality and service jobs that were added throughout the summer. As a result, it is not surprising that the unemployment rate in each Essex market with the exception of Los Angeles is under 4%, including San Francisco and San Jose in the mid 2% range. The unemployment rate in Los Angeles is higher at 4.5%, likely related to the ongoing eviction moratorium in the city of Los Angeles, which is expected to run -- to end in February 2023. Job openings at the large tech companies have declined from record levels during the pandemic, although they remain significant with approximately 20,000 jobs available, roughly consistent with the number of job openings they reported between 2016 and early 2020. Thus, while we recognize that tech job growth is slowing, the large tech companies are well-capitalized and continue to expand and hire in our markets. As in previous years, we've included our initial forecast for 2023 market level rent growth on page, S-17 in the supplemental. Our forecast begins with the consensus estimates of third-party economists for the national economy with respect to GDP and job growth, indicated at the top left of page S-17. Based on these estimates, our data analytics team estimates job growth in each Essex metro. On the supply side, we use our ground up fundamental research to estimate apartment deliveries, which is proven to be highly accurate over many years. Everyone's visibility into next year is limited by uncertainty related to past and future Fed actions and their impact on the overall U.S. economy, and therefore the forecasted rent growth may vary if the key assumptions prove inaccurate. In summary, housing supply across the Essex markets is expected to grow at 0.6% of existing housing stock with the greatest increase occurring in Seattle with a 1.1% increase. Job growth is expected to be new next year, growing at 0.4% overall in the Essex market, with the best job growth expected to be in San Francisco at just over 1%. As a result of these demand and supply assumptions, we expect net effective new lease rents to increase 2% in 2023 with our California markets expected to marginally outperform Seattle. On a year-over-year basis, we expect apartment supply to decline about 10% in 2023 with Northern California having the largest expected reduction down 45%. We also expect 2023 single family deliveries to be similar to 2022, even with permits growing modestly given much higher mortgage rates. With respect to for-sale housing, declining housing production and reduced affordability are tailwinds for apartments in the Essex markets, representing a small positive factor, contributing to our rent outlook next year. Given economists' expectations for a modest recession in 2023, I'd like to summarize our historical experience about operating our portfolio in previous economic downturns. Generally, in each significant past recession, our weakest market has been Seattle, which is due to the confluence of negative job growth and higher levels of housing supply deliveries. Northern California follows a similar pattern to Seattle with respect to job losses during recessions, although with significantly less supply that results in outperformance relative to Seattle. Finally, Southern California is our best performer during recessions, given its diverse economy and minimal supply. That being said, each recession is unique and there are several factors that could lead to a different outcome. First, most of the previous recessions followed a long economic expansion where rents grew substantially. And it's those higher rents that pressures affordability that fosters higher level of apartment supply. On the West Coast, rents plummeted in the early part of the pandemic and our recovery was much delayed compared to the rest of the country with Southern California's recovery beginning in mid-2021, and Northern California and Seattle in early 2022. As a result, the West Coast is still in the early stages of its from the 2020 recession and housing supply has not had sufficient time to fully recover. In addition, with many offices closed during the pandemic, it was common to hire remotely with the expectation that workers would need to relocate closer to offices upon re-openings, which is now occurring. The relocation of employees back to the West Coast pursuant to return to office programs, represents demand for apartments that is generally not included in job growth. Finally, we expect less outward migration in the next few years, primarily because those that typically leave California, such as the newly retired, probably left early in the pandemic when businesses were shut down. In a moment, Angela will comment further on migration. Turning to the apartment transaction market. We have recently seen a few deals close at valuations that were negotiated before the most recent increase in interest rates, and conditions have changed enough since then to significantly impact transactions. As expected, the immediate impact of higher interest rates will result in diverging buyer and seller expectations for property values, resulting in a larger bid-ask spread. Generally, it takes more than higher interest rates to create financial distress, especially with recent strong rent growth given inflationary pressures. However, pockets of distress may develop from credit or liquidity events or excessive Fed tightening, although no major issues are apparent at this point. Broker price talks with respect to apartment transactions indicates that cap rates for high-quality and well-located apartments are in the mid-4% range in the Essex markets. Finally, I wanted to note that, our balance sheet is in great condition, thanks to the unwavering urgency of Barb and the finance team over the past several years. When the markets turn positive, we expect excellent opportunities to invest creatively, and we will be in a position to be opportunistic. With that, I'll turn the call over to Angela Kleiman. Hey Steve, let me try to handle that one. So S-17, beginning a few years ago, decided to start with the consensus of third-party economists as to the U.S. and then drilled down from there into what that means for our markets. And we obviously have -- Chairman Powell there talking about breaking things and pain to come at a mild recession, which is what this is based on. And so rather than using our own how we feel, we think it's important that we create a scenario that's based on the consensus of the people that are really studying these things and certainly not ignoring what they're saying. And so, that's where this macro scenario comes from. Do we feel like that's a little bit dire? Yes, we do. But again, several years ago, we made the decision to start basing S-17 on the macroeconomists view of the world, which, in fact, is pretty dire. And it seems to us that we shouldn't ignore the Fed's comments about pain to be had, et cetera. So, that's where that scenario comes from. Do we feel like things are a little bit better than that? Well, yes, we do. And if we were basing this on how we feel, we would come up with something that is more optimistic than this. But again, we shouldn't ignore the Fed, and that seems like it's what's happening out there. And we think that's fundamentally misguided, I guess. Does that make sense? Well, that -- and that's exactly what the third-party economists are saying. So, up there in the upper left-hand corner is the consensus of the -- again, third-party macroeconomists that say, job is going to be minus 0.2% next year. And so that forms the basis of what we think. So, we outperform in terms of job growth the U.S. economy. And in fact, that minus 2% for the U.S. is translating into 0.4% job growth for us. So not a lot. But again, it's a pretty dire scenario. And so, that's where that comes from. Again, we don't feel like it's this bad. I mean based on what we see in front of us today, we're having some seasonality here in October. We expect that. Loss-to-lease typically goes negative by the end of the year, and it probably will this year. Keep in mind, the demand side of the equation is driven by jobs. And obviously, we pay attention to the seasonally adjusted jobs. But the reality is, if you look at total nonfarm employment, it gets pretty soft in the fourth quarter. And so, these things can happen. So basically, we don't feel -- we feel like this is a pretty draconian scenario, but we're trying to maintain some consistency with respect to what we are trying to put out there with respect to S-17. And just following through on the historical pattern, and looking at what the economists out there are saying, we think this is that scenario. Could it be different? Absolutely it could be different, and we hope it's different. But again, I don't want to ignore the elephant in the room. It seems pretty important to actually consider what the macro economists are saying and what it means for us. And I would add to that, everyone across the nation is going to feel the same pain if this occurs. It's not just a West Coast thing. It's a national thing. It starts with the U.S. job growth. And then, we look at historical relationships to try to determine what it means for the West Coast. And that's where these numbers are coming from. Yes. Alex, I just wanted to add a couple of things perhaps. So first thing is that Angela, she thinks for next year the kind of proxy formula is that 3.5 plus half the growth of next year, which is the 2%, which is the pretty dire scenario. So, I'd say there's some potential upside if that dire scenario doesn't take place. So that would be one thing. And then I just want to mention that we feel pretty good about where the Company is positioned right now. Core FFO right now is at the high end of the bicoastal peers when you go back and compare it to Q4 2019. So, we feel good about that. And we've accomplished that with really Southern California at sort of full recovery -- in full recovery mode, not Northern California and Seattle. And we attribute that to the fact that both of them fell further and have a longer period of time that's required for recovery. In Northern California, for example, rent levels right now are roughly equivalent to where they were at pre-COVID. So, there's been no rent -- in Northern California. And historically, the tech markets are the driver of growth, and I suspect that they will be the driver of growth going forward. We're just not there yet. So, we feel good about this. When we think about some of the other things, incomes, median incomes \u2013 household incomes in San Francisco, San Jose are now over $145,000 a year. That's the median, which is pretty amazing and screens very affordable as it relates to rental value. And that's what draws people to the West Coast. Everyone talks about, well, the costs are higher on the West Coast, but the reality is they're drawn by the incomes that are much higher as well. And so, we think that there's going to continue to be a recovery as we recovered jobs lost in the recession in Northern California and Seattle. We think that they will once again become the drivers of the Company going forward, and very little of that is priced into the stock, which makes us think that there's very good upside here. Hi John, it's Mike. So again, we're trying to start with third-party economists as to the macro scenario. And then what happens in the -- across the country will be a function of that. And again, typically, we outperform the national economy with respect to job growth. And so, the consensus of the big economists is for U.S. job growth to be at minus 2% next year. And we think we'll do better than that. We're plus 0.4%, but 9,500 new jobs under the 0.4 scenario, it is about 4,800 households against 50,000-plus new supply in the marketplace. So again, do we think that will happen? I mean, as of now and given what Angela just said, it seems like that's pretty dire. But again, we should not ignore what the economists are saying and we should not ignore the Fed talking about wrecking things and pain points. So, we don't know. Our visibility into next year is no better than yours. And whereas we feel pretty good today, as I said earlier, we can't ignore these numbers. So again, I'd rather have this discussion so you guys know where we're coming from than to just create a scenario out of thin air because that doesn't sound relevant. When we do our budgeting process, we start with economic rent growth. I don't know how you do a budget without that because you can't leave it to the property teams to try to decide what rents are going to do. You have to have some macro view of the world. And based on that, you populate your budgets based on supply and demand at the local level. I don't know how else to do it. And I'm not saying our budgets are based on this scenario because that -- because again, it does seem somewhat dire. However, we are mindful of the macro economy. We're mindful of what the Fed is saying, and we're going to adjust accordingly. Does that make sense? Yes. It's Mike. I'll start and then flip it to Angela here in a minute. The answer is yes, of course. We see all kinds of differences out there. And I'm going to give you the broader perspective of what our portfolio is and why it is the way it is, which is we hope to have properties throughout the fastest growing metros. And again, we look at supply demand to try to get to those numbers. That's how we deploy capital. We generally want to be in the B or renter by necessity category. Because when new supply hits, or when you have a supply-demand imbalance, which could happen next year, the properties that are hit the hardest are those that are near the new supply, because the new -- when someone down the street has eight weeks free, and you're a brand new apartment competing with that -- competing directly with that, you may be impacted to a much greater extent. So, our portfolio is mostly suburban in nature. Again, we're not trying to be in San Francisco and San Jose, we're trying to be in the whole Northern California, metroplex, within let's say one hour commute distance from the major job nodes. That is our portfolio composition. And we think there are -- there's inherent safety in the Bs, because you can't produce the quality property. And in a world where the -- as are more concentrated in the downtown, and the newer product is more susceptible to the impact of concessions if they increase substantially, we think those are the areas going to get hit the hardest. And the B quality property will do quite well. So Angela, I'll flip it to you? Nick, I'm going to start with that too. I mean, our portfolio is not positioned to be near the tech companies per se or to cater to the tech employees. We are trying to cater to the broad range of employment within our market. So, we do have a couple buildings that are predominantly tech related employees, but it's the exception, and actually not even close to the average. So, we are a reflection of the broader economy. And therefore, the tech component in Northern California and Seattle will be more, but there is a lot of -- there's a pretty diverse job base there in general. And so again, that goes into the philosophy of the company. So I don't think that, we are particularly exposed to tech. We are more exposed to supply-demand imbalances and which we hope won't happen. But again, the dire financial scenario on the S-17 sort of contemplates that scenario. So, a couple of questions in there. I'll try to go backward. As far as distressed opportunities, we're not seeing them as of yet. There is talk of the potential for rate caps expiring and a need for that kind of rescue capital. We are not seeing it yet. And I haven't really heard from anyone else who has seen it. There is definitely talk but haven't seen any of those opportunities come to fruition yet. As far as -- let's see, I think your other question was just what we are seeing right now on our pref side. We have increased returns. So, for deals that we are currently pursuing, we have increased returns between 100 and 150 basis points. I would say where the market is today, there are opportunities given the difficulty of debt today. But underwriting is a little more opaque. So I think for the fourth quarter, there is probably -- we have one or two deals in our pipeline right now. I don't probably see more than that coming into the fourth quarter. I think things will slow down a little and people may take a pause. And then going into next year, I think, it will start back up and we will see more opportunities. Of course, it is. Yes. I mean, I would say when I look at supply, at around 0.6% of stock, that looks like it's probably the lowest anywhere in the U.S. that's what I'm guessing, are on the low-end, let's say. And supply is the enemy in our view. And trying to avoid supply is a key part of why we are in these markets. So, if we get a little bit of demand growth, I think we will do just fine, and/or if the recession is just a short recession, and we're in and then back out of it, that scenario would be better than what is on page S-17. So, we -- it appears as S-17 is probably close to the worst case scenario, but of course, none of us really know. Yes. This is Mike. I think most of them were domestic players. I mean, I'm not sure that we know exactly where they're coming from. But, we know that we were refinanced out of several deals with high yield funds. And I didn't -- don't know exactly who they were, but it seemed like they were domestic funds, high -- domestic high yield funds. So, and there were a lot of them out there. So, we were -- these redemptions have come to an end, consistent with what Adam said, and it looks like the market is much less competitive now and going forward, which we think is a good thing. Yes, I'll start and maybe Angela will have a comment. It's a seasonal pattern every year, and it's not the same every year. There are variations. It's really defined by the drop-off in demand i.e. jobs from October to December and supply continues on being delivered during that period of time. And so, that causes the seasonal slowdown. And so, it's -- it's lumpy and all that other stuff. And so, we are just commenting on the historical patterns. So, by the end of the year, probably loss-to-lease is zero or negative gain-to-lease. And then January hits and we start getting all the new budgets, all the new hiring, et cetera, that occurs in that first quarter, and that makes the markets recover. So, that's how it works. It's been like that for many years. Is there anything, Angela, specific to this year that looks different? Hey, Rich, I just want to make sure I understand the question. So, we have this 0.4 and 0.6, and that results in a 2% rent growth, primarily because we're mostly in the B area. Well, most of the stock on the West Coast is a B, by definition. And there's just a huge housing shortage. It's the backdrop behind all of this. And so, we think that we can get some rent growth. Obviously, moving into for-sale housing is people are locked into the rental renter pool in the B space. And as a result of that, we think we can get a little bit. So I think that's -- so no matter what we think we can get about somewhere around 2%. And then we'd never, except in recessions, we always have job growth and household growth, using sort of a 2 to 1 ratio, we've -- it's almost always well above the supply. So, it's only in a in a recession scenario that that occurs. If there isn't a recession next year, then we would expect and we'd expect the job to be much better. And that pretty quickly covers supply. And again, in other markets, you're going to have a lot more supply, and they're going to have the same demand issue. So on a run basis, we still think we do better. Does that answer? Well, I'll go back to what Angela said, then, you start with the earn-in, which is somewhere around 3.5 using the methodology that she gets to, and then you would take roughly half of the economic rent forecasts that would be based on the better scenario. So, if the supply-demand is better next year and that 2% becomes 4%, we would expect the building blocks to be 3.5 plus to -- or 5.5. Yes. I think Rich, you have to throw -- that is great question, by the way. I think you have to throw affordability into the mix. So incomes are, especially in the tech markets, they're extraordinarily high. And the screening on rent to income is very low as a result of that. I mean, during the pandemic, as I said earlier, rents in Northern California about where they were pre-COVID, but the median household income has moved materially. And so, it screens very affordable. That's not the case in Southern California. And so, I would expect to see and I don't have any direct indication or reporting on this, but I would expect to see some doubling up and/or move moving to more affordable units, given the very large rent growth, 35%, from pre-COVID roughly, at that level. Even with some income growth, there still property is affordability pressure in Southern California, and I would definitely start to see some of those other things that happen, people move farther away, they double up, they trade down, et cetera. So, I think that's what you're getting at, and I totally agree with the premise. This is Mike. Once again, I want to thank you for joining our call. We -- Angela and I both really appreciate all the congratulatory sentiment out there. Much appreciated. We look forward to seeing many of you at NAREIT in a few weeks, and have a good day. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks, Angela. Today I'll discuss our third quarter results followed by an update on investments and the balance sheet. I'm pleased to report third quarter core FFO per share a $3.69, a $0.04 beat to the midpoint of our guidance range. Half of the outperformance was due to lower operating expenses, which is timing related and the other half was from higher co-investment income due to better NOI growth at the joint venture properties and higher preferred equity income. For the full year, we are raising the midpoint of core FFO by $0.02 per share to $14.47, representing approximately 16% growth compared to last year. As it relates to delinquency, we are seeing continued improvement in our gross delinquency, which is helping to offset less emergency rental assistance funds. The same-property portfolio gross delinquency improved sequentially from 4.5% in the second quarter to approximately 3.5% in the third quarter. October improved further to around 2%. We suspect the gross delinquency trends will continue to improve as we work to recapture delinquent units. However, the improvement is unlikely to be linear. One additional positive development that recently occurred is the City of LA approved removing eviction protection starting on February 1st of next year. This will allow us to recapture delinquent units in an area that accounts for approximately 40% of our outstanding bad debt and will allow us to finally get back to our historical level of delinquency. However, it will take time to achieve this goal, and we would expect delinquency will remain elevated through the first half of 2023, with the expectation that we will get closer to our historical average of 35 basis points of scheduled rent by the end of next year. Turning to our stock repurchase and investments. Consistent with last quarter, investing in our own portfolio and select preferred equity investments offers the best risk-adjusted returns in today's market. In the third quarter, we repurchased $97 million of common stock at a significant discount to our internal NAV, which we plan to match fund on a leverage-neutral basis with proceeds from a disposition expected to close in the fourth quarter. As it relates to other transactions, we closed $65 million of new preferred equity and subordinated loan investments during the quarter and committed to one additional investment in October. These new commitments are expected to be match funded with redemptions of two structured finance investments that are slated to close in the fourth quarter. Finally, I want to provide some additional color on the strength of the balance sheet. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio remains healthy at 5.8 times and we expect this to further improve as EBITDA continues to grow. It should be noted that we operated around these same leverage levels before the pandemic and our balance sheet metrics are strong. In addition, we are well positioned from a capital needs perspective. In October, we closed a delayed draw term loan that will be fully drawn in April of 2023 with proceeds intended to repay $300 million in bonds that mature next year. We have swapped this debt to an all-in fixed rate of 4.2%. As a result of this transaction, we have all our known funding needs addressed until May of 2024. The company has no significant unfunded development needs and can fund the dividend, operations and capital expenditure needs from free cash flow. Additionally, our variable rate exposure excluding our line of credit is minimal at less than 4% of our consolidated debt. With over $1.1 billion in liquidity, no funding needs for the next 18 months and access to a variety of capital sources, the balance sheet remains well positioned. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions. The February 1, \u201823 date is set with LA, the city council has approved that, so that is not changing at this point. So, if a tenant is not -- has not paid current as of February 1st, we can start eviction proceedings. We do think delinquency could remain elevated in the first half of next year as we work through LA and the rest of our portfolio and getting tenants out. We are making progress, but it's going to take time. We think the second half of the year, things trend closer to our long term average as we get the non-paying tenants out and replace them with paying tenants. And as Angela said, there could be some temporary impacts to occupancy, but we don't expect it to have a huge impact to the market and to our results. We think the delinquency trend is favorable. The one offset to 2023 that you have to keep in mind is we don't expect to receive emergency rental assistance next year, which we received quite a bit this year. So, that's why we think delinquency won't be a significant positive or a significant negative in 2023. That should be pretty much a push we think at this point."

            "content": "Thank you, Mike. I will begin by expressing my sincere gratitude to Mike for his mentorship and guidance over the past 13 years. I am honored to have the opportunity to lead this organization and to build upon the Company's long history of thoughtful capital allocation and operational excellence. My comments today will focus on our third quarter performance, followed by some regional highlights, then wrap up with the key operational initiatives that we are excited about. Starting with the third quarter, during much of this period, we capitalized on the strength of the underlying fundamentals in our markets by pushing rents and achieved 10.3% year-over-year growth in new lease rates in the third quarter. Although this is a deceleration compared to the 20% growth in the second quarter, keep in mind that new lease rates in the first half of last year declined by about 6%, but in the second half new lease rates surged to positive 17%. The tough year-over-year comps is the key driver of the deceleration. And the third quarter results are in line with our expectations. In general, we have seen a normal seasonal rent pattern. Accordingly, as we approached the end of the third quarter, we shifted to an occupancy focus strategy. Turning to the delinquency. In recent months, we have begun to recapture more units from nonpaying tenants. With the ending of eviction moratorium, it is no surprise that the number of move-outs related to nonpaying tenants have increased. Looking forward, we plan for a higher volume of move-outs, which may create a temporary headwind in occupancy for the rest of the year and into 2023. For this reason, even though we have shifted to favor occupancy, we anticipate our occupancy to be slightly lower than historical levels. The good news is that regulations are being pulled back, which is allowing us to finally make progress on delinquency. Moving on to regional highlights, starting with Pacific Northwest. After a strong start to the year, rents in this region have peaked in late July. The seasonality through the third quarter, which includes the typical decline in market rents subsequent to the peak is consistent with what we have experienced between 2016 and 2019. However, since mid-September, we've been facing softer demand along with higher level of supply deliveries in the second half of the year. So, we are monitoring this market closely.  As for Northern California, this region has led our growth in net effective new lease rates since the start of the year. Strong job growth and return to office are two key contributing factors. Bay Area net in-migration has continued to accelerate this year. In the third quarter, over 35% of move-ins were primarily from outside of our markets, which is an increase from 15% in the first quarter. Notably, we are seeing positive migration trends from markets as diverse as Dallas and Boston. Consistent with our previous commentary on commitment of tech giants to continue to expand in Northern California, we are excited to see Google break ground last week on its massive mixed use development in San Jose. This development is expected to bring 25,000 high-paying jobs and effectively doubling the amount of office space in Downtown San Jose. This will be a long-term benefit for Essex as we own almost 6,000 units in this region. On to Southern California, healthy job growth is continuing to drive incremental demand for rental housing. As such, this region continues to perform well. We're also seeing positive in-migration to Southern California, with 30% of our third quarter movies coming from outside the region compared to 17% in the first quarter. Turning to key operations initiatives, we have completed the rollout of first phase of our property collections operating model, which focused on leasing, administration and customer service. By way of background, this model optimizes our geographic density and transforms our business from operating each property individually to a collection of around 9 to 12 properties. The shift in business strategy enables us to leverage our team and technology to improve the customer experience and achieve significant efficiencies. I'm pleased to announce that Phase 1 is fully rolled out across the entire portfolio, ahead of plan and the progress is beginning to show up in our financial results. Year-to-date administrative expenses were up only by 1.4%. Despite a significantly higher wage increases, along with other inflationary pressures on expenses. The next step is to apply the collections operating model to the maintenance function. As we have demonstrated previously, this model has created more career advancement opportunities for employees through specialization, while improving efficiency and customer service. The maintenance collections highlight is currently underway and rollout is planned to start by mid next year. Lastly, on the technology front, the implementation of Funnel software suite is progressing well. As you may recall, Funnel is RET Ventures company with whom we have chosen to co-develop applications to enhance our platform. The Funnel product will handle the end to end customer experience from initial prospect inquiries through the full resident lifecycle, which will result in better experience for our customers. From an employee perspective, this technology will streamline or automate the manual tasks associated with roughly 60,000 transactions each year. Our initial pilot showed a promising 35% reduction in task time associated with these activities. Continued refinements are underway, and we are excited to work toward a full deployment by the end of 2023. With that, I will turn the call over to Barb Pak. Hey Nick, it's Angela here. So, on the earn-in for 2023, I think -- if it's okay with you, I wanted to step back and make sure we're using a consistent definition. For us, the way we look at earn-in is we look to the September loss-to-lease, it's not too hot and not too cold, and take 50% of that. So, in this case, September loss-to-lease was close to 7%, taking half of it would be about 3.5%, and that will be our earning, and we assume no market rent growth. Now, what we've heard is there's a question about 2023 revenue growth and how does the earn-in applied to that. And so what we've done in the past is explain that by saying, you take your earn-in and then we look at our 2023 S17 market rent growth and take 50% of that. So, that would be -- the market rent growth is 2%, so half of that would be 1%. You add that to the 3.5% earn-in, that gives you a proxy of about 4.5% for revenue growth for 2023. And so, as far as the loss-to-lease, where we are is we're about 2.5% loss-to-lease in October for the portfolio. And of course, it varies by region, but that's coming from a loss-to-lease in September of 6.7%, so definitely a deceleration. But it is expected and loss-to-lease at this level for October is actually better than our historical patterns. Typically, around this time of the year, we're at about 1% loss-to-lease and heading towards zero by year-end. So at 2.8, we're feeling pretty darn good about the portfolio. Sure, happy to. So, on the new lease rates for October at 2.8%, it's actually a pretty wide range. With starting -- I'll just go from North to South. Pacific Northwest, it's negative, about 90 basis points, and that's consistent with my earlier commentary about the softness in that market. And then, Northern California, the strongest at about 4.5% and Southern California close to 2%. So, Southern continues to be the steady Eddie. And Northern California is rebounding as we have anticipated. Sure. We -- concession usage is -- for us, we focus on where there's a competitive supply. So, of course, during our -- if we're doing our own lease-up, we use concessions, we line that as part of our pricing tool. But absent of that, it's a function of how many lease-up do you have near property, and how do we remain competitive and meet the market? So, in terms of the concessions usage, just the change between October and the third quarter, it has ticked up, and it's primarily driven by Seattle. So Seattle -- in the third quarter. And as mentioned that we had a very normal third quarter, was less than a week. And it is now about two weeks, and that's the biggest change. With all the other markets, it's incremental a couple of days more, which is consistent with what we expected. And so, portfolio overall, our concessions has gone up from say half a week to about a week portfolio-wise, and with the key driver being Seattle. Yes. Hey Alex, there's obviously lots of moving pieces here, and you're asking good questions, kind of what does that mean for the bottom line? Let me just clarify a few things and then I'll flip it back to Mike to talk about S-17 and maybe follow-up on the FFO. The 7% that you're referring to is September loss-to-lease. And what we normally do is take half of that with earn-in. So, that's how we got to the 3.5%. And so, that's pretty consistent math for proxy purposes. And as far as the expense comment, I do want to address that for a minute. I do think that we should perform a little better than inflation on average. And especially on the administrative side of it, that should be quite a bit below inflation. And with -- since we have not yet rolled out maintenance collections that will be higher than the admin growth. And so, we expect controllables to come in comparable to this year at about 4% for next year. So that's uncontrollable. And so, that's some of the building blocks from the P&L perspective. And then Mike? Sure, sure. We -- there's two things happening on the move-outs. The higher turnover is driven by two factors. One is, of course, the Seattle softness that I've talked about earlier. And it's attributed mostly to an elevated level of supply in Seattle in the second half. And of course, when there's more supply, there's more concessions, and that draws people out of stabilized properties. That's not usual during a period where corporate hirings are slowing, once again. That's what's happening in Seattle. As far as California, the higher move-out is attributed to the nonpaying tenants moving out, which we see is a good thing. And so, with the LA moratorium expiring next year, we do see another opportunity there. So, we're able to make good progress on the delinquency front there. So, that's -- hopefully, that's what you're looking for. I see what you're saying. Yes. So, the -- normally, when we see market strength, which is usually during a period of strong demand, we push rents. And as we head toward the end of the third quarter and into our seasonal low in the fourth quarter, we historically switch that strategy to push occupancy. And so, what we're doing here is consistent with what we've always done in the past. And what we're seeing is this is -- what I'm trying to convey there is that this is a normalized market that's stable, and we're essentially shifting this strategy to maximize revenue during this period of time. And the reason -- so normally, what you will see is in the fourth quarter, our occupancy may run, say, in the mid to high 96%. But because of this eviction headwind, it may run a little bit lower. So maybe in the low 96%. But I wanted to signal to the community that that's not because there's any problem here, this is actually a good thing. Yes. So, if I look at the September loss-to-lease and use 50% as a proxy. And then look at that number relative to prior periods, pre-COVID, this -- the September number is actually about twice as high as the normalized period. Normally, around September, the loss-to-lease is around 3%. And so, this is one of the reasons why we feel good about where our portfolio sits and as we head into next year. Absent, of course, a recession, we certainly should do quite well. Yes, that sounds about right. Now the one thing I do want to clarify is that everybody calculates it a little bit differently. And so for us, we are not including concessions. So, if we include concessions, that earn-in number, obviously, will be much higher. But we're trying to just keep it apples-to-apples, so to minimize confusion. So, it's the same baseline. Well, I think maybe I'll just give you a quick example of what Mike is talking about. Concessions in downtown LA is about 1.5 weeks, and concessions throughout the rest of the LA area averages about a week. And so that gives you the magnitude impact of the downtown versus the market. This is kind of a broader strategy question. And so, let me start with why we are here. And that's to -- you even said it, the Sunbelt has outperformed for three years. Well, to us, three years isn't exactly long-term. And what drove these three years is a pandemic. And so, the way we look at the world is we don't expect to have regular pandemics that will completely change behavior and legislation. But, in terms of this general discussion about other markets, this won't -- looking at other markets is not a Angela Kleiman era, specific pointing to that. It's a discipline that we've always had. Mike's been doing this for a very long time and I will continue that work and make sure that we are in the right place and where we can generate the highest long-term CAGR for our shareholders. And supply is definitely something that we cannot ignore, because that is a key reason of our outperformance combined with being in a center of innovation that drives demand and income growth and job growth and they're all interrelated. And so, we'll continue that discipline. And if we do end up venturing outside of California, we will also do it in a very thoughtful way. And they all consider our cost of capital, consider future growth and of course, the basic supply demand dynamics. No, we really haven't. What we are seeing the move out is really attributed to just normal market activities and then layer on to that, the other dynamics that I mentioned earlier. Sure. Northern California is sitting about a week, and that is a slight, like two days uptick from last quarter. So, it's just not a meaningful change. That's okay. I was just going to add that keep in mind, our Northern California portfolio is mostly suburban and San Francisco consists only about 2.5% of our portfolio. No, other than that, it's so far better than historical patterns. I don't see anything different. Well, the transition is about six months. And so, Mike is still the CEO until March 31st, and I'm going to -- I plan to enjoy every single day of that until that. As far as the team is concerned, I am not -- we are not going to make any changes to the operating team. We have a terrific team and great bench. And if you look at our company history for my first nine years as CEO, we did not have a COO. So, this is not -- we're not doing anything unprecedented."

            "name": "Adam Berry",
            "content": "Yes. Hey Nick, this is Adam. As Mike mentioned in his opening comments, the transaction volume is definitely down from where it was a quarter ago. But there are still deals being priced. There are still deals going non-contingent. And in talking to buyers who are still active in the market, they're willing to take a certain level of negative leverage for 18 to 24 months is the number that I'm hearing now. And so, with various assumptions about rent growth, repositioning and those types of strategies, that's what we're seeing in the market. Hey Steve, this is Adam again. So, consistent with what we just talked about the 4.5% range is kind of where we see the market. We're probably not buyers at that range, we have a better use for our capital and development yields will need to move off of that base, if not maybe slightly higher. So, when we look at development deals, depending on where they are in the entitlement process, we're looking at a 20% to 25% spread over to adjust for the risk related to development. Yes. Hey Alex. So at this point, we're not seeing any potential for material defaults. We constantly assess our preferred equity book. So, the short answer is no, we're not seeing anything at this point. A little more background behind it. Over 75% of our pref and mezz book was underwritten in 2020 or before. So, we really -- we didn't go down to the depths of the mid-3 caps, chasing deals. We did very few deals during that time. And so, with this recent expansion in cap rates, it really doesn't impact where we are in the stack. And then, you couple that with pretty significant NOI growth, and we feel like we're in a pretty good position. Great question. The answer is, yes. Predominantly the debt funds, they have disappeared. We would go into some of these deals, and especially to debt funds, they would provide what we call stretch seniors. So, it would be zero to, call it, 75%. They're no longer in competition. So, we're seeing more opportunities coming to us because of that."

Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the Company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found on the Company's filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall, you may begin.\nMichael Schall: Thank you for joining us today, and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. Angela Kleiman and Barb Pak will follow me with prepared remarks and Adam Berry is here for Q&A. I will start with a summary of our second quarter results and then highlight the strong underlying momentum in the Essex portfolio, especially in the markets benefiting from the return-to-office programs of large tech companies and finish with a brief overview of the apartment transaction market. We are pleased to announce our fourth consecutive quarter of improving results with core FFO up 21.1% from the same quarter last year, exceeding the high end of our guidance range and achieving the second best quarterly growth since the Company's IPO in 1994. Given our strong year-to-date results, we increased our guidance ranges for same-property revenues, NOI and core FFO for a third time in 2022, which Barb will discuss further in her commentary. Beginning with operating fundamentals, net effective rents for new leases are now 16% above pre-COVID levels and 20.6% higher year-over-year compared to the second quarter of 2021. Job growth remains robust at 5.6% for June year-over-year, substantially outperforming the U.S. and reflecting the ongoing recovery from the massive COVID-related job losses in 2020. Page S17.1 of our earnings supplement demonstrates the surge in rents in the tech markets of Northern California and Seattle, the largest and last markets in our portfolio to fully recover from the pandemic. Net effective rents have increased between 18% and 20% year-to-date, reflecting momentum from return-to-office programs and very strong job growth. Fundamental research from our data analytics team indicates job openings at the largest technology companies have moderated recently off the very high levels throughout the pandemic, with job openings now about 15% above pre-COVID levels compared to about 77% last quarter. Unlike other industries within our markets, the tech sector was better positioned to pivot to hybrid work in response to the pandemic and accelerated hiring. As a result, labor demand for the most highly skilled workers at the large technology companies remained solid, implying job formation in excess of the number of recently announced layoffs in our markets which we highlight on page S17.2 of our earnings supplement. Given the focus on tech layoffs recently, it's relevant to note the definition of what constitutes a tech company has broadened to include businesses that have digitized a variety of analog processes and thereby represent a much broader umbrella of organizations not necessarily located in the Bay Area, including Peloton fitness offerings, Carvana's auto sales process and mortgage companies like Better.com. Likewise, the venture capital slowdown is now impacting companies across many industries and geographies, consistent with this broader scope. Conversely, it's the largest tech companies that drive employment in our North Cal and Seattle markets, and they are more insulated from capital market fluctuations, given their growth opportunities and extraordinary financial strength. Rounding out the overall employment picture in Northern California, we continue to see a recovery of jobs that were eliminated during the pandemic. COVID-related regulations were so stringent that much of the local surface economy workforce had to be fundamentally rebuilt. For example, the Essex markets added 420,000 relatively low paying jobs on a trailing three-month basis, including a 20% to 25% increase in the leisure and hospitality sector, which supports returning tech workers and their demand for services. Our commentary usually focuses on high-paying jobs but the service jobs are also important because most of their employees need to report to a physical location each day, and they support the ecosystem that creates livable and desirable communities. The strong demand for housing is supported by apartment affordability in our Northern California markets, which has improved sharply relative to long-term averages, reflecting a higher growth rate for median incomes relative to median rents. From a historical perspective, these markets screen affordable for the first time in the last decade, and rental housing is significantly more affordable versus home ownership. The value of the median-priced home in California is up about 13% year-over-year and with higher mortgage interest rates, apartments are clearly the more affordable option. We estimate that it is now over 2 times more expensive to buy than rent in the Essex markets. Affordability trends will be impacted by the apartment supply picture of moderated deliveries in the second half of 2022 and a further decline expected in 2023. Sharply lower rents in Northern California during the pandemic resulted in fewer apartment starts in 2020 and 2021 and therefore, a significant drop in new Bay Area apartment deliveries into 2023. Production levels of for-sale housing is also muted on the West Coast with only about 0.4% of existing stock being built annually and production is difficult to increase given zoning restrictions and land availability. Looking ahead, we recognize that the Federal Reserve is working to fight inflation, which often leads to a recession. Our experience indicates that no two recessions are alike, and clearly, the current situation is unique given West Coast remains in a recovery mode from the pandemic. Given this backdrop, we believe that the following factors will help moderate the impact to the West Coast rental markets in the event that economic conditions deteriorate later this year. First, large technology companies significantly accelerated hiring during the pandemic, largely because there were beneficiaries of the pandemic-driven preference for touchless interaction. Many newly hired employees were asked to work remotely until offices reopened, which is now occurring and is a key component of our recent market rent growth in Seattle and the Bay Area. Second, we have extremely tight labor markets and strong job growth on the West Coast, a significant portion of which relates to the recovery of jobs lost in the early part of the pandemic. Recovery of jobs, especially in leisure, hospitality and service sectors has been resilient and should continue for the foreseeable future. Third, the normal migration pattern from the West Coast includes workers' approaching retirement who plan to lower their cost of living and use the equity in their homes as part of their retirement plan. We believe that most of these workers left during the pandemic given California's extraordinary lockdowns, and therefore, it's likely that retirement-related migration will be muted for at least a few more years. Finally, foreign immigration was significantly slowed throughout the pandemic. In recent months, new visas for foreign workers are increasing with the large tech companies being a primary beneficiary, restoring an important source of apartment demand. Before I turn the call over to Angela, let me quickly touch on apartment investment activity. The extraordinary uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets and higher interest rates have disrupted the apartment transaction markets, resulting in fewer closings given diverging buyer and seller expectations. We are in a period of price discovery for apartment transactions and the absence of financial distress means that buyers and sellers are not forced to transact. Therefore, we expect fewer apartment transactions for the foreseeable future. It's difficult to pinpoint cap rates in this environment, although limited recent activity indicates cap rates in the high 3% range to low 4% range. We have seen an increase in apartment development activity that was decimated in the pandemic, driven by the strong rent recovery in suburban areas, which should lead to more preferred equity investments going forward. With that, I will turn the call over to Angela Kleiman.\nAngela Kleiman: Thanks, Mike. First, I would like to express my appreciation for our operations and support teams for delivering some of our highest level of quarterly same-store revenue growth. All this while we continue to roll out our property collections operating model throughout the portfolio, great job team, and thank you. Today, I'll start with key operational highlights in our major regions, discuss rent growth expectations for the remainder of 2022 and conclude with an update on the rollout of our transformational initiatives for the operating business. We are very pleased with our second quarter performance. With strong demand fundamentals and modest supply described by Mike earlier, we maximize revenues by favoring rent growth rather than occupancy. This resulted in same-property revenue growth of 12.7% on a year-over-year basis and a 4.8% on a sequential basis, which are some of the highest growth rates achieved in the Company's history. As we head into August, so far, we are experiencing a normal leasing season with June and July loss to lease for the same-store portfolio at 9.7% and 10.3%, respectively. Turning to regional highlights, starting with our Washington portfolio. This region generated a 20.7% year-over-year net effective rent growth on new leases for the second quarter, which was led by Eastside Seattle, where the majority of our portfolio is located. Seattle continues to benefit from strong job growth, which is driving leasing momentum. Our Seattle portfolio is well positioned and 9.7% loss to lease as of July. On to Northern California. This region generated 17.5% year-over-year net effective rent growth on new leases for the second quarter, which was led by Santa Clara County at 24%, primarily driven by the robust demand from large tech employers in Silicon Valley. Northern California has demonstrated some of the strongest job growth this year. And despite the negative headlines on tech startups, we are not experiencing any softness in rent growth in July or in our third quarter renewals. We expect positive momentum to continue for Northern California with demand from return to office, which may be further accelerated by incremental job growth throughout the second half of the year. Loss to lease in this region continues to pick up and is 8.7% in July. Moving on to Southern California, which has been a strong performer with 22.4% year-over-year net effective rent growth on new leases for the second quarter. Healthy job growth has continued to drive incremental demand in Southern California, which is built upon the significant rent growth achieved last year and resulted in our highest level of loss to lease at 12.1% in July. Turning to our expectations for the remainder of 2022. As you may recall, we had anticipated a deceleration in market rent growth in the second half of the year because of tougher year-over-year comps. As expected, we are seeing this deceleration show up on our new lease spreads on page S16. However, as demonstrated by our current performance and the increase to same-property growth expectations for the year, our fundamentals remain strong. It is with this backdrop that we continue to advance our company-wide implementation of our property collections operating model. By way of background, we have been transitioning from a dedicated team for each property to teams that cover a collection of around 9 to 12 properties thereby transforming our business from a property centric to a customer-centric operating model. As we have rolled out, this model to our other regions, we've been able to replicate the improvements in cross-selling from 15% to 23% achieved at the first asset collection that was rolled out last year in San Diego. This demonstrates our sales team's ability to sell effectively across multiple properties, reducing customer acquisition costs and improving overall sales efficiency. Lastly, we have been making good progress codeveloping proprietary applications with partners from the RET Ventures such as Funnel, to enhance our technology platform. We execute approximately 60,000 transactions a year, including move-in, move-out and renewals, and we are focused on automating all manual tasks. Following full deployment of the Funnel suite in late 2023, we anticipate this investment will be an important factor in the 200 to 300 basis points of margin improvement we expect to achieve over the next few years. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barb Pak.\nBarb Pak: Thanks, Angela. I'll start with a brief overview of our second quarter results, discuss changes to our full year guidance followed by an update on investments and the balance sheet. We are pleased to report we achieved core FFO per share of $3.68 in the second quarter. The results exceeded the high end of our updated guidance range published in June. Of the $0.10 beat to the midpoint, $0.03 relates to better-than-expected revenues in June and $0.06 relates to lower property taxes, primarily from a combination of lower assessed values and millage rates at our Washington properties. For the full year, we are raising the midpoint of core FFO by $0.29 to $14.45. The revised midpoint equates to 15.7% year-over-year growth. The increase to our midpoint is primarily driven by better-than-expected operating fundamentals and an improved outlook on delinquency. As such, we are raising the midpoint of same-property revenue growth by 70 basis points to 10.3% and NOI growth by 140 basis points to 13.5%. In addition, our full year guidance assumes a reduction in expense growth from 4% to 3.3% at the midpoint. Turning to delinquency. We are encouraged by the continued improvements we are seeing in our delinquency. For the quarter, net delinquency was 60 basis points of scheduled rents, a significant reduction from the first quarter. This was a result of many efforts by our operations team, which led to a 20% reduction in gross delinquency as compared to the first quarter. In addition, we received a higher level of government reimbursement in the second quarter. Also worth noting, in late June, there were a couple of key events that are positive for the future. First, the State of California allocated an additional $1.9 billion in emergency rental assistance for existing applications after exhausting its initial $5 billion allocation. This gives us more visibility on the remaining funds to be allocated, especially as it relates to our $34 million in outstanding applications. Second, on July 1st, a California state law expired, which provides landlords additional rates to recapture delinquent units. Thus, outside of L.A. and Alameda counties where eviction protections remain in place, we would expect to see a gradual improvement in gross delinquencies over the coming quarters. Moving to our stock buyback and investment goals. In the second quarter, we repurchased approximately $61 million of common stock at a significant discount to our internal NAV, using free cash flow and excess proceeds from year-to-date transactions. As for our investment goals this year, we have a strong pipeline of accretive preferred equity deals and remain on track to achieve our goal of $50 million to $150 million of new commitments. However, given the rapidly changing interest rate environment and the sharp increase in our cost of capital relative to cap rates in our markets, we are reducing our acquisition goals, which are outlined in the earnings release to focus on share repurchases instead. This is consistent with our disciplined approach to capital allocation, whereby we will shift capital to what the best use is, given changing market dynamics. Lastly, I want to conclude my prepared remarks by highlighting the strength of the balance sheet. Over the past year, we have seen a continued reduction in leverage with our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio improving from 6.6 times at the depths of the pandemic to 5.8 times today. We are rapidly approaching our historical low for this ratio and believe we will see continued improvements in this metric over the next few quarters through growth in EBITDA. As it relates to upcoming capital needs, we are in an advantageous position. Our existing cash flow from operations covers our current dividend, all capital expenditures and development funding needs. As such, our only known funding needs relate to debt maturities, which are minimal, given we proactively took advantage of the low interest rate environment over the last few years to further strengthen the balance sheet. As a result, we have only $300 million in debt maturing in mid-2023 and $400 million maturing in mid-2024. This equates to less than 6% of our debt maturing annually for the next 2.5 years. And while interest rates have increased on new debt, capital markets remain open, and we have access to a variety of secured and unsecured debt sources. This affords us strong financial flexibility, which will enable us to be opportunistic as it relates to these upcoming maturities. With over $1.3 billion in liquidity, we are well positioned. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeffrey Spector with Bank of America.\nJeffrey Spector: My first question is focused on hybrid working. Mike, you said early on that return to work, but more hybrid working would benefit the company, and clearly, it is. I guess, what are some of the latest comments you're hearing or what are you hearing from the tech firms in your market on hybrid-verse at this point thinking about going remote fully? Obviously, there's article out today about one company going remote. Like, what are you hearing in your markets?\nMichael Schall: Hey Jeff, that's a great question. Thank you. I think what we're hearing is everyone is now pretty much committed to hybrid working model, and they're trying to figure out what that means and some of the issues are being confronted that I think are embedded in that. So, I think that everyone's having trouble and I would include us in that in this case. People like hybrid, the hybrid model, and they want to stick with a hybrid model. And so, now, it's up to the companies to try to figure out what they need to do to modify their offices to accommodate that model. And notably, Amazon paused some of the work they're doing in Bellevue to take another look at the office format. And so, I think you're going to see more of that activity going forward.\nJeffrey Spector: Okay. And then I appreciate the charts on -- the more detailed charts in the sup on tech openings, open positions, I should say, in your markets. How do you track this data?\nMichael Schall: We have a data analytics team that's run by Paul Morgan. And so, they scrape that data off the various websites and then categorize it by what's in our markets versus other parts of the U.S. And we've been doing this for, I would say, the better part of 10 years now. And so, it definitely tells the story. So, our data analytics team basically is responsible for that data.\nJeffrey Spector: Okay. Thanks. Can I just ask, can you say which markets you're seeing the most openings versus, I guess, ones towards the bottom?\nMichael Schall: We are seeing -- the tech markets are continuing to lead in terms of those openings, so. And that is not surprising. I think, some of the details in those top 10 techs. I think it's interesting that both Google or Alphabet and Apple have hit a new high in job openings, believe it or not, even though made the broader comment that of the top 10 tech companies, they're off a little bit from their high. But still, the number of jobs they have open is pretty extraordinary, given the backdrop of what we've seen over the last several years. So, we're seeing a lot of strength there ongoing and almost as if all this economic turbulence wasn't such a big deal.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citi.\nNick Joseph: Maybe just on capital allocation. You talked about the share repurchases. So curious, just given the transaction market and how historically you've sold assets to fund share repurchases, kind of the appetite today and how you think about funding additional buybacks?\nBarb Pak: Hi Nick, it's Barb. Yes, that has been our strategy historically. In the second quarter, we did have excess cash flow, so we used that to buy back the stock. Going forward though, we would look to sell assets to buy back the stock. So, we could do that. We would like -- if we have an asset in contract, we might buy it back a little earlier than the sale. But for the most part, we're going to maintain our disciplined approach to match funding any future buyback going forward.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. And then, maybe just on operations in terms of the blended rent growth that decelerated a bit in July from the second quarter. I'm wondering how you kind of marry that with the strength in the chart on Northern California and Seattle and the acceleration of the rent growth that you're seeing there, just the interplay between the two.\nAngela Kleiman: Yes. Hi. It\u2019s Angela here. That's a good question. What we are expecting is the normal seasonality to play out. Having said that, we do have headwinds from tougher year-over-year comps that I described earlier. And just to give you a little more color, last year, in the first half, our blended lease rates was negative, was negative 4%, but in the second half, it surged to about 13.25%. [Ph] So, that's the tough year-over-year comp. And what we're seeing is with the strength in Northern California is that it's a key reason for the shift of expecting So Cal to outperform in the first half. And now in the second half, we're expecting Seattle and North Cal to lead our growth going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs.\nChandni Luthra: Could you talk about your tenant composition a little bit, please? What portion of your tenants, what mix is employed by big tech versus, say, other industries? And how has that composition changed during the pandemic or more recently?\nMichael Schall: Yes. This is Mike, and that's another great question. Thank you. We have a variety of price points in our portfolio. So, we cover, I'd say, from the B minus to the A plus category. And therefore, our tenant base is a reflection of the broader economy. And so, unless we have a few buildings that are adjacent, very close to the tech companies where we could have 90-plus percent of the tenants working in the tech industry, for the most part, we're much broader than that. And again, we reflect the broader economy, which includes policemen, firemen, teachers, all the hospitality and restaurant workers, et cetera. And it has not changed a lot. Yes.\nChandni Luthra: And then, as we think about 2023, some of your peers today talked about embedded rent growth. Could you perhaps give us more color in terms of -- given the rent roll that's already priced in right now, how should we think about the earn-in going into 2023?\nAngela Kleiman: Hi. It\u2019s Angela here. Another good question. And the embedded earnings for 2023 is really going to be a function of the seasonality curve. And at this point, we are -- we have one of the strongest loss to lease in the Company's history at 10.3%, and it continues to grow because we have not yet peaked. And you add to that the tailwind from the job growth and modest supply, we feel good about our position. But to try to speculate at this point is probably not going to be all that helpful because third quarter is when we tend to have the most transactions, and so it's the most active quarter. And so, once we see how that plays out, we'll be able to provide better visibility to the actual shape of that seasonal curve. And so, it's -- so we plan to have a more in-depth discussion on that topic on our October call.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street.\nJohn Pawlowski: Just one question for me. Adam, I'm curious to get your thoughts on the level of distress you're seeing in the broader preferred equity and mezzanine lending markets on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the most dislocated, where are we on that barometer today?\nAdam Berry: Hey John. I would put us at a 1. We're seeing very little distress on the pref side. We are seeing some opportunities where bridge lenders were able to loan on deals that are in lease-up. We've seen a definite pullback in that. So, we're seeing opportunities for us to come in, in those types of cases, but no, very -- I'd say no distress at this point.\nJohn Pawlowski: And to be clear, I'm not talking about your specific book, but just in terms of the broader market, deals that are coming your way. So, other people being in distress, not Essex.\nAdam Berry: Understood. Yes. No, it\u2019s same answer. We're not seeing any...\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. Thank you for your time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore.\nSteve Sakwa: I was wondering if you could talk about the renewals that you're sending out, I guess, at this point for August or what you sent out for August, September and perhaps October. And can you talk about what's embedded in the full year guidance for the second half in terms of overall blended spreads? Thank you.\nAngela Kleiman: Sure. Happy to. It\u2019s Angela here. I'll talk about renewals, and I'll turn it over to Barb to talk about guidance. In terms of our third quarter renewals, we're coming in at close to 10%. And it's a pretty tight band within all our key markets, Seattle leading the pack around 11; Northern California in the 10 range; and of course, Southern California close to 9.\nBarb Pak: And then, Steve, as it relates to guidance, as what Angela said earlier, the first half of the year, we had much easier comps, but given the surge in rents we saw last year, we have much more difficult comps in the second half of the year, which on new leases, we're assuming in the second half of the year 7% new lease growth, it was 15% in the first half of the year, so a significant reduction just because of the comp issue.\nSteve Sakwa: Great. That's very helpful. Thanks. And then just in terms of the bad debt, I know this is bouncing around quite a bit based on what you're getting back from the government. And it sounds like you might get a little bit more in the second half, but how would you sort of think the second half shapes up in terms of the bad debt figure?\nBarb Pak: Yes. So, our revised guidance assumes 1.5% for the full year as a percent of our schedule rent. That's how we've been talking about it since the start of the pandemic. And that -- we assume the first half and the second half are about the same now. Previously, we had assumed a worse second half, but now we've pulled that up now. And that's really a function of the $1.9 billion in new emergency rental assistance that the states allocated. It does give us more visibility on continued emergency rental assistance in the back half of the year that we were uncertain about going into this quarter. And then, the other thing is we do have -- we have seen improvements in our gross delinquency. They have started to come down. In June, they fell; July, they fell. And so, we do expect a continued moderation in the gross delinquency line, which gets us to the improved outlook on delinquency in the back half of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Neil Malkin with Capital One.\nNeil Malkin: First question, I guess, capital allocation or external growth kind of thought here. But you don't really have a land bank development pipeline anymore. I think your last one finished leasing up this quarter. Just curious as your plans, what you see maybe through the end of the year for potential growth given that -- I mean, really, you've been mainly an acquirer. So, what are your priorities? I know you talked about share repurchases, but JVs an option? Are you looking at -- again, just dispositions to fund all those things? And how do you plan on sourcing growth just outside of the organic picture over the next several quarters?\nAdam Berry: Hi Neil, this is Adam. So, there was a lot to that question, but just kind of starting at the beginning. Historically, we haven't really been a land banking shop. We tend to -- when we develop, we tend to go after shovel-ready deals. We do have a couple of pre-entitlement deals that are in the pipeline and potentially would build further out. Other than that, though, we've seen the most opportunity in our prep book and especially more recently, we've seen quite a bit of opportunity. As for as acquisitions, we're always in the market, but highly dependent on where our cost of capital is and matching funds. We will -- we have seen some opportunities on the development side where we can joint venture and usually couple that with a preferred equity piece as well. And so, we're highly focused on turning those over as well. So, lots of potential, but on the development side, on the direct development side today, we're seeing cap rates probably in the mid-4s. And to us, that's just not -- that's not enough spread to adjust for the risk associated with costs and the other challenges associated with development.\nNeil Malkin: Yes. Okay. Thanks for that. And then for Angela, you guys have more recently started talking about the -- at least externally, the sort of operating enhancements, operating model expense types of enhancements, about podding and being more efficient, increasing the resident experience. I just wonder if you could maybe kind of put that in perspective. Talk about that a little bit more. And then specifically, on wage pressure you're seeing, just given the high cost of living there. And then, you talked about like again, improving resident experience by potentially having units that have no people on site. And I guess, how does that improve experience if there's no one there to help, particularly with sort of like potential issues, lacks DAs, et cetera, things like that. So, if you can just walk through all those, that would be great.\nAngela Kleiman: Sure, happy to. So, you brought up a couple of points. I'll try to hit all of them. So, if I miss anything, please chime in. So, in terms of wage pressure, I mean, we're experiencing that just like everybody else. However, I think you can see from our controllable expenses, especially in the admin line item, we've been able to find offsets and so have been able to manage through that. And it's primarily because of how we have transformed our operating business model to this, I think you call -- collection because that's improved inefficiency. So ultimately, what remains is allowing our people to take less time to get the test that they used to do. From a customer perspective, though, first of all, we've been contactless since COVID. So, it's effectively no change for them in how they interact with us. But as far as availability is concerned, we have -- although the office is not open, we do have by appointments available and of customers that access [Technical Difficulty] however, if they want, they can reach us via different, whether it's online or 800 number, they can make an appointment [Technical Difficulty] and every asset collection has a hub [Technical Difficulty]. So, sometimes it's an immediate thing, they will get into a car and drive to a hub nearby. And so, once again, that has not been an issue either. And when we look at our customer satisfaction, so they actually have been feeling better than pre-COVID.\nNeil Malkin: Okay. Yes. So basically, it sounds like just given the proximity of the pods, a maintenance issue, power, I don't know, leak issue, payment, whatever, amenity issue could be a few-minute drive away is essentially what you're saying?\nAngela Kleiman: Well, let me just clarify something. The maintenance team is on site. And so, they are responding timely to any customer service request.\nNeil Malkin: Okay. I'm sorry. Yes, I guess, I was just confused, because a lot of other peers have mentioned like peopleless buildings in terms of like servicing. But I guess, that doesn't apply to maintenance is what you're saying?\nAngela Kleiman: Yes. So, what we're talking about is administration, bookkeeping, those type of activities, but the maintenance is separate.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with SMBC.\nRich Anderson: Thanks. Good morning. Great quarter. So, I'm going to go back to Angela on the earning question. I understand you want to keep that maybe tight to the vest. But if you're providing guidance, you're implying you have some guidance about the third quarter in terms of leasing activity. So that would suggest, while you don't know what's going to happen, then you would have an assumption of what's going to happen again. And based on that assumption, do you -- would you admit that you have in an earn-in number in mind, but you just don't want to -- you think it's just premature to share? Is that a fair statement?\nAngela Kleiman: Well, it's a little bit more to it than that. I mean, it's speculative, right? Because right now, what we're saying is with 10.3% loss lease, that's higher than our typical loss lease in the past. Now normal seasonality means that that loss lease will start to decline over time. What I don't know and that's an honest statement, I don't know the rate of that decline or the steepness of that curve. All I can point to is from what we're seeing right now, the curve looks good. Having said that, there is the broad economy out there, and we will need to see how that plays out to have a better sense.\nMichael Schall: Hey Rich, I\u2019ll have my blue mood ring now. I just want to point that out. But one additional comment is I think what Angela is saying is seasonality implies that rents peak in July. We don't know if rents are going to peak in July. And so that inflection point, once we see that inflection point, we have better visibility going forward about what's going to happen for the rest of the year. So again, it's really a key time in terms of trying to determine where this is going to go, potentially, rents could keep going up or it could follow the normal seasonality, and we reach a peak in July and we start going downhill for the rest of the year. You're right. Barb has built in an assumption into the guidance. Barb, do you want to just comment on that, just to reiterate it?\nBarb Pak: Like I said earlier, we do assume rent growth year-over-year moderates in the second half of the year because of the more difficult comps. And as Angela mentioned, we've assumed a normal seasonal curve. So, we will peak at the end of July, like Mike said. So, that is what's built into the guidance. But we do feel good about the tailwinds that are in front of us or behind us from where we are today.\nRich Anderson: Okay. Fair enough. And then the second question is looking at, let's say, S-16, I believe, or maybe not S-17, rent growth forecast. Last quarter, Northern California was the leader. All markets, regions have grown, but Northern California by a lesser amount than the others. Now, in the second quarter, actually the laggard, once the leader, even though 10.5% is nothing to sneeze at. So, I'm just curious, you talked about tech layoffs that everyone's talking about. Is that intermingled in this forecast where Southern California and Seattle have leaped Northern California, again, all growing? So, I'm not really -- I don't mean to throw cold water on it, but Northern California is no longer the leader.\nAngela Kleiman: Thanks for acknowledging that these are pretty darn strong numbers across the board. But just to give you a little more background, these -- the revised forecast is really a reflection of how we performed in the first half. And because the first half was so strong in Southern California and in Seattle, that's the driver to the change in order. So, when we look at the second half, so the second half of, say, about 7% for the portfolio, we are seeing that Seattle and Northern California will be the path in the second.\nRich Anderson: Southern California, right? Seattle and Southern California?\nAngela Kleiman: No, no, Seattle and Northern California in the second half.\nRich Anderson: Oh, I see. I see what you're saying. Okay.\nAngela Kleiman: Yes. So, that 11.1% [ph] is 15% in the first half, which is big, and that's driven by So Cal and Seattle and 7% approximately in the second half, and that 7% average will be driven by Northern California and Seattle higher than 7%. And of course, Southern California lower than 7%. It's average.\nMichael Schall: And maybe one other final piece, Rich, and that is that Oakland is obviously lagging in the Northern California recovery as well. Oakland has -- Downtown Oakland has been slow to recover, and it's got quite a bit of development deliveries that are coming there and that's the part that's holding them back.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Connor Mitchell with Piper Sandler.\nConnor Mitchell: Just a couple on back rents. So first, how much of the back rents do you guys anticipate receiving from the government or California programs and then, how much do you think you'll have to go directly to the tenants to collect? I know you guys discussed a little bit about the additional government funds to be allocated. So, I was wondering about how much more to go to the tenants to collect?\nBarb Pak: Hi. This is Barb. We have $34 million in open applications right now and then of our $78 million in cumulative delinquency. So, that's how you would compare those two, of which -- so the $34 million, we've assumed some of that will occur this year. We don't know how quickly they're going to disperse those funds. We've assumed about 50% of that we get this year in our guidance. It's not all same-store though, either. So keep that in mind. That's total for the whole portfolio. And then, the other piece that we have to go after the tenants, we will -- we already started that process. We have various means we can do to -- their credit, or doing their credit, go after them in small claims court in order to try to recoup our back rent, and we're actively doing what we can and abiding by the laws, obviously. And LA Alameda is where we're probably the most restricted, but outside of that, we have a lot of -- a lot more ability to go after the tenants.\nConnor Mitchell: And then just a follow-up on that. What percent of the residents that owe the back rents are no longer within the Essex properties versus tenants that are paying current, but still owe past rents?\nBarb Pak: Yes. No, that's a good question. I think it's roughly 50-50 at this point. The $34 million in open applications does relate -- bulk of that relates to our current residents. Very little of that is for past due -- or past residents.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.\nBrad Heffern: I'm not sure if you track this or not, but do you track move-outs because of job loss? And has there been any sort of change in that statistic, if you do?\nMichael Schall: We do track new jobs or job transfers but not job losses exactly per se. And that number, new job or job transfer is roughly 15.7% in our portfolio versus, let's say -- which is down a little bit from the last couple of months. We don\u2019t actually track how many job losses -- how many of these people actually lost their job, we just track jobs in general.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. Got it. It was worth a shot. And then, I guess, on the other side, on the move-in data, has there been data that suggests that tech workers coming back or indeed what's driving a lot of this demand?\nMichael Schall: Not just tech workers, certainly, tech workers and the return-to-office people. But more broadly, we've mentioned in the script that there are awful lot of hospitality, leisure jobs and all the service jobs that are coming back as we fundamentally rebuilt when California shut everything down and many of them left the state. So, it's really both components. And again, our portfolio is not comprised mostly of tech workers. It is a -- it's intended to be a broad overview of the broader economy. So, we don't target tech workers per se.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Angela, you highlighted the strength in the loss to lease being above that 10% mark and that market rents are still growing at this point. But the portfolio has seen new lease rates decelerate much more quickly than some of your peers. And I certainly understand the difficult comps piece and some of the cross currents in the economy that are kind of blurring the next couple of months, perhaps. But, I'm really trying to understand with that backdrop of strong job growth, growing market rents still through July and the healthy loss to lease in place, why do we get to 7% new lease rate growth versus the 14%, I think you achieved in July for the back half of the year. Can you just put some additional detail in there, please?\nAngela Kleiman: Yes, happy to. I think -- we try to provide a baseline. And so we don't tend to say, forecasting recession or excessive growth, for example. Now, I do want to point you to the backdrop of the second half of last year. We grew -- our blended lease rates was 13.25%. And so, the new lease rates were much higher. And so, it truly is a function of a tougher year-over-year comp. And to your point, is it possible that we perform better because of the fundamentals? Certainly, that's on the table.\nAustin Wurschmidt: And what percent of the rent roll has been addressed, or what percent do you have strong visibility into at this point for the year?\nMichael Schall: Certainly, the renewal side. We have good visibility on. It's going to be somewhere in the high-single-digit range. It's the new lease rate that we don't know, obviously, given all the turmoil in the financial markets, et cetera. So, again, as I think Angela mentioned earlier, so far, we're following a normal seasonal pattern. But typically, that changes -- the weaker portion of the year begins in July and through the end of the year. We just don't know what that inflection point is going to look like or when we're going to attain it. And so, it's a little bit difficult for us to predict the rest of the year given that we don't know where that peak in rents this year.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Sure. No, I get -- I was more interested in if 75% of the leases have been addressed either signed or committed to at this point or 85%, whatever that number is. Anyway, maybe Mike, on capital allocation, admittedly, the headlines haven't helped you guys given your footprint. But you guys have certainly executed three guidance increases through the year. And you stepped in and bought back stock as you historically have when you trade at a wide enough discount to NAV. But I guess if the market isn't willing to ascribe the value that you see in the portfolio versus the private market aside from just selling assets and buying back a higher volume of shares, are there any other steps that you and the Board are discussing or looking to further close that value gap?\nMichael Schall: Well, I don't think so. I mean broader strategic issues are not things that you would implement quickly, there thoughtful processes and just try to work through things. I think this is more tactical. We don't know what's going to happen in the broader economy going forward, and that point was very well made by the investors at NAREIT certainly recently. So, given that backdrop, we're going to continue to lean toward a relatively conservative approach to capital allocation, and that's the one that Barb was outlining before and Adam too. And maybe what I would add to what Adam said that trying to focus on the preferred equity book will be something that we're focused on the remainder of the year. But, in terms of broader choices when you look at where the stock price is trading and we do our own fundamental research on the value of the company on a per share basis. And when you look at those numbers, it's not a time that we would be aggressively growing the Company, let's say, just because the pieces are not as compelling as they have been certainly at different points of time. So, I think it's the time to just execute, you take what the market gives us and make thoughtful decisions, and that's what we've done. That's what we're going to continue to do.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Kramer: I think just a quick 1 for me. I think you gave some kind of good color on kind of where you see cap rates kind of high 3% or low 4% range. Wondering, I guess, kind of how much wider is that -- or how much has that kind of changed from maybe the all-time tights that you saw, be it 3, 6 months ago? And then, you also kind of mentioned about price discovery, right? And so, kind of wondering what is that gap now, I guess, that bid-ask spread, right, or that gap kind of between that's kind of causing kind of price discovery rate, causing limited transactions at this point?\nAdam Berry: Yes. Hi Adam, this is Adam. To go -- cover the back half of the question first. So, transaction volume has actually been fairly consistent. Over the recent probably month to six weeks is where we've seen things slow down a little bit. So, we've seen some deals drop out of the market, and we have seen that bid-ask spread. Depending on the market, depending on vintage, I'd say for our core, core plus within our kind of core markets, there's probably a 25 to 50 basis-point bid-ask spread between what sellers are looking and buyers are willing. But again, that's not to be said that deals aren't happening because there are still transactions occurring in the market. Can you restate the first part of the question?\nAdam Kramer: Yes. Just kind of how much wider that high-3% to low-4% range for cap rates -- how much wider is that kind of maybe the all-time tights of 3 to 6 months ago.\nAdam Berry: Yes. So yes, we don't know where cap rates are going. But based on today -- what we're seeing today, we're seeing them in that kind of high-3s to low-4s. I might be...\nMichael Schall: That's roughly 50 basis points higher than what we talked about...\nAdam Berry: Yes. They were in -- okay, yes. So, they're in the mid-3s, what we talked about a few quarters ago. So yes, I would say 50 basis points is probably on average.\nOperator: There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks.\nMichael Schall: Yes. Thank you, operator. We would like to thank everyone for joining the call today. We feel good about our results, and we feel like we may have a little bit of wind to our back. So, that's obviously great to see. And we look forward to seeing many of you in the near future. Thank you, and good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Michael Schall",
            "content": "Thank you for joining us today, and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. Angela Kleiman and Barb Pak will follow me with prepared remarks and Adam Berry is here for Q&A. I will start with a summary of our second quarter results and then highlight the strong underlying momentum in the Essex portfolio, especially in the markets benefiting from the return-to-office programs of large tech companies and finish with a brief overview of the apartment transaction market. We are pleased to announce our fourth consecutive quarter of improving results with core FFO up 21.1% from the same quarter last year, exceeding the high end of our guidance range and achieving the second best quarterly growth since the Company's IPO in 1994. Given our strong year-to-date results, we increased our guidance ranges for same-property revenues, NOI and core FFO for a third time in 2022, which Barb will discuss further in her commentary. Beginning with operating fundamentals, net effective rents for new leases are now 16% above pre-COVID levels and 20.6% higher year-over-year compared to the second quarter of 2021. Job growth remains robust at 5.6% for June year-over-year, substantially outperforming the U.S. and reflecting the ongoing recovery from the massive COVID-related job losses in 2020. Page S17.1 of our earnings supplement demonstrates the surge in rents in the tech markets of Northern California and Seattle, the largest and last markets in our portfolio to fully recover from the pandemic. Net effective rents have increased between 18% and 20% year-to-date, reflecting momentum from return-to-office programs and very strong job growth. Fundamental research from our data analytics team indicates job openings at the largest technology companies have moderated recently off the very high levels throughout the pandemic, with job openings now about 15% above pre-COVID levels compared to about 77% last quarter. Unlike other industries within our markets, the tech sector was better positioned to pivot to hybrid work in response to the pandemic and accelerated hiring. As a result, labor demand for the most highly skilled workers at the large technology companies remained solid, implying job formation in excess of the number of recently announced layoffs in our markets which we highlight on page S17.2 of our earnings supplement. Given the focus on tech layoffs recently, it's relevant to note the definition of what constitutes a tech company has broadened to include businesses that have digitized a variety of analog processes and thereby represent a much broader umbrella of organizations not necessarily located in the Bay Area, including Peloton fitness offerings, Carvana's auto sales process and mortgage companies like Better.com. Likewise, the venture capital slowdown is now impacting companies across many industries and geographies, consistent with this broader scope. Conversely, it's the largest tech companies that drive employment in our North Cal and Seattle markets, and they are more insulated from capital market fluctuations, given their growth opportunities and extraordinary financial strength. Rounding out the overall employment picture in Northern California, we continue to see a recovery of jobs that were eliminated during the pandemic. COVID-related regulations were so stringent that much of the local surface economy workforce had to be fundamentally rebuilt. For example, the Essex markets added 420,000 relatively low paying jobs on a trailing three-month basis, including a 20% to 25% increase in the leisure and hospitality sector, which supports returning tech workers and their demand for services. Our commentary usually focuses on high-paying jobs but the service jobs are also important because most of their employees need to report to a physical location each day, and they support the ecosystem that creates livable and desirable communities. The strong demand for housing is supported by apartment affordability in our Northern California markets, which has improved sharply relative to long-term averages, reflecting a higher growth rate for median incomes relative to median rents. From a historical perspective, these markets screen affordable for the first time in the last decade, and rental housing is significantly more affordable versus home ownership. The value of the median-priced home in California is up about 13% year-over-year and with higher mortgage interest rates, apartments are clearly the more affordable option. We estimate that it is now over 2 times more expensive to buy than rent in the Essex markets. Affordability trends will be impacted by the apartment supply picture of moderated deliveries in the second half of 2022 and a further decline expected in 2023. Sharply lower rents in Northern California during the pandemic resulted in fewer apartment starts in 2020 and 2021 and therefore, a significant drop in new Bay Area apartment deliveries into 2023. Production levels of for-sale housing is also muted on the West Coast with only about 0.4% of existing stock being built annually and production is difficult to increase given zoning restrictions and land availability. Looking ahead, we recognize that the Federal Reserve is working to fight inflation, which often leads to a recession. Our experience indicates that no two recessions are alike, and clearly, the current situation is unique given West Coast remains in a recovery mode from the pandemic. Given this backdrop, we believe that the following factors will help moderate the impact to the West Coast rental markets in the event that economic conditions deteriorate later this year. First, large technology companies significantly accelerated hiring during the pandemic, largely because there were beneficiaries of the pandemic-driven preference for touchless interaction. Many newly hired employees were asked to work remotely until offices reopened, which is now occurring and is a key component of our recent market rent growth in Seattle and the Bay Area. Second, we have extremely tight labor markets and strong job growth on the West Coast, a significant portion of which relates to the recovery of jobs lost in the early part of the pandemic. Recovery of jobs, especially in leisure, hospitality and service sectors has been resilient and should continue for the foreseeable future. Third, the normal migration pattern from the West Coast includes workers' approaching retirement who plan to lower their cost of living and use the equity in their homes as part of their retirement plan. We believe that most of these workers left during the pandemic given California's extraordinary lockdowns, and therefore, it's likely that retirement-related migration will be muted for at least a few more years. Finally, foreign immigration was significantly slowed throughout the pandemic. In recent months, new visas for foreign workers are increasing with the large tech companies being a primary beneficiary, restoring an important source of apartment demand. Before I turn the call over to Angela, let me quickly touch on apartment investment activity. The extraordinary uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets and higher interest rates have disrupted the apartment transaction markets, resulting in fewer closings given diverging buyer and seller expectations. We are in a period of price discovery for apartment transactions and the absence of financial distress means that buyers and sellers are not forced to transact. Therefore, we expect fewer apartment transactions for the foreseeable future. It's difficult to pinpoint cap rates in this environment, although limited recent activity indicates cap rates in the high 3% range to low 4% range. We have seen an increase in apartment development activity that was decimated in the pandemic, driven by the strong rent recovery in suburban areas, which should lead to more preferred equity investments going forward. With that, I will turn the call over to Angela Kleiman. Hey Jeff, that's a great question. Thank you. I think what we're hearing is everyone is now pretty much committed to hybrid working model, and they're trying to figure out what that means and some of the issues are being confronted that I think are embedded in that. So, I think that everyone's having trouble and I would include us in that in this case. People like hybrid, the hybrid model, and they want to stick with a hybrid model. And so, now, it's up to the companies to try to figure out what they need to do to modify their offices to accommodate that model. And notably, Amazon paused some of the work they're doing in Bellevue to take another look at the office format. And so, I think you're going to see more of that activity going forward. We have a data analytics team that's run by Paul Morgan. And so, they scrape that data off the various websites and then categorize it by what's in our markets versus other parts of the U.S. And we've been doing this for, I would say, the better part of 10 years now. And so, it definitely tells the story. So, our data analytics team basically is responsible for that data. We are seeing -- the tech markets are continuing to lead in terms of those openings, so. And that is not surprising. I think, some of the details in those top 10 techs. I think it's interesting that both Google or Alphabet and Apple have hit a new high in job openings, believe it or not, even though made the broader comment that of the top 10 tech companies, they're off a little bit from their high. But still, the number of jobs they have open is pretty extraordinary, given the backdrop of what we've seen over the last several years. So, we're seeing a lot of strength there ongoing and almost as if all this economic turbulence wasn't such a big deal. Yes. This is Mike, and that's another great question. Thank you. We have a variety of price points in our portfolio. So, we cover, I'd say, from the B minus to the A plus category. And therefore, our tenant base is a reflection of the broader economy. And so, unless we have a few buildings that are adjacent, very close to the tech companies where we could have 90-plus percent of the tenants working in the tech industry, for the most part, we're much broader than that. And again, we reflect the broader economy, which includes policemen, firemen, teachers, all the hospitality and restaurant workers, et cetera. And it has not changed a lot. Yes. Hey Rich, I'll have my blue mood ring now. I just want to point that out. But one additional comment is I think what Angela is saying is seasonality implies that rents peak in July. We don't know if rents are going to peak in July. And so that inflection point, once we see that inflection point, we have better visibility going forward about what's going to happen for the rest of the year. So again, it's really a key time in terms of trying to determine where this is going to go, potentially, rents could keep going up or it could follow the normal seasonality, and we reach a peak in July and we start going downhill for the rest of the year. You're right. Barb has built in an assumption into the guidance. Barb, do you want to just comment on that, just to reiterate it? And maybe one other final piece, Rich, and that is that Oakland is obviously lagging in the Northern California recovery as well. Oakland has -- Downtown Oakland has been slow to recover, and it's got quite a bit of development deliveries that are coming there and that's the part that's holding them back. We do track new jobs or job transfers but not job losses exactly per se. And that number, new job or job transfer is roughly 15.7% in our portfolio versus, let's say -- which is down a little bit from the last couple of months. We don't actually track how many job losses -- how many of these people actually lost their job, we just track jobs in general. Not just tech workers, certainly, tech workers and the return-to-office people. But more broadly, we've mentioned in the script that there are awful lot of hospitality, leisure jobs and all the service jobs that are coming back as we fundamentally rebuilt when California shut everything down and many of them left the state. So, it's really both components. And again, our portfolio is not comprised mostly of tech workers. It is a -- it's intended to be a broad overview of the broader economy. So, we don't target tech workers per se. Certainly, the renewal side. We have good visibility on. It's going to be somewhere in the high-single-digit range. It's the new lease rate that we don't know, obviously, given all the turmoil in the financial markets, et cetera. So, again, as I think Angela mentioned earlier, so far, we're following a normal seasonal pattern. But typically, that changes -- the weaker portion of the year begins in July and through the end of the year. We just don't know what that inflection point is going to look like or when we're going to attain it. And so, it's a little bit difficult for us to predict the rest of the year given that we don't know where that peak in rents this year. Well, I don't think so. I mean broader strategic issues are not things that you would implement quickly, there thoughtful processes and just try to work through things. I think this is more tactical. We don't know what's going to happen in the broader economy going forward, and that point was very well made by the investors at NAREIT certainly recently. So, given that backdrop, we're going to continue to lean toward a relatively conservative approach to capital allocation, and that's the one that Barb was outlining before and Adam too. And maybe what I would add to what Adam said that trying to focus on the preferred equity book will be something that we're focused on the remainder of the year. But, in terms of broader choices when you look at where the stock price is trading and we do our own fundamental research on the value of the company on a per share basis. And when you look at those numbers, it's not a time that we would be aggressively growing the Company, let's say, just because the pieces are not as compelling as they have been certainly at different points of time. So, I think it's the time to just execute, you take what the market gives us and make thoughtful decisions, and that's what we've done. That's what we're going to continue to do. That's roughly 50 basis points higher than what we talked about... Yes. Thank you, operator. We would like to thank everyone for joining the call today. We feel good about our results, and we feel like we may have a little bit of wind to our back. So, that's obviously great to see. And we look forward to seeing many of you in the near future. Thank you, and good day."

            "name": "Barb Pak",
            "content": "Thanks, Angela. I'll start with a brief overview of our second quarter results, discuss changes to our full year guidance followed by an update on investments and the balance sheet. We are pleased to report we achieved core FFO per share of $3.68 in the second quarter. The results exceeded the high end of our updated guidance range published in June. Of the $0.10 beat to the midpoint, $0.03 relates to better-than-expected revenues in June and $0.06 relates to lower property taxes, primarily from a combination of lower assessed values and millage rates at our Washington properties. For the full year, we are raising the midpoint of core FFO by $0.29 to $14.45. The revised midpoint equates to 15.7% year-over-year growth. The increase to our midpoint is primarily driven by better-than-expected operating fundamentals and an improved outlook on delinquency. As such, we are raising the midpoint of same-property revenue growth by 70 basis points to 10.3% and NOI growth by 140 basis points to 13.5%. In addition, our full year guidance assumes a reduction in expense growth from 4% to 3.3% at the midpoint. Turning to delinquency. We are encouraged by the continued improvements we are seeing in our delinquency. For the quarter, net delinquency was 60 basis points of scheduled rents, a significant reduction from the first quarter. This was a result of many efforts by our operations team, which led to a 20% reduction in gross delinquency as compared to the first quarter. In addition, we received a higher level of government reimbursement in the second quarter. Also worth noting, in late June, there were a couple of key events that are positive for the future. First, the State of California allocated an additional $1.9 billion in emergency rental assistance for existing applications after exhausting its initial $5 billion allocation. This gives us more visibility on the remaining funds to be allocated, especially as it relates to our $34 million in outstanding applications. Second, on July 1st, a California state law expired, which provides landlords additional rates to recapture delinquent units. Thus, outside of L.A. and Alameda counties where eviction protections remain in place, we would expect to see a gradual improvement in gross delinquencies over the coming quarters. Moving to our stock buyback and investment goals. In the second quarter, we repurchased approximately $61 million of common stock at a significant discount to our internal NAV, using free cash flow and excess proceeds from year-to-date transactions. As for our investment goals this year, we have a strong pipeline of accretive preferred equity deals and remain on track to achieve our goal of $50 million to $150 million of new commitments. However, given the rapidly changing interest rate environment and the sharp increase in our cost of capital relative to cap rates in our markets, we are reducing our acquisition goals, which are outlined in the earnings release to focus on share repurchases instead. This is consistent with our disciplined approach to capital allocation, whereby we will shift capital to what the best use is, given changing market dynamics. Lastly, I want to conclude my prepared remarks by highlighting the strength of the balance sheet. Over the past year, we have seen a continued reduction in leverage with our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio improving from 6.6 times at the depths of the pandemic to 5.8 times today. We are rapidly approaching our historical low for this ratio and believe we will see continued improvements in this metric over the next few quarters through growth in EBITDA. As it relates to upcoming capital needs, we are in an advantageous position. Our existing cash flow from operations covers our current dividend, all capital expenditures and development funding needs. As such, our only known funding needs relate to debt maturities, which are minimal, given we proactively took advantage of the low interest rate environment over the last few years to further strengthen the balance sheet. As a result, we have only $300 million in debt maturing in mid-2023 and $400 million maturing in mid-2024. This equates to less than 6% of our debt maturing annually for the next 2.5 years. And while interest rates have increased on new debt, capital markets remain open, and we have access to a variety of secured and unsecured debt sources. This affords us strong financial flexibility, which will enable us to be opportunistic as it relates to these upcoming maturities. With over $1.3 billion in liquidity, we are well positioned. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions. Hi Nick, it's Barb. Yes, that has been our strategy historically. In the second quarter, we did have excess cash flow, so we used that to buy back the stock. Going forward though, we would look to sell assets to buy back the stock. So, we could do that. We would like -- if we have an asset in contract, we might buy it back a little earlier than the sale. But for the most part, we're going to maintain our disciplined approach to match funding any future buyback going forward. And then, Steve, as it relates to guidance, as what Angela said earlier, the first half of the year, we had much easier comps, but given the surge in rents we saw last year, we have much more difficult comps in the second half of the year, which on new leases, we're assuming in the second half of the year 7% new lease growth, it was 15% in the first half of the year, so a significant reduction just because of the comp issue. Yes. So, our revised guidance assumes 1.5% for the full year as a percent of our schedule rent. That's how we've been talking about it since the start of the pandemic. And that -- we assume the first half and the second half are about the same now. Previously, we had assumed a worse second half, but now we've pulled that up now. And that's really a function of the $1.9 billion in new emergency rental assistance that the states allocated. It does give us more visibility on continued emergency rental assistance in the back half of the year that we were uncertain about going into this quarter. And then, the other thing is we do have -- we have seen improvements in our gross delinquency. They have started to come down. In June, they fell; July, they fell. And so, we do expect a continued moderation in the gross delinquency line, which gets us to the improved outlook on delinquency in the back half of the year. Like I said earlier, we do assume rent growth year-over-year moderates in the second half of the year because of the more difficult comps. And as Angela mentioned, we've assumed a normal seasonal curve. So, we will peak at the end of July, like Mike said. So, that is what's built into the guidance. But we do feel good about the tailwinds that are in front of us or behind us from where we are today. Hi. This is Barb. We have $34 million in open applications right now and then of our $78 million in cumulative delinquency. So, that's how you would compare those two, of which -- so the $34 million, we've assumed some of that will occur this year. We don't know how quickly they're going to disperse those funds. We've assumed about 50% of that we get this year in our guidance. It's not all same-store though, either. So keep that in mind. That's total for the whole portfolio. And then, the other piece that we have to go after the tenants, we will -- we already started that process. We have various means we can do to -- their credit, or doing their credit, go after them in small claims court in order to try to recoup our back rent, and we're actively doing what we can and abiding by the laws, obviously. And LA Alameda is where we're probably the most restricted, but outside of that, we have a lot of -- a lot more ability to go after the tenants. Yes. No, that's a good question. I think it's roughly 50-50 at this point. The $34 million in open applications does relate -- bulk of that relates to our current residents. Very little of that is for past due -- or past residents."
        },
        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Angela Kleiman",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. First, I would like to express my appreciation for our operations and support teams for delivering some of our highest level of quarterly same-store revenue growth. All this while we continue to roll out our property collections operating model throughout the portfolio, great job team, and thank you. Today, I'll start with key operational highlights in our major regions, discuss rent growth expectations for the remainder of 2022 and conclude with an update on the rollout of our transformational initiatives for the operating business. We are very pleased with our second quarter performance. With strong demand fundamentals and modest supply described by Mike earlier, we maximize revenues by favoring rent growth rather than occupancy. This resulted in same-property revenue growth of 12.7% on a year-over-year basis and a 4.8% on a sequential basis, which are some of the highest growth rates achieved in the Company's history. As we head into August, so far, we are experiencing a normal leasing season with June and July loss to lease for the same-store portfolio at 9.7% and 10.3%, respectively. Turning to regional highlights, starting with our Washington portfolio. This region generated a 20.7% year-over-year net effective rent growth on new leases for the second quarter, which was led by Eastside Seattle, where the majority of our portfolio is located. Seattle continues to benefit from strong job growth, which is driving leasing momentum. Our Seattle portfolio is well positioned and 9.7% loss to lease as of July. On to Northern California. This region generated 17.5% year-over-year net effective rent growth on new leases for the second quarter, which was led by Santa Clara County at 24%, primarily driven by the robust demand from large tech employers in Silicon Valley. Northern California has demonstrated some of the strongest job growth this year. And despite the negative headlines on tech startups, we are not experiencing any softness in rent growth in July or in our third quarter renewals. We expect positive momentum to continue for Northern California with demand from return to office, which may be further accelerated by incremental job growth throughout the second half of the year. Loss to lease in this region continues to pick up and is 8.7% in July. Moving on to Southern California, which has been a strong performer with 22.4% year-over-year net effective rent growth on new leases for the second quarter. Healthy job growth has continued to drive incremental demand in Southern California, which is built upon the significant rent growth achieved last year and resulted in our highest level of loss to lease at 12.1% in July. Turning to our expectations for the remainder of 2022. As you may recall, we had anticipated a deceleration in market rent growth in the second half of the year because of tougher year-over-year comps. As expected, we are seeing this deceleration show up on our new lease spreads on page S16. However, as demonstrated by our current performance and the increase to same-property growth expectations for the year, our fundamentals remain strong. It is with this backdrop that we continue to advance our company-wide implementation of our property collections operating model. By way of background, we have been transitioning from a dedicated team for each property to teams that cover a collection of around 9 to 12 properties thereby transforming our business from a property centric to a customer-centric operating model. As we have rolled out, this model to our other regions, we've been able to replicate the improvements in cross-selling from 15% to 23% achieved at the first asset collection that was rolled out last year in San Diego. This demonstrates our sales team's ability to sell effectively across multiple properties, reducing customer acquisition costs and improving overall sales efficiency. Lastly, we have been making good progress codeveloping proprietary applications with partners from the RET Ventures such as Funnel, to enhance our technology platform. We execute approximately 60,000 transactions a year, including move-in, move-out and renewals, and we are focused on automating all manual tasks. Following full deployment of the Funnel suite in late 2023, we anticipate this investment will be an important factor in the 200 to 300 basis points of margin improvement we expect to achieve over the next few years. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barb Pak. Yes. Hi. It's Angela here. That's a good question. What we are expecting is the normal seasonality to play out. Having said that, we do have headwinds from tougher year-over-year comps that I described earlier. And just to give you a little more color, last year, in the first half, our blended lease rates was negative, was negative 4%, but in the second half, it surged to about 13.25%. [Ph] So, that's the tough year-over-year comp. And what we're seeing is with the strength in Northern California is that it's a key reason for the shift of expecting So Cal to outperform in the first half. And now in the second half, we're expecting Seattle and North Cal to lead our growth going forward. Hi. It's Angela here. Another good question. And the embedded earnings for 2023 is really going to be a function of the seasonality curve. And at this point, we are -- we have one of the strongest loss to lease in the Company's history at 10.3%, and it continues to grow because we have not yet peaked. And you add to that the tailwind from the job growth and modest supply, we feel good about our position. But to try to speculate at this point is probably not going to be all that helpful because third quarter is when we tend to have the most transactions, and so it's the most active quarter. And so, once we see how that plays out, we'll be able to provide better visibility to the actual shape of that seasonal curve. And so, it's -- so we plan to have a more in-depth discussion on that topic on our October call. Sure. Happy to. It's Angela here. I'll talk about renewals, and I'll turn it over to Barb to talk about guidance. In terms of our third quarter renewals, we're coming in at close to 10%. And it's a pretty tight band within all our key markets, Seattle leading the pack around 11; Northern California in the 10 range; and of course, Southern California close to 9. Sure, happy to. So, you brought up a couple of points. I'll try to hit all of them. So, if I miss anything, please chime in. So, in terms of wage pressure, I mean, we're experiencing that just like everybody else. However, I think you can see from our controllable expenses, especially in the admin line item, we've been able to find offsets and so have been able to manage through that. And it's primarily because of how we have transformed our operating business model to this, I think you call -- collection because that's improved inefficiency. So ultimately, what remains is allowing our people to take less time to get the test that they used to do. From a customer perspective, though, first of all, we've been contactless since COVID. So, it's effectively no change for them in how they interact with us. But as far as availability is concerned, we have -- although the office is not open, we do have by appointments available and of customers that access [Technical Difficulty] however, if they want, they can reach us via different, whether it's online or 800 number, they can make an appointment [Technical Difficulty] and every asset collection has a hub [Technical Difficulty]. So, sometimes it's an immediate thing, they will get into a car and drive to a hub nearby. And so, once again, that has not been an issue either. And when we look at our customer satisfaction, so they actually have been feeling better than pre-COVID. Well, let me just clarify something. The maintenance team is on site. And so, they are responding timely to any customer service request. Yes. So, what we're talking about is administration, bookkeeping, those type of activities, but the maintenance is separate. Well, it's a little bit more to it than that. I mean, it's speculative, right? Because right now, what we're saying is with 10.3% loss lease, that's higher than our typical loss lease in the past. Now normal seasonality means that that loss lease will start to decline over time. What I don't know and that's an honest statement, I don't know the rate of that decline or the steepness of that curve. All I can point to is from what we're seeing right now, the curve looks good. Having said that, there is the broad economy out there, and we will need to see how that plays out to have a better sense. Thanks for acknowledging that these are pretty darn strong numbers across the board. But just to give you a little more background, these -- the revised forecast is really a reflection of how we performed in the first half. And because the first half was so strong in Southern California and in Seattle, that's the driver to the change in order. So, when we look at the second half, so the second half of, say, about 7% for the portfolio, we are seeing that Seattle and Northern California will be the path in the second. No, no, Seattle and Northern California in the second half. Yes. So, that 11.1% [ph] is 15% in the first half, which is big, and that's driven by So Cal and Seattle and 7% approximately in the second half, and that 7% average will be driven by Northern California and Seattle higher than 7%. And of course, Southern California lower than 7%. It's average. Yes, happy to. I think -- we try to provide a baseline. And so we don't tend to say, forecasting recession or excessive growth, for example. Now, I do want to point you to the backdrop of the second half of last year. We grew -- our blended lease rates was 13.25%. And so, the new lease rates were much higher. And so, it truly is a function of a tougher year-over-year comp. And to your point, is it possible that we perform better because of the fundamentals? Certainly, that's on the table."

            "content": "Hey John. I would put us at a 1. We're seeing very little distress on the pref side. We are seeing some opportunities where bridge lenders were able to loan on deals that are in lease-up. We've seen a definite pullback in that. So, we're seeing opportunities for us to come in, in those types of cases, but no, very -- I'd say no distress at this point. Understood. Yes. No, it's same answer. We're not seeing any... Hi Neil, this is Adam. So, there was a lot to that question, but just kind of starting at the beginning. Historically, we haven't really been a land banking shop. We tend to -- when we develop, we tend to go after shovel-ready deals. We do have a couple of pre-entitlement deals that are in the pipeline and potentially would build further out. Other than that, though, we've seen the most opportunity in our prep book and especially more recently, we've seen quite a bit of opportunity. As for as acquisitions, we're always in the market, but highly dependent on where our cost of capital is and matching funds. We will -- we have seen some opportunities on the development side where we can joint venture and usually couple that with a preferred equity piece as well. And so, we're highly focused on turning those over as well. So, lots of potential, but on the development side, on the direct development side today, we're seeing cap rates probably in the mid-4s. And to us, that's just not -- that's not enough spread to adjust for the risk associated with costs and the other challenges associated with development. Yes. Hi Adam, this is Adam. To go -- cover the back half of the question first. So, transaction volume has actually been fairly consistent. Over the recent probably month to six weeks is where we've seen things slow down a little bit. So, we've seen some deals drop out of the market, and we have seen that bid-ask spread. Depending on the market, depending on vintage, I'd say for our core, core plus within our kind of core markets, there's probably a 25 to 50 basis-point bid-ask spread between what sellers are looking and buyers are willing. But again, that's not to be said that deals aren't happening because there are still transactions occurring in the market. Can you restate the first part of the question? Yes. So yes, we don't know where cap rates are going. But based on today -- what we're seeing today, we're seeing them in that kind of high-3s to low-4s. I might be... Yes. They were in -- okay, yes. So, they're in the mid-3s, what we talked about a few quarters ago. So yes, I would say 50 basis points is probably on average."

Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found on the company's filings with the SEC.  It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall. You may begin.\nMichael Schall : Thank you for joining us today, and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. Angela Kleiman and Barb Pak will follow me with prepared remarks and Adam Berry is here for Q&A.  Today, I will comment on our first quarter results recent housing demand and supply trends and a brief overview of the apartment transaction market. We are pleased to announce our fourth consecutive quarter of improving core FFO per share and same-store revenue growth with this quarter's core FFO exceeding our guidance midpoint by $0.07 per share. As mentioned in our earnings release, our results and rent growth trajectory support an increase in core FFO and same-property revenue guidance for the year, which Barb will review shortly. Overall, rents have continued to improve. And as of April 2022, net effective rents in the Essex markets are now 11.4% above pre-COVID rent levels and up 22% compared to one year ago. All of our markets have positive sequential rent growth with Northern California leading the portfolio, improving sequentially by approximately 3% in each month of the first quarter. We expect further improvement in Northern California as progress is made on return to office programs for the large technology companies following several COVID-related delays. The top tech companies also continue to hire rapidly in the Essex markets with over 50,000 job openings posted for California and Washington, a 79% increase compared to March of 2020. Other indicators, including job growth, venture capital deployment and office investment continue to support our thesis that Northern California will remain the epicenter of the technology industries. A significant recent example came from Google, which announced a plan to invest more than $3.5 billion on additional office and data centers in Mountain View, Downtown San Jose and elsewhere across the Bay Area. The easing of COVID-related regulation has been pivotal for return to office in our markets. mask mandates have been significantly relaxed versus prior quarters making it easier to bring employees back to the office. Business travel, in-person meetings, property tours and conferences have resumed, and we look forward to in-person investor meetings once again. As COVID-related regulations continue to subside on the West Coast, the deadline to apply for rental relief in California has now passed as of April 1. The Government-sponsored rental relief has been a double-edged sword for California apartment owners as tenants were often encouraged to see government rental relief programs rather than paying rent. Delays in government reimbursements led to the highest delinquency since the onset of the pandemic, with the rental relief program now closed to new applications in California, we are now cautiously optimistic that underlying delinquency trends will improve. California's rental assistance program remains far behind with respect to payments providing potential upside as we continue pursuing the approximately $76 million of rent owed to the company. Given the extraordinary government restrictions during the pandemic, it became clear that our portfolio would need to achieve 2 inflection points before we could be confident that a full recovery was underway. The first was the reopening of our markets, which occurred in July of 2021 and the second was a return to office for the largest technology companies. Over the past 2 months, we've seen Google, Microsoft, Meta and Apple all begin to reopen and restaff their offices. Our leasing specialists are reporting more applicants returning from out-of-state as hybrid and similar arrangements require regular office attendance for employees. Return to office mandates are generating economic activities, which is apparent in the job growth reports with San Francisco leading our portfolio with 8.9% trailing 3-month job growth. On average, the Essex markets reported job growth of 6.7% on a trailing 3-month basis versus the broader U.S. average of 4.7% and marking the second consecutive quarter that Essex markets have outpaced the nation in job growth. We expect this outperformance will continue as Essex has still only recovered 83% of the jobs compared to pre-covid levels versus the U.S. recovery of 95%.  We expect service and hospitality-related jobs to continue a strong growth trajectory supported by increased travel generally and demand for services from the well-paid workforce on the West Coast. The confluence of increasing job growth, a lower unemployment rate of 3.6% in the Essex markets and expensive for sale housing all contribute to favorable rental housing tailwinds. Turning to housing supply. The ability to ramp up housing production is more challenging along the West Coast as a result of long entitlement processes, burdensome regulations labor shortages and inflating construction cost. As a result, housing permits in Essex markets remain at levels roughly consistent with our long-term averages. Our bottoms-up supply analysis indicates that new deliveries will moderate for the rest of 2022, and we are also expecting a 15% decline in apartment supply in 2023 and which includes a 54% reduction in new supply expected in Northern California. All of our markets remain on the lower end of the supply growth spectrum versus other U.S. metros. Turning to the apartment investment markets. Geopolitical events, turbulent financial market conditions and high levels of inflation create uncertainty, which may become a headwind for transactions. However, cap rates generally don't move quickly and are mostly a function of investor demand for property. As to the West Coast specifically, strong evidence of recovering apartment market conditions, higher inflationary growth expectations and significant capital pursuing apartments appear to have mostly offset the impact of higher interest cost keeping cap rates unchanged at this point. Our review of cap rates for recent apartment transactions across the Essex markets indicate most institutional quality assets trading in the mid-3% range for stabilized properties with little deviation across markets, building class and location. We will continue to be selective with our capital allocation strategy, focusing on deals that have the best growth potential and generate accretion to our financial benchmarks. In closing, I'd like to briefly highlight the importance of ESG and its impact on the company. As a leading provider of housing along the West Coast, we know that our company has a responsibility to operate in an environmentally conscious way Consistent with that thesis, we recently released our TCFD report, which is the first step toward alignment with proposed SEC reporting requirements. Last week, we announced that Essex will co-anchor an ESG housing Impact Fund managed by RET Ventures. Finally, we are also pleased to announce the upcoming publication of our fourth CSR report which should be available in early May.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Angela Kleiman.\nAngela Kleiman : Thanks, Mike. First, I would like to express my appreciation for our operations and support teams. As we have implemented new systems and structures to optimize our operations, our team has taken on these challenges in stride and continues to demonstrate exceptional work ethic and dedication to our company's success. In today's comments, I'll begin with key operational highlights on our major regions, including our outlook for 2022 rent growth and conclude with an update on the rollout of our property collections operating model. We are pleased with our first quarter operating results, especially in delivering a 6.5% same-property revenue growth on a year-over-year basis. This is primarily driven by increases in scheduled rents and improvements in concessions detailed on Page 2 of our press release. The first quarter performance exceeded our expectations and included some of our strongest leasing spreads reported in the company's history, with net effective new leases up 20% and renewals up 11.7% compared to the same period last year. Average concessions for the portfolio continues to remain minimal with April loss to lease for the same-store portfolio at 9.5%. We are well positioned heading into the summer leasing season. Here are the key operational highlights from north to south. Beginning with our Washington portfolio. Rents in the Pacific Northwest had a strong start to the year, improving sequentially each month since December.  In addition, we successfully decreased concession in downtown Seattle throughout the quarter. Our supply forecast reflects a modest rate in deliveries throughout 2022, and the Seattle job market remained strong with March average trailing 3-month growth rate of 6.1%. Moving forward, we anticipate steady performance from our Seattle region with a loss to lease in April of 7.7%. On to Northern California. As Mike mentioned earlier, rents in this region are being lifted by the return to office of large tech companies and a solid rebound in job growth. After a typical seasonal slowdown in the fourth quarter, construction usage in San Francisco and San Jose declined throughout the first quarter, leading to a steady improvement in net effective rents. Looking ahead, we expect the supply picture to remain steady for the rest of the year and on the demand side, job growth is accelerating with March average trailing 3 months growth rate of 6.7%. As Northern California is in its early stages of recovery, we are seeing a steady increase to loss to lease, which stands at 5.1% in April, and we continue to expect this region to lead our market rent growth in 2022. Turning to Southern California, which has been our best-performing market throughout the pandemic, we continue to be confident about Southern California as rents did not experience the typical seasonal decline in the fourth quarter and have continued to improve each month in the first quarter. Concessions have been below one week for almost a year. Turnover in Southern California remains at the lowest level relative to the rest of our markets, demonstrating continued strength and stability of this region. For 2022, we have forecasted a modest increase in supply delivery and anticipate concessions may temporarily elevate in areas near those development lease-ups. On the demand side, Southern California was our top-performing region with March average trailing 3-month job growth of 7.9%.  Furthermore, our April loss to lease of 14% will provide a tailwind to revenues into 2023. It is with the strong fundamental backdrop that Essex continues to make progress in advancing our property collections operating model. We discussed on previous earnings calls on how we successfully improved efficiency last year in San Diego and Orange County by operating closely located properties as a single unified business. The benefits of this operating model includes enhancing our customer service through virtual on-demand experience, creating more career advanced opportunities for associates through specialization and ultimately generating a 10% to 15% reduction in administrative staffing needs through natural attrition, which is also mitigating the inflationary pressures we are experiencing today. Historically, Essex has operated with an employee to unit ratio of 40:1. Today, we are at 43:1, and our target by the end of 2022 is 45:1. At this point, we have completed the Wola of Southern California and expect company-wide implementation by year-end. In addition, we have ongoing digital platform improvements rolling out over the next few years. As such, we have yet to fully optimize our business, and we anticipate further benefits in 2023 and thereafter. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barb Pak.\nBarb Pak: Thanks, Angela. I'll start with a few comments on our first quarter results, discuss changes to our full year guidance followed by an update on co-investment activity and the balance sheet. I'm pleased to report core FFO for the first quarter exceeded our expectations. The favorable outcome was due to strong operating results and higher co-investment income. For the full year, we are raising the midpoint of core FFO by $0.25 per share to $13.95. The increase is driven by 2 factors: First, we are raising the midpoint of our same-property revenue growth by 85 basis points to 8.6% on a cash basis. This is driven by our solid first quarter operating results and an improvement in our net delinquency expectations for the year. Our revised guidance now assumes net delinquency of 1.9% of scheduled rent as compared to our original guidance of 2.4% at the midpoint. As Mike mentioned, the deadline for applying for federal tenant relief passed on April 1. We believe this has led to an improvement in our residents paying current, while at the same time, we have also seen an increase in emergency rental assistance over the past 2 months. As such, our April net delinquencies were 20 basis points of scheduled rent which is below our historical average of 35 basis points. While this is encouraging, underlying gross delinquencies were about 5% in April and thus, we still need to make progress before we can confidently put COVID-related delinquencies behind us.  A second factor in our improved core FFO guidance range relates to preferred equity investment as we are now expecting approximately $250 million of redemptions compared to our initial midpoint of $350 million. The reduction in redemptions relates to 3 investments that we now anticipate being paid off in 2023. Turning to our co-investment platform. We recently monetized the promote income within 2 ventures unlocking embedded value for our shareholders. In the first quarter, we amended our WESCO joint venture, realizing $17 million of promote income, which was paid in cash. The venture generated a 16% IRR for Essex shareholders. Subsequent to quarter end, we amended our WESCO 4 joint venture earning $37 million of promote income, which was elected to reinvest back into the venture and increase our ownership to 65%. This venture achieved a 22% IRR. These 2 transactions are expected to create over $2 million in additional core FFO on an annual basis. Overall, our private equity platform continues to create value for our investors and remains an important alternative source of capital.  Finally, turning to the balance sheet. In the first quarter, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio improved to 6.1x compared to 6.6x at the depth of the pandemic. we expect this ratio will continue to improve throughout 2022, driven by stronger operating results. with over $1 billion of liquidity, limited near-term funding needs and multiple sources of capital available to us, we remain in a strong financial position. That concludes my prepared remarks.  And I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first questions come from the line of Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.\nRich Hill: Hopefully, it's a relatively straightforward one. But given the really impressive new and renewal growth that you're putting up right now. I'm hoping you can disclose for us what the earn-in for 2023 is right now?\nAngela Kleiman: Rich, it's Angela. I would love to be able to give you the earning for 2023, but it's one barbelkilme. And two, it's just too early. I think you can see that our fundamentals are solid, and we're doing quite well.\nRich Hill: Okay. I'd figure that try. So maybe just one follow-up question I don't know, some of your peers talk about it. So I know it's not the ESS way, but I figured I'd give it a go. So we did noticed that your occupancy dipped a little bit in April, I'm wondering if you can just walk us through if that was intentional pushing rates into the peak leasing season and how you think that might trend given turnover that feels pretty low?\nAngela Kleiman: Sure. That's a good question, Rich. And you've seen us do this, which is when we see market strength, we would change our strategy from favoring occupancy to pushing rents, especially when we see -- when we are anticipating more market strength coming ahead of us. So it is very much intentional. And you'll see that when we are past the leasing season, usually during third quarter, and especially in the fourth quarter, we would change that strategy back to pushing occupancy instead.\nRich Hill: Okay. That's great. Mike, if I had another question, which I don't, I'd ask you about solar payables, but maybe we can table that for NAREIT.\nMichael Schall: About what I missed that.\nRich Hill: Just about solar panels.\nMichael Schall: Solar panels. Okay. I mean They hold the CSR effort\nRich Hill: Yes.\nMichael Schall: I'll just make a couple of quick comments, and then we'll move on from there. We have actually, for over 10 years now been had our own, what we call resource management group. So we've got pretty long history of pursuing things that we thought were good for our properties, good for values and create more efficient ways of doing things. So our CSR efforts have been -- they're nothing new, and they've been part of our past. And -- but I would say, as we think about California especially, there's a mandate here to remove gas cars by 2035. There are other mandates, as you all know, and they keep us focused on that. I think that there is a strong intersection between opportunity to add value to the portfolio many of these ESG efforts, and you mentioned one of them, which is solar panels, but it goes well beyond that. electronic vehicle charging stations, et cetera, part of the mandate as well. So we're excited about it. We were excited to announce our co anchoring of that new fund that sponsored by RET ventures. And I think it's consistent with our path and the way we think about ESG.\nOperator: Our next has come from the line of Nick Joseph with Citi.\nNick Joseph: You talked about the strong rent growth and demand in Northern California. As you survey those incoming residents where are they moving from? Are they within the MSA? Are they coming from kind of other areas of California coming from other areas of country, what migration trends are you seeing maybe specific to Northern California?\nMichael Schall: Nick, it's Mike, and maybe Angela will want to make a comment. And by the way, FeraBar runs higher I make that comment. But really, it's I think, opening up a number of different things. The normal migration pattern typically has retirees with expensive California homes leading as you enter into a recessionary period, we certainly saw that. And then normally, that's -- those retiring workers moving out of California are replaced by younger workers that are coming into California to take higher-paying jobs and some of the opportunities for the tech company. So the younger workers were largely told to stay put until the tech company has opened up. And so now we are starting to see them return. In addition to that, there are some foreign migration that has picked up also, and we're starting to see more demand for corporate housing units as these big tech companies in terms of their training and onboarding activities. There's definitely a pickup in demand from corporate house for corporate housing. So it's really across the board. We're seeing more normalization of our activities, and they're coming from a number of different areas.\nNick Joseph: And then maybe just on the transaction environment and I recognize every environment is different. But just based on your past experience, how are you thinking of asset pricing trending from here? Obviously, there's high rent growth, but negative leverage with higher interest rates. So in the past, as you've seen some of those inputs, what has that done to the transaction market on a lag basis?\nAdam Berry: Nick, this is Adam. So going forward, we don't see -- we don't see transaction values changing a whole lot. I think Mike you mentioned in his opening comments. You are seeing some interest rate pressures, obviously, but with the growth that we're seeing throughout our markets and with the amount of capital in the market chasing deals. We're really not seeing a dramatic move in pricing for deals that are kind of on the market right now. We're seeing a somewhat less froth than what we've seen over the last, call it, 6 to 9 months. but that that's that extra 5% the groups have moved after the second best and final round that we're not seeing today. So it really -- like I said, we're not seeing a dramatic shift in pricing moving forward.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore.\nSteve Sakwa: Barb, I just wanted to try and clarify some things I'm a little confused. I know there are a lot of numbers on delinquencies and bad debt. So F-16, you showed -- you had 2.2 in the first quarter. It dropped 0.2% in April. But then I think I heard you say that delinquencies -- gross delinquencies were 5% in April. And that your guidance now incorporates 1.9%. So I'm just sort of trying to put the gross and the net together and really figure out how conservative, how aggressive you are on the delinquency front, and what sort of upside maybe there is if the rental assistance program, which have kind of burned off, lead to better collections, what kind of upside can we see?\nBarb Pak: Steve, yes, that's a great question. So what I was alluding to in our guidance, we've assumed 1.9% scheduled rent, and that's on a net delinquency basis. So that would be after emergency rental assistance. That's for the full year, which implies 2% in the back half of the year. And that would compare to the in the first quarter in terms of net delinquencies on a cash basis. And then the other number I provided was the 5% on gross because we do still have high underlying gross delinquencies. We're working through those. And we have seen a positive change over the last couple of months. For example, in January, February, we're at 6.5%, and we've come down to 5%. And we believe that part of that is a function of the change in the law that occurred in April. That said, we still have a lot of work to do there, and we've only seen 1 month of data. So our guidance doesn't assume that, that materially changes from here, especially with Alameda and LA County where Avicion protections remain in place. So the combination of emergency rental assistance and gross delinquencies kind of gets us to our net 1.9% for the full year.\nSteve Sakwa: And if you were to just put the 5% gross in perspective, say, pre-pandemic in 2018 or 2019 before all these issues, what are the gross delinquencies sort of look like just to help frame the 5% number?\nBarb Pak: It would be less than 1%. Because remember, our net delinquencies were 35 basis points historically. So our gross delinquencies were less than 1%. And on average. So the 5% is definitely very high.\nMichael Schall: Steve, let me throw out one other set of numbers. And that is we're owed $76 million. I think that was in my script, of which we booked, I believe, $4 billion of that as revenue or accounts receivable. So we have a long way to go, a lot of collections, potential collections out there. We just don't know when or how much, given the -- most of it comes from the state rental relief program, and it is impossible for us to predict when that's going to come in.\nSteve Sakwa: Right. No, I understand it\u2019s hard to kind of figure out when you\u2019ll get it. But okay so there\u2019s a fair amount of conservatism there that could lead to further upside. I guess, Mike, I know you\u2019re not big on the development side, but just how are you thinking about new development opportunities, if at all? And are you seeing any changes in land prices or more opportunities coming your way? And how do return sort of pencil given the big inflation we\u2019ve seen, but also the starting to improve rent growth picture?\nMichael Schall: Yes, Steve. I mean, I\u2019m going to turn that over to Adam here in a second, but I will say that in the recent past, we press released a couple of development deals, one in Seattle and one in Northern California. And that doesn\u2019t speak to our pipeline. So with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Adam to talk about development.\nA \u2013Adam Berry: Steve, we\u2019re seeing we\u2019re not seeing a huge increase in deals coming out on the development side. Those that we\u2019ve seen to trade in the Bay Area the per ore price has definitely gone up. They are generally solving to a low 4 cap, which that does not provide the spread that we need in order to justify risk associated with development deals. We probably have seen more tertiary markets, increase their potential for new development deals. And that really hasn\u2019t been as much our focus either. So generally, we have \u2013 as Mike mentioned, we press released a deal last year in the Bay Area. We have a couple in the pipeline that we\u2019re working through. But we are staying selective and disciplined as to what kind of spread necessary for these deals.\nA \u2013Michael Schall: One additional note, what Adam talks about a 4 cap, he\u2019s saying today, that\u2019s untrended for cap. So we compare an acquisition yield today against a development yield today. So it\u2019s not trended just a flat.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Jeff Spector with Bank of America.\nJeff Spector: My first question, Mike, is on your supply comments. I believe you said that for '23, supply will be down. I think you said maybe 11%. And I was -- and I'm sorry, if I'm saying the wrong percent, please correct me. I'm just curious how confident you are at this point on 23. And has that changed in the last couple of months? Has it always been -- has the expectation been lower in '23 similarly, let's say, a few months ago? Or has something changed?\nMichael Schall: Jeff, actually, these numbers didn't change a lot from last quarter. And that overall reduction in 2023 was minus 15%, made up of minus 54% and in the Bay Area. So a pretty flat in Southern California and up a little bit in Seattle. So I think what's happened here is that in the early phases of COVID, people pulled back on development. And so we're starting to see the impact of that. Now couple of years later. And so I think that there will be a low period for development starts and then we'll see what happens in the further along in the cycle. But in my prepared remarks, I noted that the deliveries, we've actually had the peak deliveries in Q1, Q2 '22. So they moderate little bit toward the end of -- for the rest of the year, the last -- the next 6 months and then next year, again, down 15%. So the trajectory. And we do our own fundamental analysis on this. So we actually have people look at deals and see where they stand. And so we're accurate than some of the other data that you see out there, not that some of these can't change their construction delays, et cetera, that happen. But I think our numbers are spot on with respect to what's coming at us.\nJeff Spector: Great. And then just a follow-up, Mike, on some of the comments about San Francisco and the return to work. It's interesting. It seems to be one of the only markets where really the return to work has been a catalyst for apartment demand. A lot of other cities or most have seen that strong demand without companies, let's say, forcing people back to work? And I guess I'm more of a worry. I guess to me that it feels a bit negative, like why is that? Is that a problem longer term? I guess, how would you counter that? Like at the end of the , why is that a positive? I know it's a positive because you're seeing people come in on the return to work. But I guess what are your thoughts on that?\nMichael Schall: Well, my initial thought goes back to the first chapter of COVID, which the city is basically shut down. They shut down all the restaurants, they shut down hotels, all the leisure, all the service jobs are pretty much eliminated. And so if you're one of those people who generally is not a high wage earner, what are you going to do? You just lost your job and you don't have any certainty about getting another one because basically everything is shut down in the city. So those people all left. And so now what you're starting to see is the demand for those services really didn't change all that much, but you got to bring all those workers back in order to reengage in those businesses. And so I think that's what's happening. So this was not a voluntary choice, people had to stay in the cities and pursue their livelihood, they were effectively forced out. So as the cities recover and again, we have some concerns about the is given defund the police movements, et cetera, homelessness. And -- but as the cities recover, we think that there's good upside. And it's entirely due to real demand for travel, for services, for restaurants, for hotels, et cetera. So we don't view it as artificial at all. We view it as a policy choice largely that caused the deep hole, and now, we're just recovering to a natural place.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.\nAlexander Goldfarb: So 2 questions. Mike, in Northern California with the city reopening and jobs coming back, are you seeing more of the renters flood back to San Francisco, the city? Or are you seeing more come back to the burbs because they want the extra space? Or what's sort of the dynamic? Just trying to see where you're seeing more of the demand as people come back to the market to the region?\nMichael Schall: Well, maybe Angela will add to that because I don't have anything that tells me on a more granular basis exactly what's happening. I do think that Suburbia has done better in virtually all cases. And the cities, the concern in the cities is both, I think I mentioned before, hoses, et cetera, but also there's more supply in the cities like, for example, almost all the supply in Los Angeles, sort of the greatest percentage supply increase in Los Angeles is in the CBD, same with San Diego and kind of same throughout. So it's really the confluence of both more supplies in the cities and the demand is maybe a little bit delayed from the suburban markets. and the suburban markets generally don't have nearly the extent of the problems that there are in the cities. So they are recovering faster and doing very well.\nAngela Kleiman: Alex, if it helps, just a few data points on what Mike just said. It's Angela here. When we're looking at the sequential met new leases, net effective new leases. The best performing are San Mateo and Santa Clara. Those are the 2 top ones. So that is evidence of the strength of the suburban Northern California.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. The second question is on the delinquencies. And Barb, I appreciate your color to one of the previous analyst questions. But how soon can you guys get aggressive and start turning tenants residents over to the credit agency starts stocking their credit reports. Just how soon can you guys take a quicker hand or quicker tougher hand? And then two, if the state is paying all these people's rents, where is the -- I mean that sounds like a big moral hazard that the people know next time they don't have to pay rent. So it's like it seems to just set up for another repeat of this. Is there any sort of guard against that? Or are we just setting ourselves up for that? I guess it's a 2-parter. One, when can you report to the credit agencies? And two, it seems to be setting up for another if the state is going to pay all this background?\nAngela Kleiman: Alex, it's Angela here. Maybe I'll start with the tenant's behavior first and like me, I want to talk about more hazard. It's a favorite topic. In terms of how aggressively we can push on that front, there are a couple of factors. One is that we still have eviction protection in place for LA and Alameda county. And so that will need to work itself out, and that's -- that goes to the legislative issues, right?  As far as our ability to collect going forward, keep in mind that the protection -- delinquency protection remain for any delinquency that occurred during the period before September 2021. So we're really talking about April delinquency. So on the new April delinquency, we can take action outside of L.A., of course, in Alameda. And so it's a whole process that involves going through evaluation of putting people and payment plans, win with our tenants on how to manage through this period of time. And so -- we do, at this point, have the ability to report to the credit agency everywhere, it's really how we want to go about it that will make the most sense to be able to maximize our collections effort.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. Mike, did you want to add?\nMichael Schall: Maybe again back to where is the delinquency. It's in LA County and Alameda County. And then the other part, which is state law statewide, which effectively says if you have a rental relief application outstanding, the courts will not hear an eviction case through June 30. And so there are still reasons why we can't do the things we would ordinarily do at this point in time. But the good news is, I think, that all of these programs appear to be getting close to their end, and then we'll pretty soon have a good idea of where we stand.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Barb, if I heard you correctly, the same-store revenue guidance increase was really 2 parts, neither of which seemed to include any change to your projections for market rents or occupancy through the balance of the year. So I was curious where market rent -- where is market rent growth year-to-date across the portfolio relative to the -- I think it was 7.7% projection you assumed for this year?\nBarb Pak: I'll take the first part, and then I'll let Mike and Angela take the second part. So in terms of the same-store guidance raise, so 50 basis points of the raise was due to delinquency, another 30 basis points was due to lower concessions and higher net effective rents and then the balance was due to higher rubs. And then in terms of where we are in terms of market rent.\nAngela Kleiman: Yes, I'm happy to cover that. It's Angela here. On the market brands, we are tracking pretty much in line in Northern California and Seattle. And keep in mind, we had anticipated that Northern California recovery would be quite strong. And so that is consistent with our expectation. Southern California is outperforming and it is tracking ahead. The -- and so we are in the middle of -- in the midst of relooking at our modeling assumptions, and we'll provide a midyear update. Having said that, keep in mind that when we're looking at leasing spreads, year-over-year leasing spreads, we will have the -- it will be the strongest in the first half because last year around this time, we still had negative leasing spreads. In fact, that negative leasing spreads weren\u2019t continued through the second quarter, we didn't turn until July. And so for those reasons, with the year-over-year comparable, we need to evaluate the magnitude of what that means.\nMichael Schall: And maybe 1 final piece, and that is we'll be looking at F '17 and our rent forecast, our economic forecast on -- and the net-net is we're ahead. And we generally don't do that every quarter, we do it biannually, so we'll be looking at that for next quarter.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Yes. All very helpful. And just to clarify, Barb, on the 35 basis points, you mentioned a couple of items there, but I thought I heard you say in the prepared remarks that was mainly driven by first quarter performance. And so not necessarily that you've assumed that the -- even though it's decelerating in the back half of the year, but that growth will be higher than what was assumed in your original projection. Is that correct?\nBarb Pak: I said it was driven by, yes, strong first quarter results and then better net delinquency collection. So we -- like I said, we factored in 30 basis points improvement in concessions and higher net effective rents for our full year guidance and then 50 basis points on delinquency. Those are the bulk of the same-store guidance rates.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then, Mike, you've provided a lot of data points on the demand to supply ratio and set up for the recovery on the West Coast and how these markets have historically outperformed in an upturn. But obviously, we're amidst sort of some crosscurrents today and concerns about a recession on the horizon. So just curious how that impacts your view about the trajectory of the recovery on the West Coast.\nMichael Schall: Well, I will -- I'll start by citing the fearful of Barb comment that we already noted, but we feel good about conditions and where we stand. So we are just recovering the things that were shut down during the pandemic now that, again, all of the mass mandates most of them have been removed, and it feels like we're in a better state. I think that that's most of it. And it feels like we have a lot of catching up to do. And we're at the front end of that process, we\u2019re obviously late to the dance and -- but we feel good about where we stand and expect to continue to perform well.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.\nJohn Kim: Just wanted to ask for an update on where you're sitting at renewals for May and June? And what's your ability to achieve renewal rates that may approach the new lease growth rate of 22%?\nBarb Pak: So on the -- you're asking about the renewals that we're setting out for the second quarter, right? I just want to clarify.\nJohn Kim: Correct.\nBarb Pak: Okay. I assume, yes. Okay. So on the renewals, company-wide, we're setting at about -- slightly above 11%. And the distribution is actually not a huge variance. SoCal at about 10.5%, and Northern California, close to 12% and Seattle close to 13%. So those are the averages. In terms of our confidence level, given where we're seeing the activities and the demand, we are quite confident that these are achievable rates.\nJohn Kim: So if that continues in the second quarter, what's implied in your guidance of 8.6% same-store revenue for the second half of the year? I know, Angela, you mentioned that there are tougher comps that you're approaching. But at the same time, the loss lease went up to 9.5%. You have the market rent forecast of 7.7%. What do you -- what do you expect to happen in the third and fourth quarter?\nBarb Pak: Right. No, that's a good question. So first quarter, our same-store was 6.5%. We do expect that to gradually increase from a revenue perspective because that is -- essentially there's a lag effect, right, between revenues and economic grants. So as market rents taper off, the revenues is falling, but it's continued to increase. So there's that catch-up effect.\nJohn Kim: And so what's implied in your guidance currently for the back half of the year?\nBarb Pak: In terms of rent growth or I'm trying to understand what you're asking for. I don't have that in front of -- effective lease growth, I don't have that in front of me. I have to follow up with you after. It's consistent though we haven't changed our full year outlook on F '17 in terms of market rent growth. So there hasn't been a change to that assumption as of right now. We're revisiting that.\nMichael Schall: And John maybe -- John, as it relates to F '17, keep in mind that if we get it sooner, it doesn't necessarily mean that we're going to get what we got sooner. And in addition, we're going to get what we thought we're going to get. So there could be just -- it happened faster than we thought. And so keep that in mind. That's why we want to make sure that we wait for kind of a full review of F-17 before we start kicking it apart, if that makes sense.\nJohn Kim: It does.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.\nNick Yulico: I just wanted to go back to the delinquency number. The $76 million, which is the cumulative number. And I know previously, I didn't see an update on this, but in terms of the reimbursement that you've already applied for and haven't received that number back in March was, I think, $59 million. Is that still the number? Did that change?\nBarb Pak: Nick, it's Barb. So that number is $64 million as of last week of which half relates to our current residents and half relates to landlord initiated applications on behalf of past residents. And that the latter group is the one that the resident -- the former resident has to engage, which is obviously more uncertain of how we'll be able to collect that.\nNick Yulico: Okay. Helpful. And then in terms of the guidance then, how should we think about that $64 million. Is any of that factored into full year guidance collecting that money?\nBarb Pak: Yes. What's implied is effectively the first group, the resident, the current resident applications. We have high confidence we'll get the vast majority of that. Given the programs now ended in terms of applying for new applications, we think that, that will come in this year.\nNick Yulico: Okay. So about half of it\u2026\nBarb Pak: Yes. It won't all be same store, though because that's for our total portfolio, including joint venture properties. And so a portion of that will be same-store.\nNick Yulico: Okay. But about half of it we should think about. And then because I know the number is like over $1 of FFO per share. So we should think about half of that is in the full year guidance this year and maybe half could flow in still or maybe next year depending on that pace?\nBarb Pak: Right. The other half is uncertain, and we're seeking alternative ways to recoup that money, but the timing is very uncertain on that.\nOperator: Next question is coming from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.\nBradHeffern: Yes. So in the prepared comments, you mentioned the 3 co-investments that are expected to be paid off in '23 now versus 2022 previously. Is that a headwind that's just moving to 2023? Or does the overall macro environment lead to fewer redemptions and better reinvestment opportunities overall and that some of the headwinds that we've seen lately are abating?\nBarb Pak: Brad, this is Barb. So the 3 investments that were pushed, it's really a function of the interest rate environment today and where these properties are going to be in lease up. Keep in mind, in 2021 given the low interest rate environment, developers were able to get takeout financing before they were fully leased up. And given the higher interest rate environment and debt service coverage ratios, we don't see that happening anymore. And so that's really a function of what caused those to be pushed. Nothing -- the properties aren't behind on schedule or anything like that. It's just a change in the environment that's occurred from an interest rate perspective.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. And are you seeing any additional reinvestment opportunities, just given I imagine the financing side of things is more difficult now than it was a few months ago?\nMichael Schall: Brad, we -- I think that we will see more. Again, we have this lag after COVID when construction starts turned downward, and I suspect that we will see a lot of those deals come back and that will create more demand for the food equity program. So I think that will right -- that's in the process of rightsizing itself as well.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Rich Anderson with SMBC.\nRichAnderson: Mike, I don't know if you remember, a long time ago, I talked to you about a mood ring. Do you remember that conversation?\nMichael Schall: I do, as a matter of fact.\nRich Anderson: I want to ask about your near-term mood ring for San Francisco in a little -- or Bay Area in a little bit different format. Given S-17, I know you're going to update it, but right now, it's the leader. Northern California is the leader in terms of market rent growth. We've gone through that ad nauseam to this point. But you also reported quarter, same-store revenue in Northern California was the laggard of the 3 regions. Should we sort of extrapolate what you're thinking rent -- market rent growth wise, into your portfolio, shouldn't this just flip in the coming quarters in terms of the composition of store revenue growth in 2022 where Northern California should really become the leader in the back half relative to the other regions? Or am I thinking about that wrong?\nMichael Schall: Well, Angela will maybe have some comments. But to your mood ring thing. So I actually -- because of you know what a mood ring is and I have different colors that I have in my mind because of you, Rich. So I never forget. Red would have to be the right color for us. I mean, I think that we feel good, energized, et cetera. And --\nRich Anderson: No Red is the wrong color. You would think blue, black --\nMichael Schall: Parting to my mood ring thing, energize is red and excited and adventurous are red. So all that you feel -- I have the wrong mood ring app, I guess. So -- but no, we -- I think we're feeling good about things. And Northern California long term is our #1 market. I think it's the #1 market in America. In terms of long-term CAGRs rent growth, it's fallen well behind the curve in this case. And in this world because rents are always tethered at some level to income levels, it's really important that they move together. And we -- on the income side, we're still seeing some recovery happening there.  So I don't think you could just grow forever unless incomes are growing very rapidly. And 1 number that I was told by the group here is that our income and our -- our move-ins are up something like 15%, which is pretty darn good. It makes us feel better about the rents that we're charging, especially in Southern California. So things look good. I expect Northern California to really pick it up here, and it will become -- once again, as it has for the long term, our #1 market is what I would guess.\nAngela Kleiman: And Rich, it's Angela here. Thanks for making my point for me, which is that in the second half, we do see that flip. We do see Northern California rent growth will then outperform Southern California rent growth.\nRich Anderson: Okay. And then second question for me is -- we talk a lot about services coming back in restaurants and hotels and all that, but also reemployment or the reuse of office buildings with tech. Is it not true that hybrid office would be a better model for you rather than 5 days a week only because where you guys are located, primarily outside of San Francisco. So maybe a 2- or 3-day a week type of model would be good for your portfolio relatively speaking because people might be able to put up with a longer commute for a variety of reasons in that area, but just because they don't have to go into the office every single day. Is that the right way to think of it? Or is there any kind of return to office work for you and you're not going to really kind of dig into too much more of the detail beyond that?\nMichael Schall: Yes. No, I think you're thinking about it the right way. I think that because of the hybrid workforce. And I think everyone, including the tech workers and actually Essex as a company, most of them are pursuing a hybrid model of some kind that requires some tethering to an office. And we're actually no different from that, obviously.  And so I think what the effect of that is, is that it makes the downtowns, which have all the office buildings, a little less desirable. And it probably adds -- and we've talked about this before, another ring, let's say, another 10 miles out from where we would have drawn our line because our portfolio is planned around the key job nodes and a commute pattern to those job nodes. So now we will expand that a bit. And a good example is we've been buying in San Diego County, some of the areas that are farther from the major job nodes. And -- but that will be true of Northern California and Seattle as well. So I think it does push out the commutable space and therefore, it expands our geography accordingly.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street.\nJohn Pawlowski: And just one question, and I'll let somebody else jump on. The revenue-enhancing CapEx spend this year, $100 million is a big number. Can you just remind us what are the drivers? What are you actually spending money on? And then how do you kind of expected returns, IRRs compare versus alternatives, either buying real estate or buy back stock?\nAngela Kleiman: Sure. I'll talk about the CapEx program first and -- as far as the redevelopment spend and also just the forward CapEx spend. On the redevelopment side, we are targeting 8% to 10% cash on cash yield, and this is consistent with pre-COVID levels. And it's primarily because we're seeing the demand in our market and the rent growth to support this program. Now the elevated level that you may be referring to when it comes to the CapEx per door, I think that's what you're referring to itself, it's really driven by 2 factors. One is, of course, the material cost increase, but the other 1 is a catch-up. And so during the COVID period, we, of course, were very careful and ran much leaner from a CapEx perspective, both in terms of just trying to minimize contact and also being sensitive to what we can achieve on the top line. And because of that, our normal CapEx per door of somewhere around 1,750 dropped down to almost below $1,400. And so that -- there's a catch-up that just needs to happen normally.\nBarb Pak: And then, John, this is Bob. In terms of where to put capital, obviously, redevelopment of the 8% to 10% returns are obviously our best use of cash proceeds today relative to buying an asset in the mid-3s or even buying back the stock. So it's just hard to put a lot of money to work. Remember, you're you've got an occupied building and you can only put so many dollars to work. So there's a capital constraint on how much we can put to work there, but we think that is the best alternative source of capital outside of preferred equity, which we've already discussed in the past.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Neil Malkin with Capital One Securities.\nNeil Malkin: Now it's gone a little over narrow, so I'll be quick. First one, on the the RET fund, the one the climate change funds. Just curious about how you guys when you're talking about that with you either board or internally in investment committees, I guess what are you guys trying to achieve given that China and India are by far the biggest polluters and emitters of carbon in the world?\nMichael Schall: It's a good comment, and I'm not going to make any comments about China or India. But I would say that, again, we saw -- as I mentioned earlier, we see good opportunities to invest in our own portfolio and make it better. And by better, I mean, produce a return on investment that makes sense. And we see the cost of electricity, trash removal, water issues et cetera, as being longer-term issues for all of us. And if we can solve some of those issues and get a payback by lowering our bills, et cetera, thdn so be it, we think it makes good sense. And initially, we had -- I know RET Ventures was thinking about that as part of their existing fund and, in fact, had made a number of investments out of their main fund in ESG. And a couple of them are super important One of them is we have SEC requirements. So a company called measurable was one of the RET investments before this new fund. And it helps us organize our data and getting ready for the SEC requirements that are coming down the road. So there are a lot of important reasons when we should be doing this, and we see a lot of opportunity out there. And it's not just investing money, it's actually getting a return on your investment.\nNeil Malkin: Appreciate that, Mike. Last 1 real quick, maybe Adam, for you or anyone really, but your stock price is pretty much right around all-time high. I know that this typical model is stock price up, issue equity and buy stuff, stock price down, sell assets, JV stuff. Maybe just talk about the -- I think maybe some I touched on it before, the acquisition pipeline around in your market, potentially maybe some suburban locations, et cetera. Has that picked up recently, just kind of the things you're looking at? And or potentially maybe in the West Coast. Any commentary on how you think the rest of the year is going to shake out on the acquisition side, obviously, in the face of higher debt costs?\nAdam Berry: Sure. Neil, this is Adam. As to what's going to come later in the year, it's hard to say. Over the end of Q4 and early Q1, the volume generally on the market was pretty low. There's a pretty significant decline in overall transaction volume quarter-over-quarter. There is quite a bit on the market today. As I noted before, over the last 6 to 9 months, we really didn't partake in the frenzy that was happening in those best and best final rounds. We're always constantly assessing what's on the market and where we see more growth going forward. And so we're looking at those deals. We're not going to be in the low 3s. And so if there's any sort of adjustment or if we see an opportunity that comes up, and we did see a few of those that we closed on in early Q4 and early this quarter, then we will jump into those windows.\nNeil Malkin: Okay. So it just seems like it's going to be a little bit harder to kind of do the types of things you did maybe in years past when your stock price was up, and you're heavily acquisitive. It seems like that's maybe have a little tougher hurdle now just given cap rates and overall cost of capital. Is that fair?\nMichael Schall: Yes, that's fair. I mean if you take the cap rates that Adam was talking about and you compare it to the company, you've climbed to the company, you will find that issuing stock is something we really shouldn't do. And so we have not done that and try to use our co-investment platform to fund most of the deals. And obviously, having positive leverage, i.e., cap rates over debt cost was a -- it helps a lot when it comes to deal making. And so we're no longer in that world. And so there's a bit of an impediment on the deal side caused by negative leverage once again.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Chandni Luthra Newton with Goldman Sachs.\nChandni Luthra: If you could perhaps give some more insight into the connections operating model, I know you have it lined up to be rolled out fully across the portfolio by the end of 2022. And then I think you have the digital platform improvement next year. So is there a way to quantify in margin or cost benefits? And then how do you think of all that sort of culminating together from a timing standpoint?\nAngela Kleiman: It's Angela here. I think you're asking about how we look at or how we evaluate the success of our property collections operating model.\nChandni Luthra: Exactly. From a number standpoint, I know you've given that ratio of 45 to 1from 40, which is very helpful. But how does that data translate into the P&L down the line? What sort of could you benefit as you think about running our models?\nAngela Kleiman: Sure, sure. So we think about the benefit in 3 key ways. First is our customer interactions. And we can look at that by the retention rate. And the second one is operating efficiency, and that is the 40:1 ratio that I talked about that we now improved to 43:1 in terms of units to employ. And ultimately, what that means for the financial impact, and that's the third key metric.  And so when I refer to the 100 to 200 basis points of margin improvement, when we implemented San Diego and Orange County, that translated to about $15 million of benefit to NOI, and we have realized that savings when we were only about 1/3 way through our implementation back then. So the expectation is that going forward, once we complete the rollout -- now keep in mind, we also have a digital platform rollout that's embedded in all of the cost savings. But upon completion, and this is several years out, we would expect an additional 200 to 300 basis points of margin improvement. The trick here is -- or the challenge is trying to figure out, it's not a dollar for dollar because when we -- when I talked about the $15 million things, we were not under such extreme inflationary pressure today. And so there will be offsets, which will go towards helping us to manage our controllable expenses.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Just wanted to follow back on the delinquencies. You -- I just want to understand something. The rent payments that the state is making for the $76 million, is the state making all of that or the half of that? I think it's half of that, that you mentioned by former residents that you said those residents have to initiate, is that -- it sounds like the whole $76 million may not get paid back. It sounds like only the existing residents get paid by the state. Otherwise, the former residents have to do it on their own. Is that the correct understanding? Or did I misunderstand?\nBarb Pak: Alex, it's Barb. So the total that we've applied for is $64 million as of today, the cumulative delinquency that Mike alluded to is $76 million. So there is a delta there. And then of the $64 million in applications, it's made up of 2 components: our existing residents, which is half and then past residents. Now we've applied on behalf of those past residents. Those past residents have to engage in the process for us to get our money. If they don't engage then the application doesn't move forward. And that's why I'm saying it's a little bit uncertain in terms of whether the past resident will engage and whether we'll collect that portion of the emergency rental assistance.\nAlexander Goldfarb: And what's the incentive for them to engage?\nMichael Schall: They get their rent paid. Keep in mind, Alex, we can't -- the landlord -- this is not a landlord program, it's a tenant program. And they have to have a COVID-related hardship. So they have to certify as to the hardship basically. And so we can't do it by ourselves. So -- but it's really their reimbursement paying us off and their incentive ends, they're going to owe some money if they don't process the application.\nAngela Kleiman: Yes. Alex, it's Angela here. And that includes the impact to their credit report we can, and we actually have reported on our past residents. But also, there are other means for us to try to connect with them, which is we can go through small claims court. There are other means. And so it is actually to their benefit to engage with us and get this assistance from the state.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to management for any closing comments.\nMichael Schall: Okay. Thank you. And thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. We are looking forward to NAREIT, and hopefully, we will see many of you there. Have a great day. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Schall",
            "content": "Thank you for joining us today, and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. Angela Kleiman and Barb Pak will follow me with prepared remarks and Adam Berry is here for Q&A.  Today, I will comment on our first quarter results recent housing demand and supply trends and a brief overview of the apartment transaction market. We are pleased to announce our fourth consecutive quarter of improving core FFO per share and same-store revenue growth with this quarter's core FFO exceeding our guidance midpoint by $0.07 per share. As mentioned in our earnings release, our results and rent growth trajectory support an increase in core FFO and same-property revenue guidance for the year, which Barb will review shortly. Overall, rents have continued to improve. And as of April 2022, net effective rents in the Essex markets are now 11.4% above pre-COVID rent levels and up 22% compared to one year ago. All of our markets have positive sequential rent growth with Northern California leading the portfolio, improving sequentially by approximately 3% in each month of the first quarter. We expect further improvement in Northern California as progress is made on return to office programs for the large technology companies following several COVID-related delays. The top tech companies also continue to hire rapidly in the Essex markets with over 50,000 job openings posted for California and Washington, a 79% increase compared to March of 2020. Other indicators, including job growth, venture capital deployment and office investment continue to support our thesis that Northern California will remain the epicenter of the technology industries. A significant recent example came from Google, which announced a plan to invest more than $3.5 billion on additional office and data centers in Mountain View, Downtown San Jose and elsewhere across the Bay Area. The easing of COVID-related regulation has been pivotal for return to office in our markets. mask mandates have been significantly relaxed versus prior quarters making it easier to bring employees back to the office. Business travel, in-person meetings, property tours and conferences have resumed, and we look forward to in-person investor meetings once again. As COVID-related regulations continue to subside on the West Coast, the deadline to apply for rental relief in California has now passed as of April 1. The Government-sponsored rental relief has been a double-edged sword for California apartment owners as tenants were often encouraged to see government rental relief programs rather than paying rent. Delays in government reimbursements led to the highest delinquency since the onset of the pandemic, with the rental relief program now closed to new applications in California, we are now cautiously optimistic that underlying delinquency trends will improve. California's rental assistance program remains far behind with respect to payments providing potential upside as we continue pursuing the approximately $76 million of rent owed to the company. Given the extraordinary government restrictions during the pandemic, it became clear that our portfolio would need to achieve 2 inflection points before we could be confident that a full recovery was underway. The first was the reopening of our markets, which occurred in July of 2021 and the second was a return to office for the largest technology companies. Over the past 2 months, we've seen Google, Microsoft, Meta and Apple all begin to reopen and restaff their offices. Our leasing specialists are reporting more applicants returning from out-of-state as hybrid and similar arrangements require regular office attendance for employees. Return to office mandates are generating economic activities, which is apparent in the job growth reports with San Francisco leading our portfolio with 8.9% trailing 3-month job growth. On average, the Essex markets reported job growth of 6.7% on a trailing 3-month basis versus the broader U.S. average of 4.7% and marking the second consecutive quarter that Essex markets have outpaced the nation in job growth. We expect this outperformance will continue as Essex has still only recovered 83% of the jobs compared to pre-covid levels versus the U.S. recovery of 95%.  We expect service and hospitality-related jobs to continue a strong growth trajectory supported by increased travel generally and demand for services from the well-paid workforce on the West Coast. The confluence of increasing job growth, a lower unemployment rate of 3.6% in the Essex markets and expensive for sale housing all contribute to favorable rental housing tailwinds. Turning to housing supply. The ability to ramp up housing production is more challenging along the West Coast as a result of long entitlement processes, burdensome regulations labor shortages and inflating construction cost. As a result, housing permits in Essex markets remain at levels roughly consistent with our long-term averages. Our bottoms-up supply analysis indicates that new deliveries will moderate for the rest of 2022, and we are also expecting a 15% decline in apartment supply in 2023 and which includes a 54% reduction in new supply expected in Northern California. All of our markets remain on the lower end of the supply growth spectrum versus other U.S. metros. Turning to the apartment investment markets. Geopolitical events, turbulent financial market conditions and high levels of inflation create uncertainty, which may become a headwind for transactions. However, cap rates generally don't move quickly and are mostly a function of investor demand for property. As to the West Coast specifically, strong evidence of recovering apartment market conditions, higher inflationary growth expectations and significant capital pursuing apartments appear to have mostly offset the impact of higher interest cost keeping cap rates unchanged at this point. Our review of cap rates for recent apartment transactions across the Essex markets indicate most institutional quality assets trading in the mid-3% range for stabilized properties with little deviation across markets, building class and location. We will continue to be selective with our capital allocation strategy, focusing on deals that have the best growth potential and generate accretion to our financial benchmarks. In closing, I'd like to briefly highlight the importance of ESG and its impact on the company. As a leading provider of housing along the West Coast, we know that our company has a responsibility to operate in an environmentally conscious way Consistent with that thesis, we recently released our TCFD report, which is the first step toward alignment with proposed SEC reporting requirements. Last week, we announced that Essex will co-anchor an ESG housing Impact Fund managed by RET Ventures. Finally, we are also pleased to announce the upcoming publication of our fourth CSR report which should be available in early May.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Angela Kleiman. About what I missed that. Solar panels. Okay. I mean They hold the CSR effort I'll just make a couple of quick comments, and then we'll move on from there. We have actually, for over 10 years now been had our own, what we call resource management group. So we've got pretty long history of pursuing things that we thought were good for our properties, good for values and create more efficient ways of doing things. So our CSR efforts have been -- they're nothing new, and they've been part of our past. And -- but I would say, as we think about California especially, there's a mandate here to remove gas cars by 2035. There are other mandates, as you all know, and they keep us focused on that. I think that there is a strong intersection between opportunity to add value to the portfolio many of these ESG efforts, and you mentioned one of them, which is solar panels, but it goes well beyond that. electronic vehicle charging stations, et cetera, part of the mandate as well. So we're excited about it. We were excited to announce our co anchoring of that new fund that sponsored by RET ventures. And I think it's consistent with our path and the way we think about ESG. Nick, it's Mike, and maybe Angela will want to make a comment. And by the way, FeraBar runs higher I make that comment. But really, it's I think, opening up a number of different things. The normal migration pattern typically has retirees with expensive California homes leading as you enter into a recessionary period, we certainly saw that. And then normally, that's -- those retiring workers moving out of California are replaced by younger workers that are coming into California to take higher-paying jobs and some of the opportunities for the tech company. So the younger workers were largely told to stay put until the tech company has opened up. And so now we are starting to see them return. In addition to that, there are some foreign migration that has picked up also, and we're starting to see more demand for corporate housing units as these big tech companies in terms of their training and onboarding activities. There's definitely a pickup in demand from corporate house for corporate housing. So it's really across the board. We're seeing more normalization of our activities, and they're coming from a number of different areas. Steve, let me throw out one other set of numbers. And that is we're owed $76 million. I think that was in my script, of which we booked, I believe, $4 billion of that as revenue or accounts receivable. So we have a long way to go, a lot of collections, potential collections out there. We just don't know when or how much, given the -- most of it comes from the state rental relief program, and it is impossible for us to predict when that's going to come in. Yes, Steve. I mean, I'm going to turn that over to Adam here in a second, but I will say that in the recent past, we press released a couple of development deals, one in Seattle and one in Northern California. And that doesn't speak to our pipeline. So with that, I'll turn it over to Adam to talk about development.\nA \u2013Adam Berry: Steve, we're seeing we're not seeing a huge increase in deals coming out on the development side. Those that we've seen to trade in the Bay Area the per ore price has definitely gone up. They are generally solving to a low 4 cap, which that does not provide the spread that we need in order to justify risk associated with development deals. We probably have seen more tertiary markets, increase their potential for new development deals. And that really hasn't been as much our focus either. So generally, we have \u2013 as Mike mentioned, we press released a deal last year in the Bay Area. We have a couple in the pipeline that we're working through. But we are staying selective and disciplined as to what kind of spread necessary for these deals.\nA \u2013Michael Schall: One additional note, what Adam talks about a 4 cap, he's saying today, that's untrended for cap. So we compare an acquisition yield today against a development yield today. So it's not trended just a flat. Jeff, actually, these numbers didn't change a lot from last quarter. And that overall reduction in 2023 was minus 15%, made up of minus 54% and in the Bay Area. So a pretty flat in Southern California and up a little bit in Seattle. So I think what's happened here is that in the early phases of COVID, people pulled back on development. And so we're starting to see the impact of that. Now couple of years later. And so I think that there will be a low period for development starts and then we'll see what happens in the further along in the cycle. But in my prepared remarks, I noted that the deliveries, we've actually had the peak deliveries in Q1, Q2 '22. So they moderate little bit toward the end of -- for the rest of the year, the last -- the next 6 months and then next year, again, down 15%. So the trajectory. And we do our own fundamental analysis on this. So we actually have people look at deals and see where they stand. And so we're accurate than some of the other data that you see out there, not that some of these can't change their construction delays, et cetera, that happen. But I think our numbers are spot on with respect to what's coming at us. Well, my initial thought goes back to the first chapter of COVID, which the city is basically shut down. They shut down all the restaurants, they shut down hotels, all the leisure, all the service jobs are pretty much eliminated. And so if you're one of those people who generally is not a high wage earner, what are you going to do? You just lost your job and you don't have any certainty about getting another one because basically everything is shut down in the city. So those people all left. And so now what you're starting to see is the demand for those services really didn't change all that much, but you got to bring all those workers back in order to reengage in those businesses. And so I think that's what's happening. So this was not a voluntary choice, people had to stay in the cities and pursue their livelihood, they were effectively forced out. So as the cities recover and again, we have some concerns about the is given defund the police movements, et cetera, homelessness. And -- but as the cities recover, we think that there's good upside. And it's entirely due to real demand for travel, for services, for restaurants, for hotels, et cetera. So we don't view it as artificial at all. We view it as a policy choice largely that caused the deep hole, and now, we're just recovering to a natural place. Well, maybe Angela will add to that because I don't have anything that tells me on a more granular basis exactly what's happening. I do think that Suburbia has done better in virtually all cases. And the cities, the concern in the cities is both, I think I mentioned before, hoses, et cetera, but also there's more supply in the cities like, for example, almost all the supply in Los Angeles, sort of the greatest percentage supply increase in Los Angeles is in the CBD, same with San Diego and kind of same throughout. So it's really the confluence of both more supplies in the cities and the demand is maybe a little bit delayed from the suburban markets. and the suburban markets generally don't have nearly the extent of the problems that there are in the cities. So they are recovering faster and doing very well. Maybe again back to where is the delinquency. It's in LA County and Alameda County. And then the other part, which is state law statewide, which effectively says if you have a rental relief application outstanding, the courts will not hear an eviction case through June 30. And so there are still reasons why we can't do the things we would ordinarily do at this point in time. But the good news is, I think, that all of these programs appear to be getting close to their end, and then we'll pretty soon have a good idea of where we stand. And maybe 1 final piece, and that is we'll be looking at F '17 and our rent forecast, our economic forecast on -- and the net-net is we're ahead. And we generally don't do that every quarter, we do it biannually, so we'll be looking at that for next quarter. Well, I will -- I'll start by citing the fearful of Barb comment that we already noted, but we feel good about conditions and where we stand. So we are just recovering the things that were shut down during the pandemic now that, again, all of the mass mandates most of them have been removed, and it feels like we're in a better state. I think that that's most of it. And it feels like we have a lot of catching up to do. And we're at the front end of that process, we're obviously late to the dance and -- but we feel good about where we stand and expect to continue to perform well. And John maybe -- John, as it relates to F '17, keep in mind that if we get it sooner, it doesn't necessarily mean that we're going to get what we got sooner. And in addition, we're going to get what we thought we're going to get. So there could be just -- it happened faster than we thought. And so keep that in mind. That's why we want to make sure that we wait for kind of a full review of F-17 before we start kicking it apart, if that makes sense. Brad, we -- I think that we will see more. Again, we have this lag after COVID when construction starts turned downward, and I suspect that we will see a lot of those deals come back and that will create more demand for the food equity program. So I think that will right -- that's in the process of rightsizing itself as well. I do, as a matter of fact. Well, Angela will maybe have some comments. But to your mood ring thing. So I actually -- because of you know what a mood ring is and I have different colors that I have in my mind because of you, Rich. So I never forget. Red would have to be the right color for us. I mean, I think that we feel good, energized, et cetera. And -- Parting to my mood ring thing, energize is red and excited and adventurous are red. So all that you feel -- I have the wrong mood ring app, I guess. So -- but no, we -- I think we're feeling good about things. And Northern California long term is our #1 market. I think it's the #1 market in America. In terms of long-term CAGRs rent growth, it's fallen well behind the curve in this case. And in this world because rents are always tethered at some level to income levels, it's really important that they move together. And we -- on the income side, we're still seeing some recovery happening there.  So I don't think you could just grow forever unless incomes are growing very rapidly. And 1 number that I was told by the group here is that our income and our -- our move-ins are up something like 15%, which is pretty darn good. It makes us feel better about the rents that we're charging, especially in Southern California. So things look good. I expect Northern California to really pick it up here, and it will become -- once again, as it has for the long term, our #1 market is what I would guess. Yes. No, I think you're thinking about it the right way. I think that because of the hybrid workforce. And I think everyone, including the tech workers and actually Essex as a company, most of them are pursuing a hybrid model of some kind that requires some tethering to an office. And we're actually no different from that, obviously.  And so I think what the effect of that is, is that it makes the downtowns, which have all the office buildings, a little less desirable. And it probably adds -- and we've talked about this before, another ring, let's say, another 10 miles out from where we would have drawn our line because our portfolio is planned around the key job nodes and a commute pattern to those job nodes. So now we will expand that a bit. And a good example is we've been buying in San Diego County, some of the areas that are farther from the major job nodes. And -- but that will be true of Northern California and Seattle as well. So I think it does push out the commutable space and therefore, it expands our geography accordingly. It's a good comment, and I'm not going to make any comments about China or India. But I would say that, again, we saw -- as I mentioned earlier, we see good opportunities to invest in our own portfolio and make it better. And by better, I mean, produce a return on investment that makes sense. And we see the cost of electricity, trash removal, water issues et cetera, as being longer-term issues for all of us. And if we can solve some of those issues and get a payback by lowering our bills, et cetera, thdn so be it, we think it makes good sense. And initially, we had -- I know RET Ventures was thinking about that as part of their existing fund and, in fact, had made a number of investments out of their main fund in ESG. And a couple of them are super important One of them is we have SEC requirements. So a company called measurable was one of the RET investments before this new fund. And it helps us organize our data and getting ready for the SEC requirements that are coming down the road. So there are a lot of important reasons when we should be doing this, and we see a lot of opportunity out there. And it's not just investing money, it's actually getting a return on your investment. Yes, that's fair. I mean if you take the cap rates that Adam was talking about and you compare it to the company, you've climbed to the company, you will find that issuing stock is something we really shouldn't do. And so we have not done that and try to use our co-investment platform to fund most of the deals. And obviously, having positive leverage, i.e., cap rates over debt cost was a -- it helps a lot when it comes to deal making. And so we're no longer in that world. And so there's a bit of an impediment on the deal side caused by negative leverage once again. They get their rent paid. Keep in mind, Alex, we can't -- the landlord -- this is not a landlord program, it's a tenant program. And they have to have a COVID-related hardship. So they have to certify as to the hardship basically. And so we can't do it by ourselves. So -- but it's really their reimbursement paying us off and their incentive ends, they're going to owe some money if they don't process the application. Okay. Thank you. And thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. We are looking forward to NAREIT, and hopefully, we will see many of you there. Have a great day. Thank you."

            "name": "Barb Pak",
            "content": "Thanks, Angela. I'll start with a few comments on our first quarter results, discuss changes to our full year guidance followed by an update on co-investment activity and the balance sheet. I'm pleased to report core FFO for the first quarter exceeded our expectations. The favorable outcome was due to strong operating results and higher co-investment income. For the full year, we are raising the midpoint of core FFO by $0.25 per share to $13.95. The increase is driven by 2 factors: First, we are raising the midpoint of our same-property revenue growth by 85 basis points to 8.6% on a cash basis. This is driven by our solid first quarter operating results and an improvement in our net delinquency expectations for the year. Our revised guidance now assumes net delinquency of 1.9% of scheduled rent as compared to our original guidance of 2.4% at the midpoint. As Mike mentioned, the deadline for applying for federal tenant relief passed on April 1. We believe this has led to an improvement in our residents paying current, while at the same time, we have also seen an increase in emergency rental assistance over the past 2 months. As such, our April net delinquencies were 20 basis points of scheduled rent which is below our historical average of 35 basis points. While this is encouraging, underlying gross delinquencies were about 5% in April and thus, we still need to make progress before we can confidently put COVID-related delinquencies behind us.  A second factor in our improved core FFO guidance range relates to preferred equity investment as we are now expecting approximately $250 million of redemptions compared to our initial midpoint of $350 million. The reduction in redemptions relates to 3 investments that we now anticipate being paid off in 2023. Turning to our co-investment platform. We recently monetized the promote income within 2 ventures unlocking embedded value for our shareholders. In the first quarter, we amended our WESCO joint venture, realizing $17 million of promote income, which was paid in cash. The venture generated a 16% IRR for Essex shareholders. Subsequent to quarter end, we amended our WESCO 4 joint venture earning $37 million of promote income, which was elected to reinvest back into the venture and increase our ownership to 65%. This venture achieved a 22% IRR. These 2 transactions are expected to create over $2 million in additional core FFO on an annual basis. Overall, our private equity platform continues to create value for our investors and remains an important alternative source of capital.  Finally, turning to the balance sheet. In the first quarter, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio improved to 6.1x compared to 6.6x at the depth of the pandemic. we expect this ratio will continue to improve throughout 2022, driven by stronger operating results. with over $1 billion of liquidity, limited near-term funding needs and multiple sources of capital available to us, we remain in a strong financial position. That concludes my prepared remarks.  And I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions. Steve, yes, that's a great question. So what I was alluding to in our guidance, we've assumed 1.9% scheduled rent, and that's on a net delinquency basis. So that would be after emergency rental assistance. That's for the full year, which implies 2% in the back half of the year. And that would compare to the in the first quarter in terms of net delinquencies on a cash basis. And then the other number I provided was the 5% on gross because we do still have high underlying gross delinquencies. We're working through those. And we have seen a positive change over the last couple of months. For example, in January, February, we're at 6.5%, and we've come down to 5%. And we believe that part of that is a function of the change in the law that occurred in April. That said, we still have a lot of work to do there, and we've only seen 1 month of data. So our guidance doesn't assume that, that materially changes from here, especially with Alameda and LA County where Avicion protections remain in place. So the combination of emergency rental assistance and gross delinquencies kind of gets us to our net 1.9% for the full year. It would be less than 1%. Because remember, our net delinquencies were 35 basis points historically. So our gross delinquencies were less than 1%. And on average. So the 5% is definitely very high. I'll take the first part, and then I'll let Mike and Angela take the second part. So in terms of the same-store guidance raise, so 50 basis points of the raise was due to delinquency, another 30 basis points was due to lower concessions and higher net effective rents and then the balance was due to higher rubs. And then in terms of where we are in terms of market rent. I said it was driven by, yes, strong first quarter results and then better net delinquency collection. So we -- like I said, we factored in 30 basis points improvement in concessions and higher net effective rents for our full year guidance and then 50 basis points on delinquency. Those are the bulk of the same-store guidance rates. So on the -- you're asking about the renewals that we're setting out for the second quarter, right? I just want to clarify. Okay. I assume, yes. Okay. So on the renewals, company-wide, we're setting at about -- slightly above 11%. And the distribution is actually not a huge variance. SoCal at about 10.5%, and Northern California, close to 12% and Seattle close to 13%. So those are the averages. In terms of our confidence level, given where we're seeing the activities and the demand, we are quite confident that these are achievable rates. Right. No, that's a good question. So first quarter, our same-store was 6.5%. We do expect that to gradually increase from a revenue perspective because that is -- essentially there's a lag effect, right, between revenues and economic grants. So as market rents taper off, the revenues is falling, but it's continued to increase. So there's that catch-up effect. In terms of rent growth or I'm trying to understand what you're asking for. I don't have that in front of -- effective lease growth, I don't have that in front of me. I have to follow up with you after. It's consistent though we haven't changed our full year outlook on F '17 in terms of market rent growth. So there hasn't been a change to that assumption as of right now. We're revisiting that. Nick, it's Barb. So that number is $64 million as of last week of which half relates to our current residents and half relates to landlord initiated applications on behalf of past residents. And that the latter group is the one that the resident -- the former resident has to engage, which is obviously more uncertain of how we'll be able to collect that. Yes. What's implied is effectively the first group, the resident, the current resident applications. We have high confidence we'll get the vast majority of that. Given the programs now ended in terms of applying for new applications, we think that, that will come in this year. Yes. It won't all be same store, though because that's for our total portfolio, including joint venture properties. And so a portion of that will be same-store. Right. The other half is uncertain, and we're seeking alternative ways to recoup that money, but the timing is very uncertain on that. Brad, this is Barb. So the 3 investments that were pushed, it's really a function of the interest rate environment today and where these properties are going to be in lease up. Keep in mind, in 2021 given the low interest rate environment, developers were able to get takeout financing before they were fully leased up. And given the higher interest rate environment and debt service coverage ratios, we don't see that happening anymore. And so that's really a function of what caused those to be pushed. Nothing -- the properties aren't behind on schedule or anything like that. It's just a change in the environment that's occurred from an interest rate perspective. And then, John, this is Bob. In terms of where to put capital, obviously, redevelopment of the 8% to 10% returns are obviously our best use of cash proceeds today relative to buying an asset in the mid-3s or even buying back the stock. So it's just hard to put a lot of money to work. Remember, you're you've got an occupied building and you can only put so many dollars to work. So there's a capital constraint on how much we can put to work there, but we think that is the best alternative source of capital outside of preferred equity, which we've already discussed in the past. Alex, it's Barb. So the total that we've applied for is $64 million as of today, the cumulative delinquency that Mike alluded to is $76 million. So there is a delta there. And then of the $64 million in applications, it's made up of 2 components: our existing residents, which is half and then past residents. Now we've applied on behalf of those past residents. Those past residents have to engage in the process for us to get our money. If they don't engage then the application doesn't move forward. And that's why I'm saying it's a little bit uncertain in terms of whether the past resident will engage and whether we'll collect that portion of the emergency rental assistance."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Angela Kleiman",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. First, I would like to express my appreciation for our operations and support teams. As we have implemented new systems and structures to optimize our operations, our team has taken on these challenges in stride and continues to demonstrate exceptional work ethic and dedication to our company's success. In today's comments, I'll begin with key operational highlights on our major regions, including our outlook for 2022 rent growth and conclude with an update on the rollout of our property collections operating model. We are pleased with our first quarter operating results, especially in delivering a 6.5% same-property revenue growth on a year-over-year basis. This is primarily driven by increases in scheduled rents and improvements in concessions detailed on Page 2 of our press release. The first quarter performance exceeded our expectations and included some of our strongest leasing spreads reported in the company's history, with net effective new leases up 20% and renewals up 11.7% compared to the same period last year. Average concessions for the portfolio continues to remain minimal with April loss to lease for the same-store portfolio at 9.5%. We are well positioned heading into the summer leasing season. Here are the key operational highlights from north to south. Beginning with our Washington portfolio. Rents in the Pacific Northwest had a strong start to the year, improving sequentially each month since December.  In addition, we successfully decreased concession in downtown Seattle throughout the quarter. Our supply forecast reflects a modest rate in deliveries throughout 2022, and the Seattle job market remained strong with March average trailing 3-month growth rate of 6.1%. Moving forward, we anticipate steady performance from our Seattle region with a loss to lease in April of 7.7%. On to Northern California. As Mike mentioned earlier, rents in this region are being lifted by the return to office of large tech companies and a solid rebound in job growth. After a typical seasonal slowdown in the fourth quarter, construction usage in San Francisco and San Jose declined throughout the first quarter, leading to a steady improvement in net effective rents. Looking ahead, we expect the supply picture to remain steady for the rest of the year and on the demand side, job growth is accelerating with March average trailing 3 months growth rate of 6.7%. As Northern California is in its early stages of recovery, we are seeing a steady increase to loss to lease, which stands at 5.1% in April, and we continue to expect this region to lead our market rent growth in 2022. Turning to Southern California, which has been our best-performing market throughout the pandemic, we continue to be confident about Southern California as rents did not experience the typical seasonal decline in the fourth quarter and have continued to improve each month in the first quarter. Concessions have been below one week for almost a year. Turnover in Southern California remains at the lowest level relative to the rest of our markets, demonstrating continued strength and stability of this region. For 2022, we have forecasted a modest increase in supply delivery and anticipate concessions may temporarily elevate in areas near those development lease-ups. On the demand side, Southern California was our top-performing region with March average trailing 3-month job growth of 7.9%.  Furthermore, our April loss to lease of 14% will provide a tailwind to revenues into 2023. It is with the strong fundamental backdrop that Essex continues to make progress in advancing our property collections operating model. We discussed on previous earnings calls on how we successfully improved efficiency last year in San Diego and Orange County by operating closely located properties as a single unified business. The benefits of this operating model includes enhancing our customer service through virtual on-demand experience, creating more career advanced opportunities for associates through specialization and ultimately generating a 10% to 15% reduction in administrative staffing needs through natural attrition, which is also mitigating the inflationary pressures we are experiencing today. Historically, Essex has operated with an employee to unit ratio of 40:1. Today, we are at 43:1, and our target by the end of 2022 is 45:1. At this point, we have completed the Wola of Southern California and expect company-wide implementation by year-end. In addition, we have ongoing digital platform improvements rolling out over the next few years. As such, we have yet to fully optimize our business, and we anticipate further benefits in 2023 and thereafter. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barb Pak. Rich, it's Angela. I would love to be able to give you the earning for 2023, but it's one barbelkilme. And two, it's just too early. I think you can see that our fundamentals are solid, and we're doing quite well. Sure. That's a good question, Rich. And you've seen us do this, which is when we see market strength, we would change our strategy from favoring occupancy to pushing rents, especially when we see -- when we are anticipating more market strength coming ahead of us. So it is very much intentional. And you'll see that when we are past the leasing season, usually during third quarter, and especially in the fourth quarter, we would change that strategy back to pushing occupancy instead. Alex, if it helps, just a few data points on what Mike just said. It's Angela here. When we're looking at the sequential met new leases, net effective new leases. The best performing are San Mateo and Santa Clara. Those are the 2 top ones. So that is evidence of the strength of the suburban Northern California. Alex, it's Angela here. Maybe I'll start with the tenant's behavior first and like me, I want to talk about more hazard. It's a favorite topic. In terms of how aggressively we can push on that front, there are a couple of factors. One is that we still have eviction protection in place for LA and Alameda county. And so that will need to work itself out, and that's -- that goes to the legislative issues, right?  As far as our ability to collect going forward, keep in mind that the protection -- delinquency protection remain for any delinquency that occurred during the period before September 2021. So we're really talking about April delinquency. So on the new April delinquency, we can take action outside of L.A., of course, in Alameda. And so it's a whole process that involves going through evaluation of putting people and payment plans, win with our tenants on how to manage through this period of time. And so -- we do, at this point, have the ability to report to the credit agency everywhere, it's really how we want to go about it that will make the most sense to be able to maximize our collections effort. Yes, I'm happy to cover that. It's Angela here. On the market brands, we are tracking pretty much in line in Northern California and Seattle. And keep in mind, we had anticipated that Northern California recovery would be quite strong. And so that is consistent with our expectation. Southern California is outperforming and it is tracking ahead. The -- and so we are in the middle of -- in the midst of relooking at our modeling assumptions, and we'll provide a midyear update. Having said that, keep in mind that when we're looking at leasing spreads, year-over-year leasing spreads, we will have the -- it will be the strongest in the first half because last year around this time, we still had negative leasing spreads. In fact, that negative leasing spreads weren't continued through the second quarter, we didn't turn until July. And so for those reasons, with the year-over-year comparable, we need to evaluate the magnitude of what that means. And Rich, it's Angela here. Thanks for making my point for me, which is that in the second half, we do see that flip. We do see Northern California rent growth will then outperform Southern California rent growth. Sure. I'll talk about the CapEx program first and -- as far as the redevelopment spend and also just the forward CapEx spend. On the redevelopment side, we are targeting 8% to 10% cash on cash yield, and this is consistent with pre-COVID levels. And it's primarily because we're seeing the demand in our market and the rent growth to support this program. Now the elevated level that you may be referring to when it comes to the CapEx per door, I think that's what you're referring to itself, it's really driven by 2 factors. One is, of course, the material cost increase, but the other 1 is a catch-up. And so during the COVID period, we, of course, were very careful and ran much leaner from a CapEx perspective, both in terms of just trying to minimize contact and also being sensitive to what we can achieve on the top line. And because of that, our normal CapEx per door of somewhere around 1,750 dropped down to almost below $1,400. And so that -- there's a catch-up that just needs to happen normally. It's Angela here. I think you're asking about how we look at or how we evaluate the success of our property collections operating model. Sure, sure. So we think about the benefit in 3 key ways. First is our customer interactions. And we can look at that by the retention rate. And the second one is operating efficiency, and that is the 40:1 ratio that I talked about that we now improved to 43:1 in terms of units to employ. And ultimately, what that means for the financial impact, and that's the third key metric.  And so when I refer to the 100 to 200 basis points of margin improvement, when we implemented San Diego and Orange County, that translated to about $15 million of benefit to NOI, and we have realized that savings when we were only about 1/3 way through our implementation back then. So the expectation is that going forward, once we complete the rollout -- now keep in mind, we also have a digital platform rollout that's embedded in all of the cost savings. But upon completion, and this is several years out, we would expect an additional 200 to 300 basis points of margin improvement. The trick here is -- or the challenge is trying to figure out, it's not a dollar for dollar because when we -- when I talked about the $15 million things, we were not under such extreme inflationary pressure today. And so there will be offsets, which will go towards helping us to manage our controllable expenses. Yes. Alex, it's Angela here. And that includes the impact to their credit report we can, and we actually have reported on our past residents. But also, there are other means for us to try to connect with them, which is we can go through small claims court. There are other means. And so it is actually to their benefit to engage with us and get this assistance from the state."

You are seeing some interest rate pressures, obviously, but with the growth that we're seeing throughout our markets and with the amount of capital in the market chasing deals. We're really not seeing a dramatic move in pricing for deals that are kind of on the market right now. We're seeing a somewhat less froth than what we've seen over the last, call it, 6 to 9 months. but that that's that extra 5% the groups have moved after the second best and final round that we're not seeing today. So it really -- like I said, we're not seeing a dramatic shift in pricing moving forward. Sure. Neil, this is Adam. As to what's going to come later in the year, it's hard to say. Over the end of Q4 and early Q1, the volume generally on the market was pretty low. There's a pretty significant decline in overall transaction volume quarter-over-quarter. There is quite a bit on the market today. As I noted before, over the last 6 to 9 months, we really didn't partake in the frenzy that was happening in those best and best final rounds. We're always constantly assessing what's on the market and where we see more growth going forward. And so we're looking at those deals. We're not going to be in the low 3s. And so if there's any sort of adjustment or if we see an opportunity that comes up, and we did see a few of those that we closed on in early Q4 and early this quarter, then we will jump into those windows."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Essex Property Trust Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs, as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found on the company's filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Angela Kleiman, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Kleiman, you may begin.\nAngela Kleiman: Good morning, and thank you for joining Essex fourth quarter earnings call. Barb Pak will follow with prepared remarks; Rylan Burns and Jessica Anderson are here for Q&A. I will start with the key highlights of our 2023 performance then discuss our expectations for 2024, followed by comments on the transaction market and our investment strategy. Overall, 2023 was a solid year for Essex. We achieved a 4.4% same-property revenue growth for the full year, which is in line with our revised guidance and 40 basis points higher than the original midpoint. Furthermore, we made substantial progress in reducing delinquency as a percentage of rent from over 2% in the first quarter, down to 1.4% by year-end. These are the results of the well coordinated efforts of our hardworking operations and support teams across the company. Great job team, and thank you. Lastly, we continue to drive results to the bottom line, delivering a 3.6% year-over-year increase in core FFO per share, exceeding the high end of our original guidance range by $0.06. Turning to the fourth quarter, we deployed an occupancy focused strategy as market rents moderated generally consistent with typical seasonal pattern. In addition, we recovered a significant number of delinquent units starting in October. As expected, the subsequent backfilling of non-paying units during a seasonally slow period created a temporary headwind to net effective new lease rates, which averaged negative 1.7% for the quarter. On the renewal front, the positive trend continues with strong retention among our residents, generating an increase in renewal rates of 4.9% for the quarter, resulting in blended rates of positive 2.6%. As we start 2024, leasing activities in our markets is steady. In January, new lease net FX rates improved by 150 basis points and concession usage decreased by half since the fourth quarter, and our financial occupancy sits in a solid position of 96.2%. Moving on to our outlook for the West Coast in 2024 as outlined in our earnings package. We expect the US economy and job growth to normalize in 2024, consistent with economists' outlook of a soft landing. We forecast job growth on the West Coast to perform in line with the national average on the Essex markets to produce market rent growth of 1.25% on average. The consensus macroeconomic US assumptions and the quality of jobs are key considerations to our modest outlook. In 2023, the employment growth was largely concentrated in the service sectors, which did not yield meaningful rent growth. We expect this dynamic to continue, and we currently assume hiring of highly skilled workers to remain muted as companies continue to evaluate their labor needs and priorities. While our base case scenario for 2024 reflect tempered growth, there are several factors that could support a more positive outcome. First, inflation could continue to move in the right direction, increasing the likelihood that the Fed will pivot from tightening to easing. Accordingly, the economy could gain momentum and hiring of highly skilled workers reaccelerate as cost of capital becomes more attractive. Second, the large technology companies implemented significant business and labor retrenchments at the end of 2022 through the early part of last year. Therefore, these companies are better equipped today to lead advancements and stimulate growth. To this point, recent layoff announcements have been much smaller in scale with companies citing larger strategic plans to redirect talent and investments toward artificial intelligence projects, which we view as a long-term benefit for the West Coast. With low levels of housing supply in our markets, a modest increase in demand could accelerate rent growth. Despite uncertainties in the overall economy, we are confident in our market's ability to navigate near-term volatility and to outperform in the long term. Our conviction is based on two fundamental factors, low housing supply and favorable affordability. Over the next two years, we expect less than 1% of total supply growth per annum, which enables us to generate positive rent growth in most environments. Also, renting in the Essex markets is considerably more affordable than owning a home, and favorable rent-to-income ratios support a long runway for rent growth, especially in our Northern regions. As such, we expect the economic incentive to rent to persist and drive demand for multifamily housing. Lastly, on the investment market and our strategy. 2023 was a year of historically low transaction volume, primarily due to significant volatility in the capital markets. Although, we've seen interest rates decline throughout the fourth quarter, yield spread between buyers and sellers remain wide, ranging from approximately 25 to 50 basis points in our markets. And thus, we are not anticipating a significant increase in deal volume in the near term. Lenders have generally been accommodating to sponsors extending debt maturities when feasible, and there are very few four sellers in our markets currently. Given the thirst of data points, there is less certainty in the transaction market. It is during periods of uncertainty that Essex has historically created significant value for our shareholders through external growth. As such, our investment team is proactively looking for acquisition opportunities to generate the best risk-adjusted returns. We expect Essex's disciplined approach to capital allocation, strong balance sheet and deep market expertise will be key differentiators in creating long-term value. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barbara.\nBarb Pak: Thanks, Angela. Today, I will discuss the key assumptions to our 2024 guidance and provide an update on the balance sheet. Beginning with our outlook for 2024, a key factor to our revenue forecast is our market rent growth assumption. As Angela mentioned, the economic backdrop is expected to be muted this year, which is leading to below average rent growth for our markets. As a result, same-property revenue growth is tempered at 1.7% at the midpoint on a cash basis. The key drivers of our revenue growth are outlined on Page S-17.1 of the supplemental. Our guidance assumes delinquency of 1.5% of schedule rents for the full year, which represents a 40 basis point improvement to year-over-year revenue growth. We expect delinquency will gradually improve as we move through the year. In terms of regional performance, we expect Southern California will produce our highest revenue growth at 3%, led by Orange County in San Diego. Northern California will be around 1%, and Seattle will be our weakest performing region, which is forecasted to be flat on a year-over-year basis. Moving to operating expenses. We are projecting 4.25% growth for the full year, which was largely driven by higher insurance costs. Although insurance costs account for a small portion of our total operating expenses, we are forecasting a 30% increase in our premiums, which adds 1.4% to our total same-property expense growth. The company remains focused on managing controllable expenses, which we are forecasting to increase 3% in 2024, primarily driven by higher wages. In total, we expect same-property NOI growth of 60 basis points and core FFO per share growth to be flat at the midpoint compared to 2023. Core FFO growth would be over 1% higher, if not for the impact from two items related to our preferred equity platform. First, in December, we received $40 million in redemption proceeds, and we are forecasting an additional $100 million in redemption proceeds for this year. We anticipate redeploying the funds into new acquisitions, which tempers our near-term FFO growth, but is the best long-term capital allocation decision for Essex. Second, while our sponsors remain current on all financial obligations with the senior lenders, we changed the accrual status on two investments in the fourth quarter based on current market conditions. Further, we've taken a prudent approach as to how we projected income for the remainder of the portfolio as part of our 2024 guidance. We will continue to evaluate the accrual status on each of our preferred equity investments every quarter as appropriate. Turning to the balance sheet. Essex is in a strong financial position with minimal financing needs over the next 12 months and ample sources of capital. Our leverage levels are solid with net debt to EBITDA at 5.4 times, and we have over $1.6 billion of liquidity available to us. We manage our balance sheet and capital needs conservatively to be well positioned to create value throughout the cycle, and we remain optimistic, we will see opportunities to invest this year. With that, I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Great. Thanks. Just digging into guidance here. Can you share what your assumptions are for new and renewal lease rate growth are relative to the 1.25 market rent growth assumed and kind of how you're thinking about the cadence of that through the year? \nBarb Pak: Hi, Austin, it's Barb. Yes. So we're assuming 1.25 for new lease growth and renewals, we expect to be slightly above that at 1.75%. We do expect renewal growth will be in the first half of the year be above 2% in the low 2% range and then drift down to our market rent growth assumption of 1.25 in the back half of the year.\nAustin Wurschmidt: I guess just following quickly up on that, what's driving that really tight spread? Are there concessions burning off or anything that's impacting, I guess, the spread between new and renewal lease rates assumed in your guidance?\nBarb Pak: Yes. So I think if you look at January, you'll see we printed 4.8% on new leases or renewals, but 50% of that is a burn-off of concessions, and so it's not really a new market rent growth. And I would say, our philosophy on renewals is not to push them above market. We do like to, we want to price them appropriately. And last year, in 2023, we didn't have a significant loss to lease. And so we don't have a big spread differential between our new and renewals from last year that would carry forward into this year. So we think it's priced appropriately.\nAustin Wurschmidt : And if I can just sneak in one more. I recognize you guys report financial occupancy, but could you break out the impact from guidance around the occupancy change and then impact from concessions and maybe what market rent growth would look like on a net effective basis if you included the concession impact there? Thank you.\nBarb Pak: Yes. So the concession piece on the occupancy and concessions, we expect concessions to be a 10 -- or 10 basis point headwind to our forecast this year, occupancy to be 20 basis points. So we're forecasting 96.2% for occupancy. So we don't expect concessions to have a material impact to the forecast this year on a year-over-year basis.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Sakwa: Yes. Thanks. I guess, good morning out there. I noticed on the delinquency slide, I guess it's S-16, there was a big jump up in the delinquencies between the fourth quarter and January. And I know you talked about that overall trend getting better for the full year, I think, to the tune of 40 basis points. But just what color can you provide in January that showed that big pop?\nBarb Pak: Hi, Steve, it's Barb. Yes, this January, we've seen for several years now. It's the post holiday. I think people are paying off their credit cards and whatnot. So it's not something that we're overly concerned about. We're monitoring it closely. But we have seen this last year, if you go back and you look at our supplemental, we saw 190 basis points increase from Q4 to January. This year, we're up 80%. So it is a lot lower than we were a year ago, but we're monitoring it.\nSteve Sakwa: Okay. And then just, I guess, maybe on the DC or your -- I guess, your pref book. I mean just as you've kind of gone through and scrub sort of some of the things you talked about a couple of the underwriting changes. Like just what risk do you sort of see out there on the kind of roughly $500 million you've got outstanding? And I guess, how are you sort of handicapping that in terms of any future write-offs?\nAngela Kleiman: Yes, Steve, this is Barb. We take a prudent approach when we look at this. And there's a variety of factors that we look at when we're looking at our preferred book, where are we -- where is our last dollar sit relative to the market today? What -- what's the maturity of our investments? And how much time do we have for the market to recover and really what is our sponsors doing? Are they continuing to put equity and can they continue to fund? So those are the factors that we're looking at. I think we have fully handicap the issue that we see today based on current market conditions within our guidance. It's a few assets we're monitoring. But for the most part, the book is performing as we expected.\nSteve Sakwa: Great. Thanks. That's it for me.\nOperator: Our next question is from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.\nDaniel Tricarico: Hey, it\u2019s Daniel Tricarico on for Nick. Barb, with respect to the improvement in new lease rate growth in January, which markets were the largest drivers of that change? And I know you mentioned the 50 basis point improvement from concession burn-off, but is the general market improvement largely in line with typical seasonality?\nJessica Anderson: This is Jessica. I'll take that. With regards to the largest driver of the sequential improvement from Q4 to January, it was 150 basis points. We saw the greatest improvement in Northern California and the Bay Area. And a large part of that was concession burn-off. For the total portfolio, if you break down a 150 basis point improvement, 100 basis points of it is the improvement in concessions. So, we were averaging one week in Q4 and that's a half a week for January. And then the other part of it, 50 basis points is attributed to rent growth, which is typical with what we would expect this time of year historically.\nDaniel Tricarico: Great. Thank you. Angela, follow-up. How are you thinking about recycling capital from your future pref equity redemptions into acquisitions or other use? You talked about optimism I believe in your opening remarks around a growing opportunity set. Are you seeing anything specific in the market today? And I guess, along the same lines, how are your JV partners thinking about deploying new capital into acquisitions today?\nAngela Kleiman: Yes, that's a good question. As far as how we're reviewing investments. And let me just give you a quick background on our pref equity book. The investment thesis for this vehicle was it was intended to complement development pipeline during a period where yields and interest rates were low and construction costs were accelerating at a significant higher rate than rent growth. So, you saw us leaning into this business when the 10-year fell to historical low. And in that environment, a 12% yield was relatively more attractive. The general market environment and the interest rate conditions today are very different. And so we view that there's more upside to rent growth in our markets over the long run. So, the relative value is more compelling to focus on these simple acquisitions. So, it doesn't mean that we're shrinking the preferred equity book intentionally, but rather that this book will probably drift lower as we look to acquisitions as a way to grow the company. And the reason is because if you look at the fundamentals in our market, it all speaks to more upside relatively speaking, from rent growth. So, especially in our northern region, we have much lower supply. Affordability metrics is in the best position we've seen since we started tracking this metric historically. And there's -- the rent has yet to recover, so still in the recovery phase. And lastly, there is a demand optionality. I mean if you look at the composition of the companies in our markets, the seventh largest -- seven out of the 10 largest companies are located in our markets, and these are companies that have tremendous amount of wealth and looking -- and have committed to infrastructure and investment deployments. And so if you look at all the building blocks, it's there and it's right for acceleration once the economy shifts from a soft economy to a growth economy. And on the IRRs, Rylan, do you want to talk about the IRS?\nRylan Burns: Yeah. At a high level, I mean, we have several joint venture partners. We've been in this business for a long time and remain committed to us and our investment thesis along the West Coast. So there is demand there if we see the right opportunities. And we would expect we will see some opportunities in the next year or two.\nDaniel Tricarico: All right. Thanks for the time guys.\nOperator: Our next question is from Eric Wolfe with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nEric Wolfe: Hey, thanks. I think you just mentioned that you saw the largest improvement in Northern California between 4Q and January and your peer, just mentioned something similar on their call a moment ago. So I was just curious why you think you'll see this muted rent growth environment throughout the year in Northern California, if you're already starting to see signs of a recovery during the seasonally weak period.\nAngela Kleiman: Hey, Eric, it's Angela here. On Northern California, it's really when we look at our market rent growth, it's a -- we do see potential upside. Having said that, that will require the tech companies to hire -- to resume their hiring in a more robust way. And so our forecast is really a function of the general market outlook, because we cannot disconnect from what's happening with the rest of the country. And in particularly, the North Cal region itself, it's really dampened by Oakland because of the amount of supply. And so if you look at the 1.25% market rent, composition. First of all, it's a narrow range, just given the overall economic environment. But our Southern California leads the portfolio and above that 1.25% and Seattle is a close second. But the drag is really Northern California, which is closer to 1%, so below that 1.25% average, and that's because Oakland is well-below that 1%. So that's the drag.\nEric Wolfe: Got it. That's helpful. And then as far as your renewals, when does the concession burn off, sort of, the comp get harder? And where are you sending renewals for the next couple of months if you exclude to that concession burn off?\nJessica Anderson: Eric, this is Jessica. As far as renewal burn off, Barb mentioned it earlier, right now, it's roughly 50/50, and it becomes less so with regards to concession burn-off as we progress through Q1. Our concession strategy last year, I think we averaged roughly half week free last year, and there were some lumpiness as we dealt with delinquent units. So we may see that show up periodically. But with regards to forward-looking renewals we've sent out February and March at roughly 3%, 3.5%, and it's a little bit less than 50/50. It's probably more like 60/40, and it will continue to progress that way like I said, unless we have pockets of heavy concession usage from last year.\nEric Wolfe: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Hey, good afternoon, actually good morning, it\u2019s afternoon here. So two questions here. First, I do like the updated S-17, it's much simpler and I think brings the focus to just the data that you guys provide, so that's good. So two questions here. First, on the pref equity book, I'm assuming that you guys did not underwrite like low three cap deals at the peak or such. But can you just walk through where your investments sit in the capital stack. And as we hear articles or read stories about low 3 cap deals being revalued into the 5s, and what that does to people's equity and the associated debt. Can you just walk through your pref book and how you underwrote it and how we should think about it from a cap rate perspective?\nBarb Pak: Yeah, Alex, this is Barb. There's a lot of moving parts to that question. And every asset is different. What we have is a comprehensive model where we value every asset every quarter. And what we're really focused on is where is, our last dollar sit? Where are transactions occurring? And where is -- what is the exit strategy and our response is going to continue to fund equity shortfalls. We're also looking at their debt maturities, their caps and swaps they have in place as well as their interest reserves with their lenders. So there's a variety of factors that go into it. I do think we've scrubbed the book. We stopped accrual on two others. They were in Northern California, and given where we were in the stack, and we're watching a few others closely. But for the most part, we're at very reasonable valuations on the rest of the book and are not concerned with it. And we've consistently got redemptions even in the fourth quarter we were redeemed out of one of our assets. And so we feel good about the rest of the book, and we've not had to take back an asset. We found solutions, and I think that goes to our disciplined underwriting of our guarantors.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. And Barb, just to be clear on that, the two in Northern California, they're not paying so they're on non-accrual or you just were precautionary and then the other, I think, let that you're watching, do you expect those to go on non-accrual?\nBarb Pak: So the two in the fourth quarter, we put them on non-accrual. They weren't required to pay current, but we put them on non-accrual just given where we are in the stack. They have near-term maturities as well and we're working with the sponsors on those debt refinancing's. And then the other ones that we're monitoring, we're assessing that -- we'll assess that quarter-by-quarter. We have reserved it in the guidance, but we're assessing it based on current market conditions.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then, Barb, just on the guidance front, hearing how you guys have described the market, Seattle is the week one. Oakland is weak, but your other Bay Area is fine. Southern Cal is obviously great. You're recapturing the COVID units the OpEx is what it is. You have very little supply in the rest of the portfolio, and it sounds like the jobs outlook from what Angela described is fine. So are there any addition-- like it doesn't sound like there are really many headwinds in your portfolio. You don't have the supply issues that are plaguing other markets or geographies. So, are there any other headwinds that we should be thinking about as far as your earnings? Or -- is this -- or what I've outlined is pretty much how you guys are looking at the landscape this year?\nAngela Kleiman: Hey, Alex, it's Angela here. I think you're on point as far as how we see our portfolio. We do see that we have a very stable portfolio and supply definitely is a benefit for us. The variability really relates to the timing on the delinquency. And that is, that is one aspect of our business that we don't have as much control as we would like, because we are subject to how long it takes for the court to process these delinquency units. The good news is that, that process timing has begun to decline. So for example, last year, when we're talking about L.A., it took about 10 to 12 months. And currently, we're down to 8 months. Everywhere else used to be nine to 10 months, now it's down to six months. So we're making good progress there, but that remains an open item for us as far as the risk is concerned.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nJamie Feldman: Great. Thank you. I just wanted to dig a little more into your comments on insurance. I think you said up 30%. Can you just talk about what you're seeing there? Is that definitely the number? Is there any kind of variability to that? And -- does this last round of storms we've seen over the last few weeks impact that at all? Or is it more forward-looking?\nBarb Pak: Hi, Jamie, it's Barb. So we did our property and earthquake insurance renewal in December. So that number is fairly baked for the year. We still have our general liability, but we don't that to move the needle too much. So 30%, I think, is the number. It is still a very challenging insurance market, and we do have a captive and we utilize the captive as appropriate to minimize our insurance premiums where appropriate and where we \u2013 based on the risk that we would take within the captive. So we used all angles to minimize that number, but I think it is still going to be a challenging market for the foreseeable future. In terms of the storms that won't impact the number this year, but what the carriers will do next year is still it's undetermined. I think what we need to see in the insurance market is the reinsurers that come back into the market in a big way for the premiums to start to come down. And in terms of storm damage, we haven't had anything material. We've had obviously some leaks and some minor things, but nothing material related to the storms.\nJamie Feldman: Okay. That's helpful. I know it's so hard to like quantify because there's a waterfall at every tranche of the coverage, but is there a way to give a number of like your captive exposure? Like what percentage of total liability does fall on the company versus third party? It seems like more and more REITs are growing their captives or using their captives more. I just wonder if there's a way to benchmark that seems so convoluted.\nAngela Kleiman: Yes, Angela here. That's a tough one to quantify because even though there are more REITs looking at the captive and then I think it makes sense to do so. Everyone approach how they take first loss and that first layer differently. And so I don't know if you can really get apples-to-apples. We'll look into it and see if there's a better way to provide some additional context.\nBarb Pak: And the other thing I would just add on that is we've had a captive for decades, and we have a marketable securities portfolio of over $100 million, which is the premium that we would have paid to third parties that are there to backstop any major insurance loss that we have. So we a substantial amount of money sitting there on our balance sheet because of that.\nJamie Feldman: Okay. That's very helpful. Have you grown the exposure in recent years or not necessarily?\nBarb Pak: Not necessarily. We will ebb and flow earthquake depending on the earthquake premiums that are out there because sometimes the earthquake coverage can be extreme. So we will look at that in a different way, but we do have third-party earthquake on all high rises and five stories enough. But outside of that, we haven't taken on any real significant risk in the last few years.\nJamie Feldman: Okay. All right. Thank you. I'm sure we'll talk about this more.\nOperator: Our next question is from Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nAdam Kramer: Hey, guys. I just wanted to ask you about kind of the new versus renewal spread. And I know it's been talked about a little bit already, but just wondering if you were to look over whether it's a long run average, or maybe go back to kind of prior recessions, even and use that as kind of the test case. Wondering what the kind of spread historically was between new and renewals?\nAngela Kleiman : Hey, Adam, it's Angela here. That one -- the relationship between renewal and new lease rates is really driven by what the prior year's new lease rate is. So, for example, in 2022, our market rents or new lease rates were north of 11%. And so that, of course, means that you can have a much higher renewal rate to take it to market. And so that relationship really will be driven by whatever the market rent is going to be and the renewal then follows. It's really a lagging effect. So there isn't an exact number that you really can peg just because it's really one follows the other, not so much that there is a logical relationship that you could just use as a benchmark for trending purposes.\nAdam Kramer: Got it. That's really helpful. Thanks, Angela. And just on the kind of pref equity, you kind of may be getting kind of more and more money back from that than you have in the past. And I know in the past you roll asked about kind of, hey, would you look at other markets in the U.S., right, other markets outside of West Coast. And maybe with getting kind of more proceeds back from the pref equity, having a little bit more dry powder that could enable you to maybe take a harder look at some markets outside of the West Coast. So figure I\u2019d asked that question.\nAngela Kleiman : Hey, Adam. No, that's a good question. We actually have -- I know this is not a surprise, we get this question on a regular basis, and it's fair to ask. We have historically a disciplined approach when it comes to evaluating markets, not just within our own markets. And so we do look at all the major metros across the U.S., and it's part of our annual study to make sure that we have a good handle on what are driving the fundamentals of other markets as well. And so -- and this is not to say that we wouldn't venture into other markets or take whatever proceeds available. It's really a function of how we view the relative value. And what I mean by that is, as I mentioned earlier, when we look at the fundamentals of our markets with recovery ahead of us, with potential demand catalysts from these large companies and low supply and affordability metrics. That just speaks to the fact that our market has much more upside and lower risk from supply. And so it's more compelling in the near term to focus our investments in our markets. We will, of course, continue to watch the other markets and make sure that relative value holds.\nAdam Kramer: Great. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: Our next question is from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJoshua Dennerlein : I just want to go back to your comment that you're sending out renewals at 3%, 3.5% right now, what your guide assume is 1.75% for the full year. I think some of that might just have to do with the free rent burn off. But can you maybe walk us through the cadence of when we get past that for your rent burn-off and when things start to trend down to 1.7% because I assume the second half of the year is actually weaker than 1.75%?\nAngela Kleiman: Hey Josh, it's Angela here. We are seeing that -- that the benefit of the concession burn-off to begin to abate as we head into the second quarter. And that's why -- as Barb mentioned, that you'll see that renewal rates to start to converge to that 1.25% market rent. So, that's -- hopefully, that's the cadence that answers your cadence question?\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. Yes. No, that's good. And then maybe just one more. For the same-store revenue range, could you walk us through the assumptions that get us to the high and low end of the same-store revenue range of 70 basis points to 2.7%, mostly focused on like blends and occupancy assumptions underlying that?\nBarb Pak: Yes, Josh, this is Barb. There's a lot of different assumptions that go into the high and the low end. I think the biggest factor will be delinquency and market rent growth that could drive us to either the high or the low end. And as we saw like in the third quarter when we -- or the fourth quarter when we got back a lot of delinquent units, it can have an impact, a temporary to our occupancy and to market rent, if we get those units back in a low demand period. So, there's a variety of assumptions related to that on the high and the low end.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay, all right. Appreciate that. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Wes Golladay with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nWes Golladay: Hey everyone. Can you give us the balance on the two non-accrual investments? And then can you also comment on what the $20 million noncore G&A charges this year?\nBarb Pak: Yes. So, the two that we put on non-accrual, the balance is $25 million for both and in terms of the $20 million that we have in our guidance, that's mostly related to political contributions. As you know, we're fighting a couple of ballot measures. So, that's most of what that's for.\nWes Golladay: Okay. Thanks for that. And then I guess, maybe bigger picture, supply is still relatively low at the portfolio level and rent growth is call it, low 1%. Is it just mainly the markets with heavy supply bringing that -- the blend down for you? You also mentioned something in the comments earlier about the job growth is being driven by service-related jobs. So, I'm just wondering if the job mix is also playing a big part of the forecast this year?\nBarb Pak: Hey Wes, on the rents for our guidance, it's a couple of factors. So, first is what you mentioned the service sector jobs, which has been -- which has dominated the job growth last year. And we've all seen the announcements recently. The lots of companies are still retooling and reevaluating. And so typically, if you look at the long-term average of our job growth and the composition, normally, you would want about 30% of those jobs to come from higher wage jobs. And so in this environment, which with the consensus -- the macro consensus of a soft landing, we certainly wouldn't be forecasting -- we wouldn't be getting ahead of them forecasting robust high wage job growth. And so that's one key factor. As far as supply, you're right, for our portfolio, it's only 0.5% for California. Seattle is elevated and close to 1% and higher than last year. Fortunately, for us, it's mostly concentrated in the downtown area and our portfolio is mostly under Eastside. Having said that, there will be some properties that will have to -- that will be impacted by supply, and we'll see concessions elevated on a temporary basis for those assets.\nWes Golladay: Okay. Thank you for that.\nOperator: Our next question is from John Pawlowski with Green Street. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Pawlowski: Thanks for the time. Barb, I wanted to follow-up on your comments on your quarterly process of remarking the values in your preferred equity book and making sure your dollar basis is safe. Are you able to share a rough average loan to value in your prep book right now? On real values, not lagged kind of third-party appraised values?\nBarb Pak: Yeah. I don't have that in front of me. And I think it varies by asset. So I don't have that in front of me. But it does matter about the rent growth that we've seen in each asset for each property and how we underwrote it initially that all plays into fact where we are in the capital stack. But like I said, we do a thorough scrub and we feel comfortable with the book.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. One more for you, Barb. How much success, if any, have you had collecting past written off rent from tenants that have moved out? I'm just not \u2013 I don't have a good sense of how much teeth you guys have to go after credit scores and how much you're able to actually collect from the huge cumulative written off rent balance?\nBarb Pak: Yeah. It's a small component of our monthly collections. We are collecting a little bit every month on that past due rent, because we have hit their credit and gone after them. and because of our conservative approach to how we account for bad debt, whereby, if you're delinquent after 30 days, we reserve against it in the financials, when we go and hit their credit and they need their credit, they will start to pay. So we've -- it is a recurring part of our income given how we account for it, but it's hard to quantify, and it is lumpy. It moves around month-to-month. And we do expect it will be a reoccurring part for the foreseeable future given we have over $130 million in uncollected rent. But it will be a small part, but it will be drips and drabs.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. All right. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question is from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Kim: Thank you. I wanted to go back to your market rent forecast of 1.25% for the year, which is below what you had a year ago. Angela mentioned in the prepared remarks, layoff announcements have come down quite a bit year-over-year. So I was just wondering, are you actually seeing more move-outs due to job losses this year versus a year ago when it seemed like tech layoffs were a lot more prevalent?\nAngela Kleiman: Hey, John, it's Angela here. We have not seen more move-outs to job loss, and we do track that. When we look at move-out reasons, it's relatively stable. And so our market outlook is really a function of where the economy is and how we believe we would perform relative to the overall economy.\nJohn Kim: Okay. So just projecting unemployment rate moving up?\nBarb Pak: Yeah. And I think, John, just to add to that. I think the mix of jobs has been -- we've seen a change in mix over the last year as the high-quality jobs have not been added in mostly service sector, as Angela mentioned earlier. And I think that, that is -- we just don't see that changing in this environment given the slow economy. So -- that could change. That would be upside to the forecast, but it's not our base case at this point. And that's what's driving the below average.\nJohn Kim: Can I clarify on the impairment that you had in your preferred? Do you still have a position in this asset? Or was it -- was the loan fully written off due to the recapitalization or some other kind of event?\nBarb Pak: We still have our investment in the asset. But because our -- the loan and our investment matures in October of this year, and because we don't feel we'll fully realize our valuation by the end of the term of our maturity of our loan, we impaired the asset, which is consistent with GAAP accounting rules. We do believe in the asset long term and the market long term, we're obviously in a very depressed market in Oakland. And but it's going to take time for that market to recover. We need to see supply abate, which we will start to happen in 2025 and really into 2026. And that should bring -- bring rents up. And so that will help our investment long term. The sponsor continues to fund equity shortfalls and is actively putting money into the project, and we are working actively with them on the refi that will be coming up here in the fall.\nJohn Kim: What is the likelihood you put more capital into the project or take ownership of the asset?\nBarbara Pak: I think that will be determined as we work through the refinance and based on the sponsor's response to the refinance. So it's a little too early and premature to talk about that. We'll know more as we work through that this summer.\nJohn Kim: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. How is demand trending in your markets? And if you can quantify that in any way, like the number of property tours that would be helpful. Again, a market like Seattle does increase supply in the urban core combined with return to office, draw residents away from the more suburban Essex properties?\nJessica Anderson: Hi, Michael, this is Jessica. I can provide you some basics, I guess, as far as how leasing fundamentals are going in our markets. And it's really trending as expected in all of our markets. Right now, when we're looking at things like lead volume is steadily increasing, which is what we would expect this time of year, and then also leasing activity overall is stable. As far as quantifying it goes, I mean, we really see that increase in demand that we would expect, of course, correlates to whatever sequential rent growth that we see. And we pointed that out earlier, we saw good growth in both NorCal and Seattle. And that's something that is in part due to concession burn off. Those are our most seasonal markets. So we do expect them to grow more substantially on a sequential basis. But overall, they're performing as expected, in line with what we would expect at the time of the year.\nMichael Goldsmith: Got it. Thanks for that. And my follow-up question is, is on rent control. Have you seen any change in the rent control environment in your markets? And then given that it's an election year, does that -- does that create a little bit more noise than a traditional year? Thanks.\nAngela Kleiman: Hey, Michael, in an environment where we're looking at 1.25% market rent growth, we certainly don't expect an elevated concern when it comes to the rent control conversation. Now there is, I think many of you are aware that there is a proposition out there to repeal Costa-Hawkins again, sponsored by Michael Weinstein, the Head of the AIDS Foundation. And we, of course, participate in the housing coalition that supports responsible legislation and we do not view that this proposal to repeal the Costa-Hawkins Housing Act will have traction because it's -- this is the third time that this proposal has come up. And in the past two times, it was overwhelmingly defeated, only one out of 58 counties voted in favor of repealing Costa-Hawkins and they -- and that was by a narrow margin. And it lacks the governance and general political support, it is viewed as an antigrowth proposal that will deter housing production when we already have a housing shortage. And so that -- but that is one that we are watching carefully. But beyond that, that's a normal operating environment for us from a legislative perspective.\nMichael Goldsmith: Thank you very much. Good luck in 2024.\nAngela Kleiman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Rich Anderson with Wedbush. Please proceed you\u2019re your question.\nRich Anderson: Hey, good morning, everyone. So Barb, you said one of the swing factors for you is getting back delinquent units and perhaps into a downtime in the rental market and not knowing what that opportunity would present itself. But I imagine, it would be either zero or something more. And it's just a matter of when that something more hits. Is that it? Because obviously, the delinquent unit wasn't paying rent. I just want to make sure I understand that logically what you're saying there.\nBarb Pak: Yes. So yes, and we can take the example of what happened in September, October. We got back hundreds of units or occupancy. So our delinquency dropped about 50 basis points, but our occupancy also dropped commensurately. And then when we backfilled, we gave back a little bit on the rent growth. And so there was a small impact to the bottom line, but it didn't all fall to the bottom line. Long-term, it's beneficial for us. But there is a temporary headwind, especially if you get the units back in a low demand period because then you have to give concessions to backfill -- to backfill those units. If we get the units back during peak leasing season, and we have a strong leasing season, there will be less impact to occupancy and rent growth.\nRich Anderson: Why would there be an impact negatively, if they weren't paying rent, who cares what the occupancy was if there were zero rent coming in any way? I'm just curious, I'm not sure I understand why there would be a negative number in that scenario. It would either zero or something more. Yes.\nAngela Kleiman: Hey, Rich. Yes. So I think from your question -- from your perspective, the absolute number is right now, we're going from zero to something. So you can't be below zero. But keep in mind, the way Barb has outlined the guidance, we are assuming an improvement in delinquency, which means we will need to get -- we do need to convert some of those zeros into a positive number, just to be at midpoint. Does that help?\nRich Anderson: Yes. Okay. Perfect. That's what I am looking for. Yep. Thank you. And then -- so where there are problems in the bank industry and as it touches multifamily, it's in the rent-regulated area, and we've seen that in New York Community and Signature portfolios and so on, rent regulated can -- is California can be described with that phrase, I assume. I'm curious to what degree you're seeing anything popping up? And if this was covered earlier, I apologize. But is there -- are you in a position to jump on opportunities? Is there a pipeline building of sort of these sort of distressed situations, maturities coming. Anything like that, that is interesting to you? Or is it not really sort of apparently happening at this point as an external growth opportunity for Essex? Thanks.\nRylan Burns: Hi, Rich. I'll echo what many of our peers have said is we're not currently seeing much distressed selling at all in our markets given the amount of debt coming due in the next couple of years, we anticipate there should be some opportunities, but as of yet, we have yet to really see any force selling. So we are keeping our eyes open and looking for opportunities, but nothing as of yet.\nRich Anderson: Okay. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question is from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nLinda Tsai : Hi. In terms of the $134 million in receivables, are there different ways to tip away at that, like get debt collectors involved? Or just anything operationally you can do to get your money back faster?\nBarb Pak : Yes, Linda, we are -- this is Barb. We are pursuing every avenue to try to collect on that money, whether it be taken to small claims court, we've being their credit -- and like we are collecting a little bit here and there, but it depends on when they need their credit. And when they need their credit, then they tend to come back and pay, but if they don't need their credit for a long time, then it can sit out there. But every avenue we can pursue, we are pursuing to try to collect on that money.\nLinda Tsai : Got it. And then just in terms of getting units back in a low demand period where it's more negative for you, like what are some of the determinants for the timing of when you do get those units back and how do you forecast that to the extent you can?\nAngela Kleiman : Linda, that's the $64,000 question of the day. When do we get these darn units back? And for us, it would be great to get them back as soon as possible. The challenge here is that once a unit is in eviction. When we looked at the fourth quarter, the majority of those tenants just leave. So what that means is, for us, normally, in a normal environment, we have noticed that a tenant is going to vacate. We can pre-lease these units. We can plan for a turnover and of course, coordinated marketing efforts and our site personnel is ready for the move out, move-ins and all those logistics. In a situation where we have a certain number of evictions in play, and we don't know how many are going to come back or when, that's the part that creates that pressure when it comes to pricing and it's very difficult to predict.\nLinda Tsai: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Buck Horne with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.\nBuck Horne: Thanks. Appreciate the time. was wondering if going to the delinquency issue, if you could maybe add a little color if you're seeing any systemic application fraud or upticks in just application fraud or identity fraud or other types of misrepresentations by tenants? Is this something that's kind of spreading on social media that's becoming more of a structural issue?\nAngela Kleiman: Buck, it's Angela here. We have been -- our team has done a great job staying on top of these potential issues. And when we look at the fraud instances, it has not ticked up or become elevated. And in some instances, say, if it's a building specific issue, we immediately remedied those. And so that really hasn't been a driver for whether it's behavior or impact to our financials. It really is driven by the core processing time. So, I'll give you an example. When the tenant goes delinquent, pre-COVID, it only took us about, say, two months on average to evict this tenant. Because of the court delays, it's six months plus, right, or eight months if you're in LA. And so that's the time that's getting accumulated. And so we normally have a level of delinquency in our portfolio, but it's elevated now because it's just taking longer.\nBuck Horne: Got you. Got you. Okay, that's helpful. I appreciate the color there. And just as it relates to your future investment opportunities? Or kind of how you think about capital allocation between urban core or suburban assets and opportunities in your core markets? You're saying there's a lot of upside still yet to be achieved in the West Coast markets and some significant recovery potential. Do you think that applies to the downtown urban cores of L.A., San Fran and Seattle? Is that where you would look to allocate additional dollars first? Or do you think the suburban submarkets would continue to outperform.\nRylan Burns: Buck, it's a good question. Obviously, investment returns driven by what you pay. So we are paying attention to everything that's coming to market, and we'll keep an open mind to any investment. A major consideration for us is also making sure that we are acquiring near our existing footprints, given our unique operating model. We think we can add a lot of value when it's purchased when we buy something near an existing asset collection. Now as you know, the majority of those assets happen to be in the suburban market, and that is where we're primarily focused. They also have fewer quality of life issues currently. So, a simple answer is we are very focused in our suburban footprint, but we will keep an open mind to anything that crosses our broader markets.\nBuck Horne: Appreciate it. All right, thanks guys. Good luck.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.\nBarb Pak: Goodbye.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Angela Kleiman",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining Essex fourth quarter earnings call. Barb Pak will follow with prepared remarks; Rylan Burns and Jessica Anderson are here for Q&A. I will start with the key highlights of our 2023 performance then discuss our expectations for 2024, followed by comments on the transaction market and our investment strategy. Overall, 2023 was a solid year for Essex. We achieved a 4.4% same-property revenue growth for the full year, which is in line with our revised guidance and 40 basis points higher than the original midpoint. Furthermore, we made substantial progress in reducing delinquency as a percentage of rent from over 2% in the first quarter, down to 1.4% by year-end. These are the results of the well coordinated efforts of our hardworking operations and support teams across the company. Great job team, and thank you. Lastly, we continue to drive results to the bottom line, delivering a 3.6% year-over-year increase in core FFO per share, exceeding the high end of our original guidance range by $0.06. Turning to the fourth quarter, we deployed an occupancy focused strategy as market rents moderated generally consistent with typical seasonal pattern. In addition, we recovered a significant number of delinquent units starting in October. As expected, the subsequent backfilling of non-paying units during a seasonally slow period created a temporary headwind to net effective new lease rates, which averaged negative 1.7% for the quarter. On the renewal front, the positive trend continues with strong retention among our residents, generating an increase in renewal rates of 4.9% for the quarter, resulting in blended rates of positive 2.6%. As we start 2024, leasing activities in our markets is steady. In January, new lease net FX rates improved by 150 basis points and concession usage decreased by half since the fourth quarter, and our financial occupancy sits in a solid position of 96.2%. Moving on to our outlook for the West Coast in 2024 as outlined in our earnings package. We expect the US economy and job growth to normalize in 2024, consistent with economists' outlook of a soft landing. We forecast job growth on the West Coast to perform in line with the national average on the Essex markets to produce market rent growth of 1.25% on average. The consensus macroeconomic US assumptions and the quality of jobs are key considerations to our modest outlook. In 2023, the employment growth was largely concentrated in the service sectors, which did not yield meaningful rent growth. We expect this dynamic to continue, and we currently assume hiring of highly skilled workers to remain muted as companies continue to evaluate their labor needs and priorities. While our base case scenario for 2024 reflect tempered growth, there are several factors that could support a more positive outcome. First, inflation could continue to move in the right direction, increasing the likelihood that the Fed will pivot from tightening to easing. Accordingly, the economy could gain momentum and hiring of highly skilled workers reaccelerate as cost of capital becomes more attractive. Second, the large technology companies implemented significant business and labor retrenchments at the end of 2022 through the early part of last year. Therefore, these companies are better equipped today to lead advancements and stimulate growth. To this point, recent layoff announcements have been much smaller in scale with companies citing larger strategic plans to redirect talent and investments toward artificial intelligence projects, which we view as a long-term benefit for the West Coast. With low levels of housing supply in our markets, a modest increase in demand could accelerate rent growth. Despite uncertainties in the overall economy, we are confident in our market's ability to navigate near-term volatility and to outperform in the long term. Our conviction is based on two fundamental factors, low housing supply and favorable affordability. Over the next two years, we expect less than 1% of total supply growth per annum, which enables us to generate positive rent growth in most environments. Also, renting in the Essex markets is considerably more affordable than owning a home, and favorable rent-to-income ratios support a long runway for rent growth, especially in our Northern regions. As such, we expect the economic incentive to rent to persist and drive demand for multifamily housing. Lastly, on the investment market and our strategy. 2023 was a year of historically low transaction volume, primarily due to significant volatility in the capital markets. Although, we've seen interest rates decline throughout the fourth quarter, yield spread between buyers and sellers remain wide, ranging from approximately 25 to 50 basis points in our markets. And thus, we are not anticipating a significant increase in deal volume in the near term. Lenders have generally been accommodating to sponsors extending debt maturities when feasible, and there are very few four sellers in our markets currently. Given the thirst of data points, there is less certainty in the transaction market. It is during periods of uncertainty that Essex has historically created significant value for our shareholders through external growth. As such, our investment team is proactively looking for acquisition opportunities to generate the best risk-adjusted returns. We expect Essex's disciplined approach to capital allocation, strong balance sheet and deep market expertise will be key differentiators in creating long-term value. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barbara. Yes, Steve, this is Barb. We take a prudent approach when we look at this. And there's a variety of factors that we look at when we're looking at our preferred book, where are we -- where is our last dollar sit relative to the market today? What -- what's the maturity of our investments? And how much time do we have for the market to recover and really what is our sponsors doing? Are they continuing to put equity and can they continue to fund? So those are the factors that we're looking at. I think we have fully handicap the issue that we see today based on current market conditions within our guidance. It's a few assets we're monitoring. But for the most part, the book is performing as we expected. Yes, that's a good question. As far as how we're reviewing investments. And let me just give you a quick background on our pref equity book. The investment thesis for this vehicle was it was intended to complement development pipeline during a period where yields and interest rates were low and construction costs were accelerating at a significant higher rate than rent growth. So, you saw us leaning into this business when the 10-year fell to historical low. And in that environment, a 12% yield was relatively more attractive. The general market environment and the interest rate conditions today are very different. And so we view that there's more upside to rent growth in our markets over the long run. So, the relative value is more compelling to focus on these simple acquisitions. So, it doesn't mean that we're shrinking the preferred equity book intentionally, but rather that this book will probably drift lower as we look to acquisitions as a way to grow the company. And the reason is because if you look at the fundamentals in our market, it all speaks to more upside relatively speaking, from rent growth. So, especially in our northern region, we have much lower supply. Affordability metrics is in the best position we've seen since we started tracking this metric historically. And there's -- the rent has yet to recover, so still in the recovery phase. And lastly, there is a demand optionality. I mean if you look at the composition of the companies in our markets, the seventh largest -- seven out of the 10 largest companies are located in our markets, and these are companies that have tremendous amount of wealth and looking -- and have committed to infrastructure and investment deployments. And so if you look at all the building blocks, it's there and it's right for acceleration once the economy shifts from a soft economy to a growth economy. And on the IRRs, Rylan, do you want to talk about the IRS? Hey, Eric, it's Angela here. On Northern California, it's really when we look at our market rent growth, it's a -- we do see potential upside. Having said that, that will require the tech companies to hire -- to resume their hiring in a more robust way. And so our forecast is really a function of the general market outlook, because we cannot disconnect from what's happening with the rest of the country. And in particularly, the North Cal region itself, it's really dampened by Oakland because of the amount of supply. And so if you look at the 1.25% market rent, composition. First of all, it's a narrow range, just given the overall economic environment. But our Southern California leads the portfolio and above that 1.25% and Seattle is a close second. But the drag is really Northern California, which is closer to 1%, so below that 1.25% average, and that's because Oakland is well-below that 1%. So that's the drag. Hey, Alex, it's Angela here. I think you're on point as far as how we see our portfolio. We do see that we have a very stable portfolio and supply definitely is a benefit for us. The variability really relates to the timing on the delinquency. And that is, that is one aspect of our business that we don't have as much control as we would like, because we are subject to how long it takes for the court to process these delinquency units. The good news is that, that process timing has begun to decline. So for example, last year, when we're talking about L.A., it took about 10 to 12 months. And currently, we're down to 8 months. Everywhere else used to be nine to 10 months, now it's down to six months. So we're making good progress there, but that remains an open item for us as far as the risk is concerned. Yes, Angela here. That's a tough one to quantify because even though there are more REITs looking at the captive and then I think it makes sense to do so. Everyone approach how they take first loss and that first layer differently. And so I don't know if you can really get apples-to-apples. We'll look into it and see if there's a better way to provide some additional context. Hey, Adam, it's Angela here. That one -- the relationship between renewal and new lease rates is really driven by what the prior year's new lease rate is. So, for example, in 2022, our market rents or new lease rates were north of 11%. And so that, of course, means that you can have a much higher renewal rate to take it to market. And so that relationship really will be driven by whatever the market rent is going to be and the renewal then follows. It's really a lagging effect. So there isn't an exact number that you really can peg just because it's really one follows the other, not so much that there is a logical relationship that you could just use as a benchmark for trending purposes. Hey, Adam. No, that's a good question. We actually have -- I know this is not a surprise, we get this question on a regular basis, and it's fair to ask. We have historically a disciplined approach when it comes to evaluating markets, not just within our own markets. And so we do look at all the major metros across the U.S., and it's part of our annual study to make sure that we have a good handle on what are driving the fundamentals of other markets as well. And so -- and this is not to say that we wouldn't venture into other markets or take whatever proceeds available. It's really a function of how we view the relative value. And what I mean by that is, as I mentioned earlier, when we look at the fundamentals of our markets with recovery ahead of us, with potential demand catalysts from these large companies and low supply and affordability metrics. That just speaks to the fact that our market has much more upside and lower risk from supply. And so it's more compelling in the near term to focus our investments in our markets. We will, of course, continue to watch the other markets and make sure that relative value holds. Hey Josh, it's Angela here. We are seeing that -- that the benefit of the concession burn-off to begin to abate as we head into the second quarter. And that's why -- as Barb mentioned, that you'll see that renewal rates to start to converge to that 1.25% market rent. So, that's -- hopefully, that's the cadence that answers your cadence question? Hey, John, it's Angela here. We have not seen more move-outs to job loss, and we do track that. When we look at move-out reasons, it's relatively stable. And so our market outlook is really a function of where the economy is and how we believe we would perform relative to the overall economy. Hey, Michael, in an environment where we're looking at 1.25% market rent growth, we certainly don't expect an elevated concern when it comes to the rent control conversation. Now there is, I think many of you are aware that there is a proposition out there to repeal Costa-Hawkins again, sponsored by Michael Weinstein, the Head of the AIDS Foundation. And we, of course, participate in the housing coalition that supports responsible legislation and we do not view that this proposal to repeal the Costa-Hawkins Housing Act will have traction because it's -- this is the third time that this proposal has come up. And in the past two times, it was overwhelmingly defeated, only one out of 58 counties voted in favor of repealing Costa-Hawkins and they -- and that was by a narrow margin. And it lacks the governance and general political support, it is viewed as an antigrowth proposal that will deter housing production when we already have a housing shortage. And so that -- but that is one that we are watching carefully. But beyond that, that's a normal operating environment for us from a legislative perspective. Thank you. Hey, Rich. Yes. So I think from your question -- from your perspective, the absolute number is right now, we're going from zero to something. So you can't be below zero. But keep in mind, the way Barb has outlined the guidance, we are assuming an improvement in delinquency, which means we will need to get -- we do need to convert some of those zeros into a positive number, just to be at midpoint. Does that help? Linda, that's the $64,000 question of the day. When do we get these darn units back? And for us, it would be great to get them back as soon as possible. The challenge here is that once a unit is in eviction. When we looked at the fourth quarter, the majority of those tenants just leave. So what that means is, for us, normally, in a normal environment, we have noticed that a tenant is going to vacate. We can pre-lease these units. We can plan for a turnover and of course, coordinated marketing efforts and our site personnel is ready for the move out, move-ins and all those logistics. In a situation where we have a certain number of evictions in play, and we don't know how many are going to come back or when, that's the part that creates that pressure when it comes to pricing and it's very difficult to predict. Buck, it's Angela here. We have been -- our team has done a great job staying on top of these potential issues. And when we look at the fraud instances, it has not ticked up or become elevated. And in some instances, say, if it's a building specific issue, we immediately remedied those. And so that really hasn't been a driver for whether it's behavior or impact to our financials. It really is driven by the core processing time. So, I'll give you an example. When the tenant goes delinquent, pre-COVID, it only took us about, say, two months on average to evict this tenant. Because of the court delays, it's six months plus, right, or eight months if you're in LA. And so that's the time that's getting accumulated. And so we normally have a level of delinquency in our portfolio, but it's elevated now because it's just taking longer."

            "content": "Thanks, Angela. Today, I will discuss the key assumptions to our 2024 guidance and provide an update on the balance sheet. Beginning with our outlook for 2024, a key factor to our revenue forecast is our market rent growth assumption. As Angela mentioned, the economic backdrop is expected to be muted this year, which is leading to below average rent growth for our markets. As a result, same-property revenue growth is tempered at 1.7% at the midpoint on a cash basis. The key drivers of our revenue growth are outlined on Page S-17.1 of the supplemental. Our guidance assumes delinquency of 1.5% of schedule rents for the full year, which represents a 40 basis point improvement to year-over-year revenue growth. We expect delinquency will gradually improve as we move through the year. In terms of regional performance, we expect Southern California will produce our highest revenue growth at 3%, led by Orange County in San Diego. Northern California will be around 1%, and Seattle will be our weakest performing region, which is forecasted to be flat on a year-over-year basis. Moving to operating expenses. We are projecting 4.25% growth for the full year, which was largely driven by higher insurance costs. Although insurance costs account for a small portion of our total operating expenses, we are forecasting a 30% increase in our premiums, which adds 1.4% to our total same-property expense growth. The company remains focused on managing controllable expenses, which we are forecasting to increase 3% in 2024, primarily driven by higher wages. In total, we expect same-property NOI growth of 60 basis points and core FFO per share growth to be flat at the midpoint compared to 2023. Core FFO growth would be over 1% higher, if not for the impact from two items related to our preferred equity platform. First, in December, we received $40 million in redemption proceeds, and we are forecasting an additional $100 million in redemption proceeds for this year. We anticipate redeploying the funds into new acquisitions, which tempers our near-term FFO growth, but is the best long-term capital allocation decision for Essex. Second, while our sponsors remain current on all financial obligations with the senior lenders, we changed the accrual status on two investments in the fourth quarter based on current market conditions. Further, we've taken a prudent approach as to how we projected income for the remainder of the portfolio as part of our 2024 guidance. We will continue to evaluate the accrual status on each of our preferred equity investments every quarter as appropriate. Turning to the balance sheet. Essex is in a strong financial position with minimal financing needs over the next 12 months and ample sources of capital. Our leverage levels are solid with net debt to EBITDA at 5.4 times, and we have over $1.6 billion of liquidity available to us. We manage our balance sheet and capital needs conservatively to be well positioned to create value throughout the cycle, and we remain optimistic, we will see opportunities to invest this year. With that, I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions. Hi, Austin, it's Barb. Yes. So we're assuming 1.25 for new lease growth and renewals, we expect to be slightly above that at 1.75%. We do expect renewal growth will be in the first half of the year be above 2% in the low 2% range and then drift down to our market rent growth assumption of 1.25 in the back half of the year. Yes. So I think if you look at January, you'll see we printed 4.8% on new leases or renewals, but 50% of that is a burn-off of concessions, and so it's not really a new market rent growth. And I would say, our philosophy on renewals is not to push them above market. We do like to, we want to price them appropriately. And last year, in 2023, we didn't have a significant loss to lease. And so we don't have a big spread differential between our new and renewals from last year that would carry forward into this year. So we think it's priced appropriately. Yes. So the concession piece on the occupancy and concessions, we expect concessions to be a 10 -- or 10 basis point headwind to our forecast this year, occupancy to be 20 basis points. So we're forecasting 96.2% for occupancy. So we don't expect concessions to have a material impact to the forecast this year on a year-over-year basis. Hi, Steve, it's Barb. Yes, this January, we've seen for several years now. It's the post holiday. I think people are paying off their credit cards and whatnot. So it's not something that we're overly concerned about. We're monitoring it closely. But we have seen this last year, if you go back and you look at our supplemental, we saw 190 basis points increase from Q4 to January. This year, we're up 80%. So it is a lot lower than we were a year ago, but we're monitoring it. Yeah, Alex, this is Barb. There's a lot of moving parts to that question. And every asset is different. What we have is a comprehensive model where we value every asset every quarter. And what we're really focused on is where is, our last dollar sit? Where are transactions occurring? And where is -- what is the exit strategy and our response is going to continue to fund equity shortfalls. We're also looking at their debt maturities, their caps and swaps they have in place as well as their interest reserves with their lenders. So there's a variety of factors that go into it. I do think we've scrubbed the book. We stopped accrual on two others. They were in Northern California, and given where we were in the stack, and we're watching a few others closely. But for the most part, we're at very reasonable valuations on the rest of the book and are not concerned with it. And we've consistently got redemptions even in the fourth quarter we were redeemed out of one of our assets. And so we feel good about the rest of the book, and we've not had to take back an asset. We found solutions, and I think that goes to our disciplined underwriting of our guarantors. So the two in the fourth quarter, we put them on non-accrual. They weren't required to pay current, but we put them on non-accrual just given where we are in the stack. They have near-term maturities as well and we're working with the sponsors on those debt refinancing's. And then the other ones that we're monitoring, we're assessing that -- we'll assess that quarter-by-quarter. We have reserved it in the guidance, but we're assessing it based on current market conditions. Hi, Jamie, it's Barb. So we did our property and earthquake insurance renewal in December. So that number is fairly baked for the year. We still have our general liability, but we don't that to move the needle too much. So 30%, I think, is the number. It is still a very challenging insurance market, and we do have a captive and we utilize the captive as appropriate to minimize our insurance premiums where appropriate and where we \u2013 based on the risk that we would take within the captive. So we used all angles to minimize that number, but I think it is still going to be a challenging market for the foreseeable future. In terms of the storms that won't impact the number this year, but what the carriers will do next year is still it's undetermined. I think what we need to see in the insurance market is the reinsurers that come back into the market in a big way for the premiums to start to come down. And in terms of storm damage, we haven't had anything material. We've had obviously some leaks and some minor things, but nothing material related to the storms. And the other thing I would just add on that is we've had a captive for decades, and we have a marketable securities portfolio of over $100 million, which is the premium that we would have paid to third parties that are there to backstop any major insurance loss that we have. So we a substantial amount of money sitting there on our balance sheet because of that. Not necessarily. We will ebb and flow earthquake depending on the earthquake premiums that are out there because sometimes the earthquake coverage can be extreme. So we will look at that in a different way, but we do have third-party earthquake on all high rises and five stories enough. But outside of that, we haven't taken on any real significant risk in the last few years. Yes, Josh, this is Barb. There's a lot of different assumptions that go into the high and the low end. I think the biggest factor will be delinquency and market rent growth that could drive us to either the high or the low end. And as we saw like in the third quarter when we -- or the fourth quarter when we got back a lot of delinquent units, it can have an impact, a temporary to our occupancy and to market rent, if we get those units back in a low demand period. So, there's a variety of assumptions related to that on the high and the low end. Yes. So, the two that we put on non-accrual, the balance is $25 million for both and in terms of the $20 million that we have in our guidance, that's mostly related to political contributions. As you know, we're fighting a couple of ballot measures. So, that's most of what that's for. Hey Wes, on the rents for our guidance, it's a couple of factors. So, first is what you mentioned the service sector jobs, which has been -- which has dominated the job growth last year. And we've all seen the announcements recently. The lots of companies are still retooling and reevaluating. And so typically, if you look at the long-term average of our job growth and the composition, normally, you would want about 30% of those jobs to come from higher wage jobs. And so in this environment, which with the consensus -- the macro consensus of a soft landing, we certainly wouldn't be forecasting -- we wouldn't be getting ahead of them forecasting robust high wage job growth. And so that's one key factor. As far as supply, you're right, for our portfolio, it's only 0.5% for California. Seattle is elevated and close to 1% and higher than last year. Fortunately, for us, it's mostly concentrated in the downtown area and our portfolio is mostly under Eastside. Having said that, there will be some properties that will have to -- that will be impacted by supply, and we'll see concessions elevated on a temporary basis for those assets. Yeah. I don't have that in front of me. And I think it varies by asset. So I don't have that in front of me. But it does matter about the rent growth that we've seen in each asset for each property and how we underwrote it initially that all plays into fact where we are in the capital stack. But like I said, we do a thorough scrub and we feel comfortable with the book. Yeah. It's a small component of our monthly collections. We are collecting a little bit every month on that past due rent, because we have hit their credit and gone after them. and because of our conservative approach to how we account for bad debt, whereby, if you're delinquent after 30 days, we reserve against it in the financials, when we go and hit their credit and they need their credit, they will start to pay. So we've -- it is a recurring part of our income given how we account for it, but it's hard to quantify, and it is lumpy. It moves around month-to-month. And we do expect it will be a reoccurring part for the foreseeable future given we have over $130 million in uncollected rent. But it will be a small part, but it will be drips and drabs. Yeah. And I think, John, just to add to that. I think the mix of jobs has been -- we've seen a change in mix over the last year as the high-quality jobs have not been added in mostly service sector, as Angela mentioned earlier. And I think that, that is -- we just don't see that changing in this environment given the slow economy. So -- that could change. That would be upside to the forecast, but it's not our base case at this point. And that's what's driving the below average. We still have our investment in the asset. But because our -- the loan and our investment matures in October of this year, and because we don't feel we'll fully realize our valuation by the end of the term of our maturity of our loan, we impaired the asset, which is consistent with GAAP accounting rules. We do believe in the asset long term and the market long term, we're obviously in a very depressed market in Oakland. And but it's going to take time for that market to recover. We need to see supply abate, which we will start to happen in 2025 and really into 2026. And that should bring -- bring rents up. And so that will help our investment long term. The sponsor continues to fund equity shortfalls and is actively putting money into the project, and we are working actively with them on the refi that will be coming up here in the fall. Yes. So yes, and we can take the example of what happened in September, October. We got back hundreds of units or occupancy. So our delinquency dropped about 50 basis points, but our occupancy also dropped commensurately. And then when we backfilled, we gave back a little bit on the rent growth. And so there was a small impact to the bottom line, but it didn't all fall to the bottom line. Long-term, it's beneficial for us. But there is a temporary headwind, especially if you get the units back in a low demand period because then you have to give concessions to backfill -- to backfill those units. If we get the units back during peak leasing season, and we have a strong leasing season, there will be less impact to occupancy and rent growth. Yes, Linda, we are -- this is Barb. We are pursuing every avenue to try to collect on that money, whether it be taken to small claims court, we've being their credit -- and like we are collecting a little bit here and there, but it depends on when they need their credit. And when they need their credit, then they tend to come back and pay, but if they don't need their credit for a long time, then it can sit out there. But every avenue we can pursue, we are pursuing to try to collect on that money. Goodbye."

            "name": "Jessica Anderson",
            "content": "This is Jessica. I'll take that. With regards to the largest driver of the sequential improvement from Q4 to January, it was 150 basis points. We saw the greatest improvement in Northern California and the Bay Area. And a large part of that was concession burn-off. For the total portfolio, if you break down a 150 basis point improvement, 100 basis points of it is the improvement in concessions. So, we were averaging one week in Q4 and that's a half a week for January. And then the other part of it, 50 basis points is attributed to rent growth, which is typical with what we would expect this time of year historically. Eric, this is Jessica. As far as renewal burn off, Barb mentioned it earlier, right now, it's roughly 50/50, and it becomes less so with regards to concession burn-off as we progress through Q1. Our concession strategy last year, I think we averaged roughly half week free last year, and there were some lumpiness as we dealt with delinquent units. So we may see that show up periodically. But with regards to forward-looking renewals we've sent out February and March at roughly 3%, 3.5%, and it's a little bit less than 50/50. It's probably more like 60/40, and it will continue to progress that way like I said, unless we have pockets of heavy concession usage from last year. Hi, Michael, this is Jessica. I can provide you some basics, I guess, as far as how leasing fundamentals are going in our markets. And it's really trending as expected in all of our markets. Right now, when we're looking at things like lead volume is steadily increasing, which is what we would expect this time of year, and then also leasing activity overall is stable. As far as quantifying it goes, I mean, we really see that increase in demand that we would expect, of course, correlates to whatever sequential rent growth that we see. And we pointed that out earlier, we saw good growth in both NorCal and Seattle. And that's something that is in part due to concession burn off. Those are our most seasonal markets. So we do expect them to grow more substantially on a sequential basis. But overall, they're performing as expected, in line with what we would expect at the time of the year."

We've been in this business for a long time and remain committed to us and our investment thesis along the West Coast. So there is demand there if we see the right opportunities. And we would expect we will see some opportunities in the next year or two. Hi, Rich. I'll echo what many of our peers have said is we're not currently seeing much distressed selling at all in our markets given the amount of debt coming due in the next couple of years, we anticipate there should be some opportunities, but as of yet, we have yet to really see any force selling. So we are keeping our eyes open and looking for opportunities, but nothing as of yet. Buck, it's a good question. Obviously, investment returns driven by what you pay. So we are paying attention to everything that's coming to market, and we'll keep an open mind to any investment. A major consideration for us is also making sure that we are acquiring near our existing footprints, given our unique operating model. We think we can add a lot of value when it's purchased when we buy something near an existing asset collection. Now as you know, the majority of those assets happen to be in the suburban market, and that is where we're primarily focused. They also have fewer quality of life issues currently. So, a simple answer is we are very focused in our suburban footprint, but we will keep an open mind to anything that crosses our broader markets."

Statements made in this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found on the company's filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Angela Kleiman, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Ms. Kleiman, you may begin.\nAngela Kleiman: Good morning, and thank you for joining Essex\u2019s third quarter earnings call. Barb Pak and Jessica Anderson will follow with prepared remarks and Rylan Burns is here for Q&A. My comments today will focus on how we performed to date. Our initial outlook for 2024 and a brief update on the investment markets. Overall, 2023 has unfolded generally in-line with our expectations. We increased our same-property revenue and NOI growth in middle of the year, despite a challenging operating environment, with almost 2% of rent delinquent for the first nine months of the year. For context, this delinquency level is approximately five times our historical average. The unprecedented eviction protections enacted during COVID exacerbated by subsequent court delays has resulted in protractive exposure to non-paying tenants and uncertainty on timing of when we could recapture these units. That said, we made considerable progress reducing delinquency as a percentage of rent, which is now at 1.3% in October, this improvement has naturally resulted in a temporary trade-off between rate growth and occupancy but has proven to be an optimal strategy to maximize revenues as we make progress towards normalization in our markets. Looking ahead to 2024, we plan to publish a more comprehensive outlook for the West Coast in conjunction with our full year guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call. For now, we have provided our initial 2024 supply outlook for our market on S-17 of the supplemental which forecasts total supply growth of only 0.5% of total housing stock. Unlike many other US markets, total housing supply in our markets is expected to remain at low level. And we do not see a near-term catalyst for increasing housing supply growth in the Essex markets. This supply landscape also minimizes our risk to job growth relative to other markets, especially if we encounter a softer demand environment and will be a tailwind for Essex when the economy accelerates. While muted supply is part of our thesis, we also see conditions that could drive demand for housing. First, after a year of retrenchment, layoff in the tech industry appears to be slowing and return to office is gaining momentum, with percent of remote job hiring at the largest tech companies now in the low single-digits. Implying that once tech hiring resumes in a meaningful way, job growth will be highly concentrated near major employment centers. Second, it remains to be seen, how the artificial intelligence industry will grow. We know that success in this industry will require immense scale and capital resources, and these types of companies are largely concentrated in the Bay Area and Seattle. Third, affordability, particularly in Northern California. Today, the Bay Aera is as affordable as we've seen since we began tracking this data, and we expect this will provide a long runway for rent growth. In summary, the combination of this potential demand backdrop and a muted supply outlook gives us confidence that the West Coast is well positioned to outperform in the long-run. Lastly, an update on the apartment investment markets. Deal activity slowed further in the third quarter, as interest rates increased sharply in recent months, compressing perspective returns and resulting in many buyers remaining on the sidelines. We have seen several marketed deals not transact this year as sellers await a less volatile interest rate environment. There is little evidence to suggest transaction activity will pick-up in the near term as bid-ask spread remains wide. We have navigated through many economic cycles and our finance team has done an excellent job in fortifying the balance sheet, which positions Essex well for any environment. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barb.\nBarb Pak: Thanks Angela. Today, I will discuss our third quarter results, along with investments and the balance sheet. Starting with our third quarter performance. I'm pleased to report that core FFO per share for the quarter came in $0.03 ahead of our midpoint. The outperformance was driven by slightly higher revenues, other income and lower G&A expenses, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Most of the deals in the third quarter is timing related. As such, we are reiterating the midpoint of our full year core FFO per share and same-property revenue, expense and NOI growth. As it relates to operating expense [Technical Difficulty] which increased by only 1% due to the favorable outcome we received in Seattle. As we look to 2024, we expect operating expenses will remain elevated, primarily driven by non-controllable items such as insurance and utilities. In addition, the tax benefit we received in Washington share is not expected to repeat in 2024. However, it should be noted that we have done a good job over the past four years improving the operating efficiency of the platform, which has led to modest increase in our controllable expenses. Since 2019, our controllable expenses have increased around 2.75% annually despite elevated inflationary pressures and higher costs related to our delinquent units during this period. This favorable outcome is primarily driven by the rollout of Phase 1 of our property collections model. As always, we are continuously looking for ways to improve efficiencies within the platform in order to optimize our cost structure. Turning to investments. For the year, we expect preferred equity redemptions to be around $70 million as we anticipate being fully repaid on a $40 million investment in the fourth quarter. As we look to 2024, we expect redemptions within our preferred equity book to be around $100 million. While we are actively looking for new deals to replace these investments, there could be a timing mismatch in terms of when we get repaid and when we can reinvest. We are finding there are still significant capital sources eager to invest in this portion of the capital stack, while at the same time projects with reasonable return expectations are becoming harder to find. We will remain disciplined in this environment, leaning on our deep network on the West Coast to source deals at attractive risk adjusted returns. Turning to capital markets and the balance sheet. In July, we closed $298 million in ten-year secured loans at a fixed rate of 5.08%. The proceeds were used -- will be used to repay our 2024 consolidated maturities. We were proactive in refinancing our debt early in today's volatile rate environment, locking in favorable financing ahead of the recent acceleration in treasury yields. As such, the company is well positioned with minimal financing needs over the next 18 months. We are pleased that our net-debt to EBITDA ratio continues to trend lower and stands at 5.5 times today as compared to 5.8 times one year ago. With over $1.6 billion in liquidity, the balance sheet remains a source of strength. I'll now turn the call over to Jessica Anderson.\nJessica Anderson: Thanks Barb. My comments today will cover our recent operating results and strategy, followed by an update on our delinquency progress and regional highlights. Operating results were solid for the quarter including same-property revenue growth of 3.2% on a year-over-year basis. We experienced a normal peak leasing season across all markets. Market rents peaked in August, at 6% growth year-to-date compared to December 2022 and has subsequently moderated by 10 basis points in September, which is consistent with typical seasonality. While we took advantage of opportunities to push rents during peak season, we shifted back to an occupancy focused strategy midway through the third quarter as we began to recapture a larger volume of units from non-paying tenants. This shift in strategy tempered our blended trade-out rates in Q3 which were similar to Q2 at 2.1%. Renewal growth rates were healthy at 3% in Q3 and 5.3% in October, boosting our blended trade-out rates while new lease growth was muted at 1.2% for Q3, reflecting new lease incentives to backfill recently vacated non-paying units. Eviction related move-outs increased in September, allowing for improvement in delinquency as a percentage of rents to 1.9% in September and even further improvement in October to 1.3%. Several of our markets such as Santa Clara, San Mateo and San Diego have returned to delinquency levels close to the long-term run rate. Los Angeles and Alameda County remained elevated, but significant progress is also being made in these areas after protections expired earlier in the year. As Angela mentioned, the improvement in delinquency will result in a temporary tradeoff with new lease growth and occupancy, which can be seen in our preliminary October numbers, but we view this progress, as a positive for the company. Consistent with our approach all year, we remain nimble and will shift our strategy as necessary to maximize revenue in any operating environment. Finally, I want to thank the Essex team for their diligent efforts this past quarter. They've been a major driver of the improvement we've achieved. Moving on to regional specific commentary. Beginning with Seattle, this market has performed as expected this year. Blended net effective rent growth averaged 0.5% for the quarter, improving 70 basis-points from Q2. Despite nominal trade-out growth, demand fundamentals were solid in Q3 and I'm pleased with the recovery of this market after a slow start to the year. Market rents in this region were the first to peak in July on par with a typical year and we anticipate a normal seasonal moderation although higher levels of supply deliveries in the fourth quarter may have an impact on pricing. Turning to Northern California, blended net effective rent growth averaged 1.4% for the quarter, consistent with Q2. Market rents peaked in late August later than normal, an indicator of solid fundamentals in this market. Santa Clara was our top-performing market for the quarter as outlined on page S-9 of the supplemental. The ongoing return to office along with corporate housing activity contributed to these positive quarterly results. San Francisco and Oakland CBD, which account for a small portion of our NOI, have lagged the regional average. Oakland continues to be impacted by supply, which is expected to continue into 2024. Lastly, Southern California continues to be our top-performing region led by San Diego. Market rents in Southern California were last to peak in mid-September and blended net effective rates remained resilient at 3.7%, despite the headwinds in Los Angeles, our market most impacted by delinquency. In October, delinquency in Los Angeles was at 4.6%, reflecting a 2.1% improvement since the start of the year. We anticipate making continued progress on delinquency in Los Angeles and as such we expect rents and occupancy in this area to be more volatile in the near-term. In summary, we are encouraged by the improvement we are seeing on the delinquency front and expect continued progress, heading into next year. As we conclude the balance of the year, we remain focused on preserving occupancy and positioning the portfolio favorably, heading into 2024. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Great, thank you. Jessica, you highlighted that you've shifted your strategy from pushing new lease rate growth to growing occupancy, due in part to the elevated move outs of non-paying tenants. But from what I recall, the guidance assumes both an improvement in cash delinquency and re-acceleration in new lease rate growth towards that high 2% range in the back-half of the year. So, I guess I'm just curious if anything else changed from a demand perspective that also contributed to that shift in sort of operating strategy?\nJessica Anderson: Well, just to emphasize, we are on-track for the year. And as mentioned in my prepared remarks, there is essentially a trade-out. We did expect delinquency to stay elevated above the 1.3% that we reported for October. So that is lower than we had planned although we had experienced the trade-out with occupancy and our new lease -- new lease trade-out rate. So as far as demand goes, all of the markets are performing as expected as we move into the seasonal slow period and we're encouraged by recapturing the non-paying units because it will position us well as we head into 2024.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Got it, that's helpful. And then can you just remind me -- I know you guys report financial occupancy, but does that capture cash delinquency or is that figure more reflection of gross potential rent? Thank you.\nJessica Anderson: Financial occupancy does not include delinquency.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Understood. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Wolfe with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nEric Wolfe: Hey thanks. Just curious what you think drove the decline in delinquencies in October sort of specifically versus, say, two months ago and -- even a couple of months ago. Some of your peers started seeing it. Do you think that the improvement is sustainable going-forward?\nJessica Anderson: Hi, Eric, this is Jessica. Well, we're definitely encouraged by the improvement that we've seen in October and there is several factors that are contributing to that. The first is, for all of our areas outside of Los Angeles and Alameda, protections expired in July last year and at the time we were reporting that evictions we're taking in the range of 10 to 12 months and some longer. And so now that we're a year, plus into those areas, we are seeing a lot of those units have made their way through the system. And in the move-up that we're experiencing. As far as Los Angeles and Alameda go, those protections expired earlier in the year and those tenants are realizing that there are no more protections. There is no more emergency rental assistance. So overall, the tenant sentiment has changed and there is a greater sense of urgency. So we are seeing increased move outs as tenants are realizing this. And as far as forward-looking, one month certainly doesn't make a trend and we've seen some choppiness in delinquency as we've worked through it, the last couple of years, but we're certainly encouraged by our recent results and we're going to be monitoring that closely, and we'll have more information on our fourth quarter earnings call.\nEric Wolfe: All right, that's helpful. I guess leads to my second question which is around the -- you dropping through new lease rates, the increased occupancy of non-paying tenants. I guess, how long would you sort of expect that process to take? And would you expect new lease rates to sort of go back up to that sort of 2.8% that you discussed on the last call or should renewals have to come down? Because, I think you also talked about renewals tending to follow new lease. So just trying to understand how long new lease rates will be depressed and if we should also expect renewals to come down to follow them?\nJessica Anderson: All right. Let me tackle that. I'll tackle new leases then renewals. So as far as what we can expect for new lease rates through the quarter. I expect those to remain muted. We have come into a period of easier comps, but since we've increased incentives to backfill these units, that's going to mask some of that progress. And overall, we view that as a positive. I think it's neutral over the short-term, with only a couple of months left in the year, but a positive as we look to 2024, because essentially we have people occupying units that are not paying rent. And so if that unit becomes vacant, it's not vacancy, but essentially that's neutral trade-out. And we're offering concessions to refill -- backfill these units as quickly as possible. And at that point, you have somebody occupying the unit that will be paying full market rent in the near term. So it sets us up favorably for 2024. And with regards to renewals. renewals is where you're seeing our comp show up. Renewals are insulated from some of the choppiness of the day-to-day pricing strategy as we've increased incentives to backfill these units. But what you're seeing in October is essentially 50-50 gross rent growth and then also concession burn-off in that 5.3%. And I expect for the quarter, renewals will be pretty consistent. We've sent them out around 5% and we'll monitor conditions closely. We may negotiate those a little bit, but expect those to be fairly consistent through Q4.\nEric Wolfe: Got it, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.\nDaniel Tricarico: Hey. It's Daniel Tricarico with Nick. Thanks for taking the question. First question is on market rent growth thoughts for next year. With the 0.5% supply growth you gave in the sub, just curious what sort of demand environment would drive negative market rent growth next year, given that supply backdrop? Just looking to sensitize possible outcomes.\nAngela Kleiman: Yeah, that's a good question. It's Angela here. We -- one of the reasons why we held off on publishing our macro outlook is because we listen to our investors feedback to better understand the value of publishing that outlook because that ultimately impacts our view on market rent growth. And we have decided not to change -- I mean to change our approach to -- so we would provide the outlook early next year so it aligns better with the timing and the release of our guidance. And so -- I wanted to give you that backdrop, but ultimately the market fundamentals really are going to be impacted by a couple of factors. And we start with looking at the third-party macroeconomist forecast, which is still evolving and we've not seen anyone with a robust outlook, but it is too early to predict. What we will say is that Essex is in a better position relative to other markets due to low supply that you mentioned earlier, which of course reduces the risk to rent growth and of course having some potential upside when it comes to future demand. And so those are all the different moving pieces that we are evaluating at this time.\nDaniel Tricarico: No, that's good. Thanks for that, Angela. And the next question would be on just your different regions. SoCal has been your strongest, but curious if you could see that gap to Northern California and Seattle remaining or maybe converging next year. Any thoughts on the puts and takes there? Thank you.\nAngela Kleiman: Well. I think, Northern California is our steady Eddie market and it has a profile -- employment profile that's similar to that of the US, but with higher level of professional services. So the land remains constant. In Northern California, we do expect that recovery will come. Of course, the timing is the question, right and so ultimately it should outperform, if nothing for the sake of it's still in the recovery mode. And so that's how we're thinking about the two regions.\nDaniel Tricarico: Great, thanks for the time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Sakwa: Yeah, thanks. First, Jessica, could you provide a kind of a loss to lease [Technical Difficulty] and an earn-in figure for the portfolio?\nJessica Anderson: [Technical Difficulty] is consistent with periods pre-COVID, the three years average pre-COVID. And as far as earning goes, typically in the past we look at using roughly 50%, maybe a little bit more of that loss to lease number, which gets us to roughly 70 basis points or 100 basis points. And then we'll look at whatever our market rent forecast is for the year and take 50% of that and it's still early and we'll be evaluating that and providing more information on our fourth quarter. We do see some other building blocks as far as earning for next year with some other income initiatives as well that will contribute to revenue growth as well next year.\nSteve Sakwa: Great, thanks. And then maybe just on the investment side, I guess, I think Barb might have talked about some repayment of some of the preferred investments. I guess just what are you seeing in the marketplace today from other developers or other investors who might be in trouble form a financing perspective?\nRylan Burns: Hi, Steve, Rylan here. We are still seeing a few opportunities. I would say just a little historical context. The majority of our deals up until last year were development based. This year it's been a mix, I would say about 50-50 between development and stabilized recaps and I anticipate next year we're going to see more opportunities for stabilized properties that are seeking recaps. We've seen several deals in the past couple of years with above 50% leverage and very low-interest rates capped or swap that will roll in the next few years at a very different interest-rate environment. So with limited NOI growth we've seen in several of our markets, we think there are going to be opportunities to put some capital to work.\nSteve Sakwa: Great, thanks. That's it from me.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Yeah, hey guys. I appreciate that your markets have lower supply than a lot of other markets out there across the country. But just kind of curious on what you're seeing as far as demand goes in San Francisco and Seattle and then maybe what do we need to see to kind of see an acceleration of that demand in those markets?\nAngela Kleiman: Hey, it's Angela here. I think on the demand side for Northern California, we do want to acknowledge that it remains soft, but I do think that we got two things happening. One is from a year-over-year comp perspective, September was still quite robust last year because that was before the tech sectors began their retrenchment. And at this point what we're seeing is that, that has stabilized and so that's a -- definitely a good indicator. As far as other indications, we look at, of course, unemployment claims that remain stable and WARN notices, it's back to pre-COVID levels. So that all points to that the market is functioning as it should. In terms of looking forward, we do think that the technology sector, the hiring needs to return in a more robust way. It\u2019s -- this is -- what it looks like is that they're going through kind of the tail end of the retrenchment and so we do see light at the end of the tunnel from that perspective. And of course, having the remote job hiring, which is now in 8% versus it was 25% last year, and of course 100% during COVID, that need to continue to decline, and which we expect that to happen. And then, of course, the last piece is really the international migration, which has been quite muted as a result of COVID and of course, the various retrenchment. And so with those three elements, those are all potential upside for our markets.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay, appreciate that color. And then maybe just one quick one and apologies if I missed this. But what does your guide assume for the rest of the year as far as new lease rate growth goes?\nBarb Pak: [Technical Difficulty] specific number that we need to achieve to hit the fourth quarter [Technical Difficulty] we got back a lot of units from non-paying tenants. It has had an impact to our occupancy, but there's a trade-off there. So there's a variety of factors that will play into the fourth quarter guidance, and there's not a specific rent growth number that we need to achieve because there\u2019s all the other factors play into it.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nJamie Feldman: Great. Thank you. Can you talk about for the occupancy first initiative in the first half. Do you think that sets you up for potential acceleration next year?\nJessica Anderson: Hi, Jamie, this is Jessica. Can you clarify your question, were you talking the first half of 2023? [indiscernible]\nJamie Feldman: Yeah. I'm just thinking about what the year-over-year comps could be into next year. Like, where did you push harder in the first half of '23 that you may get the benefit. It might be harder to have the comps for the first half of '24 both on occupancy by market and also by rents?\nJessica Anderson: Yes, I understand what you're saying. Yeah, year-to-date, occupancy, I believe we're sitting about 96.5% and right now we floated down to 95.9%, but again there is a trade out. So, it's revenue neutral over the short term, but potentially positive as we head into 2024. So where we're heading right now with occupancy, it's hard to peg exactly where we'll end the year. As I mentioned, we remain focused on occupancy and back selling units. It's a seasonally slow period, so it's uncertain how much progress we'll be able to make with occupancy over the short term. So with that said, as we head into the year, we certainly could be lower than last year. But stable is what my expectation is from an occupancy perspective. But there's other components that will add to a favorable revenue outcome as we see our delinquency come down. And as far as occupancy, by area, I mean, generally speaking, we're seeing our stronger occupancies in Orange County, San Diego, Ventura. Seattle is performing quite well now and having quite a stable seasonal slowdown, particularly when compared to last year, and it's sitting around 96%. Los Angeles is 95.4% and I would expect that market to be particularly impacted with a lower occupancy, but again an upside on the delinquency front. And the Bay Area is also sitting around 96%. Does that answer your question?\nJamie Feldman: Yeah, that's helpful. Thank you. And then, I guess, just switching gears, to the investment here to investment potential. I mean, you mentioned Oakland. I mean, some of these sub-markets, you saw better opportunities or better pricing?\nRylan Burns: Hey, Jamie. Rylan, here. I would say, we are open to any good investment opportunity subject to the conditions that are presented to us. At a high level, as we've talked about, we are relatively bullish on the prospects for Northern California on the next several years, and I think Angela has reiterated several of reasons for that case. Oakland will be challenged for the next year or two given the supply that went out there. So it would have to be a pretty compelling investment opportunity. But it's -- we are open and eagerly looking for opportunities in all of our core markets.\nJamie Feldman: Okay, all right. Thanks, Rylan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brad Heffern with RBC. Please proceed with your question.\nBrad Heffern: Hey, everybody. Can you talk about some of the return to office mandates you've been watching like we saw with Meta in September. And has there been a noticeable impact in leasing activity on the ground from those?\nAngela Kleiman: The return to office mandate that we've [Technical Difficulty] what I mean by that is, last year, when the tech employers announced they had to make some adjustments, they had said, three days, and then they moved back to two days, and they were still hiring remotely. This year, what we're seeing is that the rehiring -- the remote hiring has stopped and, in fact, it's become policy. And, of course, the return to office has been gaining momentum. It's difficult to point exactly to our financial lease rates because we're in the middle of working through the evictions and delinquency issue, and that's taking precedent. So there's a lot of noise in that. Certainly we expect that that's been a benefit, but to [Technical Difficulty] straightforward as possible at this point.\nBrad Heffern: Okay, understood. And then concessions have come up a few times on the call. I'm just curious if you could walk through the individual markets and just give the average concession that you're offering right now?\nJessica Anderson: [Technical Difficulty] offering across the portfolio with an average of one week free and [Technical Difficulty] units as they come in and adjust as needed to manage our new lease velocity. As far as by-market, we have the largest volume of concessions concentrated in pockets. Southern California is still generally just a few days outside of Los Angeles, and we're seeing larger concessions in Los Angeles areas, the Bay Area. And then Seattle surprisingly is only a few days at this point. As, I mentioned a few minutes ago, it's been a very stable seasonal slowdown in that market.\nBrad Heffern: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nAdam Kramer: Hey guys, thanks for the time. Just a couple of questions on kind of a couple different demand drivers you guys have touched on in the past. I think one would just be -- some of kind of be in-migration to your markets, right? And that could be overseas tech workers, visas, other kind of immigration factors. Just want to maybe kind of walk through that because I know there's a lot of focus on the outward migration. Maybe just kind of thinking about the in-migration to your markets. And then the other kind of demand driver question is just on kind of the end of the, writer strike, actor strike, if that -- what potential impact that could have on your business?\nAngela Kleiman: Hey, Adam. It's Angela here. Good question on the in-migration. Those -- the data on that front is not as readily available, but what we've been tracking is really the move-ins. And as I've mentioned last year, we saw a good uptick and I think part of that relates to really a recovery and since then it's been steady. And so the in-migration data into our markets from outside of California and Washington have generally remained steady. The piece that we're still missing actually is the international migration part of it. And I do think that, that will return and just not as immediate at this point. And as far as the hospitality industries, it's very telling that when we look at the drivers of job growth in the third quarter, it's mainly education and healthcare and other services. Hospitality and leisure was very muted. And we do think that that's partly attributed to the strike. And so we do think that, that could be a potential demand catalyst as well.\nAdam Kramer: Great, thanks. I'll leave it there. I appreciate the time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nWes Golladay: Hi everyone. You mentioned getting -- I think, repaid on $100 million extra in the structured finance. Do you have a timing estimate on that? Do you -- is there any chance you extend that? And then when looking at the entire structured finance book, is there any geographic concentration?\nBarb Pak: Hi Wes, it's Barb. I think for now you could assume mid-year on the $100 million is probably a safe assumption. I think we have some in the first half of the year and some in the back half of the year. So mid-year assumption is good there. And then in terms of geographic concentration, our portfolio is actually, it mirrors our actual portfolio in terms of our investments. So about 40% in Northern California, 40% in Southern California, and 20% in Seattle is how the portfolio aligns in terms of where it's located geographically.\nWes Golladay: Great. That's all from me.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Kim: Thank you. On the 5.3% renewal rate growth achieved in October, can you break that down between how much of that was rate growth versus concession burn-off from a year ago?\nJessica Anderson: Hi, John, it's Jessica. Yes, that -- it's roughly 50-50. So we're seeing about 2.5% to 2.8% or so in rate growth and then the rest is concession burn-off.\nJohn Kim: So when you compare the concessions that you mentioned earlier that you're offering versus the year-ago, is that additive to rental rate growth going forward?\nJessica Anderson: Where we sit right now it is additive. So last year we were at roughly two weeks, pretty consistently across Q4. And right now, we're sitting at a week. Like I said earlier, we may increase the volume of concessions and the amount, but we'll monitor that. But as of right now, that's a positive.\nJohn Kim: Okay. Has there been an update on the gross delinquency outlook for the second half of this year, it was last at 1.9%. I think you basically there, including October, has that changed at all?\nBarb Pak: Hi, John, it's Barb. We didn't make any changes to our guidance for the full year. We believe we're on target for that. There may be puts and takes and if delinquency does come in favorable, there maybe a trade-off with occupancy. And so net-net, we're in line with our full year guidance.\nJohn Kim: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Pawlowski with Green Street. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Pawlowski: Good morning, thanks for the time. Barb, I have a question about the potential deferred repair and maintenance and CapEx costs that might be in the portfolio today associated with delinquent tenants. Have you -- could you give us an order on that, a sense, like an order of magnitude of the total amount of dollars you think that needs to get spent over the coming years on these units? I'm just trying to get a sense of whether early innings is seeing the cost flow through from evictions or you've already worked through most of it?\nAngela Kleiman: Hey, John, it's Angela here. So let me give you just a high-level answer to that, because, frankly, what we're seeing is the turnover as it relates to delinquent tenants is not -- the higher level of CapEx is not material relative to in the past when we have delinquent tenants and some actually have just decided to leave. And so the turnover just sort of natural turn, and there's going to be bad actors from time to time, but once again, it's at a comparable rate as pre-COVID. And so that's why there isn't a number that Barb can point to. Our CapEx at this point is really more driven by other activities like storm damage and as far as the eviction is concerned, it's a higher volume, but it's not greater damage because of evictions.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. Maybe shifting over to the private market, and I joined the call a few minutes late, so apologies if I missed this, but Rylan, I'm curious where you think market clearing cap rates are right now in kind of the urban cores of San Fran and San Jose, I imagine they're pretty close to redline right now. So I'm just curious, what type of pricing do you think buyers and sellers might agree on pricing in the kind of urban high-rise environment in San Fran, San Jose?\nRylan Burns: Hey John, I appreciate the question. I hesitate to give you a specific number, because as you are well aware, when there is not any transactions, it's very difficult to pinpoint where buyers are. I also would take some pause with the idea of a redlining a whole city. We are still seeing -- or we've seen some transactions occur, year-to-date, and the buyer profile is different than what we've typically seen. I think you're seeing some family office buyers who are coming in and looking at the basis versus replacement costs that are still continuing to transact in some of these sub-markets that you mentioned. So obviously a challenged market fundamentally over the past year or two, but as those turn, I suspect you're going to see people, investors come back in and -- so I'll leave it at that, without giving you a specific number, but hopefully that color is helpful.\nJohn Pawlowski: Yeah, no, it definitely is. Maybe one follow-up. Just curious, I know you've been talking more suburban over the last few years. What -- like what pricing becomes interesting to you to go back into these urban markets that have not really healed from COVID? What kind of range of cap rates would you be willing to be a buyer at?\nRylan Burns: Thanks, John. Another good question. As you know, we force rank our 30 plus sub-markets and forecast a rent growth for five years, forward looking based on our fundamental analysis. And so the cap rates have to accommodate for a higher IRR based on those rent growth estimates. So there is a price at which we would be willing to invest in these submarkets. I will say, given the performance we've seen over the past several years with the suburban strongly outperforming and where we're looking at supply for the next few years, I would think, on average, incremental dollars will go towards our portfolio investments that look similar to what our portfolio mix currently is demonstrating. But there is a price and we have our -- we're turning over every rock and looking for opportunities and I'm optimistic we're going to see more in the next few years.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay, thanks for the time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Connor Mitchell with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\nConnor Mitchell: Hey, thanks for the time. Just wanted to follow up on some of the in-migration discussion. Would you be able to kind of give a waiting or the amount of impact that you're expecting from international migration maybe compared to historical figures, whether that's 10% of the growth compared to the current return to office we're looking for? How much of an impact do you think that could have versus the other demand factors looking forward?\nAngela Kleiman: Hey Connor, It's Angela here. That's a good question. The one thing I can point you to is California historically has a negative net in-migration, so 17 out of the last 20 years, even during years when we have significant growth. And so -- but once you factor in international, net migration becomes positive. As far as the exact percentage, that's influenced by a lot of factors. It's influenced by, of course, supply and the demand and where the macroeconomy generally is. And of course it's influenced by the affordability ratio. So I don't think I could do you justice by making a straight line from migration number to a absolute percentage of increase.\nConnor Mitchell: Yeah, of course. And then, just another question. You've talked about the secured financing a little bit. So after you issued the secured debt earlier this year recently, just wondering if you could give an update on how the unsecured market is looking now versus the secured market and whether there's been any narrowing of the spreads? The unsecured market has improved a little bit since then. Thanks.\nBarb Pak: Yeah, this is Barb. So on the unsecured bond market for us today, we would probably be in the high 6% range to do a 10-year unsecured bond offering. And if we were to go do a secured loan, 10-year secured loan like we did, I think we're in around a mid-six. So there has been a little bit of a narrowing from when we originally did our secured loan back in July, but there hasn't been a lot of transactions on unsecured bond market as well. And so it's a little unknown at this time. But we feel good about where we executed and our capital needs for next year. We don't have a lot of capital needs next year.\nConnor Mitchell: Appreciate the color. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.\nHaendel St. Juste: Hey guys. Couple quick ones for me. First, Angela, I guess I'm curious, any perspective on -- there's an article in New York Times the other day, in it called -- California called -- slam San Francisco for egregious barriers to housing I think was the header. So I'm curious if you have any thoughts on this. Certainly the idea of low barrier to entry, low supply in California is the key theme, key part of the thesis there. So I'm curious if there's any perhaps updated perspective reviews on the barriers to building, if there's any changes that are being contemplated that could be real and how that could impact the marketplace? Thanks.\nAngela Kleiman: Hey, Haendel. It's Angela here. It's a good question, I think. We've all seen the acute housing shortage in California and despite Governor Newsom's efforts to enact multiple legislations to spur housing production, it just has not moved the needle in a meaningful way. And you may recall that he campaigned on building 3.5 million homes by 2025. And as part of that, there were numerous legislation passed and even recently a few more passed. But that barrier continues because there is a cost barrier, there is -- as part of legislations they enacted requiring prevailing wages, there's environmental protections and so it just is very challenging. And so I go back to that original goal of 3.5 million homes that to be built by 2025. Currently they're on track and have issued about 450,000 permits. So now units built and we're two years away. So that gives you the magnitude of how we view supply and why we do believe that it will remain favorable. And when we look at the permit data, it remains very low as well.\nHaendel St. Juste: Got it, got it, thank you for that. And then one more, I believe, earlier you mentioned that concessions in San Francisco, broadly in your portfolio average, one week. I was hoping you could bifurcate that a bit further, maybe San Francisco proper versus down in Peninsula. Thank you.\nJessica Anderson: Hello, this is Jessica. I don't have that information in front of me. I mean, San Francisco is such a small market for us with just a 1,000 units and a couple of large buildings. But like I said, as far as what we're currently offering, I would say roughly one week free with a little bit more in pockets of the Bay Area like San Jose. Oakland is supply impacted, so we have higher concessions there. Seattle, very minimal concessions. All of Southern California outside of Los Angeles, minimal concessions.\nHaendel St. Juste: Thank you.\nOperator: Our final question is from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nLinda Tsai: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Over the next 12 months across, which markets would you expect the highest rent growth and how much faster might growth be in these markets versus your portfolio average?\nAngela Kleiman: Hi It's Angela here. We do expect our Northern region to outpace the southern region, and so particularly Northern California and Seattle, and for different reasons. Northern California much lower supply and of course will have a benefit ultimately from the tech hiring when they come. And Seattle, it's been our strongest job growth market, but Seattle also has a higher level of supply, about two times of that of California as a percentage. So about 1% of stock versus 0.5%. Having said that, both of these markets, particularly in Northern region are rebounding and of course, Northern California, as I've mentioned before, has a much better affordability metric. And so for those reasons, we do expect the Northern region to outperformed the Southern regions.\nLinda Tsai: And then just one quick follow-up on expenses. Given the commentary about higher utility insurance costs in '24 , do you see more markets where this is more pronounced versus others?\nBarb Pak: Yeah, this is Barb. No, on the insurance front, it's just a broad -- it's actually a national issue, not an Essex, Pacific or West Coast issue. We're just seeing a lot of pressure on insurance cost and we expect that to continue. It's been an issue in '23, we expect that issue in '24. And then on the utilities front, we're up about 6% year-to-date, and we do expect that utility pressures will continue to be above inflationary levels near term, despite all the ESG efforts we're putting into place. And so those two will cause expense growth to be elevated next year.\nLinda Tsai: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and we thank you for your participation.\nAngela Kleiman: Goodbye.",

My comments today will focus on how we performed to date. Our initial outlook for 2024 and a brief update on the investment markets. Overall, 2023 has unfolded generally in-line with our expectations. We increased our same-property revenue and NOI growth in middle of the year, despite a challenging operating environment, with almost 2% of rent delinquent for the first nine months of the year. For context, this delinquency level is approximately five times our historical average. The unprecedented eviction protections enacted during COVID exacerbated by subsequent court delays has resulted in protractive exposure to non-paying tenants and uncertainty on timing of when we could recapture these units. That said, we made considerable progress reducing delinquency as a percentage of rent, which is now at 1.3% in October, this improvement has naturally resulted in a temporary trade-off between rate growth and occupancy but has proven to be an optimal strategy to maximize revenues as we make progress towards normalization in our markets. Looking ahead to 2024, we plan to publish a more comprehensive outlook for the West Coast in conjunction with our full year guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call. For now, we have provided our initial 2024 supply outlook for our market on S-17 of the supplemental which forecasts total supply growth of only 0.5% of total housing stock. Unlike many other US markets, total housing supply in our markets is expected to remain at low level. And we do not see a near-term catalyst for increasing housing supply growth in the Essex markets. This supply landscape also minimizes our risk to job growth relative to other markets, especially if we encounter a softer demand environment and will be a tailwind for Essex when the economy accelerates. While muted supply is part of our thesis, we also see conditions that could drive demand for housing. First, after a year of retrenchment, layoff in the tech industry appears to be slowing and return to office is gaining momentum, with percent of remote job hiring at the largest tech companies now in the low single-digits. Implying that once tech hiring resumes in a meaningful way, job growth will be highly concentrated near major employment centers. Second, it remains to be seen, how the artificial intelligence industry will grow. We know that success in this industry will require immense scale and capital resources, and these types of companies are largely concentrated in the Bay Area and Seattle. Third, affordability, particularly in Northern California. Today, the Bay Aera is as affordable as we've seen since we began tracking this data, and we expect this will provide a long runway for rent growth. In summary, the combination of this potential demand backdrop and a muted supply outlook gives us confidence that the West Coast is well positioned to outperform in the long-run. Lastly, an update on the apartment investment markets. Deal activity slowed further in the third quarter, as interest rates increased sharply in recent months, compressing perspective returns and resulting in many buyers remaining on the sidelines. We have seen several marketed deals not transact this year as sellers await a less volatile interest rate environment. There is little evidence to suggest transaction activity will pick-up in the near term as bid-ask spread remains wide. We have navigated through many economic cycles and our finance team has done an excellent job in fortifying the balance sheet, which positions Essex well for any environment. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barb. Yeah, that's a good question. It's Angela here. We -- one of the reasons why we held off on publishing our macro outlook is because we listen to our investors feedback to better understand the value of publishing that outlook because that ultimately impacts our view on market rent growth. And we have decided not to change -- I mean to change our approach to -- so we would provide the outlook early next year so it aligns better with the timing and the release of our guidance. And so -- I wanted to give you that backdrop, but ultimately the market fundamentals really are going to be impacted by a couple of factors. And we start with looking at the third-party macroeconomist forecast, which is still evolving and we've not seen anyone with a robust outlook, but it is too early to predict. What we will say is that Essex is in a better position relative to other markets due to low supply that you mentioned earlier, which of course reduces the risk to rent growth and of course having some potential upside when it comes to future demand. And so those are all the different moving pieces that we are evaluating at this time. Well. I think, Northern California is our steady Eddie market and it has a profile -- employment profile that's similar to that of the US, but with higher level of professional services. So the land remains constant. In Northern California, we do expect that recovery will come. Of course, the timing is the question, right and so ultimately it should outperform, if nothing for the sake of it's still in the recovery mode. And so that's how we're thinking about the two regions. Hey, it's Angela here. I think on the demand side for Northern California, we do want to acknowledge that it remains soft, but I do think that we got two things happening. One is from a year-over-year comp perspective, September was still quite robust last year because that was before the tech sectors began their retrenchment. And at this point what we're seeing is that, that has stabilized and so that's a -- definitely a good indicator. As far as other indications, we look at, of course, unemployment claims that remain stable and WARN notices, it's back to pre-COVID levels. So that all points to that the market is functioning as it should. In terms of looking forward, we do think that the technology sector, the hiring needs to return in a more robust way. It's -- this is -- what it looks like is that they're going through kind of the tail end of the retrenchment and so we do see light at the end of the tunnel from that perspective. And of course, having the remote job hiring, which is now in 8% versus it was 25% last year, and of course 100% during COVID, that need to continue to decline, and which we expect that to happen. And then, of course, the last piece is really the international migration, which has been quite muted as a result of COVID and of course, the various retrenchment. And so with those three elements, those are all potential upside for our markets. The return to office mandate that we've [Technical Difficulty] what I mean by that is, last year, when the tech employers announced they had to make some adjustments, they had said, three days, and then they moved back to two days, and they were still hiring remotely. This year, what we're seeing is that the rehiring -- the remote hiring has stopped and, in fact, it's become policy. And, of course, the return to office has been gaining momentum. It's difficult to point exactly to our financial lease rates because we're in the middle of working through the evictions and delinquency issue, and that's taking precedent. So there's a lot of noise in that. Certainly we expect that that's been a benefit, but to [Technical Difficulty] straightforward as possible at this point. Hey, Adam. It's Angela here. Good question on the in-migration. Those -- the data on that front is not as readily available, but what we've been tracking is really the move-ins. And as I've mentioned last year, we saw a good uptick and I think part of that relates to really a recovery and since then it's been steady. And so the in-migration data into our markets from outside of California and Washington have generally remained steady. The piece that we're still missing actually is the international migration part of it. And I do think that, that will return and just not as immediate at this point. And as far as the hospitality industries, it's very telling that when we look at the drivers of job growth in the third quarter, it's mainly education and healthcare and other services. Hospitality and leisure was very muted. And we do think that that's partly attributed to the strike. And so we do think that, that could be a potential demand catalyst as well. Hey, John, it's Angela here. So let me give you just a high-level answer to that, because, frankly, what we're seeing is the turnover as it relates to delinquent tenants is not -- the higher level of CapEx is not material relative to in the past when we have delinquent tenants and some actually have just decided to leave. And so the turnover just sort of natural turn, and there's going to be bad actors from time to time, but once again, it's at a comparable rate as pre-COVID. And so that's why there isn't a number that Barb can point to. Our CapEx at this point is really more driven by other activities like storm damage and as far as the eviction is concerned, it's a higher volume, but it's not greater damage because of evictions. Hey Connor, It's Angela here. That's a good question. The one thing I can point you to is California historically has a negative net in-migration, so 17 out of the last 20 years, even during years when we have significant growth. And so -- but once you factor in international, net migration becomes positive. As far as the exact percentage, that's influenced by a lot of factors. It's influenced by, of course, supply and the demand and where the macroeconomy generally is. And of course it's influenced by the affordability ratio. So I don't think I could do you justice by making a straight line from migration number to a absolute percentage of increase. Hey, Haendel. It's Angela here. It's a good question, I think. We've all seen the acute housing shortage in California and despite Governor Newsom's efforts to enact multiple legislations to spur housing production, it just has not moved the needle in a meaningful way. And you may recall that he campaigned on building 3.5 million homes by 2025. And as part of that, there were numerous legislation passed and even recently a few more passed. But that barrier continues because there is a cost barrier, there is -- as part of legislations they enacted requiring prevailing wages, there's environmental protections and so it just is very challenging. And so I go back to that original goal of 3.5 million homes that to be built by 2025. Currently they're on track and have issued about 450,000 permits. So now units built and we're two years away. So that gives you the magnitude of how we view supply and why we do believe that it will remain favorable. And when we look at the permit data, it remains very low as well. Hi It's Angela here. We do expect our Northern region to outpace the southern region, and so particularly Northern California and Seattle, and for different reasons. Northern California much lower supply and of course will have a benefit ultimately from the tech hiring when they come. And Seattle, it's been our strongest job growth market, but Seattle also has a higher level of supply, about two times of that of California as a percentage. So about 1% of stock versus 0.5%. Having said that, both of these markets, particularly in Northern region are rebounding and of course, Northern California, as I've mentioned before, has a much better affordability metric. And so for those reasons, we do expect the Northern region to outperformed the Southern regions. Goodbye."

            "name": "Barb Pak",
            "content": "Thanks Angela. Today, I will discuss our third quarter results, along with investments and the balance sheet. Starting with our third quarter performance. I'm pleased to report that core FFO per share for the quarter came in $0.03 ahead of our midpoint. The outperformance was driven by slightly higher revenues, other income and lower G&A expenses, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Most of the deals in the third quarter is timing related. As such, we are reiterating the midpoint of our full year core FFO per share and same-property revenue, expense and NOI growth. As it relates to operating expense [Technical Difficulty] which increased by only 1% due to the favorable outcome we received in Seattle. As we look to 2024, we expect operating expenses will remain elevated, primarily driven by non-controllable items such as insurance and utilities. In addition, the tax benefit we received in Washington share is not expected to repeat in 2024. However, it should be noted that we have done a good job over the past four years improving the operating efficiency of the platform, which has led to modest increase in our controllable expenses. Since 2019, our controllable expenses have increased around 2.75% annually despite elevated inflationary pressures and higher costs related to our delinquent units during this period. This favorable outcome is primarily driven by the rollout of Phase 1 of our property collections model. As always, we are continuously looking for ways to improve efficiencies within the platform in order to optimize our cost structure. Turning to investments. For the year, we expect preferred equity redemptions to be around $70 million as we anticipate being fully repaid on a $40 million investment in the fourth quarter. As we look to 2024, we expect redemptions within our preferred equity book to be around $100 million. While we are actively looking for new deals to replace these investments, there could be a timing mismatch in terms of when we get repaid and when we can reinvest. We are finding there are still significant capital sources eager to invest in this portion of the capital stack, while at the same time projects with reasonable return expectations are becoming harder to find. We will remain disciplined in this environment, leaning on our deep network on the West Coast to source deals at attractive risk adjusted returns. Turning to capital markets and the balance sheet. In July, we closed $298 million in ten-year secured loans at a fixed rate of 5.08%. The proceeds were used -- will be used to repay our 2024 consolidated maturities. We were proactive in refinancing our debt early in today's volatile rate environment, locking in favorable financing ahead of the recent acceleration in treasury yields. As such, the company is well positioned with minimal financing needs over the next 18 months. We are pleased that our net-debt to EBITDA ratio continues to trend lower and stands at 5.5 times today as compared to 5.8 times one year ago. With over $1.6 billion in liquidity, the balance sheet remains a source of strength. I'll now turn the call over to Jessica Anderson. [Technical Difficulty] specific number that we need to achieve to hit the fourth quarter [Technical Difficulty] we got back a lot of units from non-paying tenants. It has had an impact to our occupancy, but there's a trade-off there. So there's a variety of factors that will play into the fourth quarter guidance, and there's not a specific rent growth number that we need to achieve because there's all the other factors play into it. Hi Wes, it's Barb. I think for now you could assume mid-year on the $100 million is probably a safe assumption. I think we have some in the first half of the year and some in the back half of the year. So mid-year assumption is good there. And then in terms of geographic concentration, our portfolio is actually, it mirrors our actual portfolio in terms of our investments. So about 40% in Northern California, 40% in Southern California, and 20% in Seattle is how the portfolio aligns in terms of where it's located geographically. Hi, John, it's Barb. We didn't make any changes to our guidance for the full year. We believe we're on target for that. There may be puts and takes and if delinquency does come in favorable, there maybe a trade-off with occupancy. And so net-net, we're in line with our full year guidance. Yeah, this is Barb. So on the unsecured bond market for us today, we would probably be in the high 6% range to do a 10-year unsecured bond offering. And if we were to go do a secured loan, 10-year secured loan like we did, I think we're in around a mid-six. So there has been a little bit of a narrowing from when we originally did our secured loan back in July, but there hasn't been a lot of transactions on unsecured bond market as well. And so it's a little unknown at this time. But we feel good about where we executed and our capital needs for next year. We don't have a lot of capital needs next year. Yeah, this is Barb. No, on the insurance front, it's just a broad -- it's actually a national issue, not an Essex, Pacific or West Coast issue. We're just seeing a lot of pressure on insurance cost and we expect that to continue. It's been an issue in '23, we expect that issue in '24. And then on the utilities front, we're up about 6% year-to-date, and we do expect that utility pressures will continue to be above inflationary levels near term, despite all the ESG efforts we're putting into place. And so those two will cause expense growth to be elevated next year."

            "content": "Thanks Barb. My comments today will cover our recent operating results and strategy, followed by an update on our delinquency progress and regional highlights. Operating results were solid for the quarter including same-property revenue growth of 3.2% on a year-over-year basis. We experienced a normal peak leasing season across all markets. Market rents peaked in August, at 6% growth year-to-date compared to December 2022 and has subsequently moderated by 10 basis points in September, which is consistent with typical seasonality. While we took advantage of opportunities to push rents during peak season, we shifted back to an occupancy focused strategy midway through the third quarter as we began to recapture a larger volume of units from non-paying tenants. This shift in strategy tempered our blended trade-out rates in Q3 which were similar to Q2 at 2.1%. Renewal growth rates were healthy at 3% in Q3 and 5.3% in October, boosting our blended trade-out rates while new lease growth was muted at 1.2% for Q3, reflecting new lease incentives to backfill recently vacated non-paying units. Eviction related move-outs increased in September, allowing for improvement in delinquency as a percentage of rents to 1.9% in September and even further improvement in October to 1.3%. Several of our markets such as Santa Clara, San Mateo and San Diego have returned to delinquency levels close to the long-term run rate. Los Angeles and Alameda County remained elevated, but significant progress is also being made in these areas after protections expired earlier in the year. As Angela mentioned, the improvement in delinquency will result in a temporary tradeoff with new lease growth and occupancy, which can be seen in our preliminary October numbers, but we view this progress, as a positive for the company. Consistent with our approach all year, we remain nimble and will shift our strategy as necessary to maximize revenue in any operating environment. Finally, I want to thank the Essex team for their diligent efforts this past quarter. They've been a major driver of the improvement we've achieved. Moving on to regional specific commentary. Beginning with Seattle, this market has performed as expected this year. Blended net effective rent growth averaged 0.5% for the quarter, improving 70 basis-points from Q2. Despite nominal trade-out growth, demand fundamentals were solid in Q3 and I'm pleased with the recovery of this market after a slow start to the year. Market rents in this region were the first to peak in July on par with a typical year and we anticipate a normal seasonal moderation although higher levels of supply deliveries in the fourth quarter may have an impact on pricing. Turning to Northern California, blended net effective rent growth averaged 1.4% for the quarter, consistent with Q2. Market rents peaked in late August later than normal, an indicator of solid fundamentals in this market. Santa Clara was our top-performing market for the quarter as outlined on page S-9 of the supplemental. The ongoing return to office along with corporate housing activity contributed to these positive quarterly results. San Francisco and Oakland CBD, which account for a small portion of our NOI, have lagged the regional average. Oakland continues to be impacted by supply, which is expected to continue into 2024. Lastly, Southern California continues to be our top-performing region led by San Diego. Market rents in Southern California were last to peak in mid-September and blended net effective rates remained resilient at 3.7%, despite the headwinds in Los Angeles, our market most impacted by delinquency. In October, delinquency in Los Angeles was at 4.6%, reflecting a 2.1% improvement since the start of the year. We anticipate making continued progress on delinquency in Los Angeles and as such we expect rents and occupancy in this area to be more volatile in the near-term. In summary, we are encouraged by the improvement we are seeing on the delinquency front and expect continued progress, heading into next year. As we conclude the balance of the year, we remain focused on preserving occupancy and positioning the portfolio favorably, heading into 2024. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions. Well, just to emphasize, we are on-track for the year. And as mentioned in my prepared remarks, there is essentially a trade-out. We did expect delinquency to stay elevated above the 1.3% that we reported for October. So that is lower than we had planned although we had experienced the trade-out with occupancy and our new lease -- new lease trade-out rate. So as far as demand goes, all of the markets are performing as expected as we move into the seasonal slow period and we're encouraged by recapturing the non-paying units because it will position us well as we head into 2024. Financial occupancy does not include delinquency. Hi, Eric, this is Jessica. Well, we're definitely encouraged by the improvement that we've seen in October and there is several factors that are contributing to that. The first is, for all of our areas outside of Los Angeles and Alameda, protections expired in July last year and at the time we were reporting that evictions we're taking in the range of 10 to 12 months and some longer. And so now that we're a year, plus into those areas, we are seeing a lot of those units have made their way through the system. And in the move-up that we're experiencing. As far as Los Angeles and Alameda go, those protections expired earlier in the year and those tenants are realizing that there are no more protections. There is no more emergency rental assistance. So overall, the tenant sentiment has changed and there is a greater sense of urgency. So we are seeing increased move outs as tenants are realizing this. And as far as forward-looking, one month certainly doesn't make a trend and we've seen some choppiness in delinquency as we've worked through it, the last couple of years, but we're certainly encouraged by our recent results and we're going to be monitoring that closely, and we'll have more information on our fourth quarter earnings call. All right. Let me tackle that. I'll tackle new leases then renewals. So as far as what we can expect for new lease rates through the quarter. I expect those to remain muted. We have come into a period of easier comps, but since we've increased incentives to backfill these units, that's going to mask some of that progress. And overall, we view that as a positive. I think it's neutral over the short-term, with only a couple of months left in the year, but a positive as we look to 2024, because essentially we have people occupying units that are not paying rent. And so if that unit becomes vacant, it's not vacancy, but essentially that's neutral trade-out. And we're offering concessions to refill -- backfill these units as quickly as possible. And at that point, you have somebody occupying the unit that will be paying full market rent in the near term. So it sets us up favorably for 2024. And with regards to renewals. renewals is where you're seeing our comp show up. Renewals are insulated from some of the choppiness of the day-to-day pricing strategy as we've increased incentives to backfill these units. But what you're seeing in October is essentially 50-50 gross rent growth and then also concession burn-off in that 5.3%. And I expect for the quarter, renewals will be pretty consistent. We've sent them out around 5% and we'll monitor conditions closely. We may negotiate those a little bit, but expect those to be fairly consistent through Q4. [Technical Difficulty] is consistent with periods pre-COVID, the three years average pre-COVID. And as far as earning goes, typically in the past we look at using roughly 50%, maybe a little bit more of that loss to lease number, which gets us to roughly 70 basis points or 100 basis points. And then we'll look at whatever our market rent forecast is for the year and take 50% of that and it's still early and we'll be evaluating that and providing more information on our fourth quarter. We do see some other building blocks as far as earning for next year with some other income initiatives as well that will contribute to revenue growth as well next year. Hi, Jamie, this is Jessica. Can you clarify your question, were you talking the first half of 2023? [indiscernible] Yes, I understand what you're saying. Yeah, year-to-date, occupancy, I believe we're sitting about 96.5% and right now we floated down to 95.9%, but again there is a trade out. So, it's revenue neutral over the short term, but potentially positive as we head into 2024. So where we're heading right now with occupancy, it's hard to peg exactly where we'll end the year. As I mentioned, we remain focused on occupancy and back selling units. It's a seasonally slow period, so it's uncertain how much progress we'll be able to make with occupancy over the short term. So with that said, as we head into the year, we certainly could be lower than last year. But stable is what my expectation is from an occupancy perspective. But there's other components that will add to a favorable revenue outcome as we see our delinquency come down. And as far as occupancy, by area, I mean, generally speaking, we're seeing our stronger occupancies in Orange County, San Diego, Ventura. Seattle is performing quite well now and having quite a stable seasonal slowdown, particularly when compared to last year, and it's sitting around 96%. Los Angeles is 95.4% and I would expect that market to be particularly impacted with a lower occupancy, but again an upside on the delinquency front. And the Bay Area is also sitting around 96%. Does that answer your question? [Technical Difficulty] offering across the portfolio with an average of one week free and [Technical Difficulty] units as they come in and adjust as needed to manage our new lease velocity. As far as by-market, we have the largest volume of concessions concentrated in pockets. Southern California is still generally just a few days outside of Los Angeles, and we're seeing larger concessions in Los Angeles areas, the Bay Area. And then Seattle surprisingly is only a few days at this point. As, I mentioned a few minutes ago, it's been a very stable seasonal slowdown in that market. Hi, John, it's Jessica. Yes, that -- it's roughly 50-50. So we're seeing about 2.5% to 2.8% or so in rate growth and then the rest is concession burn-off. Where we sit right now it is additive. So last year we were at roughly two weeks, pretty consistently across Q4. And right now, we're sitting at a week. Like I said earlier, we may increase the volume of concessions and the amount, but we'll monitor that. But as of right now, that's a positive. Hello, this is Jessica. I don't have that information in front of me. I mean, San Francisco is such a small market for us with just a 1,000 units and a couple of large buildings. But like I said, as far as what we're currently offering, I would say roughly one week free with a little bit more in pockets of the Bay Area like San Jose. Oakland is supply impacted, so we have higher concessions there. Seattle, very minimal concessions. All of Southern California outside of Los Angeles, minimal concessions."

            "name": "Rylan Burns",
            "content": "Hi, Steve, Rylan here. We are still seeing a few opportunities. I would say just a little historical context. The majority of our deals up until last year were development based. This year it's been a mix, I would say about 50-50 between development and stabilized recaps and I anticipate next year we're going to see more opportunities for stabilized properties that are seeking recaps. We've seen several deals in the past couple of years with above 50% leverage and very low-interest rates capped or swap that will roll in the next few years at a very different interest-rate environment. So with limited NOI growth we've seen in several of our markets, we think there are going to be opportunities to put some capital to work. Hey, Jamie. Rylan, here. I would say, we are open to any good investment opportunity subject to the conditions that are presented to us. At a high level, as we've talked about, we are relatively bullish on the prospects for Northern California on the next several years, and I think Angela has reiterated several of reasons for that case. Oakland will be challenged for the next year or two given the supply that went out there. So it would have to be a pretty compelling investment opportunity. But it's -- we are open and eagerly looking for opportunities in all of our core markets. Hey John, I appreciate the question. I hesitate to give you a specific number, because as you are well aware, when there is not any transactions, it's very difficult to pinpoint where buyers are. I also would take some pause with the idea of a redlining a whole city. We are still seeing -- or we've seen some transactions occur, year-to-date, and the buyer profile is different than what we've typically seen. I think you're seeing some family office buyers who are coming in and looking at the basis versus replacement costs that are still continuing to transact in some of these sub-markets that you mentioned. So obviously a challenged market fundamentally over the past year or two, but as those turn, I suspect you're going to see people, investors come back in and -- so I'll leave it at that, without giving you a specific number, but hopefully that color is helpful. Thanks, John. Another good question. As you know, we force rank our 30 plus sub-markets and forecast a rent growth for five years, forward looking based on our fundamental analysis. And so the cap rates have to accommodate for a higher IRR based on those rent growth estimates. So there is a price at which we would be willing to invest in these submarkets. I will say, given the performance we've seen over the past several years with the suburban strongly outperforming and where we're looking at supply for the next few years, I would think, on average, incremental dollars will go towards our portfolio investments that look similar to what our portfolio mix currently is demonstrating. But there is a price and we have our -- we're turning over every rock and looking for opportunities and I'm optimistic we're going to see more in the next few years."

Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found on the company's filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Angela Kleiman, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Ms. Kleiman, you may begin.\nAngela Kleiman: Good morning. Thank you for joining Essex's second quarter earnings call. Barb Pak and Jessica Anderson will follow me with prepared remarks, and Adam Berry is here for Q&A. We delivered a solid second quarter with core FFO per share exceeding the high end of our guidance range. In addition, we are pleased to announce a meaningful increase to our 2023 guidance for same property revenues, NOI and core FFO per share growth. Barb will discuss this further in a moment. Our performance to date demonstrates the underlying strength of the West Coast economy along with continued refinement to our operating strategy. My remarks today will focus on our 2023 revised outlook for the West Coast and conclude with an update on the transaction market. Starting with expectations for the balance of the year, as shown on Page S17 of the supplemental. Our improved outlook reflects the year-to-date resilience of the economy and labor markets both surpassing our initial forecast. This dynamic, coupled with slowing apartment deliveries have contributed to a healthy demand for rental housing in our markets. As a result, we raised our average market rent growth expectations for the West Coast by 50 basis points to 2.5%, with notable increases to San Diego and San Jose.  Demand associated with job growth is a key driver to the revision. We now expect our markets to generate 1.7% job growth for the full year. This is mostly attributable to the growth achieved in the first half of the year, with our markets posting 2.6% job growth on a trailing 3-month average through June.  Additionally, the layoff announcements from the largest technology companies have proven less consequential than headlines suggested with only a fraction occurring within our markets, and the vast majority of those affected quickly finding new employment.  Turning to the supply outlook. Our research forecast a slight reduction in 2023 deliveries as a few delay projects get pushed into 2024. While we have been pleased with the steady job growth achieved on the West Coast to start the year, we remain cognizant of the potential for more interest rate increases given the Fed's focus on inflation reduction. Thus, our job outlook contemplates a moderating economy as we approach year-end. And accordingly, our base case expectation assumes modest market rent growth for the remainder of the year. Looking forward to the next several years, we see the West Coast as uniquely positioned to generate above-average rent growth based on 3 key factors present today. First and most importantly, the West Coast supply outlook is relatively muted, and a multiyear lead time is required to develop new housing in our markets. With permitting activities declining, we expect to benefit from moderate supply levels for years to come.  Second is rental affordability. Since 2020, average personal income in the Essex market has grown over 20% compared to cumulative rent growth of 10%, resulting in attractive rental affordability. Furthermore, high cost of homeownership continues to favor renting. It is now over 2x expensive to own compared to rent in the Essex market.  Third, solid demand drivers. Our Southern region continues to demonstrate stable growth supported by a diverse and vibrant economy. Likewise, the Northern region economies are steadily growing, a key driver is the investment in AI companies that are largely concentrated in Northern California. We've seen open positions of the top 10 tech companies improved gradually each month since the trough earlier this year.  Lastly, fully remote as a percent of total job postings have significantly declined at below 10% in June. For these reasons, we expect the West Coast to continue gaining momentum for the remainder of 2023 and outperform over the next several years. Lastly, turning to the investment markets. Transaction activities in the West Coast have remained muted. Similar to the first quarter, volume in the second quarter was about 55% lower than the same period prior year with cap rates in the mid-4% to low 5% range for institutional quality properties. We are starting to see more deals actively marketed at a similar valuation levels. Interest from a healthy group of buyers range from local syndicators to large institutional and foreign investors. As expected, leverage buyers remain largely in the sidelines, waiting for more clarity on interest rates. We continue to diligently underwrite deals as we are well positioned to be opportunistic.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Barb Pak.\nBarbara Pak: Thanks, Angela. I'll begin with a brief overview of our second quarter results, discuss increases to our full year guidance and provide an update on capital markets and the balance sheet. Beginning with our second quarter performance. I'm pleased to report we achieved core FFO per share of $3.77. This result exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.08 per share, of which $0.06 is attributable to better revenue growth and lower property taxes in Washington. Our favorable year-to-date results have enabled us to increase the full year midpoint of our same-property revenue growth by approximately 40 basis points to 4.4%. The increase is due to higher occupancy and net effective rents achieved year-to-date, partially offset by higher delinquency in the second half of the year as compared to our original forecast. As it relates to same-property operating expenses, we have reduced our midpoint by 100 basis points to 4% as a result of a reduction in Washington property taxes.  Due to these revisions, our full year same-property NOI growth has increased to 4.5% at the midpoint, representing a 90 basis points improvement to our guidance -- to our initial guidance. As a result of our strong second quarter and revisions to our same-property outlook, we are raising the full year midpoint of core FFO by $0.22 to $15 per share, which represents 3.4% year-over-year growth. Turning to capital markets activities. We have historically been proactive in managing our capital needs and debt maturity profile, taking advantage of attractive opportunities in the market to refinance our debt early, minimizing our near-term capital needs and maximizing our financial flexibility. Subsequent to quarter-end, we closed a $298 million 10-year secured loan at a fixed rate of 5.08%. Proceeds will be used to repay unsecured bonds maturing in May 2024.  In the interim, the proceeds will be invested in short-term cash accounts, resulting in a positive impact to FFO of approximately $0.03 per share until the unsecured bonds are repaid next year. Our capital markets team did a terrific job monitoring the variety of debt capital sources available and locking in a favorable rate in today's volatile environment. With this refinancing, the company has addressed approximately 50% of the 2024 debt maturities at pro rata share. Finally, our balance sheet metrics remain strong. Leverage continues to decline, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio continues to trend lower and stands at 5.6x today. We have minimum near-term financing needs over the next 18 months and over $1.6 billion in liquidity. As such, the company remains in a strong financial position. I'll now turn the call over to Jessica Anderson.\nJessica Anderson: Thanks, Barb. I'll begin my comments today by providing color on our recent operating results and strategy, followed by regional commentary. I was pleased with our operating results from the second quarter, including a same-property revenue increase of 4% year-over-year. For the first several months of the year, we maintained an occupancy-focused leasing strategy to mitigate expected headwinds from eviction-related move-outs. This approach helped us exceed revenue expectations in the first half of the year and left us well positioned to push rate during peak leasing season, which continues today. Our new lease trade-out accelerated through the second quarter from 0.5% in May to 1.7% in June and finally to a preliminary 2.1% in July. Renewal trade-out is stable and averaged 3.4%, resulting in blended net effective rent growth of 2.2% for the second quarter. These results were achieved despite increased turnover driven by eviction-related move-outs. Given ongoing delinquency court backlog, we will continue to work through evictions for the rest of the year and anticipate some of this activity spilling over into 2024. Moving on to regional specific commentary. In Seattle, blended net effective rent growth averaged negative 0.2% for the second quarter, dragging down the portfolio average. This is attributed to 2 key factors. First is the year-over-year comp. In the second quarter of 2022, Seattle generated a portfolio-leading net effective rent growth of over 16%.  Second, Seattle remains our most seasonal market, thus is more sensitive to changes in the operating environment. You may recall during the back half of 2022, the Seattle market experienced increased supply during a period of softening demand, which heavily impacted rents as we headed into 2023. However, throughout the second quarter, we saw a steady strengthening of demand, particularly in Seattle CBD that coincided with Amazon's mandatory May 1 return-to-office of 3 days a week. Strong leasing activity drove a collective 680 basis point sequential increase in net effective rents from April to June and a solid 97% quarter-end occupancy. Moving on to Northern California. Blended net effective rent growth averaged 1.5% for the second quarter. Oakland continues to be impacted by supply posting a negative 0.4% for the quarter, diluting the healthy 2.7% achieved in San Jose, where the bulk of our Northern California portfolio is located. Despite the tech employment headlines, we still experienced corporate housing activity associated with the large tech companies albeit muted from last year, which helped support seasonal demand. Quarter-end occupancy was also solid at 96.7%.  Lastly, in Southern California, blended net effective rent growth averaged 4.1% for the quarter, driven by continued strength in San Diego, Ventura and Orange County. Los Angeles is pulling the average down with a 1.9% blended lease trade-out for the quarter. However, because of the eviction activity in this market, rent growth and occupancy are expected to run lower relative to the rest of Southern California for the remainder of the year. Quarter-end occupancy in Southern California was 96.3%.  In summary, we are encouraged by our results for the first half of the year and the current operating environment. As we begin the third quarter, we are well positioned with the current physical occupancy of 96.7%, coupled with strong leasing activity across all markets. As we look to the back half of the year, we will reassess our rent growth focused strategy as the summer leasing season wraps up in the next 30 days and maintain our flexible approach to maximize revenue in a variety of market conditions. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Eric Wolfe with Citi.\nEric Wolfe: I think at NAREIT, you mentioned that you saw some earlier move-outs of nonpaying tenants, which probably was impacting your pricing and the use of concessions. But based on your comments and just looking at the July data, it seems like your delinquent percentage is staying about the same. So I'm just trying to reconcile that and try to understand when we might actually see the delinquent percentage come down.\nBarbara Pak: Eric, it's Barb. I would say delinquency is generally tracking in mind. We were ahead in the first 6 months relative to our plan, primarily due to emergency rental assistance payments. July is generally on plan. And we do expect that number will continue to trend lower. And by the end of the year will be below 2%. We left our midpoint unchanged at 2% for the full year. But we are making progress, but it's slow, it's dependent upon the courts and just resident behavior. So it's a little bit out of our control.\nEric Wolfe: Understood. But I guess, just to be clear, I mean, if I look at the sort of May data around new leases, you're using concessions, that was what was depressing that number. I mean, guess what -- I guess what drove that then? And then what changed to allow you to feel more comfortable with the push rate?\nJessica Anderson: This is Jessica. Eric, I'll take that. With regards to our shift in strategy around mid-May, we changed from an occupancy-focused strategy to more focus on rent growth. And to your point, what got us more comfortable with that? Well, a couple of things. One would be really the macroeconomic outlook, the headlines that we're seeing earlier in the year and the layoffs, and the headlines overall were concerning. And so we took a proactive approach and the layoffs subsided, and we started seeing strengthening. And then in addition to that, with regards to the eviction, they've been coming back at a pretty steady pace, which is manageable.  And so based on the strength we were seeing in the markets and the manageable pace, at which we were getting the evictions, we felt comfortable shifting to a rate growth focus. And what you're seeing in April and May that we had shared as far as our trade-out numbers so reflects concession usage that was predominantly in April. We averaged about a week free at that point. We did go through a lot of evictions that we wanted to offset and reposition our occupancy at a higher rate right before peak season and some of that activity spilled over into May. But as of today, concession usage is minimal across all of our markets.\nOperator: Our next question is from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.\nStephen Sakwa: Just to follow-up on Eric's question, just to be clear. So your delinquencies baked into guidance are basically 2% for Q3 and Q4? And then secondly, can you just provide some color on what your blended, I guess, rate expectations are for Q3 and Q4?\nBarbara Pak: Steve, this is Barb. I'll take the first part of that question. And so in terms of delinquency, yes, it's roughly 2% for the full year. We're at 2.1% today, year-to-date. And so it's a little bit under that in the back half of the year. Like I said, we do expect it to continue to trend favorable, but it's an inherent lumpy number. And so it's difficult to predict month-to-month, but end of the year should be less than 2% for sure. And then on the blended, I'll let Jessica answer that.\nJessica Anderson: Steve, this is Jessica. As far as blended goes, I'm going to break that out into new lease and to renewals. And so year-to-date for our new leases, we've achieved 1.1%. But keep in mind, that reflects our focus on maintaining a high occupancy earlier in the year. And so we gave approximately it's over half a week in concessions to maintain that higher occupancy. And when we look at our outlook, we've revised it from 2% full year rent growth to 2.5%, which reflects the broader expectations of the market.  And so in order to make it apples-to-apples, we have to adjust our first half. And so essentially half a week is 1% of rent growth. And so if you add that to our 1.1%, you get to 2.1%, which leads us to 2.8% for new lease growth expected for the back half of the year. And based on the strength that we're seeing in the markets right now, and then the easier comps that we'll be facing in Q3, particularly Q4, that is an achievable number.  And then as far as renewals go, renewals are reaccelerating. We've sent renewals out in August and September at around 4%. You may have noticed in our results that renewals had come down, which essentially went to 2.8% preliminary for July. And renewals trail new leases by approximately 60 to 90 days. So wherever new lease -- new leases go renewals end up following, but we've been able to achieve some solid rent growth. And so therefore, the renewals reaccelerated and expect renewals to be around 4% for the back half of the year.\nOperator: Our next question is from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nAustin Wurschmidt: So given the strength that you highlighted year-to-date, the benefit to same-store revenue growth in the first half of the year as well as some of the new lease rate growth momentum you achieved in June and July. I guess, why leave your back half same-store revenue growth guidance of 3% unchanged?\nBarbara Pak: Yes. This is Barb. I would say, I think we know -- we've done the vast majority of our leases. We still have some to go. So we know where leases are going to trend this year and that top line number. If we get substantially more rent growth from here, it's really going to benefit 2024 at this point versus 2023 given the amount of time that's left in the year. And the number of leases that we have left to sign is lower in the third and the fourth quarter. And so I think that's the biggest factor. The biggest factor to our guidance at this point in terms of same-store is really delinquency. It can swing up or down. That's the biggest wildcard right now. I think with other -- the other components of the same-store revenue are pretty dialed in.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Got it. And then, Jessica, I think you said 2.8% new lease rate growth in the back half of the year. Just trying to understand the cadence of that through the back half, obviously, starting in the low 2% range here. You've got easier comps coming given the deceleration you saw last year. So can you give us a sense of that cadence? And then from a back half perspective, what type of seasonality did you underwrite for the back half?\nJessica Anderson: So as far as where we see trade-out going would expect that is slightly different by market, but expect that to accelerate from here. It will be higher in Q4, and that's simply based on the comps, as you pointed out. And then as far as seasonality goes, we see this as being a typical year, and we may have a prolonged peak. We've been monitoring our rents. And typically, we peak in NorCal and Seattle around -- right around about now or mid-July and then SoCal is often a little bit later. But as of this week, we're still seeing rents accelerate in San Jose specifically in Southern California, and some of our other markets are leveling off at this point. So pretty normal, but we're seeing strong leasing on the ground and anticipate a typical seasonal slowdown.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo.\nJames Feldman: Your comments and also EQR commented earlier, talked about maybe an improving return-to-office, especially in the Bay Area. Can you talk more about what you're seeing? And also, how do you think about the implications for suburban versus urban type of assets as more people are getting pulled in the cities? I think their comment was the urban -- more urban as the people want to be closer to their workplaces.\nAngela Kleiman: Jamie, it's Andrea here. I think there are a couple of things that are different between how our portfolio is located versus EQR and where the key job nodes are in California versus the rest of the country. So I'll start there. So as it relates to the urban, suburban conversation, keep in mind that in California, most of the large tech companies are actually suburban based. And so that, of course, for us, it's always been a benefit even pre-COVID. And the underlying strength is a couple of factors, right? Lower supply in the suburban [indiscernible] the cities are tougher, quality of life, more homeless and some of these other issues.  And of course, the proximity to employers are much more favorable from that perspective. And so from that perspective, Essex, our view is that the suburban still is more compelling than the urban. And that is consistent to our prime [indiscernible] even for COVID. As far as the return to office, we saw that in Seattle with Amazon early May. And although I do want to say that, that was somewhat muted than normal just because of the layoff announcements. And so it was really people digesting and getting rehired. And so from the return-to-office activity, what we would expect to see is that it will be more pronounced in September with Meta and some of these other larger companies. Essex, for us, we're doing the same thing. We are mandating a 3-day working from office now until September after Labor Day as well. And so we do see that at that point, the activities will resume in a more robust way.\nJames Feldman: Okay. And then as we think about your expenses heading into kind of late into the fourth quarter or even into next year. Can you just talk a little bit about where you think you may see either the greatest moderation or maybe some acceleration in operating expense growth across the major line items?\nBarbara Pak: Yes, this is Barb. I would say in the back half of this year, we have easier comps as it relates to eviction costs and turnover because we had those expenses last year in the fourth quarter. And so some of the expenses that we've seen in the first quarter and some of our high R&M, and admin expenses will moderate in the back half of the year just on a year-over-year growth basis. I would say, in terms of other lines this year, I don't see significant change in any other major line this year. I think we've got expenses pretty dialed in for this year, we do know taxes and insurance.  As we look to 2024, it's difficult to predict just yet where we're going to land. We'll be going through our budget process here this quarter, and I'll have more clarity on the next quarter call. The 1 line item that we've talked about in the past is insurance, it still is a very challenging market. We would expect that we would be up 20-plus percent next year on the insurance line. But keep in mind, that's a very small line for us. It's only like 4% of our total OpEx spend. So while the headline number is large, it's a small component of our OpEx. And outside of that and outside of the favorable taxes we have in California, where they only grow 2%, we need a little more time to dial in 2024.\nJames Feldman: Okay. That makes a lot of sense. I guess just sticking with insurance, are you seeing any lightening up from the insurance company in terms of what they're willing to offer as they build up their capital reserves? Or no, you think it's going to be another tough year?\nBarbara Pak: Right now, based on what we know, we believe it will be a tough year. We're going to go through our renewal in the fourth quarter of this year. Our renewal comes up in December. And so I'll have more clarity on the next call in terms of that market. But based on what we're hearing, we think it's still a very challenging market.\nOperator: Our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.\nAlexander Goldfarb: So two questions. First, Angela, you made comments before that sort of outward migration from California is always a constant, but it's the HP-1 visas, the overseas tech workers, et cetera., entrepreneurs who immigrate to the country that offset and drive. So just sort of curious, what's the latest on tech hiring from overseas? Whether it's permanent or sort of the annual consultants who they bring in? Just curious what's going on there.\nAngela Kleiman: Yes, Alex, that's a good question. We haven't seen an active hiring from an international basis yet. And what we have seen is on a net migration for California as a whole. So this is market as a whole. That net outflow remains negative, but it hasn't been -- it's gotten better. So during COVID, it was an extreme outflow. And now when we look at the net migration outflow number, it's pretty consistent to pre-COVID. And so we do think that once we have that international, it would definitely be a good tailwind. As far as when we look at our own portfolio, just on a more granular level, so this is move-ins. We saw a pop last year between the first and third quarter with California reopening, and that acceleration was definitely very encouraging to see. And since then, the move-out, obviously, it's not going to continue at that level in terms of acceleration. But the -- I'm sorry, I meant to say the move-ins, but it has remained positive, and it's been stable. And so that's another good sign.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. Second question is on capital markets. You guys did a secured loan that wasn't for a JV. Normally, I guess, in REIT land for the investment-grade companies, we expect secured loans either in times of distress or for a joint venture asset. Here, it seems like the unsecured debt markets are open. So just sort of curious the decision on that. And also, I imagine there were probably a bunch of people who are out there hungry to buy more of your unsecured. So maybe it's just maybe if something else planned later in the year that satisfies that. But just sort of curious about the decision to do secured and what seems to be a functioning unsecured debt market?\nBarbara Pak: Alex, it's Barb. That's a great question. I will tell you, we do prefer unsecured debt, and that's been kind of our ammo for many, many years as that's the way we finance the balance sheet. In this environment, though, we saw a significant pricing differential between the secured and unsecured market. So while we locked in our -- the secured loans at 5.0%. If we were to go to do an unsecured bond, it would have been 65 to 75 basis points wide of that. And so that pricing differential was so great that we decided to move forward with the secured side of the equation. 95% of our NOI is unencumbered. And so we have lots of room within our covenants to secure a few assets. And there's no change in our overall balance sheet philosophy. It was just really a pricing differential that made us move the way we did.\nOperator: Our next question is from Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Just wanted to ask about the R&M same-store expenses. It looks like it was impacted by storms and flooding damage in the first half of the year. One, is that all behind us now, so it will kind of normalize out in 3Q? And then what would that trend look like if you could strip out the storm impact?\nBarbara Pak: This is Barb again. Yes, you're correct. It is impacted by some of the spillover from the storm and flood damage cleanup costs in the second quarter. We had a lot in the first quarter and some of it still is in the second quarter. And it also had higher turnover costs because keep in mind, we are getting back units. And so it's that and then just general inflation -- inflationary pressures within the R&M space.  And so it's three components. In terms of if we just pulled out the flood, I don't have that in front of me. I'll get back to you on what that would be. But it's really all 3 of those components that drove that increase. In the back half of the year, though, I do expect that number to come down. First of all, we don't expect the same level of storms or floods. It's not a rainy season here right now. And so that should abate and not be in our third or fourth quarter numbers. And then the eviction-related turnover costs, we have easier comps in the third and fourth quarter because we started incurring those last year in the third and fourth quarter. So that 14% that we had in the third quarter should moderate significantly in the third and fourth quarter.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. I appreciate that, Barb. And then can you just clarify when exactly you made that strategy shift from occupancy to rate growth. And then I guess my real question is, does that imply you have a bigger mark-to-market? I'm not sure if you actually set the mark-to-market at this time.\nJessica Anderson: Josh, this is Jessica. Yes, we switched really about mid-May. And as far as the mark-to-market, we're looking -- right now, our loss-to-lease is 1.7%. But as I mentioned earlier, still seeing our rents grow in some markets. And so expect that potentially to go up a little bit more.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. Is that about average of the loss-to-lease at this time of the year, 1.7%? Or is it a little bit below normal because of that -- the initial strategy on the occupancy?\nJessica Anderson: Yes, it's definitely a little suppressed based on our approach earlier in the year.\nOperator: Our next question is from Nick Yubico with Deutsche Bank.\nUnidentified Analyst: Daniel [indiscernible] on for Nick. I can ask the question. So July new lease rates accelerated nicely from 2Q. So just curious what markets drove that sequential improvement? And second, do you think it's possible to see continued acceleration given some of your larger markets have lagged year-to-date and are, I guess, still recovering in a sense in tandem with the pretty benign supply backdrop?\nJessica Anderson: This is Jessica. Yes, we did see Seattle was a large contributor to the sequential improvement, followed by Northern California. Southern California has been performing pretty steadily. And then as far as specific markets in Northern California, San Jose has been particularly strong, which reflects over 40% of our portfolio in the Bay Area. So we've seen strong occupancy, strong leasing demand. That one is encouraging, certainly watching it. We've seen with all of the prior return to office announcement. So Amazon and Seattle CBD and then last year with Google as well in the Bay Area, there's definitely demand associated to these return to office events.  And so anticipating that Meta, which is in September is going to have the same impact. I would imagine, we're experiencing some of that demand right now. And then also, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the corporate housing activity. It is less than last year, but we still saw the activity this year, which is always an encouraging sign as far as the health of the big tech employers, they certainly wouldn't be investing in interns and contract work if they were planning on tightening their belts and we've certainly seen an uptick in hiring as well.  So San Jose has been doing quite well. And then Seattle had already touched on the Seattle CBD and the Amazon returned to office, so that was a factor. And we're still seeing strength in demand today. However, it is our most market. And so we certainly see the most pronounced reduction in rents in the back half of the year in that market. But I expect it to be in line with our typical seasonal curve and expectations there and then also supply. We do have good supply headwinds in Seattle. Some of it was pushed to the first half of 2024. So it's a little bit better than what we originally expected, but we still have some supply on our radar there.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. And then I'm not sure if you have an answer to this question, but San Diego, one of your stronger markets. Wondering if you have a sense of like which employment sectors are driving demand in that market for your assets?\nAngela Kleiman: It's Angela here. The key drivers in actually all of our markets have been in the health services and education and, of course, the leisure and hospitality as well. And so with San Diego rebounding, it's been good to see those activities coming back in a more robust way.\nOperator: Our next question is from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.\nJohn Kim: On the Washington property taxes coming in lower than expected, was that due to a favorable appeal that you had or lower mill rates or something else?\nBarbara Pak: John, it's Barb. So property taxes in Washington declined 1% year-over-year. The assessed values went up 15%. So when we were budgeting, we knew assess side were up quite a bit, but millage rates came down. And so that's what drove the favorable year-over-year reduction in taxes. There was -- it wasn't based on a PL.\nJohn Kim: Do you think that rate is a good run rate going forward? Or is it more of a onetime reduction?\nBarbara Pak: It's really hard to know. So there's a lag effect in terms of when they do the bills. So our '24 bills will be based off of 1 January of '23 assess values, which we don't know what those will be at this point. Obviously, values have changed over the last year. But it also depends on the millage and what the city does with that. And so that's always a wildcard factor. Historically, we've not had a reduction in Seattle taxes 2 years in a row. But -- so we'll have to just monitor and see next year. I don't know if 1 -- a negative 1% is a good way. I wouldn't use that. I don't think that's how we would view it going forward, but we are pleasantly surprised this year.\nJohn Kim: Okay. My second question is on your loss-to-lease. I think Jessica mentioned it was 1.7%. Last year, Angela mentioned that the September loss-to-lease is a good indicator for your future earnings. And I'm wondering how you think that trend just given the market rental rate assumption has gone up? I think you touched on this a little bit, but where do you see that September loss-to-lease go to?\nBarbara Pak: Well, it's definitely a little bit too early to predict that, and we have -- while we've had a typical seasonal curve. It will be interesting to see how the back half of peak leasing season plays out. And yes, I did share it, we have the 1.7% loss-to-lease today. But based on several of our markets, still accelerating with rent growth week-over-week that may grow from here and also the Meta return to office that we're watching and the demand overall in the Bay Area could change how we typically experience in August or September. So in short, it's a little bit early. And yes, we will look at that in September as we typically do.\nAngela Kleiman: Just a little context. I think last year, around this time, we were sitting around 7% loss-to-lease. And -- but we were looking at the seasonal curve that is occurring in a more -- that mirror pre-COVID level. What happened was the prior year, we didn't even peak until November. So it's been a little wonky coming out of COVID. And so it's September, generally, as a rule of thumb is a good data point. But just because of the uniqueness in the past couple of years, I just -- we didn't want anyone to just peg a June number as a good rule of thumb.\nOperator: Our next question is from Handel St. Juste with Mizuho.\nHaendel St. Juste: So first question is on transactions. As we've heard we've seen still pretty stalled. But you mentioned that you're diligently underwriting deals. So I'm curious where you peg the bid-ask spread at today and where asset pricing would need to be for you to get more active?\nAdam Berry: Haendel, this is Adam. So yes, we are underwriting every deal in the market. And even though in Q2, volume went down pretty considerably. Q3, I expect it to be increased just given the amount of activity in the market today. So we are underwriting a lot of deals right now. And there isn't much of a bit-ask spread. I think many of the deals -- most of the deals that are on the market today will make. So I think there will be capitulation on both sides and a meeting of the minds. And I think echoing what Angela said in her opening comments, I think those are going to be in the mid-4s to low 5s range depending on product, location and then specific circumstances, whether there's assumable debt or some tax abatements.  So as far as when we will be back in the market, I think that's really highly dependent on where our cost of capital is. So given where we're trading today, that it's hard to make accretive deals in the mid-4s to low 5s. And so we will continue to market or continue to monitor the market, and we will act when it makes sense.\nHaendel St. Juste: Got you. That's helpful. A follow-up on the conversation around concessions. Can you guys provide a more detailed breakdown perhaps by region what the average concession that you're providing in your NorCal or SoCal and Seattle regions are and then also a loss-to-lease by region?\nJessica Anderson: Sure. This is Jessica. So concessions in Q2 by region. So if you look at Southern California, it's a little less than half a week. Northern California, 1 week and Seattle a little bit over half a week. So that gets us to 0.7 weeks overall. And keep in mind that a lot of that was concentrated in the April time frame. Some of it's build over into May. By the time we got to the end of the quarter, we pretty much have no concessions across the portfolio with the exception a very small portion of our portfolio that is exposed to lease that's like 10 to 15 properties or so. And then as far as loss-to-lease by market, Southern California, 2.5%; Northern California, 0.7%; and Seattle, 1.9% to make up the 1.7%.\nHaendel St. Juste: Great. And then sorry, if I missed this, but what's the embedded assumption for bad debt impact the revenue in the back half of the year?\nBarbara Pak: Haendel, it's Barb. It's roughly 2%, a little bit under 2%, consistent with the full year forecast.\nHaendel St. Juste: That's the incremental tailwind? You're saying that the expectations by year-end? Is that the incremental benefit you expect in the back half of the year?\nBarbara Pak: No, that's the assumption. So we assume 2% for the full year. We're at 2.1% through the first 6 months of the year, we assume effectively like 1.9% in the back half of the year to hit our 2.0% for the full year. So it is an incremental improvement in the back half as well.\nOperator: Our next question is from [indiscernible] with Green Street.\nUnidentified Analyst: Just a follow up on the question earlier. What's the total magnitude of acquisitions, you're hoping to achieve in the back half of this year?\nAdam Berry: Robin, this is Adam. So at this point, our intention is to -- well, our guidance really is not to acquire anything in the back half of the year. We -- like I said, we've been underwriting everything. And if there are deals that makes sense strategically that fit in with our existing portfolio, whether through economies of scale or other methods, then we will focus more on those deals. But for the moment, given our cost of capital, we wouldn't expect much on the acquisitions front.\nUnidentified Analyst: So with, I guess, in a scenario where there's minimal acquisition, then no development starts penciled. Do you expect to -- how do stock buybacks stack up in terms of midterm priorities for capital allocation?\nBarbara Pak: Yes. I mean we did do stock buybacks in the first quarter, and we will assess our sources of capital to do that because we want to maintain our balance sheet strength and a leverage neutral approach to the stock buyback. So we would need a source of capital to continue to buy back the stock, and so that would imply that we would dispose of something.  So it will all depend on where we can find opportunities to add value to the bottom line. Because at the end of the day, that's our goal on the external front is how can we grow accretively. And to Adam's point, it's hard to do it via acquisitions today. But it doesn't mean that we're just going to go buy back the stock. We would need a source of capital to do that as well. So it all go into the mix.\nUnidentified Analyst: I appreciate that response. And then finally for me, can you give us a rough direction on what percentage of the $100 million outstanding delinquencies that you think you'll ultimately be able to collect?\nBarbara Pak: Yes, it's a great question. It's difficult to know. I mean, obviously, we'll get some of that. But -- and none of that is baked into our guidance for delinquency this year. We are making progress collecting. The problem is, until the courts get caught up delinquency keeps accruing because we have tenants that are in our properties a lot longer than they were historically. Pre-COVID, if somebody went delinquent, they were out within 2 to 3 months. And now they go delinquent, they're out in 9 to 12 months. And so that's part of the compounding problem on the delinquency side and the cumulative delinquency side. In terms of what we're going to collect, I can't give you a number. It's just too hard to predict.\nUnidentified Analyst: Do you think it's closer to 10%, 20% or towards 50%? I understand it's very hard to predict.\nBarbara Pak: Yes. I'm not going to throw out a number because it's just not something that we know with any sort of certainty at this point. We're working hard to collect every time that we can. We've used all measures possible to go after these tenants who are delinquent and have delinquent balances, but it's not a number I can throw out there.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Goldsmith with UBS.\nMichael Goldsmith: For the L.A. market, are you seeing any pressure from the writers and actor strikes? Or does your guidance contemplate any impact from this?\nJessica Anderson: This is Jessica. I'll speak to as far as the on-the-ground operations. We have not seen any impact from a strike at this point. We track our exposure to the major studios and it's less than 1% of our L.A. portfolio. And so I think it really comes down to how long the strike is going to go on and if there's potentially a ripple effect to other industries. But at this point, we do not see it have a material impact on our portfolio would have to go on for some time. There may be specific property impact, but not the larger portfolio as a whole.\nMichael Goldsmith: That's helpful context. And for my follow-up question, when you look at the A versus B quality properties. Are you seeing any differences in trends between them? Is there any differences in demand or tenant health and how that's trending between A versus B quality properties?\nJessica Anderson: This is Jessica again. As far as A versus B, we do not see a material difference in performance. It's more really location. So back to the whole suburban versus urban concept. And the bulk of our portfolio is suburban, and we are seeing strength in our suburban market versus some of the urban properties. And really, I think that's attributed to supply as well. When we look at where we have concentrations of supply is in these urban locations. So Seattle CBD, Downtown L.A., West L.A., Downtown San Diego, and that's where we would see rent lag. So urban versus suburban is where we're seeing the difference.\nOperator: Our next question is from Nathan [indiscernible] with Robert W. Baird.\nUnidentified Analyst: Can you speak to what is driving the strength in San Diego? And which market or markets do you believe will be the next to see a rebound?\nJessica Anderson: This is Jessica. So yes, San Diego has been a phenomenal market for us. I think it benefited during the pandemic. It was a popular area to relocate to, rents were lower and overall great quality of life. And as Angela mentioned earlier, there is some underlying employment industries that have strength there. So San Diego has been very solid, and we expect it to continue to perform well. As far as other markets that I have my eye on that are showing signs of strength, go back up to the Bay Area with San Jose. Just to reiterate what I'm seeing there, that's been a strong market for us. And then when you couple that with the recovery as well that we still anticipate with continued return to office and where we're at relative to pre-COVID rent. There's definitely an upside there and then up in the Seattle area for similar reasons. But of course, we're going to be facing some supply headwinds there over the next year.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Good morning. Thank you for joining Essex's second quarter earnings call. Barb Pak and Jessica Anderson will follow me with prepared remarks, and Adam Berry is here for Q&A. We delivered a solid second quarter with core FFO per share exceeding the high end of our guidance range. In addition, we are pleased to announce a meaningful increase to our 2023 guidance for same property revenues, NOI and core FFO per share growth. Barb will discuss this further in a moment. Our performance to date demonstrates the underlying strength of the West Coast economy along with continued refinement to our operating strategy. My remarks today will focus on our 2023 revised outlook for the West Coast and conclude with an update on the transaction market. Starting with expectations for the balance of the year, as shown on Page S17 of the supplemental. Our improved outlook reflects the year-to-date resilience of the economy and labor markets both surpassing our initial forecast. This dynamic, coupled with slowing apartment deliveries have contributed to a healthy demand for rental housing in our markets. As a result, we raised our average market rent growth expectations for the West Coast by 50 basis points to 2.5%, with notable increases to San Diego and San Jose.  Demand associated with job growth is a key driver to the revision. We now expect our markets to generate 1.7% job growth for the full year. This is mostly attributable to the growth achieved in the first half of the year, with our markets posting 2.6% job growth on a trailing 3-month average through June.  Additionally, the layoff announcements from the largest technology companies have proven less consequential than headlines suggested with only a fraction occurring within our markets, and the vast majority of those affected quickly finding new employment.  Turning to the supply outlook. Our research forecast a slight reduction in 2023 deliveries as a few delay projects get pushed into 2024. While we have been pleased with the steady job growth achieved on the West Coast to start the year, we remain cognizant of the potential for more interest rate increases given the Fed's focus on inflation reduction. Thus, our job outlook contemplates a moderating economy as we approach year-end. And accordingly, our base case expectation assumes modest market rent growth for the remainder of the year. Looking forward to the next several years, we see the West Coast as uniquely positioned to generate above-average rent growth based on 3 key factors present today. First and most importantly, the West Coast supply outlook is relatively muted, and a multiyear lead time is required to develop new housing in our markets. With permitting activities declining, we expect to benefit from moderate supply levels for years to come.  Second is rental affordability. Since 2020, average personal income in the Essex market has grown over 20% compared to cumulative rent growth of 10%, resulting in attractive rental affordability. Furthermore, high cost of homeownership continues to favor renting. It is now over 2x expensive to own compared to rent in the Essex market.  Third, solid demand drivers. Our Southern region continues to demonstrate stable growth supported by a diverse and vibrant economy. Likewise, the Northern region economies are steadily growing, a key driver is the investment in AI companies that are largely concentrated in Northern California. We've seen open positions of the top 10 tech companies improved gradually each month since the trough earlier this year.  Lastly, fully remote as a percent of total job postings have significantly declined at below 10% in June. For these reasons, we expect the West Coast to continue gaining momentum for the remainder of 2023 and outperform over the next several years. Lastly, turning to the investment markets. Transaction activities in the West Coast have remained muted. Similar to the first quarter, volume in the second quarter was about 55% lower than the same period prior year with cap rates in the mid-4% to low 5% range for institutional quality properties. We are starting to see more deals actively marketed at a similar valuation levels. Interest from a healthy group of buyers range from local syndicators to large institutional and foreign investors. As expected, leverage buyers remain largely in the sidelines, waiting for more clarity on interest rates. We continue to diligently underwrite deals as we are well positioned to be opportunistic.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Barb Pak. Jamie, it's Andrea here. I think there are a couple of things that are different between how our portfolio is located versus EQR and where the key job nodes are in California versus the rest of the country. So I'll start there. So as it relates to the urban, suburban conversation, keep in mind that in California, most of the large tech companies are actually suburban based. And so that, of course, for us, it's always been a benefit even pre-COVID. And the underlying strength is a couple of factors, right? Lower supply in the suburban [indiscernible] the cities are tougher, quality of life, more homeless and some of these other issues.  And of course, the proximity to employers are much more favorable from that perspective. And so from that perspective, Essex, our view is that the suburban still is more compelling than the urban. And that is consistent to our prime [indiscernible] even for COVID. As far as the return to office, we saw that in Seattle with Amazon early May. And although I do want to say that, that was somewhat muted than normal just because of the layoff announcements. And so it was really people digesting and getting rehired. And so from the return-to-office activity, what we would expect to see is that it will be more pronounced in September with Meta and some of these other larger companies. Essex, for us, we're doing the same thing. We are mandating a 3-day working from office now until September after Labor Day as well. And so we do see that at that point, the activities will resume in a more robust way. Yes, Alex, that's a good question. We haven't seen an active hiring from an international basis yet. And what we have seen is on a net migration for California as a whole. So this is market as a whole. That net outflow remains negative, but it hasn't been -- it's gotten better. So during COVID, it was an extreme outflow. And now when we look at the net migration outflow number, it's pretty consistent to pre-COVID. And so we do think that once we have that international, it would definitely be a good tailwind. As far as when we look at our own portfolio, just on a more granular level, so this is move-ins. We saw a pop last year between the first and third quarter with California reopening, and that acceleration was definitely very encouraging to see. And since then, the move-out, obviously, it's not going to continue at that level in terms of acceleration. But the -- I'm sorry, I meant to say the move-ins, but it has remained positive, and it's been stable. And so that's another good sign. It's Angela here. The key drivers in actually all of our markets have been in the health services and education and, of course, the leisure and hospitality as well. And so with San Diego rebounding, it's been good to see those activities coming back in a more robust way. Just a little context. I think last year, around this time, we were sitting around 7% loss-to-lease. And -- but we were looking at the seasonal curve that is occurring in a more -- that mirror pre-COVID level. What happened was the prior year, we didn't even peak until November. So it's been a little wonky coming out of COVID. And so it's September, generally, as a rule of thumb is a good data point. But just because of the uniqueness in the past couple of years, I just -- we didn't want anyone to just peg a June number as a good rule of thumb."

            "name": "Barbara Pak",
            "content": "Thanks, Angela. I'll begin with a brief overview of our second quarter results, discuss increases to our full year guidance and provide an update on capital markets and the balance sheet. Beginning with our second quarter performance. I'm pleased to report we achieved core FFO per share of $3.77. This result exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.08 per share, of which $0.06 is attributable to better revenue growth and lower property taxes in Washington. Our favorable year-to-date results have enabled us to increase the full year midpoint of our same-property revenue growth by approximately 40 basis points to 4.4%. The increase is due to higher occupancy and net effective rents achieved year-to-date, partially offset by higher delinquency in the second half of the year as compared to our original forecast. As it relates to same-property operating expenses, we have reduced our midpoint by 100 basis points to 4% as a result of a reduction in Washington property taxes.  Due to these revisions, our full year same-property NOI growth has increased to 4.5% at the midpoint, representing a 90 basis points improvement to our guidance -- to our initial guidance. As a result of our strong second quarter and revisions to our same-property outlook, we are raising the full year midpoint of core FFO by $0.22 to $15 per share, which represents 3.4% year-over-year growth. Turning to capital markets activities. We have historically been proactive in managing our capital needs and debt maturity profile, taking advantage of attractive opportunities in the market to refinance our debt early, minimizing our near-term capital needs and maximizing our financial flexibility. Subsequent to quarter-end, we closed a $298 million 10-year secured loan at a fixed rate of 5.08%. Proceeds will be used to repay unsecured bonds maturing in May 2024.  In the interim, the proceeds will be invested in short-term cash accounts, resulting in a positive impact to FFO of approximately $0.03 per share until the unsecured bonds are repaid next year. Our capital markets team did a terrific job monitoring the variety of debt capital sources available and locking in a favorable rate in today's volatile environment. With this refinancing, the company has addressed approximately 50% of the 2024 debt maturities at pro rata share. Finally, our balance sheet metrics remain strong. Leverage continues to decline, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio continues to trend lower and stands at 5.6x today. We have minimum near-term financing needs over the next 18 months and over $1.6 billion in liquidity. As such, the company remains in a strong financial position. I'll now turn the call over to Jessica Anderson. Eric, it's Barb. I would say delinquency is generally tracking in mind. We were ahead in the first 6 months relative to our plan, primarily due to emergency rental assistance payments. July is generally on plan. And we do expect that number will continue to trend lower. And by the end of the year will be below 2%. We left our midpoint unchanged at 2% for the full year. But we are making progress, but it's slow, it's dependent upon the courts and just resident behavior. So it's a little bit out of our control. Steve, this is Barb. I'll take the first part of that question. And so in terms of delinquency, yes, it's roughly 2% for the full year. We're at 2.1% today, year-to-date. And so it's a little bit under that in the back half of the year. Like I said, we do expect it to continue to trend favorable, but it's an inherent lumpy number. And so it's difficult to predict month-to-month, but end of the year should be less than 2% for sure. And then on the blended, I'll let Jessica answer that. Yes. This is Barb. I would say, I think we know -- we've done the vast majority of our leases. We still have some to go. So we know where leases are going to trend this year and that top line number. If we get substantially more rent growth from here, it's really going to benefit 2024 at this point versus 2023 given the amount of time that's left in the year. And the number of leases that we have left to sign is lower in the third and the fourth quarter. And so I think that's the biggest factor. The biggest factor to our guidance at this point in terms of same-store is really delinquency. It can swing up or down. That's the biggest wildcard right now. I think with other -- the other components of the same-store revenue are pretty dialed in. Yes, this is Barb. I would say in the back half of this year, we have easier comps as it relates to eviction costs and turnover because we had those expenses last year in the fourth quarter. And so some of the expenses that we've seen in the first quarter and some of our high R&M, and admin expenses will moderate in the back half of the year just on a year-over-year growth basis. I would say, in terms of other lines this year, I don't see significant change in any other major line this year. I think we've got expenses pretty dialed in for this year, we do know taxes and insurance.  As we look to 2024, it's difficult to predict just yet where we're going to land. We'll be going through our budget process here this quarter, and I'll have more clarity on the next quarter call. The 1 line item that we've talked about in the past is insurance, it still is a very challenging market. We would expect that we would be up 20-plus percent next year on the insurance line. But keep in mind, that's a very small line for us. It's only like 4% of our total OpEx spend. So while the headline number is large, it's a small component of our OpEx. And outside of that and outside of the favorable taxes we have in California, where they only grow 2%, we need a little more time to dial in 2024. Right now, based on what we know, we believe it will be a tough year. We're going to go through our renewal in the fourth quarter of this year. Our renewal comes up in December. And so I'll have more clarity on the next call in terms of that market. But based on what we're hearing, we think it's still a very challenging market. Alex, it's Barb. That's a great question. I will tell you, we do prefer unsecured debt, and that's been kind of our ammo for many, many years as that's the way we finance the balance sheet. In this environment, though, we saw a significant pricing differential between the secured and unsecured market. So while we locked in our -- the secured loans at 5.0%. If we were to go to do an unsecured bond, it would have been 65 to 75 basis points wide of that. And so that pricing differential was so great that we decided to move forward with the secured side of the equation. 95% of our NOI is unencumbered. And so we have lots of room within our covenants to secure a few assets. And there's no change in our overall balance sheet philosophy. It was just really a pricing differential that made us move the way we did. This is Barb again. Yes, you're correct. It is impacted by some of the spillover from the storm and flood damage cleanup costs in the second quarter. We had a lot in the first quarter and some of it still is in the second quarter. And it also had higher turnover costs because keep in mind, we are getting back units. And so it's that and then just general inflation -- inflationary pressures within the R&M space.  And so it's three components. In terms of if we just pulled out the flood, I don't have that in front of me. I'll get back to you on what that would be. But it's really all 3 of those components that drove that increase. In the back half of the year, though, I do expect that number to come down. First of all, we don't expect the same level of storms or floods. It's not a rainy season here right now. And so that should abate and not be in our third or fourth quarter numbers. And then the eviction-related turnover costs, we have easier comps in the third and fourth quarter because we started incurring those last year in the third and fourth quarter. So that 14% that we had in the third quarter should moderate significantly in the third and fourth quarter. John, it's Barb. So property taxes in Washington declined 1% year-over-year. The assessed values went up 15%. So when we were budgeting, we knew assess side were up quite a bit, but millage rates came down. And so that's what drove the favorable year-over-year reduction in taxes. There was -- it wasn't based on a PL. It's really hard to know. So there's a lag effect in terms of when they do the bills. So our '24 bills will be based off of 1 January of '23 assess values, which we don't know what those will be at this point. Obviously, values have changed over the last year. But it also depends on the millage and what the city does with that. And so that's always a wildcard factor. Historically, we've not had a reduction in Seattle taxes 2 years in a row. But -- so we'll have to just monitor and see next year. I don't know if 1 -- a negative 1% is a good way. I wouldn't use that. I don't think that's how we would view it going forward, but we are pleasantly surprised this year. Well, it's definitely a little bit too early to predict that, and we have -- while we've had a typical seasonal curve. It will be interesting to see how the back half of peak leasing season plays out. And yes, I did share it, we have the 1.7% loss-to-lease today. But based on several of our markets, still accelerating with rent growth week-over-week that may grow from here and also the Meta return to office that we're watching and the demand overall in the Bay Area could change how we typically experience in August or September. So in short, it's a little bit early. And yes, we will look at that in September as we typically do. Haendel, it's Barb. It's roughly 2%, a little bit under 2%, consistent with the full year forecast. No, that's the assumption. So we assume 2% for the full year. We're at 2.1% through the first 6 months of the year, we assume effectively like 1.9% in the back half of the year to hit our 2.0% for the full year. So it is an incremental improvement in the back half as well. Yes. I mean we did do stock buybacks in the first quarter, and we will assess our sources of capital to do that because we want to maintain our balance sheet strength and a leverage neutral approach to the stock buyback. So we would need a source of capital to continue to buy back the stock, and so that would imply that we would dispose of something.  So it will all depend on where we can find opportunities to add value to the bottom line. Because at the end of the day, that's our goal on the external front is how can we grow accretively. And to Adam's point, it's hard to do it via acquisitions today. But it doesn't mean that we're just going to go buy back the stock. We would need a source of capital to do that as well. So it all go into the mix. Yes, it's a great question. It's difficult to know. I mean, obviously, we'll get some of that. But -- and none of that is baked into our guidance for delinquency this year. We are making progress collecting. The problem is, until the courts get caught up delinquency keeps accruing because we have tenants that are in our properties a lot longer than they were historically. Pre-COVID, if somebody went delinquent, they were out within 2 to 3 months. And now they go delinquent, they're out in 9 to 12 months. And so that's part of the compounding problem on the delinquency side and the cumulative delinquency side. In terms of what we're going to collect, I can't give you a number. It's just too hard to predict. Yes. I'm not going to throw out a number because it's just not something that we know with any sort of certainty at this point. We're working hard to collect every time that we can. We've used all measures possible to go after these tenants who are delinquent and have delinquent balances, but it's not a number I can throw out there."

            "name": "Jessica Anderson",
            "content": "Thanks, Barb. I'll begin my comments today by providing color on our recent operating results and strategy, followed by regional commentary. I was pleased with our operating results from the second quarter, including a same-property revenue increase of 4% year-over-year. For the first several months of the year, we maintained an occupancy-focused leasing strategy to mitigate expected headwinds from eviction-related move-outs. This approach helped us exceed revenue expectations in the first half of the year and left us well positioned to push rate during peak leasing season, which continues today. Our new lease trade-out accelerated through the second quarter from 0.5% in May to 1.7% in June and finally to a preliminary 2.1% in July. Renewal trade-out is stable and averaged 3.4%, resulting in blended net effective rent growth of 2.2% for the second quarter. These results were achieved despite increased turnover driven by eviction-related move-outs. Given ongoing delinquency court backlog, we will continue to work through evictions for the rest of the year and anticipate some of this activity spilling over into 2024. Moving on to regional specific commentary. In Seattle, blended net effective rent growth averaged negative 0.2% for the second quarter, dragging down the portfolio average. This is attributed to 2 key factors. First is the year-over-year comp. In the second quarter of 2022, Seattle generated a portfolio-leading net effective rent growth of over 16%.  Second, Seattle remains our most seasonal market, thus is more sensitive to changes in the operating environment. You may recall during the back half of 2022, the Seattle market experienced increased supply during a period of softening demand, which heavily impacted rents as we headed into 2023. However, throughout the second quarter, we saw a steady strengthening of demand, particularly in Seattle CBD that coincided with Amazon's mandatory May 1 return-to-office of 3 days a week. Strong leasing activity drove a collective 680 basis point sequential increase in net effective rents from April to June and a solid 97% quarter-end occupancy. Moving on to Northern California. Blended net effective rent growth averaged 1.5% for the second quarter. Oakland continues to be impacted by supply posting a negative 0.4% for the quarter, diluting the healthy 2.7% achieved in San Jose, where the bulk of our Northern California portfolio is located. Despite the tech employment headlines, we still experienced corporate housing activity associated with the large tech companies albeit muted from last year, which helped support seasonal demand. Quarter-end occupancy was also solid at 96.7%.  Lastly, in Southern California, blended net effective rent growth averaged 4.1% for the quarter, driven by continued strength in San Diego, Ventura and Orange County. Los Angeles is pulling the average down with a 1.9% blended lease trade-out for the quarter. However, because of the eviction activity in this market, rent growth and occupancy are expected to run lower relative to the rest of Southern California for the remainder of the year. Quarter-end occupancy in Southern California was 96.3%.  In summary, we are encouraged by our results for the first half of the year and the current operating environment. As we begin the third quarter, we are well positioned with the current physical occupancy of 96.7%, coupled with strong leasing activity across all markets. As we look to the back half of the year, we will reassess our rent growth focused strategy as the summer leasing season wraps up in the next 30 days and maintain our flexible approach to maximize revenue in a variety of market conditions. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions. This is Jessica. Eric, I'll take that. With regards to our shift in strategy around mid-May, we changed from an occupancy-focused strategy to more focus on rent growth. And to your point, what got us more comfortable with that? Well, a couple of things. One would be really the macroeconomic outlook, the headlines that we're seeing earlier in the year and the layoffs, and the headlines overall were concerning. And so we took a proactive approach and the layoffs subsided, and we started seeing strengthening. And then in addition to that, with regards to the eviction, they've been coming back at a pretty steady pace, which is manageable.  And so based on the strength we were seeing in the markets and the manageable pace, at which we were getting the evictions, we felt comfortable shifting to a rate growth focus. And what you're seeing in April and May that we had shared as far as our trade-out numbers so reflects concession usage that was predominantly in April. We averaged about a week free at that point. We did go through a lot of evictions that we wanted to offset and reposition our occupancy at a higher rate right before peak season and some of that activity spilled over into May. But as of today, concession usage is minimal across all of our markets. Steve, this is Jessica. As far as blended goes, I'm going to break that out into new lease and to renewals. And so year-to-date for our new leases, we've achieved 1.1%. But keep in mind, that reflects our focus on maintaining a high occupancy earlier in the year. And so we gave approximately it's over half a week in concessions to maintain that higher occupancy. And when we look at our outlook, we've revised it from 2% full year rent growth to 2.5%, which reflects the broader expectations of the market.  And so in order to make it apples-to-apples, we have to adjust our first half. And so essentially half a week is 1% of rent growth. And so if you add that to our 1.1%, you get to 2.1%, which leads us to 2.8% for new lease growth expected for the back half of the year. And based on the strength that we're seeing in the markets right now, and then the easier comps that we'll be facing in Q3, particularly Q4, that is an achievable number.  And then as far as renewals go, renewals are reaccelerating. We've sent renewals out in August and September at around 4%. You may have noticed in our results that renewals had come down, which essentially went to 2.8% preliminary for July. And renewals trail new leases by approximately 60 to 90 days. So wherever new lease -- new leases go renewals end up following, but we've been able to achieve some solid rent growth. And so therefore, the renewals reaccelerated and expect renewals to be around 4% for the back half of the year. So as far as where we see trade-out going would expect that is slightly different by market, but expect that to accelerate from here. It will be higher in Q4, and that's simply based on the comps, as you pointed out. And then as far as seasonality goes, we see this as being a typical year, and we may have a prolonged peak. We've been monitoring our rents. And typically, we peak in NorCal and Seattle around -- right around about now or mid-July and then SoCal is often a little bit later. But as of this week, we're still seeing rents accelerate in San Jose specifically in Southern California, and some of our other markets are leveling off at this point. So pretty normal, but we're seeing strong leasing on the ground and anticipate a typical seasonal slowdown. Josh, this is Jessica. Yes, we switched really about mid-May. And as far as the mark-to-market, we're looking -- right now, our loss-to-lease is 1.7%. But as I mentioned earlier, still seeing our rents grow in some markets. And so expect that potentially to go up a little bit more. Yes, it's definitely a little suppressed based on our approach earlier in the year. This is Jessica. Yes, we did see Seattle was a large contributor to the sequential improvement, followed by Northern California. Southern California has been performing pretty steadily. And then as far as specific markets in Northern California, San Jose has been particularly strong, which reflects over 40% of our portfolio in the Bay Area. So we've seen strong occupancy, strong leasing demand. That one is encouraging, certainly watching it. We've seen with all of the prior return to office announcement. So Amazon and Seattle CBD and then last year with Google as well in the Bay Area, there's definitely demand associated to these return to office events.  And so anticipating that Meta, which is in September is going to have the same impact. I would imagine, we're experiencing some of that demand right now. And then also, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the corporate housing activity. It is less than last year, but we still saw the activity this year, which is always an encouraging sign as far as the health of the big tech employers, they certainly wouldn't be investing in interns and contract work if they were planning on tightening their belts and we've certainly seen an uptick in hiring as well.  So San Jose has been doing quite well. And then Seattle had already touched on the Seattle CBD and the Amazon returned to office, so that was a factor. And we're still seeing strength in demand today. However, it is our most market. And so we certainly see the most pronounced reduction in rents in the back half of the year in that market. But I expect it to be in line with our typical seasonal curve and expectations there and then also supply. We do have good supply headwinds in Seattle. Some of it was pushed to the first half of 2024. So it's a little bit better than what we originally expected, but we still have some supply on our radar there. Sure. This is Jessica. So concessions in Q2 by region. So if you look at Southern California, it's a little less than half a week. Northern California, 1 week and Seattle a little bit over half a week. So that gets us to 0.7 weeks overall. And keep in mind that a lot of that was concentrated in the April time frame. Some of it's build over into May. By the time we got to the end of the quarter, we pretty much have no concessions across the portfolio with the exception a very small portion of our portfolio that is exposed to lease that's like 10 to 15 properties or so. And then as far as loss-to-lease by market, Southern California, 2.5%; Northern California, 0.7%; and Seattle, 1.9% to make up the 1.7%. This is Jessica. I'll speak to as far as the on-the-ground operations. We have not seen any impact from a strike at this point. We track our exposure to the major studios and it's less than 1% of our L.A. portfolio. And so I think it really comes down to how long the strike is going to go on and if there's potentially a ripple effect to other industries. But at this point, we do not see it have a material impact on our portfolio would have to go on for some time. There may be specific property impact, but not the larger portfolio as a whole. This is Jessica again. As far as A versus B, we do not see a material difference in performance. It's more really location. So back to the whole suburban versus urban concept. And the bulk of our portfolio is suburban, and we are seeing strength in our suburban market versus some of the urban properties. And really, I think that's attributed to supply as well. When we look at where we have concentrations of supply is in these urban locations. So Seattle CBD, Downtown L.A., West L.A., Downtown San Diego, and that's where we would see rent lag. So urban versus suburban is where we're seeing the difference. This is Jessica. So yes, San Diego has been a phenomenal market for us. I think it benefited during the pandemic. It was a popular area to relocate to, rents were lower and overall great quality of life. And as Angela mentioned earlier, there is some underlying employment industries that have strength there. So San Diego has been very solid, and we expect it to continue to perform well. As far as other markets that I have my eye on that are showing signs of strength, go back up to the Bay Area with San Jose. Just to reiterate what I'm seeing there, that's been a strong market for us. And then when you couple that with the recovery as well that we still anticipate with continued return to office and where we're at relative to pre-COVID rent. There's definitely an upside there and then up in the Seattle area for similar reasons. But of course, we're going to be facing some supply headwinds there over the next year."

            "name": "Adam Berry",
            "content": "Haendel, this is Adam. So yes, we are underwriting every deal in the market. And even though in Q2, volume went down pretty considerably. Q3, I expect it to be increased just given the amount of activity in the market today. So we are underwriting a lot of deals right now. And there isn't much of a bit-ask spread. I think many of the deals -- most of the deals that are on the market today will make. So I think there will be capitulation on both sides and a meeting of the minds. And I think echoing what Angela said in her opening comments, I think those are going to be in the mid-4s to low 5s range depending on product, location and then specific circumstances, whether there's assumable debt or some tax abatements.  So as far as when we will be back in the market, I think that's really highly dependent on where our cost of capital is. So given where we're trading today, that it's hard to make accretive deals in the mid-4s to low 5s. And so we will continue to market or continue to monitor the market, and we will act when it makes sense. Robin, this is Adam. So at this point, our intention is to -- well, our guidance really is not to acquire anything in the back half of the year. We -- like I said, we've been underwriting everything. And if there are deals that makes sense strategically that fit in with our existing portfolio, whether through economies of scale or other methods, then we will focus more on those deals. But for the moment, given our cost of capital, we wouldn't expect much on the acquisitions front."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Essex Property Trust First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found on the company's filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Angela Kleiman, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you. Ms. Kleinman, you may begin.\nAngela Kleiman: Good morning. Thank you for joining Essex's first quarter earnings call. Barb Pak and Jessica Anderson will follow me with prepared remarks and Adam Berry is here for Q&A. We are pleased to report a solid first quarter that exceeded our initial expectations, and that we are raising the midpoint of our FFO per share guidance for the full year. Barb and Jessica will provide more details on the quarter, while my comments will focus on our economic outlook, the opportunities within our platform, and some perspectives on the apartment transaction market. Beginning with our outlook for the remainder of the year, we continue to anticipate modest economic growth in 2023 resulting from a more restrictive monetary policy tempering job growth nationally. Our assumptions are detailed on Page 17 of our supplemental package. As we all know, the West Coast is home to some of the largest companies to announce layoffs over the past six months. Even so, the West Coast economies have proven resilient, producing a solid job growth of 2.7% on a trailing three month basis through March. We believe there are two key factors contributing to the durability of the underlying West Coast fundamentals. First, many of the layoff workers have quickly found new jobs. And second, the vast majority of the layoff affected people who do not reside on the West Coast. For example, we continue to monitor WARN notices and, of the largest companies to announce layoffs, only 16% of their reductions have occurred in our markets. With the exception of a few specific submarkets, the overall labor market and demand for housing in the West Coast had a healthy start to the year. On the supply side, the outlook remains favorable with only about 60 basis points of total housing stock forecasted to deliver in 2023, the supply risk in our markets remain low. We expect that continued housing production challenges, such as diminished labor force and high construction costs, should lead to relatively [light] (ph) apartment deliveries for the next several years in our markets. Thus, we do not need meaningful job growth to generate modest rent growth in 2023. Since none of us have control over the Fed or the economy, our team will remain focused on what we can control, which is the continued enhancement of our operating platform. We have been thoughtfully transforming our operating model for several years, which has resulted in one of the most efficient operating platforms in the industry. Relative to our peers, Essex has the highest controllable operating margins and one of the lowest average controllable expense per unit. While the rollout of our property collections model has contributed to this efficiency, we are only midway through implementation. Our next phase of expanding this operating model to the maintenance function will maximize the workflow of our associates, including reducing tasks time and vendor costs. These advancements will enable incremental revenue growth to flow more efficiently to the bottom-line, ultimately generating additional FFO per share and dividend growth throughout all economic cycles. Lastly, turning to investment activities. We're still seeing institutional quality transactions occur from the mid to high 4% market cap rate with a deeper buyer pool towards the high end of this range. Keep in mind that the transaction market is still digesting higher interest rates, as evidenced by a significant reduction in volume of approximately 70% nationally and 60% in the West Coast in the first quarter compared to last year. In addition to the [indiscernible] volume, our cost of capital remains unattractive from an acquisition's perspective. But keep in mind that Essex has a long track record of creating value for our shareholders by arbitraging discrepancies between the stock price and the underlying asset value. Once again, we demonstrated this strategy in the first quarter, locking in significant FFO and NAV per share accretion for shareholders, which is the primary driver of raising our FFO guidance mentioned earlier. We continue to actively evaluate potential deals and are ready to act swiftly and thoughtfully when opportunities emerge. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barb Pak.\nBarb Pak: Thanks, Angela. I'll begin with a few comments on our first quarter results and full year guidance, followed by an update on investment activity and the balance sheet. I'm pleased to report our first quarter core FFO per share grew 8.3% on a year-over-year, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.08. The better-than-expected results are largely attributable to two factors that drove an outperformance in same property revenue growth: first, occupancy trended higher than we expected for the quarter; and second, net delinquencies were better than forecasted as we received $1.3 million in emergency rental assistance. As you may recall, we did not assume any rental assistance funds in our 2023 forecast. Overall gross delinquency was 2.5% of scheduled rents for the quarter, in line with our expectations. Given the favorable first quarter results, we are currently running 30 basis points ahead of our full year midpoint for same property revenue growth. However, given the macroeconomic uncertainty and the timing of recapturing delinquent units, which remains uncertain, we are holding off on changing our same property guidance range until we get further into the peak leasing season. As for core FFO, we are raising our full year midpoint by $0.03 per share, primarily related to accretion from stock repurchases completed in the first quarter and higher other income. Turning to our stock repurchases and investments. During the quarter, we sold a 61-year-old student housing community located in a non-core market. The proceeds were used to buy back the stock on a leverage neutral basis in order to arbitrage a significant disconnect between public and private market pricing. This is another example of how Essex seeks to create value in all environments while at the same time improving our portfolio. As it relates to our preferred equity book, we had little activity to report this quarter. However, for the full year, we still expect about $100 million of early redemption. Our sponsors are able to take advantage of the available financing via Fannie Mae and HUD to redeem us thoroughly. We believe the additional source of financing is one of the many benefits to being in the multifamily sector, which has, over time, helped keep cap rates low. Overall, we remain comfortable with our preferred equity portfolio, especially given how diversified it is both geographically on the West Coast in terms of -- and in terms of the average deal size. Finally, onto the balance sheet. We plan to pay off our upcoming 2023 unsecured bonds that mature May 1 with the proceeds from the $300 million delayed draw term loan, which closed last year. As such, we have no funding needs over the next 12 months. With $1.5 billion in liquidity, limited variable rate debt exposure, and access to a variety of capital sources, our balance sheet remains in a strong position. I will now turn the call to Jessica Anderson.\nJessica Anderson: Thanks, Barb. I'll begin my comments today by providing color on our recent operating results and strategy, followed by regional commentary. I was pleased with our operating results from the first quarter, including a same property revenue increase of 7.6% year-over-year. As Barb mentioned, one core factor driving these results was the successful execution of our occupancy strategy that resulted in a solid 96.7% for the first quarter, up 70 basis points from the fourth quarter. This focus began in Q4 and was done proactively in anticipation of elevated turnover from eviction. During the first quarter, we made progress recapturing units from non-paying tenants and we experienced the highest volume of eviction related move-outs to-date. The number of long-term delinquent residents has declined by 65% from our peak over a year ago, excluding Los Angeles and Alameda County. Additionally, a notable milestone in the first quarter was the ending of the eviction moratoriums in the city and county of Los Angeles, where approximately half of our delinquency resides. Given backloged eviction courts, it will take many months to recapture these units, but steady progress throughout 2023 is expected. I am very proud of the team and appreciate the tremendous amount of work that has gone into recapturing, turning, and re-leasing units. Thank you, team, great job. Throughout the first quarter, we saw positive demand indicators for the portfolio, lead volume, which reflects the number of initial inquiries into leasing an apartment and as a leading indicator of demand, was consistent with and up in some cases over same quarter last year. Additionally, concession usage has declined from approximately two-weeks free in the fourth quarter to a half-a-week free in the first quarter. We are experiencing a relatively normal ramp up to the peak leasing season. Net effective blended rates accelerated through Q1, averaging 2.9% for the quarter and ended with March at 3.8%, although they moderated in April. This was due to a temporary increase in leasing incentives to offset a period of heavy eviction volume. While April averaged 96.4% occupied, we are at 96.9% today and well positioned to absorb additional turnover while still increasing rents as demand allows. Moving on to regional specific commentary. In the Pacific Northwest, our most seasonal market, blended net effective rents were up 30 basis points in the first quarter compared to one year ago. The elevated supply in the downtown submarket is weighing on our regional performance. The supply outlook for Seattle is comparable to 2022 and similarly a more challenging second half of the year is expected. In Northern California, blended net effective rents improved to 2.6% in the first quarter year-over-year. We're seeing strength in the San Jose submarket, offset by supply driven weakness in Oakland. The supply outlook for Northern California remains relatively muted, which will benefit our ability to push rents, presuming job growth continues to outpace the recently announced layoffs. Finally, in Southern California, blended net effective rents were up 5% in the first quarter as demand remained solid. All regions have fared well to start the year, including Los Angeles. As I mentioned earlier, we're expecting elevated turnover in this region driven by eviction. In general, supply outlook in Southern California is very manageable and outside of pockets of supply in submarkets such as West LA, this market is expected to fare well. In summary, 2023 has started off slightly better than expected. Demand for apartments has been solid. We continue to make progress with evictions and our occupancy-focused strategy positions us well. We are cautiously optimistic as we head into the peak leasing season, but also acknowledge the macroeconomic uncertainty that could influence apartment demand through the balance of this year. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.\nNick Yulico: Great. Thanks. Appreciate some of the commentary on the markets and tech job exposure. I guess if you were to quantify some of the impact to markets whether it's parts of Oakland, Downtown Seattle, any other more difficult markets right now within the portfolio, how would you come up with that as a percentage of a total company?\nAngela Kleiman: Yeah. Hey, Nick. It's Angela here. Good question. On the -- on our portfolio composition, big picture, we have about 20% of exposure in Seattle and 40% in Northern California and 40% in Southern California. And so when we look at the overall portfolio composition, we're actually pretty comfortable at where everything is sitting and our results have delivered, especially in Q1, the way we had anticipated. Now, there are pockets of softness. For example, I think you heard about Downtown Seattle and certain pockets in Downtown LA. And so, Downtown LA, for example, is about 2% of our portfolio. And so, in aggregate, it's not so meaningful that gives us pause. And as you can see by our Q1 results that it's -- we're generally trending well here.\nNick Yulico: Great. That's helpful. And then just a second question is I know you talked a little bit about the tracking ahead of same store revenue growth guidance right now. I guess in terms of what some of -- you could talk a little bit more about some of the offsets that could prevent the guidance raise in the second quarter. I don't know if it's the delinquent units coming back to market and how they get leased. And then, separately on the economic forecast, it sounds like the job losses are playing out better than expected year-to-date. In many cases, large tech has already come out with their announcements. So, maybe talk a little bit more about the decision to not change some of the economic forecasts as well. Thanks.\nAngela Kleiman: Yeah, it's Angela here again. Good question. And it's something we debated, because you -- as you know, in Q1, jobs did track better than what we expected. Having said that, I do think that visibility this year is just more limited than past years because it's -- because of Fed's position, right? And the next Fed meeting isn't until May 1. And so, we are anticipating a mild recession, and that is a factor, and that's nationwide, of course, it's not Essex. And you're right, with the tech layoffs, especially looking at the WARN notices, we have -- we saw that peaked in January and appears to be trending down, but it's just too early to really have clear visibility on where the economy is headed. And Barb will talk about guidance.\nBarb Pak: Hi, Nick. Yeah, I would say on the guidance piece, delinquency, obviously, is something that's still a little bit uncertain to predict in terms of getting units back. As Jessica mentioned, LA, Alameda, just are coming out of their eviction moratoriums. And so, the timing on when we're going to get those units back is uncertain. And so that's a factor. And we also want to get a little further into the peak leasing season given the uncertainty that Angela just mentioned. And then, we'll do a full reforecast for the second quarter. But the first quarter was very strong for us, and we feel we feel pretty good going into second quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Wolfe with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nEric Wolfe: Thanks. I guess with respect to the stock repurchases, is there an internal limit sort of in the short term or long term, or just as long as you're able to sell assets and then buy back your stock at a reasonable discount, you'll just keep going?\nBarb Pak: Hi. This is Barb. We're going to match fund, asset sales with stock repurchases, so we know what we're locking in in terms of value. We do have an internal NAV and we know where the value of our assets are. And so, we're going to be cognizant of it. We're going to be mindful of the balance sheet, liquidity, and maintain our strong balance sheet structure. And so, it's not we're just going to do it to do. We want to make sure that we're thoughtful about doing it. And what we did in the first quarter is we sold an asset that's non-core. It actually doesn't fit with our new operating model. We got a very attractive price for it. And then, we're able to take it and redeploy them buy back the stock and create a lot of value that way. So, we're going to be very thoughtful going forward.\nEric Wolfe: Right. And I guess, what I was trying to understand is just -- if you're able to sell $200 million, you're able to sell $300 million successfully, you'd be willing to repurchase $300 million? Or is there just sort of a certain point where from a G&A perspective and sticking other sort of considerations into account that it's just not as efficient for you to keep selling assets and buyback stock? And then, I guess to sort of add on to that question, for your internal NAV, are you using the cap rates that you see transact in your markets or sort of making adjustments about where it should be based on debt cost? Because I think the theory of that it's a pretty thin transaction market right now. So, the cap rates we're seeing may not be sort of reflective of where things would transact if they had to.\nBarb Pak: Yeah. Our NAV is based off of -- Adam and I sit down and we talk about where transactions are happening and where we think we could sell our assets today, and based off of what is happening and negotiations that are going on behind the scenes. And so, we feel like we have a good pulse on the market. We have sold assets over the last several years and proven out the value for the portfolio. And so that is the process on the NAV side. And we're very comfortable transacting and selling and then buying back the stock.\nEric Wolfe: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Sakwa: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I guess maybe for Jessica, I was hoping you could speak a little bit to the blended rates that you talked about. I think in April you said maybe there were some impact from the eviction. So I'm just hoping to see if you could quantify that, because I think amongst all your peers, you might be the only one that showed a decline in April. So just trying to get a sense of the magnitude of that and maybe what your expectations are for May and June.\nJessica Anderson: Hi, Steve. Yeah. The -- overall those numbers -- those blended numbers that we're looking at, those are net effective trade out numbers. And so, I think it's important to point out, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that through March, so they grew sequentially throughout the quarter. So April really reflected a point in time pricing strategy rather than underlying market fundamentals. And we've expected with the evictions, we're working through quite a few. And they do come to us in a steady stream, but we do anticipate that there might be some concentrations from time to time. And so that's what's really driven our occupancy-focused strategy. And you really saw that play out with our April occupancy number. We had floated down after seeing a concentration in March to 96.4%. But ultimately when we start -- when we think about as far as the market and how they're progressing through the seasonal ramp up and the strength there, we really look at our market rent, which is essentially the -- our gross recently achieved leases. And since the beginning of the year, we have seen our market rates grow sequentially through April in all of our markets. And so, those net effective trade outs and of course incorporate concessions and again really reflects a point in time. So, we saw really great activity in April and we were roughly one-week free as far as concessions go. And we've since pulled back to only a couple of days today on average. And breakdown by market, we're actually sitting at 97% in Seattle, 97% in Northern California and then 96.8% today. So, ultimately, we're pulling back on the concessions. There might be a little bit of a spillover into May, and we expect the trade out rates to reaccelerate from here and then also market rents to continue to grow.\nSteve Sakwa: Thanks. And then, I guess maybe as a follow-up, just to get a little more color on Seattle. I mean some of your peers had maybe a bit more weakness and spoke to the weakness specifically in Downtown Seattle. I know that you have probably more East side exposure. But just any thoughts around Seattle in particular? And does Amazon's kind of May 1st return to office policy have any influence or have you seen any influence from that? Or do you think people were sort of already back in the Seattle market? Or do you think there's a wave of people to come back to the market in the near term?\nJessica Anderson: I think, yes, overall for Seattle -- and we have a pretty conservative outlook for Seattle this year. And as I mentioned that I think it will be more challenging in the back half as we experience more supply. And we've been experiencing that really for the last six months. But interestingly, yes, in April, we did see quite a bit of movement from a leasing velocity perspective. So I do feel like that May 1st return to -- mandatory return to office three days a week for Amazon potentially had an impact for us. And as far as strength goes, I mean anytime you introduce leasing incentives or adjust your rates, how the market responds and the leasing velocity you're able to get is really telling. And so we weren't necessarily getting 97% in Seattle. So that really goes just to show that there is some underlying strength there. And so I think Amazon did play out. But again, we have a pretty conservative outlook and we're certainly seeing the impacts of demand with the diminishing of the hiring with Amazon and Microsoft. Last year having July, August 30,000 open positions that essentially disappeared in a matter of a month or two. And then, obviously, we have the supply factors. We have both things working [against us] (ph). But, we're encouraged and I think Seattle is on track with our expectations for the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Great. Thank you. Sort of going back to the stock buyback conversation, I guess in sort of the sources and uses or match funding, any future repurchases, are you guys currently marketing any additional non-core assets today?\nAdam Berry: Hey, Austin. This is Adam. Apologies. So at the moment, we are not actively marketing anything. We're always opportunistically looking at potential for disposing of assets that are either non-core or in non-core markets. And this is how [indiscernible] deal we sold last quarter, that's how that came about. But currently no, not marketing anything right now.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Got it. And then just going back to guidance a little bit. I mean, you mentioned a couple components of driving the same store revenue outperformance in the first quarter. First, which is obviously a non-recurring item in the ERA payments. Have you received any additionally ERA payments in the second quarter? And then, second, with the dip in April, I guess how is April trending relative to plan? Is it offsetting some of the benefit you had in 1Q? Or is April occupancy and rents also trending ahead of plan? Thank you.\nBarb Pak: Yeah. This is Barb. On the Emergency Rental Assistance payments, in April, we had a $100,000 in our same store portfolio, so nothing material. And that is disclosed in our supplemental. And then in terms of factors in the April guidance, the one thing I would say is that for delinquency, we did assume the first half of the year would be in the mid 2% range, 2.5%. And then the back half, we expect continues to trend down to close to 1.5% and 2% for the full year. So we're on plan with delinquency in April, and then occupancy at 96.4% is generally in line with plan as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nJamie Feldman: Great. Thank you. I was hoping to shift gears to the expense side. Can you talk about just the key line items in expenses? There's been a lot of volatility for insurance for people and taxes. Just kind of what gives you conviction on your current outlook for the different expense lines? And where do you think maybe there might be some risk either the upside or downside of the growth rates?\nBarb Pak: Yes, this is Barb again. So on the expense side, I think the biggest variability we're seeing is really maintenance and repairs, because we have more turnover, we had some more flood damage this quarter. So that's kind of one time we don't expect that to reoccur, but we do expect the turnover to be a reoccurring item given evictions. I would say, on the insurance, we've already done our insurance renewal for the year. So that line is pretty baked and we don't expect any surprises from here on out. It is up 20%, but that's going to be the number for the year. And then, on the tax side, we do have the benefit of Prop 13, and so -- which is 80% of our tax base. And so that is pretty well known. We'll know Seattle taxes here in the second quarter and then really have that drilled in. And so for us, the variability on expenses is mostly just tied to R&M. And then utilities, the one thing on utilities is it can be variable. We did -- we've put in place some gas hedges, which has helped us on the utility expense side. And so, it's kept at to a more moderate level, all else being equal.\nJamie Feldman: Okay, thanks, Barb. And then, Orange County seems to have come through this quarter pretty well across most portfolios, including yours. Can you just talk more about what's going in that submarket specifically?\nBarb Pak: Yeah. As far as Orange County goes, it is -- it has performed well. For the last couple of years, we were seeing good trade out numbers, good leasing velocity. It's really stable as far as the supply outlook. There's nothing noteworthy there as well. So, overall, Orange County is pretty stable as a lot of our Southern California markets, San Diego is similar as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Kim: Thank you. Barb, can just elaborate a little bit more on the real estate taxes? You had the rare decline in taxes. And I think you mentioned last quarter you were budgeting 4.25% increase. And given real estate taxes are the largest components of OpEx and insurance came in pretty much where you expected, is there the likelihood of your expense guidance going down during the year?\nBarb Pak: John. So, on the tax line, it really deals with the comp issue from the first quarter of last year. So, in Seattle, if you recall, we did have a favorable surprise last year where our real estate taxes went down 4%. We didn't know that until the second quarter. The first quarter of last year was our budget and what we assumed taxes would be. And so it was way too high. so we're comping off of a really easy comp, and that's why you see the negative 1.6 on the tax line. We -- like I said a few minutes ago, we'll know where Seattle taxes come in, in the second quarter when we pay the bills. And so, that's still TBD. We're still assuming 4.25% overall for the tax line for this year. It's really just a comp issue in the first quarter.\nJohn Kim: Okay. I mean I saw last year's first quarter wasn't that high, that was like 3%. But anyway, my second question is on your mezz opportunities. It seems like with regional banks having issues that could be a part of the capital stack where you could see more opportunities at higher yields. And I'm wondering if that's the case and how you would stack that up versus buybacks.\nAdam Berry: Hi, John. This is Adam. So over the last couple of months, we've seen, I would say, a slight uptick in possible opportunities come in the mezz and pref world. As you said, some of the lending sources out there have either tightened or disappeared entirely. It remains to be seen if this new wave that we're seeing will actually translate into deals. There are legacy development deals that have been out there a while. There are some new, actually existing deals that we're seeing as well. But again, this process takes a long time and several months. And so, we're assessing a number of new opportunities, but very too early to tell how many of them translate into actual deals. But we'll always -- we'll continue to look at potential options when we have liquidity, whether that's through dispositions or redemptions, what the best use of that capital is.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC. Please proceed with your question.\nBrad Heffern: Yeah. Hi, everybody. Thanks. So the big tech layoffs have already been touched on, but I'm wondering what effect, if any, do you think the SVB failure and the associated impact on tech company funding they have on your residents. I know you typically talk about a relatively small exposure to big tech in the resident base, but I'm curious if you think that applies to start-ups as well.\nAngela Kleiman: Yeah. Hey, Brad, it's Angela here. With the SVB failure that occurred recently, we did not see any impact to our portfolio. And so, looking forward, obviously, we don't know what can happen. But we do know that the parent has filed for bankruptcy. But its subsidiary, which SVB has -- the Fed stepped in and then it's been sold. And so we certainly don't expect further disruption from that. And just looking at some anecdotal information, looking at the 30-plus companies in our real estate technology ventures, there's no impact there either. So, as it relates to kind of a broad banking sector, it could -- it may play into more a broad economy conversation. And for those -- that's one of those reasons that we are forecasting a mild recession in our current expectations.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. Got it. Thanks for that. And then maybe for Barb, another one on the guide. The increase to the guide was smaller than the beat versus the first quarter midpoint guide. I know you mentioned that most things are outperforming, and then you had the repurchase as well, but it seems like there was some sort of offset for the rest of the year, second quarter to fourth quarter. So, can you talk about what that is?\nBarb Pak: Yes. So, the vast majority of the beat in the first quarter was really tied to same-store revenue growth, and we didn't change our revenue outlook. And so that is not carried forward through in the guidance. So that was $0.07 of the $0.08 beat. The reason we changed our guidance was the stock repurchase, which will carry forward, that's $0.03. And then, we also have higher other income, mostly tied to better rates on our cash management platform and how we're managing our cash and our marketable securities. And then, it's partially offset by lower co-investment tied to preferred equity redemptions and the timing of those redemptions. So that's what was updated in the guidance. Same-store will be revisited here in the second quarter.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nAdam Kramer: Hey guys. Thanks for the question. Just wanted to ask about -- look, I know we touched on kind of tech and SVB. Maybe asking the same question a little bit differently, which is just on kind of severance packages. I know some of the early layoffs last year, maybe some even -- later in the year, have longer severance packages, right, and so maybe you wouldn't kind of see that change in resident behavior right away. Wondering if maybe since some time has passed since then [indiscernible] many differences in resident behavior kind of given the severance packages that may be expiring now?\nAngela Kleiman: Yes. It's Angela here. The severance packages can range up to three months. Having said that, given the bulk of the layoff announcements that occurred back in January and tenants behavior, they tend to make decisions, say, 45 days to 60 days in advance for major events. We -- what our expectation is that we've seen that play through our portfolio. We've digested it already. And once again, I kind of want to point to the job growth numbers as a good indicator. But the other good indicator is the initial unemployment claims in California and Washington. And today, they still remain below the 15-year average. So that's another good data point there.\nAdam Kramer: That's great. That's all super helpful. Maybe a follow-up. I think you guys have done a really good job of kind of bringing us into your minds when it comes to kind of managing occupancy versus pushing rents I think both on this call and in prior calls. Maybe just kind of on a go-forward basis, walk us through kind of that trade-off, right? I know you mentioned concessions now lower than they were earlier in April. Walk us through maybe just kind of how you're thinking about that trade off now, given kind of the demand screen today, right, how you're thinking about kind of managing occupancy versus pushing rents?\nJessica Anderson: Hey, Adam, this is Jessica. Yes, so we're progressing through the peak leasing season. And of course, we're always going to be opportunistic with a focus on maximizing revenue. I think overall, with our outlook for the year, I think we'll probably spends the bulk of the year focused on occupancy based on -- we know we're going to continue to have to work through evictions. But also rent growth is moderating. And when you think about as far as rate growth, any time you're turning an apartment, you're experiencing the turn costs and the cost of vacancy. And so you really have to be getting some really strong trade out numbers to make it make sense to be focused on rate over occupancy. But certainly, we'll monitor the markets closely. And just like we pulled back concessions at the end of April and leaving us well positioned for the peak growth period that typically occurs in Q2, we certainly have opportunities again to maximize revenue overall.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Hey, good morning out there. So two questions. First, just going back to Silicon Valley. Let me ask the question this way. You guys mentioned that you anticipate the $100 million of debt and preferred equity being taken out this year and that the owners of properties have capital options in Fannie and Freddie. So, are you saying that what's going on in banking and where we see people, lenders pulling back from real estate loans, that's having no impact on your debt and preferred equity portfolio? Or is it just this $100 million that you're slated for being taken out is fine, but broader speaking, there are bank fallouts to the debt and preferred equity business?\nBarb Pak: Hi, Alex, it's Barb. What I was speaking to is that there is still capital available in the multifamily space. I know in other sectors, it's just definitely pulled back, and I definitely think the banks have pulled back. But the government financing is still available. Life insurance companies are stepping in. And I think you're seeing other lenders step in. And in our preferred book, keep in mind the deals that we're getting taken out of, they were underwritten 2019, 2020, a long time ago when cap rates were in the mid 3.5%, and so we can get fully taken out. And so I think they're good situation for us. And we haven't seen any real issues within our own portfolio. It doesn't mean that it's not happening elsewhere. But in terms of distress in the whole market, we haven't seen that in a significant way on the West Coast.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. The second question is going back to supply. It sounded like the only market that was an issue is Seattle, and I'm assuming that's Seattle Downtown, not the suburbs. But in general, as you look at your portfolio into next year and the year after, do you see supply coming down everywhere, like Northern Cal is clearly that's been a pullback. But do you see any area where there's going to be a deluge of supply that's going to deliver next year? Or as you look across your portfolio, whatever this sort of is the peak and next year should be less supply across your markets?\nAngela Kleiman: Hey, Alex, it's Angela here. It's a good question. I'm trying to figure out looking ahead, what's happening here. In terms of our portfolio, just big picture starting this year compared to last year, overall supply is slightly down. But the vast majority, as you pointed out, is Northern California is down over 20%. And Southern California is up slightly about 14%, and the bulk of it is in the Downtown LA and then some of these other West LA, certain other markets. But overall, of course, that supply number is quite muted. As we look forward to 2022 -- 2024, what we're seeing preliminarily [indiscernible] landscape. And so not a huge drop-off, but similar level. But keep in mind, we're already operating at a pretty darn down low level, right? I mean total supply as a percent of total stock is only 60 basis points. And so, we do foresee that to continue especially given the environment of much more challenging labor force available and higher construction costs. And lastly, rents in the northern region haven't moved significantly past pre-COVID. So, Northern California is still slightly below pre-COVID level. And so, it didn't surprise us that Southern California supply picked up slightly this year. And I think you kind of see that throughout the country where you have significant rent growth that's where supply will occur. So that's the big picture of our overall this year and next year, similar levels and it's going [indiscernible] in our markets.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. So, just to clarify, Seattle, it is just Downtown Seattle, that's the issue, right?\nAngela Kleiman: Seattle overall is slightly down, but Downtown is up.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay.\nAngela Kleiman: So, yes.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nAnthony Powell: Hi, good morning. Going back to the share buybacks, do you have a number of assets or a dollar number in terms of non-core that you would sell? And if you were to get offers on core assets at those 4% to high 4% cap rates, would you opportunistically sell those to buy back stock accretively?\nAdam Berry: So, on the first -- hi, Anthony, this is Adam. The first part of your question, do we have a list of non-core assets, the answer is yes. And we're constantly having discussions and going through those to see where they could potentially sell and what we could do with the proceeds. As to the amount with which we can buy stock back, there are challenges always with dispositions. There's always the different ramifications of tax gains, Prop 13. So all of those are taken into account when we assess what we can do with those proceeds. There's also another tool in the shed is to use 1031 exchanges to exchange out of non-core assets into markets that we think will overall affect the portfolio in a positive way.\nAnthony Powell: Okay, thanks. And maybe more broadly, it sounds like you're a bit more optimistic on kind of the West Coast markets recovering this year despite the layoff activity. Does this make you -- does it just reinforce your view on the West Coast has the best use of capital, the best place to invest? Or would you still consider maybe diversifying into the East Coast or Sunbelt as we've talked before about in prior calls?\nAngela Kleiman: Yeah, hi. It's Angela here. On the diversification question or expanding outside of West Coast, it is something that we have been disciplined about evaluating. And so that -- just that basic discipline has not changed. We're going to continue to monitor those markets and look for opportunities. But back to your original point, I think you hit the nail on the head, especially as it relates to Northern California, a couple of things going for our markets where we have the lowest supply deliveries and especially Northern California supply is down 22%. We're just starting to rebound in terms of job growth, getting jobs -- numbers getting back to pre-COVID levels and market rents still below with gradual improvements. We're in the best affordability position from a rent-to-income perspective in the northern region, below long-term average. And so that would point to all the best growth prospects. On the just broad picture on the migration front, and we all experienced meaningful net migration during COVID, while the migration landscape has been improving gradually as well. And so, you put together all those pieces [indiscernible] point to that where we want to deploy our dollar, where we see the most upside ahead of us, it's in the West Coast.\nAnthony Powell: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nWes Golladay: Hey, everyone. I just want to get your view on maybe starting developments with the hopes of delivering into our better part of the cycle.\nAdam Berry: Hi, Wes. This is Adam. It's -- the development landscape today is challenging for a number of reasons. Angela has pointed to a few of them. With a challenging labor market, construction costs have remained elevated. And so when solving for a, call it, 20% premium over where market cap rates are, it just -- it basically will lead to a lower land price than landowners are willing to go. So, sure, we would love to be delivering into a lesser supply market, but right now, it's just the development deals just don't cancel.\nWes Golladay: Got it. And can you remind us, don't you have a few covered land place? Or did you get rid of those?\nAdam Berry: We do, yes. And those are still generating active revenue. And now with some, we're pursuing entitlements in the meantime, so parallel processing and others have just longer-term lease commitments.\nWes Golladay: Okay. And then could you talk about maybe the demand from people that currently have H1B visa? Do you view it as maybe a potential positive with more people getting visa or with tech layoffs, maybe you might lose a few people?\nAngela Kleiman: We actually see the international part to be a tailwind for us, because it's just starting. And so I think it's no surprise that historically, California has a net out-migration if you only look at domestic numbers. In fact, 17 out of the last 20 years, it's net out-migration domestically. And even during those periods, we had meaningful rent growth acceleration. So the international component is what drives migration to become positive for California. And that virtually disappeared. I mean it was zero during COVID. And so that is just starting to come back. And so we are hopeful that will be additive to the demographics piece.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. My question is about migration. How is demand from customers -- how has demand been from customers currently living outside Essex's market? And how does that compare with normal? And then also the other side, have you seen increased or decreased move-outs to non-Essex markets?\nAngela Kleiman: Yes, that's a good question. Compared to the migration from outside of Essex markets, we are generally -- just domestically speaking, of course, we're generally back to pre-COVID levels. And so that's a good thing. And with -- of course, with the international, we do see that's where the tailwind is. As far as the out-migration piece, when we look at the migration numbers, we look at it on a net basis. And so we're continuing to see gradual improvements.\nMichael Goldsmith: Got it. And my follow-up, we talked a lot about tech layoffs, but have you seen any specific changes in the reasons for move out?\nAngela Kleiman: Yes. We really haven't. I mean, we've track, of course, the usual move-outs to purchase a home that's below the long-term average, move out for jobs, new jobs or transfers or loss on that one bucket. And in totality, it's generally in line with historical norms. And so what I think is happening is what we're seeing, which is that the job losses are being quickly absorbed and benefited by that gradual in-migration on a net basis.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Chandni Luthra, your line is live.\nChandni Luthra: Sorry, I was on mute, sorry about that. Could you give us any thoughts around the RealPage issue? Any changes you are making to your operating platform considering those dynamics? And then how are you thinking about the rolled-up class action suit?\nAngela Kleiman: Hey, Chandni, it's Angela here. We actually have been reducing our usage of RealPage as we develop our new revenue management system over the past several years. And so, we started as well before the RealPage lawsuit for the reasons that Jessica mentioned earlier. So, we believe that their claim is without any merit, and we're very confident about our defense prospects.\nChandni Luthra: Great. And as a follow-up, and sorry if I missed this, but what was gross delinquency in the first quarter? I believe net was 2.1%. And then as we sort of think about delinquencies improving faster than expected with eviction moratorium going away and the process becoming easier, could there be upside to that 2% growth delinquency numbers that you laid out earlier?\nBarb Pak: Hi, Chandni, it's Barb. So in the first quarter, gross delinquencies were 2.5% versus the reported number of 2.1%, so 40 basis point improvement tied to Emergency Rental Assistance. And then for the outlook for the year, the 2%, we're still holding to it. I think LA and Alameda just come off. It's really going to depend on how quickly the court move on these evictions. It's taking six-plus months right now. And so that really is going to depend how quickly either people go through the whole eviction process or whether they just skip. And that's a little unknown at this point. I think in the next few months, we'll have a better visibility on that.\nChandni Luthra: Great. Thank you for the detail.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Pawlowski: Thanks. Maybe just a follow-up question to that bad debt topic. Barb, just one question on the longer-term bad debt profile of your markets. Based off the current trajectory of gross delinquencies and just the payment behavior that you're seeing among tenants, do you think when the dust settles, bad debt actually settles out at a structurally higher level versus pre-pandemic behavior? And if not, when is your best guess on when bad debt does get back to pre-pandemic levels?\nBarb Pak: Yes, John, it's a great question, something we talk about internally a lot. We historically have been at 35 basis points pre-COVID. We believe we will ultimately get back there because there won't be any loss to protect tenants like there was during COVID, which allow tenants to have this behavior. And so now that we're coming out of all of the moratoriums, I think the City of Oakland is the only one that really remains, we think we will get back there. But it's going to take until into 2024 to get there. And it won't be -- for the full year of 2024, it's going to take into that year because of the eviction process and how long it's taking. But structurally, we don't believe that there will be a fundamental shift in delinquency and our long-term trends will go up because of COVID.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. In your unregulated submarkets within the portfolio, has bad debt reverted fully back to pre-COVID levels?\nBarb Pak: I don't think we -- no, I don't think we've gone back fully to pre-COVID levels in our other markets. As Jessica said, in the call or in our prepared comments that we've gotten over 60% of our long-term delinquent residents out over the past or since the start of 2022. So, we're making good progress, but we're not fully back to where we should be at this point.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. And then last question for me is more of a regional question for Angela or Jessica. If you start the clock today, which region do you think would generate the highest and lowest revenue growth for the next two or three years, Seattle, Northern California or Southern California?\nAngela Kleiman: It's Angela here. I'll start, and Jessica, welcome to add. In terms of the upside or the most revenue growth, we definitely see Northern California being in the top of that list followed by Seattle and then Southern California. And both for -- with Northern California because of, as I said earlier, the job growth is just getting back to pre-COVID levels, market rents are still below pre-COVID, but it has been gradually improving. It has the lowest level of supply deliveries relative to our other portfolio and the best affordability position. And so that -- for those reasons, it's ranked number one. And Seattle for similar reasons, but it does have a higher supply, and then it's more volatile or more seasonal. And so -- which means that -- so with Southern California coming in last, not because we don't like it, it's just because it's just done so well. I mean it's 15%, in some cases, 20%, 30% rent growth above pre-COVID. And we're starting to see some supply pressure, which -- it's still in check relative to the rest -- the U.S., but relative to our markets, it's starting to creep up. And so that's the order of the ranking. Jessica?\nJessica Anderson: No, nothing to add.\nJohn Pawlowski: Agreed.\nAngela Kleiman: Okay. Good. Glad you agree.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.\nBarry Lou: Hey, it's Barry Lou on the line for Haendel St. Juste. I just want to have a quick follow-up on the regulatory question. So, I was wondering if you could provide any color on the $8.5 million in legal settlements added back to your core FFO. Wondering if that's from one big settlement? And if there's any piece of that, that will trickle into future quarters? Thank you.\nBarb Pak: This is Barb. It was primarily related to a legal settlement for construction defect at one of our properties, and there's no carry-forward on that. That was just a one-time item that occurred in the first quarter. It was paid in cash. So that's done.\nBarry Lou: Got it. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Yes, thanks for the time, everyone. I just wanted to touch base on the new revenue management software you rolled out at the start of the year. Just curious to kind of hear your experience as you're using that now, and how it's trending versus your expectations, and just -- maybe just the capabilities versus your old software?\nJessica Anderson: Hi. This is Jessica. Yes, things are going very well. We're very pleased with the platform thus far, and we have a long development pipeline for that revenue management system. So, all is going well. I mean a couple of benefits to point out that we're looking at is in alignment and allows us to price at a portfolio level with our property collections model versus the commercially available systems you're often pricing at the property level. And then second, we also see, as far as long-term development, the ability to optimize our amenities. So when you look at like our average rent, it's $2,600 and good $200 of that is actually fixed amenity values. And again, with your commercially available systems, that portion of the rent is not optimized. And so if you look at that on an annual basis, what that is for us is over $100 million that's not optimized. So that's one opportunity we also see moving forward with the system. So there's a few value-add opportunities to give you a couple of examples.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. Thanks, Jessica. Maybe just one follow-up on that. What exactly do you mean by like price of the portfolio level? And like what's the benefit to having it done that way?\nJessica Anderson: Well, when you're looking at, we have a high geographic concentration. And so when you're pricing properties individually, sometimes you can be kind of cannibalizing yourself based on the occupancy position at a property. And so, when you're looking at an entire portfolio collectively one-bedrooms, two-bedrooms, ultimately, you can maximize revenue through a more stable approach to rents and the balance with occupancy.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Appreciate that. Thanks, Jessica.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nLinda Tsai: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just one on the job market. To the extent that job growth has fully recovered to pre-COVID, WARN notices are below average, and that laid off people are finding jobs quickly again, do you have a sense of what industries people are getting hired to?\nAngela Kleiman: Yes. In our markets, well, in the northern regions is, of course, more tech centric. But in the Southern California, it's more service driven, leisure and hospitality. It's much more diversified and mirrors that of the U.S. broad economy with more professional services and, of course, higher income levels.\nLinda Tsai: Are the -- is the tech hiring from the ones that are also laying off, or is it more diversified?\nAngela Kleiman: It's more diversified.\nLinda Tsai: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions in the queue. This does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Angela Kleiman",
            "content": "Good morning. Thank you for joining Essex's first quarter earnings call. Barb Pak and Jessica Anderson will follow me with prepared remarks and Adam Berry is here for Q&A. We are pleased to report a solid first quarter that exceeded our initial expectations, and that we are raising the midpoint of our FFO per share guidance for the full year. Barb and Jessica will provide more details on the quarter, while my comments will focus on our economic outlook, the opportunities within our platform, and some perspectives on the apartment transaction market. Beginning with our outlook for the remainder of the year, we continue to anticipate modest economic growth in 2023 resulting from a more restrictive monetary policy tempering job growth nationally. Our assumptions are detailed on Page 17 of our supplemental package. As we all know, the West Coast is home to some of the largest companies to announce layoffs over the past six months. Even so, the West Coast economies have proven resilient, producing a solid job growth of 2.7% on a trailing three month basis through March. We believe there are two key factors contributing to the durability of the underlying West Coast fundamentals. First, many of the layoff workers have quickly found new jobs. And second, the vast majority of the layoff affected people who do not reside on the West Coast. For example, we continue to monitor WARN notices and, of the largest companies to announce layoffs, only 16% of their reductions have occurred in our markets. With the exception of a few specific submarkets, the overall labor market and demand for housing in the West Coast had a healthy start to the year. On the supply side, the outlook remains favorable with only about 60 basis points of total housing stock forecasted to deliver in 2023, the supply risk in our markets remain low. We expect that continued housing production challenges, such as diminished labor force and high construction costs, should lead to relatively [light] (ph) apartment deliveries for the next several years in our markets. Thus, we do not need meaningful job growth to generate modest rent growth in 2023. Since none of us have control over the Fed or the economy, our team will remain focused on what we can control, which is the continued enhancement of our operating platform. We have been thoughtfully transforming our operating model for several years, which has resulted in one of the most efficient operating platforms in the industry. Relative to our peers, Essex has the highest controllable operating margins and one of the lowest average controllable expense per unit. While the rollout of our property collections model has contributed to this efficiency, we are only midway through implementation. Our next phase of expanding this operating model to the maintenance function will maximize the workflow of our associates, including reducing tasks time and vendor costs. These advancements will enable incremental revenue growth to flow more efficiently to the bottom-line, ultimately generating additional FFO per share and dividend growth throughout all economic cycles. Lastly, turning to investment activities. We're still seeing institutional quality transactions occur from the mid to high 4% market cap rate with a deeper buyer pool towards the high end of this range. Keep in mind that the transaction market is still digesting higher interest rates, as evidenced by a significant reduction in volume of approximately 70% nationally and 60% in the West Coast in the first quarter compared to last year. In addition to the [indiscernible] volume, our cost of capital remains unattractive from an acquisition's perspective. But keep in mind that Essex has a long track record of creating value for our shareholders by arbitraging discrepancies between the stock price and the underlying asset value. Once again, we demonstrated this strategy in the first quarter, locking in significant FFO and NAV per share accretion for shareholders, which is the primary driver of raising our FFO guidance mentioned earlier. We continue to actively evaluate potential deals and are ready to act swiftly and thoughtfully when opportunities emerge. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barb Pak. Yeah. Hey, Nick. It's Angela here. Good question. On the -- on our portfolio composition, big picture, we have about 20% of exposure in Seattle and 40% in Northern California and 40% in Southern California. And so when we look at the overall portfolio composition, we're actually pretty comfortable at where everything is sitting and our results have delivered, especially in Q1, the way we had anticipated. Now, there are pockets of softness. For example, I think you heard about Downtown Seattle and certain pockets in Downtown LA. And so, Downtown LA, for example, is about 2% of our portfolio. And so, in aggregate, it's not so meaningful that gives us pause. And as you can see by our Q1 results that it's -- we're generally trending well here. Yeah, it's Angela here again. Good question. And it's something we debated, because you -- as you know, in Q1, jobs did track better than what we expected. Having said that, I do think that visibility this year is just more limited than past years because it's -- because of Fed's position, right? And the next Fed meeting isn't until May 1. And so, we are anticipating a mild recession, and that is a factor, and that's nationwide, of course, it's not Essex. And you're right, with the tech layoffs, especially looking at the WARN notices, we have -- we saw that peaked in January and appears to be trending down, but it's just too early to really have clear visibility on where the economy is headed. And Barb will talk about guidance. Yeah. Hey, Brad, it's Angela here. With the SVB failure that occurred recently, we did not see any impact to our portfolio. And so, looking forward, obviously, we don't know what can happen. But we do know that the parent has filed for bankruptcy. But its subsidiary, which SVB has -- the Fed stepped in and then it's been sold. And so we certainly don't expect further disruption from that. And just looking at some anecdotal information, looking at the 30-plus companies in our real estate technology ventures, there's no impact there either. So, as it relates to kind of a broad banking sector, it could -- it may play into more a broad economy conversation. And for those -- that's one of those reasons that we are forecasting a mild recession in our current expectations. Yes. It's Angela here. The severance packages can range up to three months. Having said that, given the bulk of the layoff announcements that occurred back in January and tenants behavior, they tend to make decisions, say, 45 days to 60 days in advance for major events. We -- what our expectation is that we've seen that play through our portfolio. We've digested it already. And once again, I kind of want to point to the job growth numbers as a good indicator. But the other good indicator is the initial unemployment claims in California and Washington. And today, they still remain below the 15-year average. So that's another good data point there. Hey, Alex, it's Angela here. It's a good question. I'm trying to figure out looking ahead, what's happening here. In terms of our portfolio, just big picture starting this year compared to last year, overall supply is slightly down. But the vast majority, as you pointed out, is Northern California is down over 20%. And Southern California is up slightly about 14%, and the bulk of it is in the Downtown LA and then some of these other West LA, certain other markets. But overall, of course, that supply number is quite muted. As we look forward to 2022 -- 2024, what we're seeing preliminarily [indiscernible] landscape. And so not a huge drop-off, but similar level. But keep in mind, we're already operating at a pretty darn down low level, right? I mean total supply as a percent of total stock is only 60 basis points. And so, we do foresee that to continue especially given the environment of much more challenging labor force available and higher construction costs. And lastly, rents in the northern region haven't moved significantly past pre-COVID. So, Northern California is still slightly below pre-COVID level. And so, it didn't surprise us that Southern California supply picked up slightly this year. And I think you kind of see that throughout the country where you have significant rent growth that's where supply will occur. So that's the big picture of our overall this year and next year, similar levels and it's going [indiscernible] in our markets. Seattle overall is slightly down, but Downtown is up. So, yes. Yeah, hi. It's Angela here. On the diversification question or expanding outside of West Coast, it is something that we have been disciplined about evaluating. And so that -- just that basic discipline has not changed. We're going to continue to monitor those markets and look for opportunities. But back to your original point, I think you hit the nail on the head, especially as it relates to Northern California, a couple of things going for our markets where we have the lowest supply deliveries and especially Northern California supply is down 22%. We're just starting to rebound in terms of job growth, getting jobs -- numbers getting back to pre-COVID levels and market rents still below with gradual improvements. We're in the best affordability position from a rent-to-income perspective in the northern region, below long-term average. And so that would point to all the best growth prospects. On the just broad picture on the migration front, and we all experienced meaningful net migration during COVID, while the migration landscape has been improving gradually as well. And so, you put together all those pieces [indiscernible] point to that where we want to deploy our dollar, where we see the most upside ahead of us, it's in the West Coast. We actually see the international part to be a tailwind for us, because it's just starting. And so I think it's no surprise that historically, California has a net out-migration if you only look at domestic numbers. In fact, 17 out of the last 20 years, it's net out-migration domestically. And even during those periods, we had meaningful rent growth acceleration. So the international component is what drives migration to become positive for California. And that virtually disappeared. I mean it was zero during COVID. And so that is just starting to come back. And so we are hopeful that will be additive to the demographics piece. Yes, that's a good question. Compared to the migration from outside of Essex markets, we are generally -- just domestically speaking, of course, we're generally back to pre-COVID levels. And so that's a good thing. And with -- of course, with the international, we do see that's where the tailwind is. As far as the out-migration piece, when we look at the migration numbers, we look at it on a net basis. And so we're continuing to see gradual improvements. Yes. We really haven't. I mean, we've track, of course, the usual move-outs to purchase a home that's below the long-term average, move out for jobs, new jobs or transfers or loss on that one bucket. And in totality, it's generally in line with historical norms. And so what I think is happening is what we're seeing, which is that the job losses are being quickly absorbed and benefited by that gradual in-migration on a net basis. Hey, Chandni, it's Angela here. We actually have been reducing our usage of RealPage as we develop our new revenue management system over the past several years. And so, we started as well before the RealPage lawsuit for the reasons that Jessica mentioned earlier. So, we believe that their claim is without any merit, and we're very confident about our defense prospects. It's Angela here. I'll start, and Jessica, welcome to add. In terms of the upside or the most revenue growth, we definitely see Northern California being in the top of that list followed by Seattle and then Southern California. And both for -- with Northern California because of, as I said earlier, the job growth is just getting back to pre-COVID levels, market rents are still below pre-COVID, but it has been gradually improving. It has the lowest level of supply deliveries relative to our other portfolio and the best affordability position. And so that -- for those reasons, it's ranked number one. And Seattle for similar reasons, but it does have a higher supply, and then it's more volatile or more seasonal. And so -- which means that -- so with Southern California coming in last, not because we don't like it, it's just because it's just done so well. I mean it's 15%, in some cases, 20%, 30% rent growth above pre-COVID. And we're starting to see some supply pressure, which -- it's still in check relative to the rest -- the U.S., but relative to our markets, it's starting to creep up. And so that's the order of the ranking. Jessica? Okay. Good. Glad you agree. Yes. In our markets, well, in the northern regions is, of course, more tech centric. But in the Southern California, it's more service driven, leisure and hospitality. It's much more diversified and mirrors that of the U.S. broad economy with more professional services and, of course, higher income levels. It's more diversified."

            "content": "Thanks, Angela. I'll begin with a few comments on our first quarter results and full year guidance, followed by an update on investment activity and the balance sheet. I'm pleased to report our first quarter core FFO per share grew 8.3% on a year-over-year, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.08. The better-than-expected results are largely attributable to two factors that drove an outperformance in same property revenue growth: first, occupancy trended higher than we expected for the quarter; and second, net delinquencies were better than forecasted as we received $1.3 million in emergency rental assistance. As you may recall, we did not assume any rental assistance funds in our 2023 forecast. Overall gross delinquency was 2.5% of scheduled rents for the quarter, in line with our expectations. Given the favorable first quarter results, we are currently running 30 basis points ahead of our full year midpoint for same property revenue growth. However, given the macroeconomic uncertainty and the timing of recapturing delinquent units, which remains uncertain, we are holding off on changing our same property guidance range until we get further into the peak leasing season. As for core FFO, we are raising our full year midpoint by $0.03 per share, primarily related to accretion from stock repurchases completed in the first quarter and higher other income. Turning to our stock repurchases and investments. During the quarter, we sold a 61-year-old student housing community located in a non-core market. The proceeds were used to buy back the stock on a leverage neutral basis in order to arbitrage a significant disconnect between public and private market pricing. This is another example of how Essex seeks to create value in all environments while at the same time improving our portfolio. As it relates to our preferred equity book, we had little activity to report this quarter. However, for the full year, we still expect about $100 million of early redemption. Our sponsors are able to take advantage of the available financing via Fannie Mae and HUD to redeem us thoroughly. We believe the additional source of financing is one of the many benefits to being in the multifamily sector, which has, over time, helped keep cap rates low. Overall, we remain comfortable with our preferred equity portfolio, especially given how diversified it is both geographically on the West Coast in terms of -- and in terms of the average deal size. Finally, onto the balance sheet. We plan to pay off our upcoming 2023 unsecured bonds that mature May 1 with the proceeds from the $300 million delayed draw term loan, which closed last year. As such, we have no funding needs over the next 12 months. With $1.5 billion in liquidity, limited variable rate debt exposure, and access to a variety of capital sources, our balance sheet remains in a strong position. I will now turn the call to Jessica Anderson. Hi, Nick. Yeah, I would say on the guidance piece, delinquency, obviously, is something that's still a little bit uncertain to predict in terms of getting units back. As Jessica mentioned, LA, Alameda, just are coming out of their eviction moratoriums. And so, the timing on when we're going to get those units back is uncertain. And so that's a factor. And we also want to get a little further into the peak leasing season given the uncertainty that Angela just mentioned. And then, we'll do a full reforecast for the second quarter. But the first quarter was very strong for us, and we feel we feel pretty good going into second quarter. Hi. This is Barb. We're going to match fund, asset sales with stock repurchases, so we know what we're locking in in terms of value. We do have an internal NAV and we know where the value of our assets are. And so, we're going to be cognizant of it. We're going to be mindful of the balance sheet, liquidity, and maintain our strong balance sheet structure. And so, it's not we're just going to do it to do. We want to make sure that we're thoughtful about doing it. And what we did in the first quarter is we sold an asset that's non-core. It actually doesn't fit with our new operating model. We got a very attractive price for it. And then, we're able to take it and redeploy them buy back the stock and create a lot of value that way. So, we're going to be very thoughtful going forward. Yeah. Our NAV is based off of -- Adam and I sit down and we talk about where transactions are happening and where we think we could sell our assets today, and based off of what is happening and negotiations that are going on behind the scenes. And so, we feel like we have a good pulse on the market. We have sold assets over the last several years and proven out the value for the portfolio. And so that is the process on the NAV side. And we're very comfortable transacting and selling and then buying back the stock. Yeah. This is Barb. On the Emergency Rental Assistance payments, in April, we had a $100,000 in our same store portfolio, so nothing material. And that is disclosed in our supplemental. And then in terms of factors in the April guidance, the one thing I would say is that for delinquency, we did assume the first half of the year would be in the mid 2% range, 2.5%. And then the back half, we expect continues to trend down to close to 1.5% and 2% for the full year. So we're on plan with delinquency in April, and then occupancy at 96.4% is generally in line with plan as well. Yes, this is Barb again. So on the expense side, I think the biggest variability we're seeing is really maintenance and repairs, because we have more turnover, we had some more flood damage this quarter. So that's kind of one time we don't expect that to reoccur, but we do expect the turnover to be a reoccurring item given evictions. I would say, on the insurance, we've already done our insurance renewal for the year. So that line is pretty baked and we don't expect any surprises from here on out. It is up 20%, but that's going to be the number for the year. And then, on the tax side, we do have the benefit of Prop 13, and so -- which is 80% of our tax base. And so that is pretty well known. We'll know Seattle taxes here in the second quarter and then really have that drilled in. And so for us, the variability on expenses is mostly just tied to R&M. And then utilities, the one thing on utilities is it can be variable. We did -- we've put in place some gas hedges, which has helped us on the utility expense side. And so, it's kept at to a more moderate level, all else being equal. Yeah. As far as Orange County goes, it is -- it has performed well. For the last couple of years, we were seeing good trade out numbers, good leasing velocity. It's really stable as far as the supply outlook. There's nothing noteworthy there as well. So, overall, Orange County is pretty stable as a lot of our Southern California markets, San Diego is similar as well. John. So, on the tax line, it really deals with the comp issue from the first quarter of last year. So, in Seattle, if you recall, we did have a favorable surprise last year where our real estate taxes went down 4%. We didn't know that until the second quarter. The first quarter of last year was our budget and what we assumed taxes would be. And so it was way too high. so we're comping off of a really easy comp, and that's why you see the negative 1.6 on the tax line. We -- like I said a few minutes ago, we'll know where Seattle taxes come in, in the second quarter when we pay the bills. And so, that's still TBD. We're still assuming 4.25% overall for the tax line for this year. It's really just a comp issue in the first quarter. Yes. So, the vast majority of the beat in the first quarter was really tied to same-store revenue growth, and we didn't change our revenue outlook. And so that is not carried forward through in the guidance. So that was $0.07 of the $0.08 beat. The reason we changed our guidance was the stock repurchase, which will carry forward, that's $0.03. And then, we also have higher other income, mostly tied to better rates on our cash management platform and how we're managing our cash and our marketable securities. And then, it's partially offset by lower co-investment tied to preferred equity redemptions and the timing of those redemptions. So that's what was updated in the guidance. Same-store will be revisited here in the second quarter. Hi, Alex, it's Barb. What I was speaking to is that there is still capital available in the multifamily space. I know in other sectors, it's just definitely pulled back, and I definitely think the banks have pulled back. But the government financing is still available. Life insurance companies are stepping in. And I think you're seeing other lenders step in. And in our preferred book, keep in mind the deals that we're getting taken out of, they were underwritten 2019, 2020, a long time ago when cap rates were in the mid 3.5%, and so we can get fully taken out. And so I think they're good situation for us. And we haven't seen any real issues within our own portfolio. It doesn't mean that it's not happening elsewhere. But in terms of distress in the whole market, we haven't seen that in a significant way on the West Coast. Hi, Chandni, it's Barb. So in the first quarter, gross delinquencies were 2.5% versus the reported number of 2.1%, so 40 basis point improvement tied to Emergency Rental Assistance. And then for the outlook for the year, the 2%, we're still holding to it. I think LA and Alameda just come off. It's really going to depend on how quickly the court move on these evictions. It's taking six-plus months right now. And so that really is going to depend how quickly either people go through the whole eviction process or whether they just skip. And that's a little unknown at this point. I think in the next few months, we'll have a better visibility on that. Yes, John, it's a great question, something we talk about internally a lot. We historically have been at 35 basis points pre-COVID. We believe we will ultimately get back there because there won't be any loss to protect tenants like there was during COVID, which allow tenants to have this behavior. And so now that we're coming out of all of the moratoriums, I think the City of Oakland is the only one that really remains, we think we will get back there. But it's going to take until into 2024 to get there. And it won't be -- for the full year of 2024, it's going to take into that year because of the eviction process and how long it's taking. But structurally, we don't believe that there will be a fundamental shift in delinquency and our long-term trends will go up because of COVID. I don't think we -- no, I don't think we've gone back fully to pre-COVID levels in our other markets. As Jessica said, in the call or in our prepared comments that we've gotten over 60% of our long-term delinquent residents out over the past or since the start of 2022. So, we're making good progress, but we're not fully back to where we should be at this point. This is Barb. It was primarily related to a legal settlement for construction defect at one of our properties, and there's no carry-forward on that. That was just a one-time item that occurred in the first quarter. It was paid in cash. So that's done."

            "name": "Jessica Anderson",
            "content": "Thanks, Barb. I'll begin my comments today by providing color on our recent operating results and strategy, followed by regional commentary. I was pleased with our operating results from the first quarter, including a same property revenue increase of 7.6% year-over-year. As Barb mentioned, one core factor driving these results was the successful execution of our occupancy strategy that resulted in a solid 96.7% for the first quarter, up 70 basis points from the fourth quarter. This focus began in Q4 and was done proactively in anticipation of elevated turnover from eviction. During the first quarter, we made progress recapturing units from non-paying tenants and we experienced the highest volume of eviction related move-outs to-date. The number of long-term delinquent residents has declined by 65% from our peak over a year ago, excluding Los Angeles and Alameda County. Additionally, a notable milestone in the first quarter was the ending of the eviction moratoriums in the city and county of Los Angeles, where approximately half of our delinquency resides. Given backloged eviction courts, it will take many months to recapture these units, but steady progress throughout 2023 is expected. I am very proud of the team and appreciate the tremendous amount of work that has gone into recapturing, turning, and re-leasing units. Thank you, team, great job. Throughout the first quarter, we saw positive demand indicators for the portfolio, lead volume, which reflects the number of initial inquiries into leasing an apartment and as a leading indicator of demand, was consistent with and up in some cases over same quarter last year. Additionally, concession usage has declined from approximately two-weeks free in the fourth quarter to a half-a-week free in the first quarter. We are experiencing a relatively normal ramp up to the peak leasing season. Net effective blended rates accelerated through Q1, averaging 2.9% for the quarter and ended with March at 3.8%, although they moderated in April. This was due to a temporary increase in leasing incentives to offset a period of heavy eviction volume. While April averaged 96.4% occupied, we are at 96.9% today and well positioned to absorb additional turnover while still increasing rents as demand allows. Moving on to regional specific commentary. In the Pacific Northwest, our most seasonal market, blended net effective rents were up 30 basis points in the first quarter compared to one year ago. The elevated supply in the downtown submarket is weighing on our regional performance. The supply outlook for Seattle is comparable to 2022 and similarly a more challenging second half of the year is expected. In Northern California, blended net effective rents improved to 2.6% in the first quarter year-over-year. We're seeing strength in the San Jose submarket, offset by supply driven weakness in Oakland. The supply outlook for Northern California remains relatively muted, which will benefit our ability to push rents, presuming job growth continues to outpace the recently announced layoffs. Finally, in Southern California, blended net effective rents were up 5% in the first quarter as demand remained solid. All regions have fared well to start the year, including Los Angeles. As I mentioned earlier, we're expecting elevated turnover in this region driven by eviction. In general, supply outlook in Southern California is very manageable and outside of pockets of supply in submarkets such as West LA, this market is expected to fare well. In summary, 2023 has started off slightly better than expected. Demand for apartments has been solid. We continue to make progress with evictions and our occupancy-focused strategy positions us well. We are cautiously optimistic as we head into the peak leasing season, but also acknowledge the macroeconomic uncertainty that could influence apartment demand through the balance of this year. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions. Hi, Steve. Yeah. The -- overall those numbers -- those blended numbers that we're looking at, those are net effective trade out numbers. And so, I think it's important to point out, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that through March, so they grew sequentially throughout the quarter. So April really reflected a point in time pricing strategy rather than underlying market fundamentals. And we've expected with the evictions, we're working through quite a few. And they do come to us in a steady stream, but we do anticipate that there might be some concentrations from time to time. And so that's what's really driven our occupancy-focused strategy. And you really saw that play out with our April occupancy number. We had floated down after seeing a concentration in March to 96.4%. But ultimately when we start -- when we think about as far as the market and how they're progressing through the seasonal ramp up and the strength there, we really look at our market rent, which is essentially the -- our gross recently achieved leases. And since the beginning of the year, we have seen our market rates grow sequentially through April in all of our markets. And so, those net effective trade outs and of course incorporate concessions and again really reflects a point in time. So, we saw really great activity in April and we were roughly one-week free as far as concessions go. And we've since pulled back to only a couple of days today on average. And breakdown by market, we're actually sitting at 97% in Seattle, 97% in Northern California and then 96.8% today. So, ultimately, we're pulling back on the concessions. There might be a little bit of a spillover into May, and we expect the trade out rates to reaccelerate from here and then also market rents to continue to grow. I think, yes, overall for Seattle -- and we have a pretty conservative outlook for Seattle this year. And as I mentioned that I think it will be more challenging in the back half as we experience more supply. And we've been experiencing that really for the last six months. But interestingly, yes, in April, we did see quite a bit of movement from a leasing velocity perspective. So I do feel like that May 1st return to -- mandatory return to office three days a week for Amazon potentially had an impact for us. And as far as strength goes, I mean anytime you introduce leasing incentives or adjust your rates, how the market responds and the leasing velocity you're able to get is really telling. And so we weren't necessarily getting 97% in Seattle. So that really goes just to show that there is some underlying strength there. And so I think Amazon did play out. But again, we have a pretty conservative outlook and we're certainly seeing the impacts of demand with the diminishing of the hiring with Amazon and Microsoft. Last year having July, August 30,000 open positions that essentially disappeared in a matter of a month or two. And then, obviously, we have the supply factors. We have both things working [against us] (ph). But, we're encouraged and I think Seattle is on track with our expectations for the year. Hey, Adam, this is Jessica. Yes, so we're progressing through the peak leasing season. And of course, we're always going to be opportunistic with a focus on maximizing revenue. I think overall, with our outlook for the year, I think we'll probably spends the bulk of the year focused on occupancy based on -- we know we're going to continue to have to work through evictions. But also rent growth is moderating. And when you think about as far as rate growth, any time you're turning an apartment, you're experiencing the turn costs and the cost of vacancy. And so you really have to be getting some really strong trade out numbers to make it make sense to be focused on rate over occupancy. But certainly, we'll monitor the markets closely. And just like we pulled back concessions at the end of April and leaving us well positioned for the peak growth period that typically occurs in Q2, we certainly have opportunities again to maximize revenue overall. No, nothing to add. Hi. This is Jessica. Yes, things are going very well. We're very pleased with the platform thus far, and we have a long development pipeline for that revenue management system. So, all is going well. I mean a couple of benefits to point out that we're looking at is in alignment and allows us to price at a portfolio level with our property collections model versus the commercially available systems you're often pricing at the property level. And then second, we also see, as far as long-term development, the ability to optimize our amenities. So when you look at like our average rent, it's $2,600 and good $200 of that is actually fixed amenity values. And again, with your commercially available systems, that portion of the rent is not optimized. And so if you look at that on an annual basis, what that is for us is over $100 million that's not optimized. So that's one opportunity we also see moving forward with the system. So there's a few value-add opportunities to give you a couple of examples. Well, when you're looking at, we have a high geographic concentration. And so when you're pricing properties individually, sometimes you can be kind of cannibalizing yourself based on the occupancy position at a property. And so, when you're looking at an entire portfolio collectively one-bedrooms, two-bedrooms, ultimately, you can maximize revenue through a more stable approach to rents and the balance with occupancy."

            "content": "Hey, Austin. This is Adam. Apologies. So at the moment, we are not actively marketing anything. We're always opportunistically looking at potential for disposing of assets that are either non-core or in non-core markets. And this is how [indiscernible] deal we sold last quarter, that's how that came about. But currently no, not marketing anything right now. Hi, John. This is Adam. So over the last couple of months, we've seen, I would say, a slight uptick in possible opportunities come in the mezz and pref world. As you said, some of the lending sources out there have either tightened or disappeared entirely. It remains to be seen if this new wave that we're seeing will actually translate into deals. There are legacy development deals that have been out there a while. There are some new, actually existing deals that we're seeing as well. But again, this process takes a long time and several months. And so, we're assessing a number of new opportunities, but very too early to tell how many of them translate into actual deals. But we'll always -- we'll continue to look at potential options when we have liquidity, whether that's through dispositions or redemptions, what the best use of that capital is. So, on the first -- hi, Anthony, this is Adam. The first part of your question, do we have a list of non-core assets, the answer is yes. And we're constantly having discussions and going through those to see where they could potentially sell and what we could do with the proceeds. As to the amount with which we can buy stock back, there are challenges always with dispositions. There's always the different ramifications of tax gains, Prop 13. So all of those are taken into account when we assess what we can do with those proceeds. There's also another tool in the shed is to use 1031 exchanges to exchange out of non-core assets into markets that we think will overall affect the portfolio in a positive way. Hi, Wes. This is Adam. It's -- the development landscape today is challenging for a number of reasons. Angela has pointed to a few of them. With a challenging labor market, construction costs have remained elevated. And so when solving for a, call it, 20% premium over where market cap rates are, it just -- it basically will lead to a lower land price than landowners are willing to go. So, sure, we would love to be delivering into a lesser supply market, but right now, it's just the development deals just don't cancel. We do, yes. And those are still generating active revenue. And now with some, we're pursuing entitlements in the meantime, so parallel processing and others have just longer-term lease commitments."

        "content": "Angela Kleiman: Good morning. Thank you for joining Essex third quarter earnings call. Barb Pak will follow with prepared remarks and Rylan Burns is here for Q&A. We are pleased to report our third guidance raise this year as a result of another healthy quarter with core FFO per share exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range. Today, my comments will focus on our performance year-to-date, preliminary considerations for 2025 and an update on the investment market. Starting with highlights to-date, notable milestones this year include record low turnover, excellent progress resolving delinquency and positive inflection points in several key demand drivers. These factors combined with muted level of new housing supply have enabled Essex to deliver results exceeding the high end of our original 2024 expectations. Year-to-date, we've achieved solid results with market rents generally trending consistent with historical patterns as shown in the chart on Page S-13.2. In the third quarter, rents peaked in July and remained resilient through August before moderating in September. As we expected, the blended rate growth of 2.5% for the quarter was tempered by the combination of seasonal moderation in rents, which started in September and difficult year-over-year comparison. Especially since last year, our rents did not moderate until late October. As we enter the fourth quarter, our market remain stable. We shifted our operating strategy to focus on occupancy as we've done in prior years in anticipation of slower demand characteristic of normal seasonality. Moving to regional highlights. Seattle has been our top performer this year, delivering a strong 3.8% blended rate growth in the third quarter. The East side, where we have approximately 70% of our portfolio, was our strongest markets with 4.7% blended growth. For the rest of the year, we anticipate a heavier supply delivery and thus more concessions usage in this region. Northern California has performed well, achieving 2.3% blended rate growth in the third quarter, led by Santa Clara County with 3.6%. The overall supply for this region remains very low but we anticipate most of the deliveries for San Jose this year to occur in the fourth quarter. Therefore, we plan for higher concessions to address this short term impact. On to Southern California, which achieved 2.1% blended lease rate growth in the third quarter. Lease rates in this region were tempered by headwinds related to delinquency recovery in Los Angeles. Excluding LA, this region produced 3.5% blended rate growth for the third quarter. While the exact timing is difficult to pinpoint, we are cautiously optimistic that new lease rates will begin to recover next year in LA as volume of delinquent units continue to subside. Heading into year end, we are well positioned at 96.1% financial occupancy for October with year-over-year comps easing in November and December. Turning to our expectations for 2025. We've provided high level revenue drivers on Page S-16.2 of the supplemental. We expect our earnings for next year to surpass what was achieved in 2024, ranging from 80 to 100 basis points. Additionally, we anticipate a 40 to 60 basis points tailwind from delinquency improvements. Combined, these two components should generate approximately 120 to 160 basis points of same property revenue growth in 2025. As for market rent growth, supply and demand will ultimately be the key building blocks. The fundamental backdrop remains stable and continues to gradually improve. On the supply side, detailed on Page S-16 of the supplemental, we expect total supply growth of only 50 basis points in 2025. This is consistent with the low level of supply in 2024 and well below our long term average of 1% for our markets. On the demand side, we've seen positive inflection points and several major demand drivers this year. Job postings at the top 20 technology companies have been steadily recovering, demonstrating a sentiment shift from retrenchment in 2023 to positioning for future growth. Additionally, these same companies continue to increase their return to office requirements, which has resulted in increased demand to San Jose and Seattle regions. Related to this is migration back to our markets, which has steadily improved and is rebalancing toward historical patterns. Given the low supply environment in the Essex markets, we are well positioned to achieve new lease rate growth with incremental demand. Lastly, on the transaction market, strong investor interest for multifamily properties on the West Coast has resulted in cap rates trading consistently in the mid 4% range with numerous transaction in the low 4%. Within this competitive landscape, our investment team has done a terrific job originating several opportunities at better than market yields, acquiring over 1,700 units to date, totaling over $700 million at our pro rata share. We continue to execute transactions with attractive returns relative to our cost of capital and we are confident in our ability to generate opportunities to drive NAV and FFO per share accretion for our shareholders. Finally, I'll conclude with a brief comment on California Proposition 33. It is no surprise to anyone that excessive regulation dramatically restrict housing production in California, leading to high cost of housing. As such, we have joined Governor Newsom in endorsing a no vote on Proposition 33. We all know that building more housing is the only solution to the state's housing shortage. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barb.\nBarb Pak: Thanks, Angela. I'll begin by briefly discussing our third quarter results, followed by comments on the remainder of 2024 and conclude with investments and the balance sheet. I'm pleased to report third quarter core FFO per share of $3.91, a $0.04 beat to the midpoint of our guidance range. The outperformance was primarily driven by higher same property revenues. For the full year, we are raising the midpoint of core FFO for a third consecutive quarter by $0.06 to $15.56 per share, which represents 3.5% year-over-year growth. A key contributor to the full year increase relates to same property revenue growth, which has outperformed our expectations. As such, we are raising our midpoint by 25 basis points to 3.25% growth for the year. The increase is driven by lower delinquency and higher other income. With no change to our expense outlook, we expect same property NOI growth of 2.6%, a 30 basis points increase at the midpoint. Turning to investments. Year-to-date, we've acquired approximately $700 million in multifamily properties at pro rata share, which has been funded on a leverage neutral basis with $200 million of dispositions, $450 million of proceeds from structured finance redemptions and free cash flow and $25 million in OP units. As it relates to our structured finance book, we have received $106 million in cash redemptions through October and anticipate an additional $40 million for the balance of the year. We've reinvested these funds into new acquisitions, which offer the most attractive risk adjusted return today given the growth potential in our markets. While this strategic reallocation results in short term FFO dilution, growing the company via apartment acquisitions improves the quality of our cash flow and the long term growth profile of our portfolio. This in turn drives better NAV and core FFO growth for our shareholders. Looking to 2025, we expect between $100 million to $150 million of redemptions with up to 50% expected by the end of the first quarter. Barring a change in the investment landscape, we are most likely to redeploy these proceeds into acquisitions, resulting in a continued reduction of the structured finance book and better alignment with our target range for this business at 3% to 5% of core FFO. Finally, a few comments on the balance sheet. Over the last several years, we have opportunistically refinanced our debt maturities early when we see an attractive issuance window. We continued that trend this quarter as we issued $200 million in 10 year unsecured bonds and an effective rate of 5.1%. With a manageable debt maturity schedule next year, we have ample flexibility to be opportunistic. Overall, our balance sheet remains in a strong position with low leverage as defined by net debt to EBITDA at 5.5 times. In addition, with over $1 billion in liquidity and ample sources of available capital, the company is well positioned. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Nick Yulico from Scotiabank.\nDaniel Tricarico: This is Daniel Tricarico on with Nick. I wanted to ask a question on bad debt, with the 50 basis points of improvement in 2025. What gives you the confidence LA Alameda County will normalize like your other markets? And just to confirm your comment, Angela, from your prepared remarks, this assumption would imply maybe broader supply/demand fundamentals should improve in those markets as well.\nAngela Kleiman: With respect to LA Alameda, a couple of things are happening on the ground that gives us also some confidence that things are improving. So for example, delinquency in terms of just the volume, let's start there, it has really improved. In fact, at year end, last year in December, our delinquency as a percentage of rent for LA was almost 5%. Today, it's 1.6%. So that is significant progress. And we've seen a direct correlation with the courts continue to move through the eviction and that's been a key to continuing that trend. But as far as just general economic viability for LA, a couple of things that actually has given us a positive sign. So for example, we have, of course, the World Cup coming in the Olympics. And so what we are anticipating is that there will be benefits from economic investments, both domestically and internationally to this region. But further, just this week, Governor Newsom proposed to double California's film and television tax credit program from current $330 million to about $750 million. So these are all great signs that we're seeing that gives us that level of optimism, if you will.\nDaniel Tricarico: As a follow-up, you mentioned signs of -- I think you mentioned signs of improving tech job backdrop, not something you necessarily heard from office landlords. So maybe you could expand a bit more where and what you're seeing specifically related to that?\nAngela Kleiman: So we track the openings of the top 20 tech companies. And that is -- it's just the closest thing to apples-to-apples that we can see and they're really the drivers of the overall health of the technology sector. And so we follow that and we use a third party independent report. And we have seen that for the first time in almost two years the job openings have reached pre-COVID averages. And it's a good start, because openings is an indication that these companies will be positioning to hire in the future. The one thing that I'll ask that you keep in mind is that this is a lumpy trend and it's not an immediate impact. But obviously, things are going in the right direction here.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Eric Wolfe from Citi.\nNick Joseph: It's Nick Joseph here with Eric. Appreciate the '25 building blocks. I guess my question is just around pricing strategy going forward. I mean, you've laid out kind of the improving bad debt situation, particularly in Southern California, continued low supply. So half percentage point next year. How are you thinking about the ability to actually push on the new lease side and how are renewals going out over the next 30 and 60 days?\nAngela Kleiman: In terms of our operating strategy, we have shifted to an occupancy strategy in the fourth quarter and that is typical to address the seasonal slow demand that's characteristic of our business, that's not anything unusual. What we are expecting is the deceleration that we have seen in September and October, which we, of course, have factored into our guidance to the headwinds that caused those to start to abate. And so for example, in October last year, just to give you one data point, our concessions was only half a week and this year, it's about a week. Well, that doesn't seem like a big number, half a week is -- represents 1% of rent. So you can see the year-over-year impact on the financials. But as far as the renewal is concerned, we're sending renewals out in the mid-4s. So a strong number consistent with our plan. And early indication is that we're landing around the high 3s, once again, also well within the range. Typically, the negotiations range from zero to 100 basis points, and this is kind of in the middle of that. So these are all good indications for the rest of the year and our ability for pricing power in next year to come.\nNick Joseph: And then just on, I guess, the potential repeal of cost on to understand all the arguments on the policy side. But if it were to pass, right, so if the repeal occurred, how do you think about what could happen kind of over the following few months? And what is your exposure to municipalities that have some form of rent control currently?\nAngela Kleiman: We kind of battle internally on how to think about this risk. Let me just start with a couple of data points that I think may be useful in an assumption like this, because it is a very difficult hypothetical question to answer. And the reason that's the case is because right now every city in California can enact rent control on buildings that are on 1995, we have about 483 cities in California. And believe it or not, only about 8% of these cities have been active rent control and with a lot of these cities where the rent control is actually quite moderate. And so as far as Prop 33 is concerned, 23 mayors have actually came out and announced that they were against Proposition 33. And some of these mayors are the same ones that out have in that the rent control like San Jose, for example, and Santa Ana. So for us to try to interpolate something that is so unlikely -- it's just it's too difficult to predict. But more importantly, on the campaign itself, what we're seeing is that this is following the same pattern as the 2018 and the 2020 pattern and both times, they were defeated by a landslide. And so I understand that there's an overhang in our stock just because it isn't unknown. But what we're seeing is that the public and the legislators they understand the impact of something this onerous. And in fact, this is evidenced by the most expensive cities in California are the ones with the most onerous rent control like San Francisco and Santa Monica and the ones with the highest brands. So the net-net is that the campaign continues to gain momentum and we are confident this will be defeated.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho Securities.\nHaendel St. Juste: So a couple of questions from me. I think in your prepared remarks, Angela, you mentioned that rents last year did not moderate until October. So you had tough comps this year in September and October, but it looks like the comps are getting easier ahead. So I guess I'm curious what you're sending out for renewals here today and any color on October new lease rates? But more broadly, is there a scenario where we can see a reacceleration in blends on these easy comps? Just curious what's kind of embedded in your near term outlook here.\nAngela Kleiman: So we are sending new renewals out in the mid-4s. And so far, the early indication and those who have signed leases are lending in the high 3s, so say 3.9%, 3.8% on average. So these are definitely good trends and positive indication. As far as the possibility of a reacceleration, it's certainly possible just because, as I mentioned, rents continue to increase through October last year. So that's one factor, renewals remain strong. And if nothing else, we just don't have the same headwind in November, December this year as we did last year. And so that is a possibility.\nHaendel St. Juste: And then you also mentioned again this quarter seeing positive immigration, more employees enforcing return office mandates and now tech job growth for the first time in years being back to pre-COVID levels. So I guess I'm curious if you're seeing any of that translate into better demand applications, things which could forebode kind of more demand or pricing power rent growth into early into next year?\nAngela Kleiman: A couple of things on the immigration front. We are seeing that this year has benefited our numbers and especially if you look at the job growth environment, it's generally not robust for the US and the West Coast. It's stable and it's moving along. And so for us to be able to outperform, it's demand coming from elsewhere relative to our original forecast. And so in terms of predicting how that is going to impact next year, it's too early to tell really for two reasons. One is that we do believe most of the return to office benefit were captured this year. And I'll give you a point -- one data point, which is our immigration. Our immigration as a percentage of our total leases, it's not yet to pre-COVID level but it's pretty darn close. So that's one good indication. So maybe you can say we've captured 70%, 75% of the return to office. So there's some left for next year but it's not going to be as robust as this year. But what will really drive demand for housing next year is going to be all about job growth. Fortunately, for us, with low demand, our base case is very low risk. Having said that, we'll need better indication on a macro level where the consensus job forecast is going to land and what that will mean for the West Coast, because we are still all somewhat interrelated to the entire economy.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI.\nSteve Sakwa: Could you provide a little bit of color on the cap rate pricing on the sort of different acquisitions that you did as well as the dispositions?\nRylan Burns: We were pleased to buy out two of our joint venture partners in the third quarter and these were long running negotiations. In both cases, we had debt maturing, which necessitated conversation. And we believe we were able to buy those at very attractive basis, probably 20% to 25% discounts to replacement cost today at yields in the high 4s. So we think better than market pricing. In one instance, we were able to also negotiate an OP unit transaction at a 305 strike price, which was, when we negotiated, it was -- stock was around 270. So that was a necessary requirement for us to make that deal [pencil] an accretive basis. Subsequent to quarter end, the portfolio transaction that was noted in the release, this is similar to the portfolio that we did earlier in the year where market cap rates are in the low 5s, given this is a slightly older portfolio but one that we've owned for many, many years. We've invested in we know very well. And with our basis as we were already majority owners is going to cap rate to Essex -- closer to a 6. The disposition subsequent to quarter end in San Mateo, this was a 76 year old asset and approximately a 5 cap to Essex inclusive of capital. And the thinking there is that we are seeing better risk adjusted opportunities elsewhere and we're able to redeploy that capital into higher returning investments.\nSteve Sakwa: And I realize development maybe still a bit of a dirty word. But how are you guys thinking about future developments and where would developments perhaps pencil today on current costs and in-place rents? I'm trying to just figure out how far away you think you might be from being able to start some new projects?\nRylan Burns: It's something we've been really focused on here over the past year. So as you know, we haven't started a new development for almost five years. The risk adjusted returns just really didn't make sense. What we've seen more recently is that I think others are recognizing the challenging return environment and we've seen capital pullback. So permits are starting to come down, hard costs are starting to come down. So if you can secure land at an attractive basis and design an efficient building, I'd say we're getting closer. So we have a history of being a counter-cyclical developer. And I think with others pulling back, we are sharpening our pencils. And we'll have more to come here in the next several quarters.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Two questions. First, Angela, you mentioned some comments around supply on the east side of Seattle and I think you also mentioned maybe with San Jose. But just big picture collectively, can you just sort of outline the supply picture that you're looking at? How much of the portfolio you think it impacts? And if it's just sort of in the next six months or if you think it's something that extends longer and impacts more of '25?\nAngela Kleiman: On the supply landscape, we do see that the San Jose impact should only really be more concentrated in the fourth quarter, maybe a little bit leads over in the first quarter, because it all really depends on how the delivery occurs. So for example, if they all come at once or if they going to go pro rata over the next several months, it'll have a different impact. But having said that, San Jose as far as -- or the total stock is still very low. We're talking about, for the full year, 2,400 units that's supposed to be delivered. Unfortunately, about 1,100 of those happened in the fourth quarter but it's still very low and this is why we expect that absorption to occur quickly. And well, yes, there will be some concessions involved. It's not going to be as challenging as what we've seen, for example, in Downtown LA or Oakland. It's a very different beast. And it should -- we should get past it within, say, three months or four months or something along those lines. Seattle is a little bit more in terms of the supply overall. I mean, generally, it has been a higher supply delivery market with stay a little bit above 1% of total supply. And so having a shift from the east side, we believe that impact will start in the fourth quarter and probably continue in the first quarter. What has helped Seattle in the past and what we continue to see the benefit is that Seattle has also generated the highest level of demand in the market. So with a higher level of job growth, we expect that the demand or the supply will be absorbed timely. And so while there will be a temporary concession environment, it shouldn't be prolonged because that's how it's been every year with Seattle.\nAlexander Goldfarb: And then, Barb, a question for you on the recycling. As you guys whittle down the preferred and debt book and recycle into assets, sort of in aggregate, especially as we think about '25. Is there some sort of pennies or some sort of way that we can think about the dilution impact, is it $0.05, $0.10, is it more than that? Just trying to get a sense of how we should think about the redeployment from the preferred and debt book into income producing assets?\nBarb Pak: I think what you can do is we're losing at 10% on the preferred and we're redeploying it around 5%. And so that's kind of the impact that you're seeing from an FFO perspective. But what I did talk about on the call was we're targeting 3% to 5% of our core FFO per share. In 2024, we were at about 5.5%. So structured finance is about 5.5% of our 2024 core FFO. We do expect that will moderate to the low 4% range next year as a lot of our redemptions this year were back end loaded and then we have some front end loaded redemptions next year. And so we do expect it to moderate throughout next year. But we should have higher NOI as well as we are redeploying this money back into acquisitions.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Adam Kramer from Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Kramer: Just wanted to ask about the kind of advocacy expense, lobbying expense that was disclosed this quarter. Maybe just quantify kind of what it was this quarter and maybe what it's been year-to-date as well and then if there's more to come here in 4Q still given kind of the timing of the election versus the timing of the quarter end?\nBarb Pak: So in the third quarter, we spent $10 million. Year-to-date, we're at $16 million and for the full year, our guidance assumes a little over $30 million on the advocacy front.\nAdam Kramer: And are you able to split out whether that's kind of Prop 33 versus Prop 34 versus maybe, I don't know, the other legislative lobbying efforts?\nBarb Pak: No, it's all related to mostly Prop 33 and 34, but we don't have -- I don't have that breakout in front of me.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Jamie Feldman from Wells Fargo.\nJamie Feldman: So I think you renewed your insurance policy in December. Can you give us your initial thoughts on how that's looking and maybe just frame what you're seeing and hearing on the commercial property insurance market overall?\nBarb Pak: We have a good memory. We are in the midst of our insurance renewal right now. It's a little too early to know how it's going to play out. But what we have seen in the industry this year is a moderation in insurance premium increases. So just to give some history, the last two years, we've seen our premium increase 20% to 30% annually. And we do expect that it will moderate from there next year, but the level is a little difficult to discern at this point. We'll obviously have more color on our fourth quarter call.\nJamie Feldman: And I know you're not obviously in Florida. But are you hearing like that spills over everywhere in the country or do you think you'll be relatively isolated from the impact?\nBarb Pak: It's something that is playing out as we speak. And the November renewal didn't see too big of an impact that we heard. But obviously, we're going after both hurricanes hit. So a little tricky to answer that question right now and we're in the midst of those discussions at this point.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Josh Dennerlein from Bank of America.\nJosh Dennerlein: I was looking at a Exhibit or I guess Page S-16.1 in the supplemental. Could you just kind of go over that earn in? I see that you added [Technical Difficulty] concession impact. So I just kind of want to clarify what that means and maybe how we should think about it versus like our models out here?\nBarb Pak: So the earn-in is consistent with how we calculate it last year. It's really just taking the leases that we've signed through October. And and then our projections for November, December and what does that kind of carry forward next year, assuming no market rent growth next year. And it doesn't include concessions because concessions are below the line. I mean this is just that gross rent not including any concessions. I don't think it's too dissimilar from how the industry calculates this number but 90 basis points is our projection at this point based on the leases signed. Does that answer your question or\u2026\nJosh Dennerlein: And then maybe just why have you, just kind of thinking about like the capital recycling. Do you guys think you'll lean into maybe taking out or consolidating additional JVs versus just like outright open market purchases of income producing assets or is it just kind of opportunity set driven?\nRylan Burns: The joint venture business has really been an efficient source of capital. And so it has and will continue to benefit the company through various points of the cycle. We have great partners who want exposure to West Coast housing and they like investing alongside a company like Essex that's financially aligned and can provide a best-in-class operating platform. So in 2024, from Essex's perspective, we saw an opportunity to purchase communities that we knew well, we had invested in for many years and most importantly, was accretive to shareholders. Going forward, we still have 7,700 units that are owned in joint venture partnerships and it's going to be a function of our discussion with partners, our cost of capital and the opportunity set in the market. So we are open and eagerly looking at all avenues to grow.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of John Kim from BMO Capital Markets.\nJohn Kim: I wanted to ask about the spread that you have between renewal and new leases this quarter. It was 330 basis points, over the last two years, it's been 350. A lot of your peers are at 600 basis points or more in some cases. So it seems like your renewals are a little bit more sensitive to market rents than maybe some others. And I'm wondering why that's the case?\nAngela Kleiman: I don't know if our renewals and market rent sensitivity is really what's driving the spread. I think it's more the operating strategy that's driving the spread. And so what we focus on is maximizing revenues. And so we try to send renewals out where we anticipate what the market is going to be a month or two from today. And negotiate as needed along the way. And of course, that strategy is influenced by whether we're focusing on occupancy and what else is happening, the supply landscape, the job landscape. And so we try to factor all of that with our maximizing total revenue in mind. What we have seen is some of our peers are more focused on, say, getting a higher lease -- new lease rate and some are more focused on just getting higher renewal rates, for example. And when you focus on one, of course, there's going to -- it's going to impact the others. And if it's not a rate impact, it's going to be an occupancy impact. So ultimately, I know it's -- I'm probably giving you more color than what you're asking for. But ultimately, I do think that we all have different levers that we are pulling. And our business objective is focused on maximizing revenue, not a specific rate per se.\nJohn Kim: But I mean, in the case of some companies, the move out to buy a home is at all-time lows. I'm wondering what that ratio is for you right now. But because of that all-time low, they're able to push renewals maybe harder than one would expect versus new leases. So I'm wondering because home prices are so high in your markets, does that present potential upside for you going forward as far as, I don't know, pushing on a little bit more renewals?\nAngela Kleiman: For us, the move out to buy homes has not been a meaningful factor in our pricing strategy, whether it's now or in prior cycles, primarily because it's a smaller percentage. So for example, pre-COVID, during say more -- even when interest rates were at very low, our move out to buy homes was somewhere around 10 percentage range. So it's already very low. And the cost to own a home is back then almost 2 times. I think it was 1.8 times more expensive to buy a home than to rent. Today, the move-out ratio is about 5%. So it's about half. Having said that, we're talking about almost 2.8%, so almost 3% or 3 times more expensive to own than to rent. So that incremental increase on that cost of ownership really isn't going to move the needle on our pricing strategy because it's already so expensive.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Linda Tsai from Jefferies.\nLinda Tsai: Maybe just related to some of the topics you covered earlier. Just with comparisons getting a little easier from here, would you expect new lease rates to inflect more positively for the last two months?\nAngela Kleiman: That's what we are anticipating. And so new rates obviously went negative in October and this started in September. But with the easier year-over-year comp, we do expect a inflection point where it either becomes neutral or turns positive.\nLinda Tsai: And a quick question for Barb. Could you provide some color on your refinancing plans for the upcoming 2025 maturities and maybe what kind of impact that would have on earnings for next year?\nBarb Pak: We're constantly monitoring the market. And most of the maturities that are due next year is $500 million in unsecured bonds. So we'll be looking at the bond market to refinance that in the near term. I think it depends on the tenor and where the treasury is at. When we issued the 10 year paper in August, we were at 5.1%. Today, we're probably 30 basis points wide of that today. And so there will be an earnings impact because we're rolling off a 3.5% coupon bond and going up into the low 5s. But in terms of opportunities to refinance it, we'll continue to monitor the market to see if there's a window, that's a more attractive opportunity.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of John Pawlowski from Green Street.\nJohn Pawlowski: I wanted to drill into the return to office theme some more and use Seattle as a case study. So can you share any specific metrics to help us understand how the leasing conditions have improved since Amazon and a few others have announced stricter return to office policies and now ostensibly housing choices need to change ahead of those mandates becoming effective? So would love to hear how either foot traffic or leasing spreads have shifted in recent weeks and months.\nAngela Kleiman: So in Seattle, what we have seen is our demand increase or in fact spike when Amazon and some of these other companies first announced return to office and I think back then it was three days. And so we saw that direct correlation and usually, it was within, say, 30 to 45 days of that announcement. And as far as we're -- fast worded today, with the announcement of Amazon going full time in January, the question here is going to be, when do they start enforcing it, because that's when we will see the benefit. So when Amazon first announced their return to office, they also said they were enforcing it right away. And this time, we're waiting to see how -- if that's going to hold true as well.\nJohn Pawlowski: And then last one from me, Angela, Barb, I want to talk about the exclusion of the advocacy costs from core FFO. I just get frustrated when a lot of money gets excluded from these metrics. So as these regulatory efforts become more recurring in nature, they're episodic but they're definitely not onetime. How do you guys just deliberate internally as they become more recurring, still excluding meaningful expenses from core FFO?\nBarb Pak: I mean we don't see them as recurring every year. And in this case, we haven't had any cost since 2020 on this front. So it's been four years. And so we do have a plan in terms of how -- what we define as nonrecurring costs and this is one of them. I think it's pretty standard in the industry but it's something that we do revisit regularly, and we've been transparent about how much we're spending. And so we're not trying to hide from it but we don't see it reoccurring every year.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Julien Blouin from Goldman Sachs.\nJulien Blouin: Rylan, maybe digging into your comments on the JV acquisition front. I guess, how many of those 7,000 plus remaining JV units would you ultimately be interested in consolidating if you had the opportunity? And do most of those have sort of significant Prop 13 benefits that help your yield as a buyer sort of come in closer to that 6% buyer cap rate you've been getting?\nRylan Burns: Julien, the fact that we've made these investments to begin with would suggest that we would like to own all of them if we had the opportunity, and several of them are structured in such a way that we would have a Prop 13 benefit. But that being said, we have great partnerships and our strategy or plan is not to consolidate all of them. We will continue to evaluate opportunities as joint venture maturities come forward or as debt maturities come forward. So it represents an opportunity. But we are committed to this business and we're committed to our partners that want to be in this business with us. So just manage expectations about how many of those could be consolidated in the near term.\nJulien Blouin: And it sounds like a lot of these are older assets. I guess, does that bring any sort of value add redev opportunities to sort of accretively upgrade these assets at attractive yields, maybe putting in capital that would have been difficult to secure from partners but that maybe now is a little more straightforward for you to do on your own?\nRylan Burns: I would say that there was one asset that was part of the initial portfolio earlier this year where we had significant development opportunity that we continue to explore. Typically, these are business cases that we discuss with partners. And more often than not -- again, we have got great partnerships that see the value that we can create that those are rarely gating issues from our partners' capital. However, as you can imagine, it is a little bit more efficient when we're doing it internally on a consolidated basis. So these are assets that we've owned for a long time. We invested in our assets. So we know what we're stepping into. And in some cases, there is some value add opportunity but nothing significant to highlight from the most recent acquisitions.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Alex Kim from Zelman & Associates.\nAlex Kim: I wanted to ask about your blended rent growth outlook. I noticed that you referenced remaining on plan for your full year outlook of around 2.5%. Could you talk through some of your expectations in November and December that allow you to remain on track, I guess, especially with the seasonal moderation that occurs in these upcoming months?\nAngela Kleiman: In terms of what we're looking at for November, December, I'll just give you one example that hopefully can give you the appropriate color. So in last year, in October, we were giving out half a week of concessions in San Mateo. And by November and December, concessions went up to 3.2 weeks. So currently sitting at two, we don't see that increasing dramatically because last year, we had supply in San Mateo, for example, and some other influences. And so just from the fact that there is going to be no headwind on the concessions that in itself is a beneficial pickup. The second factor is, of course, with LA working through the evictions in a meaningful way that overhang on new leases will continue to abate. So that will be another beneficial factor. And of course, the third piece is lease rates. New lease rates in October and November last year, they went down to about, say, average negative 2.5%. And so once again, this year in October, we're sitting here at about 1.5%. We have plenty of room and certainly not a new lease rate headwind on that front, so -- and multiple fronts, we actually have either a tailwind or no headwind and which is why we have talked about a potential reacceleration on the new lease rates. And of course, the last component is our renewals have performed stronger than our original forecast. And so on a blended basis, we see a path to achieving our plan.\nAlex Kim: And then just to follow up, wanted to ask about bad debt. And some of your assumptions for delinquencies, not for '25 but for this upcoming fourth quarter, as well as any other specifics you could provide for like the other income piece that helped drive the upward revenue guidance revision?\nBarb Pak: In terms of bad debt, year-to-date through October, we're sitting right around 1%. We think we'll be right around 1%, maybe slightly under for the full year with the fourth quarter being not too dissimilar. In terms of the other income drivers for the quarter, in the third quarter, we did have higher lease break fees related to corporate tenants, which hit the other income line but it's not going to reoccur in the fourth quarter, which is causing some sequential decline that you're seeing in the numbers, fourth quarter relative to the third quarter.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Amy [Indiscernible] from UBS.\nUnidentified Analyst: A follow-up to a previous question, and sorry if this is coming a little too close to asking for guidance. Are you able to discuss how we should be thinking about the impact of concession burn-off in '25? It seems like San Jose and Seattle could see some tailwinds in the second half of the year. But wondering if there is a way that we can think about quantifying some of this impact.\nAngela Kleiman: What we're seeing is that the concessionary level, while it may vary in our submarkets, is essentially moving from one area to another when it comes to supply. And so last year was heavier in downtown Seattle this year -- I mean -- or this year, I should say, 2024, not over yet, is so heavier in downtown Seattle. Next year, it's going to be a little heavier in East side. And so it's going to shift from one to the other. And therefore, overall, we really don't expect the concessionary environment for the full year to vary all that much from one year to the other.\nUnidentified Analyst: And just a quick one on the transaction environment. Do you think that the current transaction levels are kind of back to a pre-COVID norm or are we still trending lower in terms of absolute volume?\nRylan Burns: Amy, transaction volumes year-to-date in California and Washington, and it actually is approximate for the national average, are around of what we would call pre-COVID average, say, 15% to 19%. It's still well below approximately a third of what we saw in '21 and '22. So we've had an uptick versus last year, which there was very limited volume. It's picked up that includes some of the large portfolio transactions that I'm sure you're aware of but we're still below the level of volumes that we've seen in previous years. So there's a good chance of capital markets continue to trend favorably that we'll see an uptick in transaction volume next year. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, we take the last question from the line of Conor Peaks from Deutsche Bank.\nConor Peaks: Maybe sticking on the acquisition opportunity front. Maybe if you could talk a little bit about what kind of regional differences you're seeing in your markets, maybe in regards to available stock for sale or movements in cap rate pricing?\nRylan Burns: We're not seeing a wide differentiation in terms of cap rates for core product, well located newer product in all of our submarkets continue to be well bid. I think you're seeing some -- the most aggressive pricing is along the Peninsula where I think people are more likely to be underwriting above average rent growth for the next several years. But the spread difference in terms of cap rates for high quality product is de minimis. We've seen limited transaction volume in the downtown centers and particularly LA to start the year that has picked up. We've seen several transactions in Downtown LA this year. So they feel like relatively healthy markets. But again, as I mentioned earlier not to the level of volumes we've seen in previous years.\nConor Peaks: And then it could be a tougher comp kind of driving this a little bit. But if we were to look at the higher expenses in the Northern California portfolio and the drivers behind that?\nBarb Pak: It is somewhat comp related. There is -- expenses are lumpy quarter-to-quarter and does depend on what happened a year ago. I would say utility expenses were a little higher there than in some of the other regions and that represents 20% of our OpEx. So that can have sometimes a meaningful impact. And so nothing to be alarmed about, nothing that's really outside the norm. It just really does depend on the comp from the prior year.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the question-and-answer session. And it also concludes the conference of Essex Property Trust. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Angela Kleiman",
            "content": "Good morning. Thank you for joining Essex third quarter earnings call. Barb Pak will follow with prepared remarks and Rylan Burns is here for Q&A. We are pleased to report our third guidance raise this year as a result of another healthy quarter with core FFO per share exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range. Today, my comments will focus on our performance year-to-date, preliminary considerations for 2025 and an update on the investment market. Starting with highlights to-date, notable milestones this year include record low turnover, excellent progress resolving delinquency and positive inflection points in several key demand drivers. These factors combined with muted level of new housing supply have enabled Essex to deliver results exceeding the high end of our original 2024 expectations. Year-to-date, we've achieved solid results with market rents generally trending consistent with historical patterns as shown in the chart on Page S-13.2. In the third quarter, rents peaked in July and remained resilient through August before moderating in September. As we expected, the blended rate growth of 2.5% for the quarter was tempered by the combination of seasonal moderation in rents, which started in September and difficult year-over-year comparison. Especially since last year, our rents did not moderate until late October. As we enter the fourth quarter, our market remain stable. We shifted our operating strategy to focus on occupancy as we've done in prior years in anticipation of slower demand characteristic of normal seasonality. Moving to regional highlights. Seattle has been our top performer this year, delivering a strong 3.8% blended rate growth in the third quarter. The East side, where we have approximately 70% of our portfolio, was our strongest markets with 4.7% blended growth. For the rest of the year, we anticipate a heavier supply delivery and thus more concessions usage in this region. Northern California has performed well, achieving 2.3% blended rate growth in the third quarter, led by Santa Clara County with 3.6%. The overall supply for this region remains very low but we anticipate most of the deliveries for San Jose this year to occur in the fourth quarter. Therefore, we plan for higher concessions to address this short term impact. On to Southern California, which achieved 2.1% blended lease rate growth in the third quarter. Lease rates in this region were tempered by headwinds related to delinquency recovery in Los Angeles. Excluding LA, this region produced 3.5% blended rate growth for the third quarter. While the exact timing is difficult to pinpoint, we are cautiously optimistic that new lease rates will begin to recover next year in LA as volume of delinquent units continue to subside. Heading into year end, we are well positioned at 96.1% financial occupancy for October with year-over-year comps easing in November and December. Turning to our expectations for 2025. We've provided high level revenue drivers on Page S-16.2 of the supplemental. We expect our earnings for next year to surpass what was achieved in 2024, ranging from 80 to 100 basis points. Additionally, we anticipate a 40 to 60 basis points tailwind from delinquency improvements. Combined, these two components should generate approximately 120 to 160 basis points of same property revenue growth in 2025. As for market rent growth, supply and demand will ultimately be the key building blocks. The fundamental backdrop remains stable and continues to gradually improve. On the supply side, detailed on Page S-16 of the supplemental, we expect total supply growth of only 50 basis points in 2025. This is consistent with the low level of supply in 2024 and well below our long term average of 1% for our markets. On the demand side, we've seen positive inflection points and several major demand drivers this year. Job postings at the top 20 technology companies have been steadily recovering, demonstrating a sentiment shift from retrenchment in 2023 to positioning for future growth. Additionally, these same companies continue to increase their return to office requirements, which has resulted in increased demand to San Jose and Seattle regions. Related to this is migration back to our markets, which has steadily improved and is rebalancing toward historical patterns. Given the low supply environment in the Essex markets, we are well positioned to achieve new lease rate growth with incremental demand. Lastly, on the transaction market, strong investor interest for multifamily properties on the West Coast has resulted in cap rates trading consistently in the mid 4% range with numerous transaction in the low 4%. Within this competitive landscape, our investment team has done a terrific job originating several opportunities at better than market yields, acquiring over 1,700 units to date, totaling over $700 million at our pro rata share. We continue to execute transactions with attractive returns relative to our cost of capital and we are confident in our ability to generate opportunities to drive NAV and FFO per share accretion for our shareholders. Finally, I'll conclude with a brief comment on California Proposition 33. It is no surprise to anyone that excessive regulation dramatically restrict housing production in California, leading to high cost of housing. As such, we have joined Governor Newsom in endorsing a no vote on Proposition 33. We all know that building more housing is the only solution to the state's housing shortage. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barb. With respect to LA Alameda, a couple of things are happening on the ground that gives us also some confidence that things are improving. So for example, delinquency in terms of just the volume, let's start there, it has really improved. In fact, at year end, last year in December, our delinquency as a percentage of rent for LA was almost 5%. Today, it's 1.6%. So that is significant progress. And we've seen a direct correlation with the courts continue to move through the eviction and that's been a key to continuing that trend. But as far as just general economic viability for LA, a couple of things that actually has given us a positive sign. So for example, we have, of course, the World Cup coming in the Olympics. And so what we are anticipating is that there will be benefits from economic investments, both domestically and internationally to this region. But further, just this week, Governor Newsom proposed to double California's film and television tax credit program from current $330 million to about $750 million. So these are all great signs that we're seeing that gives us that level of optimism, if you will. So we track the openings of the top 20 tech companies. And that is -- it's just the closest thing to apples-to-apples that we can see and they're really the drivers of the overall health of the technology sector. And so we follow that and we use a third party independent report. And we have seen that for the first time in almost two years the job openings have reached pre-COVID averages. And it's a good start, because openings is an indication that these companies will be positioning to hire in the future. The one thing that I'll ask that you keep in mind is that this is a lumpy trend and it's not an immediate impact. But obviously, things are going in the right direction here. In terms of our operating strategy, we have shifted to an occupancy strategy in the fourth quarter and that is typical to address the seasonal slow demand that's characteristic of our business, that's not anything unusual. What we are expecting is the deceleration that we have seen in September and October, which we, of course, have factored into our guidance to the headwinds that caused those to start to abate. And so for example, in October last year, just to give you one data point, our concessions was only half a week and this year, it's about a week. Well, that doesn't seem like a big number, half a week is -- represents 1% of rent. So you can see the year-over-year impact on the financials. But as far as the renewal is concerned, we're sending renewals out in the mid-4s. So a strong number consistent with our plan. And early indication is that we're landing around the high 3s, once again, also well within the range. Typically, the negotiations range from zero to 100 basis points, and this is kind of in the middle of that. So these are all good indications for the rest of the year and our ability for pricing power in next year to come. We kind of battle internally on how to think about this risk. Let me just start with a couple of data points that I think may be useful in an assumption like this, because it is a very difficult hypothetical question to answer. And the reason that's the case is because right now every city in California can enact rent control on buildings that are on 1995, we have about 483 cities in California. And believe it or not, only about 8% of these cities have been active rent control and with a lot of these cities where the rent control is actually quite moderate. And so as far as Prop 33 is concerned, 23 mayors have actually came out and announced that they were against Proposition 33. And some of these mayors are the same ones that out have in that the rent control like San Jose, for example, and Santa Ana. So for us to try to interpolate something that is so unlikely -- it's just it's too difficult to predict. But more importantly, on the campaign itself, what we're seeing is that this is following the same pattern as the 2018 and the 2020 pattern and both times, they were defeated by a landslide. And so I understand that there's an overhang in our stock just because it isn't unknown. But what we're seeing is that the public and the legislators they understand the impact of something this onerous. And in fact, this is evidenced by the most expensive cities in California are the ones with the most onerous rent control like San Francisco and Santa Monica and the ones with the highest brands. So the net-net is that the campaign continues to gain momentum and we are confident this will be defeated. So we are sending new renewals out in the mid-4s. And so far, the early indication and those who have signed leases are lending in the high 3s, so say 3.9%, 3.8% on average. So these are definitely good trends and positive indication. As far as the possibility of a reacceleration, it's certainly possible just because, as I mentioned, rents continue to increase through October last year. So that's one factor, renewals remain strong. And if nothing else, we just don't have the same headwind in November, December this year as we did last year. And so that is a possibility. A couple of things on the immigration front. We are seeing that this year has benefited our numbers and especially if you look at the job growth environment, it's generally not robust for the US and the West Coast. It's stable and it's moving along. And so for us to be able to outperform, it's demand coming from elsewhere relative to our original forecast. And so in terms of predicting how that is going to impact next year, it's too early to tell really for two reasons. One is that we do believe most of the return to office benefit were captured this year. And I'll give you a point -- one data point, which is our immigration. Our immigration as a percentage of our total leases, it's not yet to pre-COVID level but it's pretty darn close. So that's one good indication. So maybe you can say we've captured 70%, 75% of the return to office. So there's some left for next year but it's not going to be as robust as this year. But what will really drive demand for housing next year is going to be all about job growth. Fortunately, for us, with low demand, our base case is very low risk. Having said that, we'll need better indication on a macro level where the consensus job forecast is going to land and what that will mean for the West Coast, because we are still all somewhat interrelated to the entire economy. On the supply landscape, we do see that the San Jose impact should only really be more concentrated in the fourth quarter, maybe a little bit leads over in the first quarter, because it all really depends on how the delivery occurs. So for example, if they all come at once or if they going to go pro rata over the next several months, it'll have a different impact. But having said that, San Jose as far as -- or the total stock is still very low. We're talking about, for the full year, 2,400 units that's supposed to be delivered. Unfortunately, about 1,100 of those happened in the fourth quarter but it's still very low and this is why we expect that absorption to occur quickly. And well, yes, there will be some concessions involved. It's not going to be as challenging as what we've seen, for example, in Downtown LA or Oakland. It's a very different beast. And it should -- we should get past it within, say, three months or four months or something along those lines. Seattle is a little bit more in terms of the supply overall. I mean, generally, it has been a higher supply delivery market with stay a little bit above 1% of total supply. And so having a shift from the east side, we believe that impact will start in the fourth quarter and probably continue in the first quarter. What has helped Seattle in the past and what we continue to see the benefit is that Seattle has also generated the highest level of demand in the market. So with a higher level of job growth, we expect that the demand or the supply will be absorbed timely. And so while there will be a temporary concession environment, it shouldn't be prolonged because that's how it's been every year with Seattle. I don't know if our renewals and market rent sensitivity is really what's driving the spread. I think it's more the operating strategy that's driving the spread. And so what we focus on is maximizing revenues. And so we try to send renewals out where we anticipate what the market is going to be a month or two from today. And negotiate as needed along the way. And of course, that strategy is influenced by whether we're focusing on occupancy and what else is happening, the supply landscape, the job landscape. And so we try to factor all of that with our maximizing total revenue in mind. What we have seen is some of our peers are more focused on, say, getting a higher lease -- new lease rate and some are more focused on just getting higher renewal rates, for example. And when you focus on one, of course, there's going to -- it's going to impact the others. And if it's not a rate impact, it's going to be an occupancy impact. So ultimately, I know it's -- I'm probably giving you more color than what you're asking for. But ultimately, I do think that we all have different levers that we are pulling. And our business objective is focused on maximizing revenue, not a specific rate per se. For us, the move out to buy homes has not been a meaningful factor in our pricing strategy, whether it's now or in prior cycles, primarily because it's a smaller percentage. So for example, pre-COVID, during say more -- even when interest rates were at very low, our move out to buy homes was somewhere around 10 percentage range. So it's already very low. And the cost to own a home is back then almost 2 times. I think it was 1.8 times more expensive to buy a home than to rent. Today, the move-out ratio is about 5%. So it's about half. Having said that, we're talking about almost 2.8%, so almost 3% or 3 times more expensive to own than to rent. So that incremental increase on that cost of ownership really isn't going to move the needle on our pricing strategy because it's already so expensive. That's what we are anticipating. And so new rates obviously went negative in October and this started in September. But with the easier year-over-year comp, we do expect a inflection point where it either becomes neutral or turns positive. So in Seattle, what we have seen is our demand increase or in fact spike when Amazon and some of these other companies first announced return to office and I think back then it was three days. And so we saw that direct correlation and usually, it was within, say, 30 to 45 days of that announcement. And as far as we're -- fast worded today, with the announcement of Amazon going full time in January, the question here is going to be, when do they start enforcing it, because that's when we will see the benefit. So when Amazon first announced their return to office, they also said they were enforcing it right away. And this time, we're waiting to see how -- if that's going to hold true as well. In terms of what we're looking at for November, December, I'll just give you one example that hopefully can give you the appropriate color. So in last year, in October, we were giving out half a week of concessions in San Mateo. And by November and December, concessions went up to 3.2 weeks. So currently sitting at two, we don't see that increasing dramatically because last year, we had supply in San Mateo, for example, and some other influences. And so just from the fact that there is going to be no headwind on the concessions that in itself is a beneficial pickup. The second factor is, of course, with LA working through the evictions in a meaningful way that overhang on new leases will continue to abate. So that will be another beneficial factor. And of course, the third piece is lease rates. New lease rates in October and November last year, they went down to about, say, average negative 2.5%. And so once again, this year in October, we're sitting here at about 1.5%. We have plenty of room and certainly not a new lease rate headwind on that front, so -- and multiple fronts, we actually have either a tailwind or no headwind and which is why we have talked about a potential reacceleration on the new lease rates. And of course, the last component is our renewals have performed stronger than our original forecast. And so on a blended basis, we see a path to achieving our plan. What we're seeing is that the concessionary level, while it may vary in our submarkets, is essentially moving from one area to another when it comes to supply. And so last year was heavier in downtown Seattle this year -- I mean -- or this year, I should say, 2024, not over yet, is so heavier in downtown Seattle. Next year, it's going to be a little heavier in East side. And so it's going to shift from one to the other. And therefore, overall, we really don't expect the concessionary environment for the full year to vary all that much from one year to the other."

            "name": "Barb Pak",
            "content": "Thanks, Angela. I'll begin by briefly discussing our third quarter results, followed by comments on the remainder of 2024 and conclude with investments and the balance sheet. I'm pleased to report third quarter core FFO per share of $3.91, a $0.04 beat to the midpoint of our guidance range. The outperformance was primarily driven by higher same property revenues. For the full year, we are raising the midpoint of core FFO for a third consecutive quarter by $0.06 to $15.56 per share, which represents 3.5% year-over-year growth. A key contributor to the full year increase relates to same property revenue growth, which has outperformed our expectations. As such, we are raising our midpoint by 25 basis points to 3.25% growth for the year. The increase is driven by lower delinquency and higher other income. With no change to our expense outlook, we expect same property NOI growth of 2.6%, a 30 basis points increase at the midpoint. Turning to investments. Year-to-date, we've acquired approximately $700 million in multifamily properties at pro rata share, which has been funded on a leverage neutral basis with $200 million of dispositions, $450 million of proceeds from structured finance redemptions and free cash flow and $25 million in OP units. As it relates to our structured finance book, we have received $106 million in cash redemptions through October and anticipate an additional $40 million for the balance of the year. We've reinvested these funds into new acquisitions, which offer the most attractive risk adjusted return today given the growth potential in our markets. While this strategic reallocation results in short term FFO dilution, growing the company via apartment acquisitions improves the quality of our cash flow and the long term growth profile of our portfolio. This in turn drives better NAV and core FFO growth for our shareholders. Looking to 2025, we expect between $100 million to $150 million of redemptions with up to 50% expected by the end of the first quarter. Barring a change in the investment landscape, we are most likely to redeploy these proceeds into acquisitions, resulting in a continued reduction of the structured finance book and better alignment with our target range for this business at 3% to 5% of core FFO. Finally, a few comments on the balance sheet. Over the last several years, we have opportunistically refinanced our debt maturities early when we see an attractive issuance window. We continued that trend this quarter as we issued $200 million in 10 year unsecured bonds and an effective rate of 5.1%. With a manageable debt maturity schedule next year, we have ample flexibility to be opportunistic. Overall, our balance sheet remains in a strong position with low leverage as defined by net debt to EBITDA at 5.5 times. In addition, with over $1 billion in liquidity and ample sources of available capital, the company is well positioned. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions. I think what you can do is we're losing at 10% on the preferred and we're redeploying it around 5%. And so that's kind of the impact that you're seeing from an FFO perspective. But what I did talk about on the call was we're targeting 3% to 5% of our core FFO per share. In 2024, we were at about 5.5%. So structured finance is about 5.5% of our 2024 core FFO. We do expect that will moderate to the low 4% range next year as a lot of our redemptions this year were back end loaded and then we have some front end loaded redemptions next year. And so we do expect it to moderate throughout next year. But we should have higher NOI as well as we are redeploying this money back into acquisitions. So in the third quarter, we spent $10 million. Year-to-date, we're at $16 million and for the full year, our guidance assumes a little over $30 million on the advocacy front. No, it's all related to mostly Prop 33 and 34, but we don't have -- I don't have that breakout in front of me. We have a good memory. We are in the midst of our insurance renewal right now. It's a little too early to know how it's going to play out. But what we have seen in the industry this year is a moderation in insurance premium increases. So just to give some history, the last two years, we've seen our premium increase 20% to 30% annually. And we do expect that it will moderate from there next year, but the level is a little difficult to discern at this point. We'll obviously have more color on our fourth quarter call. It's something that is playing out as we speak. And the November renewal didn't see too big of an impact that we heard. But obviously, we're going after both hurricanes hit. So a little tricky to answer that question right now and we're in the midst of those discussions at this point. So the earn-in is consistent with how we calculate it last year. It's really just taking the leases that we've signed through October. And and then our projections for November, December and what does that kind of carry forward next year, assuming no market rent growth next year. And it doesn't include concessions because concessions are below the line. I mean this is just that gross rent not including any concessions. I don't think it's too dissimilar from how the industry calculates this number but 90 basis points is our projection at this point based on the leases signed. Does that answer your question or... We're constantly monitoring the market. And most of the maturities that are due next year is $500 million in unsecured bonds. So we'll be looking at the bond market to refinance that in the near term. I think it depends on the tenor and where the treasury is at. When we issued the 10 year paper in August, we were at 5.1%. Today, we're probably 30 basis points wide of that today. And so there will be an earnings impact because we're rolling off a 3.5% coupon bond and going up into the low 5s. But in terms of opportunities to refinance it, we'll continue to monitor the market to see if there's a window, that's a more attractive opportunity. I mean we don't see them as recurring every year. And in this case, we haven't had any cost since 2020 on this front. So it's been four years. And so we do have a plan in terms of how -- what we define as nonrecurring costs and this is one of them. I think it's pretty standard in the industry but it's something that we do revisit regularly, and we've been transparent about how much we're spending. And so we're not trying to hide from it but we don't see it reoccurring every year. In terms of bad debt, year-to-date through October, we're sitting right around 1%. We think we'll be right around 1%, maybe slightly under for the full year with the fourth quarter being not too dissimilar. In terms of the other income drivers for the quarter, in the third quarter, we did have higher lease break fees related to corporate tenants, which hit the other income line but it's not going to reoccur in the fourth quarter, which is causing some sequential decline that you're seeing in the numbers, fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. It is somewhat comp related. There is -- expenses are lumpy quarter-to-quarter and does depend on what happened a year ago. I would say utility expenses were a little higher there than in some of the other regions and that represents 20% of our OpEx. So that can have sometimes a meaningful impact. And so nothing to be alarmed about, nothing that's really outside the norm. It just really does depend on the comp from the prior year."

In both cases, we had debt maturing, which necessitated conversation. And we believe we were able to buy those at very attractive basis, probably 20% to 25% discounts to replacement cost today at yields in the high 4s. So we think better than market pricing. In one instance, we were able to also negotiate an OP unit transaction at a 305 strike price, which was, when we negotiated, it was -- stock was around 270. So that was a necessary requirement for us to make that deal [pencil] an accretive basis. Subsequent to quarter end, the portfolio transaction that was noted in the release, this is similar to the portfolio that we did earlier in the year where market cap rates are in the low 5s, given this is a slightly older portfolio but one that we've owned for many, many years. We've invested in we know very well. And with our basis as we were already majority owners is going to cap rate to Essex -- closer to a 6. The disposition subsequent to quarter end in San Mateo, this was a 76 year old asset and approximately a 5 cap to Essex inclusive of capital. And the thinking there is that we are seeing better risk adjusted opportunities elsewhere and we're able to redeploy that capital into higher returning investments. It's something we've been really focused on here over the past year. So as you know, we haven't started a new development for almost five years. The risk adjusted returns just really didn't make sense. What we've seen more recently is that I think others are recognizing the challenging return environment and we've seen capital pullback. So permits are starting to come down, hard costs are starting to come down. So if you can secure land at an attractive basis and design an efficient building, I'd say we're getting closer. So we have a history of being a counter-cyclical developer. And I think with others pulling back, we are sharpening our pencils. And we'll have more to come here in the next several quarters. The joint venture business has really been an efficient source of capital. And so it has and will continue to benefit the company through various points of the cycle. We have great partners who want exposure to West Coast housing and they like investing alongside a company like Essex that's financially aligned and can provide a best-in-class operating platform. So in 2024, from Essex's perspective, we saw an opportunity to purchase communities that we knew well, we had invested in for many years and most importantly, was accretive to shareholders. Going forward, we still have 7,700 units that are owned in joint venture partnerships and it's going to be a function of our discussion with partners, our cost of capital and the opportunity set in the market. So we are open and eagerly looking at all avenues to grow. Julien, the fact that we've made these investments to begin with would suggest that we would like to own all of them if we had the opportunity, and several of them are structured in such a way that we would have a Prop 13 benefit. But that being said, we have great partnerships and our strategy or plan is not to consolidate all of them. We will continue to evaluate opportunities as joint venture maturities come forward or as debt maturities come forward. So it represents an opportunity. But we are committed to this business and we're committed to our partners that want to be in this business with us. So just manage expectations about how many of those could be consolidated in the near term. I would say that there was one asset that was part of the initial portfolio earlier this year where we had significant development opportunity that we continue to explore. Typically, these are business cases that we discuss with partners. And more often than not -- again, we have got great partnerships that see the value that we can create that those are rarely gating issues from our partners' capital. However, as you can imagine, it is a little bit more efficient when we're doing it internally on a consolidated basis. So these are assets that we've owned for a long time. We invested in our assets. So we know what we're stepping into. And in some cases, there is some value add opportunity but nothing significant to highlight from the most recent acquisitions. Amy, transaction volumes year-to-date in California and Washington, and it actually is approximate for the national average, are around of what we would call pre-COVID average, say, 15% to 19%. It's still well below approximately a third of what we saw in '21 and '22. So we've had an uptick versus last year, which there was very limited volume. It's picked up that includes some of the large portfolio transactions that I'm sure you're aware of but we're still below the level of volumes that we've seen in previous years. So there's a good chance of capital markets continue to trend favorably that we'll see an uptick in transaction volume next year. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, we take the last question from the line of Conor Peaks from Deutsche Bank. We're not seeing a wide differentiation in terms of cap rates for core product, well located newer product in all of our submarkets continue to be well bid. I think you're seeing some -- the most aggressive pricing is along the Peninsula where I think people are more likely to be underwriting above average rent growth for the next several years. But the spread difference in terms of cap rates for high quality product is de minimis. We've seen limited transaction volume in the downtown centers and particularly LA to start the year that has picked up. We've seen several transactions in Downtown LA this year. So they feel like relatively healthy markets. But again, as I mentioned earlier not to the level of volumes we've seen in previous years."

        "content": "Angela Kleiman - President and CEO:\nBarb Pak - CFO & EVP:\nRylan Burns - EVP and Chief Investment Officer:\nOperator: Good day, and welcome to Essex Property Trust's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions, and beliefs, as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found on the company's filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Angela Kleiman, President and Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Ms. Kleiman. You may begin.\nAngela Kleiman : Good morning, and thank you for joining Essex's second quarter earnings call. Our pack will follow with prepared remarks, and Rylan Burns is here for Q&A. We are pleased to report a strong second quarter, with core FFO per share exceeding the high end of our guidance range by $0.05. As a result, we have our second notable increase to our full-year guidance. Today, my comments will focus on underlying drivers to our outperformance and operational highlights, followed by an update on the investment market. Starting with operating fundamentals. Year-to-date, demand for West Coast multifamily housing has exceeded our expectations, particularly in Northern California and Seattle regions. While we've traditionally relied on the BLS to assess housing demand, the reported data have not correlated to the strength we're experiencing on the ground. As such, we've analyzed alternative demand indicators from third-party sources for better insights into the key drivers supporting housing demand. The first of these is job openings at the top 20 technology companies. In June, openings in the Essex markets totaled over 17,000 jobs, which represent a 150% increase from the 2023 trough. While we have yet to return to the historical average of 25,000 jobs, the steady improvement so far has generated incremental demand in our markets and is a good precursor of the recovery, particularly in Northern California and Seattle. Another factor contributing to West Coast housing demand is migration. Real-time data using Placer AI shows a gradual improvement in domestic migration patterns on the West Coast. This is illustrated on page S16.1 of our supplemental. This data suggests that workers are relocating back to the coastal headquarters, generating a shadow demand similar to a new job being added. Additionally, this year, Northern California has positive net domestic migration for the first time since pre-COVID. As for supply dynamics, limited new housing combined with favorable rental affordability continue to underpin our market fundamentals. For example, the rate of income growth has outpaced rent growth, which has improved affordability metrics in our markets. Additionally, it is 2.8 times more expensive to own than to rent in our markets today, compared to 1.7 times back in 2019 when interest rates were near the historical low. Even if mortgage rates were to revert back to the 2019 level, homeownership in our markets will still remain significantly less affordable than renting. Turning to property operations, we experienced a solid peak leasing season with blended rent growth for same property portfolio of 3.4% for the quarter. Blended rent growth would have been 4.5%, so 110 basis points higher if we exclude LA and Alameda, the two counties with elevated delinquency-related turnover. As for regional highlights, Seattle has been our best-performing market today, achieving a 4.9% blended rent growth while maintaining strong occupancy level of 97% in the second quarter. The east side, which has been less impacted by supply than the CBD, led this region with 5% blended rent growth. There are two key factors that contributed to this strong performance. First, relative to our other regions, Seattle has the strongest job growth. Second, the new supply has been less impactful as timing delays resulted in fewer deliveries in the first half of the year. These two factors have led to a prolonged seasonal peak, in that this market typically peaks around late June, but this year the peak occurred a month later, around the end of July. Northern California was our second best-performing region, achieving a 3.3% blended rent growth in the second quarter, an occupancy of 96.3%. San Mateo and San Jose were the notable outperformers at around 4% growth, with Alameda County pulling down the regional average by 80 basis points due to delinquency turnover and the continued elevated supply in Oakland. Generally, rents in this region peaked around early July, consistent with historical patterns. Lastly, Southern California continues to be a steady performer. We achieved 2.8% blended rent growth for the quarter, which would have been 200 basis points higher if we were to exclude LA. In similar fashion, Southern California's average occupancy of 95.7% for the quarter was tempered by Los Angeles, with all other markets at or above 96% occupancy. Excluding LA, Southern California's rents peaked in late July, consistent with historical patterns. As we begin the third quarter, our portfolio is well-positioned, with average concession of less than two days, and occupancy is healthy at 96.2%. We are prepared to shift to an occupancy strategy as appropriate, while maintaining the optionality to minimize rental growth. Finally, on the transaction market, in the second quarter, there was a significant increase in investor demand for well-located, newer multifamily properties on the West Coast. In contrast, the number of marketed properties for sale remained low. This combination has resulted in a highly competitive bidding process, and a compression in cap rates in some markets. Over the past few months, Essex has selectively procured three high-quality communities in the Bay area. All three of these investments have significant upside potential, based on the favorable fundamental backdrop and efficiencies from our operating platform. We are pleased with the progress to date, with over $500 million in acquisitions closed, and are optimistic more opportunities will arise in the near future. As always, we remain disciplined and focus on maximizing shareholder value and enhancing the growth profile of the company. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barb.\nBarb Pak : Thanks, Angela. I'll begin with comments on our second quarter results, followed by the key components of our full year guidance raise, and conclude with an update on the balance sheet. Beginning with our second quarter results, we are pleased to report core FFO per share of $3.94, which exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.11. The outperformance was primarily driven by $0.05 of higher same-property revenues, which was largely the result of stronger net effect of rent growth. In addition, this quarter benefited from $0.04 of one-time revenues and lower operating expenses, which are timing related. Turning to our full year guidance revision, our strong second quarter results and healthy peak leasing season have enabled us to increase the midpoint of our same property revenue growth by 75 basis points to 3%. Our improved outlook is largely driven by blended rent growth outpacing our initial forecast, resulting in a 50 basis points increase to revenue growth. We now forecast blended rent growth to be 120 basis points higher than our initial forecast, driven by outperformance in Northern California and Seattle. As for same property operating expenses, higher utility costs and legal fees are the primary drivers of the 50 basis points increase in our midpoint to 4.75%. As it relates to controllable expenses, we have been effective in managing this aspect of the business despite the elevated cost environment. For the year, we expect controllable expenses to increase less than 3%. In total, we now expect same property NOI to grow by 2.3% at the midpoint, representing a 90 basis points improvement to our prior guidance and 170 basis points improvement from our initial outlook. Based on our strong second quarter results and the revision to same-property growth, we are raising full-year core FFO by $0.27 to $15.50 per share, which represents 3.1% year-over-year growth. In total, we've raised core FFO a notable $0.47 per share so far this year. As it relates to our third quarter guidance, we are forecasting $3.87 at the midpoint. The sequential decline from the second quarter relates to two factors. First, same-property NOI is expected to be $0.05 lower, which is driven by elevated operating expenses given the typical seasonality and spending for repairs and maintenance, taxes and utilities. And second, we had $0.02 of one-time items in the second quarter. Turning to the preferred equity portfolio. For the year, we expect between $125 million to $175 million in redemptions, of which we received $50 million to date. Our intention is to redeploy the proceeds into acquisitions depending on market opportunities. In terms of the watch list, we started the year with five properties on the list, of which three have been removed so far to date. Two of the properties were acquired and consolidated on our financials, and one of the investments had a significant equity infusion, which puts us in a better position in the capital stack. In total, the reduction in the watch list added approximately $0.04 to our full-year core FFO. The rest of the portfolio is performing as planned. Finally, our balance sheet metrics remain a key source of strength. We have no remaining consolidated maturities in 2024, our leverage levels remain healthy with net debt to EBITDA at 5.4 times, and we have over $1 billion in available liquidity. As such, we are well-positioned to capitalize on opportunities as they arise. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nAustin Wurschmidt : Hi, and good morning, everybody. Angela, you mentioned that you're prepared to shift to an occupancy strategy, so just curious if we should view kind of the pullback and renewal rate growth in recent months as a tactical move to drive occupancy, or are you getting some pushback on the increases and kind of seeing retention moderate? What's sort of driving the pullback? Thanks.\nAngela Kleiman: Hey, Austin. Good to hear from you. This is more in line with our approach to address seasonality in our business, and so typically as we approach the seasonal peak, we would push on rents, and now as we shift toward the seasonal, you know, slower time of demand, we start to migrate toward occupancy, ultimately, the goal is to maximize revenues. So it's not so much of anything we're seeing that is, you know, any red flags on the fundamentals. It's more of how we normally run our business to maximize rents and revenue.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Got it, and then could you break out how new lease growth has trended across the three regions as you get into July, and just curious where you're seeing kind of the most moderation and what's kind of holding stronger, maybe a little longer than you would have anticipated? Thanks.\nAngela Kleiman: First thing, so on the new lease rates, net effect new lease rates, we are seeing Southern California holding steady, slight deceleration, but, you know, nothing material like 10, 20 basis points. Northern California is the more deceleration, about 200 basis points, and then Seattle about 50 to 60 basis points of deceleration. And once again, on the new lease, you know, activity here, it's pretty much what we had expected. There's nothing here that's giving us any alarm. This is normal business, you know, with us. Normally, Northern California peaks earlier than Southern California, and so this is on plan.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Wolfe with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. It's Nick Joseph here with Eric. Maybe just following up on that pricing strategy, but more specific to LA and Alameda, you know, are you getting closer to the point where you can be pushing pricing more right now, or do you need to get to a certain occupancy level first?\nAngela Kleiman: That's a great question, Eric [ph]. We are not quite there on LA Alameda in terms of our operating strategy. We pretty much ran a occupancy-focused strategy starting late last year that has continued throughout the year. We've been able to kind of switch back and forth a little bit, but it really didn't last long. At this point, we made really good progress on delinquency, and essentially, it improved by almost 50%. We reduced by another 50% from beginning of the year, so we're making good traction there. We probably will not be able to have pricing power until we get through the rest of this year in LA and Alameda.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. And then just on your gross bad debt, it looks like it came down to 80 basis points in July. Is your expectation that it will hold around this level for the rest of the year?\nBarb Pak: Hi, Nick. It's Barb. Yes, our guidance has about 1% baked into the rest of the year. Remember, the number can bounce around month to month, but we're pleased with the progress that we've made so far and feel comfortable that we'll continue to make progress. If we do make more progress in the 80 basis points, I'll just be upside to the high end or be to the high end of the guidance range.\nNick Joseph: Makes sense. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Song: Hi, this is Steven Song on for Josh. Thanks for the time. And then my first question is on the bad debt assumption. Seems like that's progressing better than expected so far. I wonder if you can give more color on how it will trend for the second half.\nBarb Pak: Yes, this is Barb. It is a difficult number to predict because it does bounce around month to month, and we are pleased with the progress. Keep in mind, we did take that -- we did increase our guidance in the first quarter by 40 basis points because we did lower bad debt to 1.1% for the full year. And through July, we are at 1.1% year-to-date. So we're in line with our forecast. And we do expect -- we're working hard to make progress, but it does depend on when tenants leave and when the courts process evictions. And so it's a little out of our control. So we've got 1% budgeted in the back half of the year.\nSteven Song: Okay, got it. That's very helpful. And then my second question is on the concession. If I hear this correctly, you said it's less than two days across the markets. I wonder, like, whether you separate that -- you can separate that for different regions and how that's trending so far?\nAngela Kleiman: Yes. We have that detail, concessions. So generally speaking, so Southern California has a heavier concession in L.A. for the most part, no surprise there. And Northern California concession environment is driven primarily by Oakland because of the higher -- the elevated supply. And so Southern California DQ with L.A. and Northern California, Oakland with supply. And those are the two primary drivers of higher concession levels. But ultimately, we're talking about, say, closer to for five days in those areas versus rest of the region where Seattle has essentially zero and everywhere else around one to two days. So that averages to the two days in July.\nSteven Song: Okay, got it. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nUnidentified Analyst : Hi. This is Sanket on for Steve. We were looking at the same-store revenue guidance that you guys updated. And we were just surprised that you didn't update like -- you didn't raise the low end more because year-to-date, you guys are trending at 3.5%. So we were just curious about how do you get to low end or in the lower range of the guidance range in terms of same-store revenue?\nBarb Pak: Yes. This is Barb. Yes, there's a lot of factors that go into it. And at the low end, it just does depend on how steep the decline is in the back half of the year in terms of the peak leasing season. We expect a normal season, but we've seen air pockets in the past. And so that factors into the low end, and that could impact occupancy and concessions. And then delinquency has been a wild card. It feels like it's less of a wildcard this year. But once again, that is something where we've seen blips every now and then. And so those are the factors that really led to the low end where it is. But we feel very comfortable with where our midpoint is at this point.\nUnidentified Analyst : Okay. And if -- as a follow-up, are you guys sending out renewals for the month of August and September?\nAngela Kleiman: Yes, for sending out renewals at around low 4% portfolio-wide. And based on the negotiations that we're seeing, we'll probably land somewhere between mid-3s to high 3s on the renewal side.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nicholas Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.\nDaniel Tricarico : Hey, good morning team. It's Daniel Tricarico on for Nick. Can you talk to your expectations around pricing through the back half of the year with respect to your comments on a normal seasonal pattern and pricing peaking later than typical? And would you say there's any conservatism in the new guide related to any macroeconomic or political related factors?\nAngela Kleiman: That's a great question. Well, let's start with -- we have expected that full year our blended rents will be about 2.7%. And we achieved 2.9% in the first half. So there's an implied deceleration about 35 to 40 basis points and this is actually quite moderate. It's not seem to be nothing to be concerned about. But aside from what's going on out there in the political realm, the key drivers to our anticipation is really that we have tougher year-over-year comps. So last year, our seasonal peak actually occurred one to two months later, Northern California, a month later and Southern California two months later. And so that tougher year-over-year comp is a primary driver. And then the secondary factor is the renewals ultimately will converge toward market rate over time, and that's normal.\nDaniel Tricarico: Very helpful, Angela. My follow-up is you've been a bit more active in the transaction market and with your JV partners recently. Obviously, it seems to imply a vote of confidence in your markets. You also mentioned the competitive bidding and compressed cap rates. So just curious if you're considering any new on-balance sheet development today with the supply and demand outlook you're communicating?\nRylan Burns : Yes. This is Rylan here. It's a good question. I'd say working in our favor, we've started to see hard costs come down a little bit from a year ago. The vast majority of development that we underwrite, however, does not meet our return expectations. We're looking for a significant premium to where we can go purchase today given the risk inherent in development. But I would say the trends are favorable, and we are pursuing several opportunities that could lead to an increase in our development pipeline in the near future.\nDaniel Tricarico: What would be the spread you're targeting versus market cap rates?\nRylan Burns: Yes, it's case-by-case dependent, but a general rule would be in our markets today for a shovel-ready site entitlements. We'd be looking for at least 100 basis point spread to where we can go and buy a comparable product.\nDaniel Tricarico: Thanks, Rylan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nBrad Heffern : Yes. Thanks. Hi, everyone. So for L.A. and Alameda, when you do get pricing power back, do you see those markets just returning to kind of a normal level of growth? Or should there be some sort of catch-up given incomes have gone up much more than rent has gone up?\nAngela Kleiman: That's a great question, Brad. I think that's going to depend on demand. So how quickly do we see job acceleration as we return back to that normal state to the pre-COVID level. And so fortunately, for us, we don't need much, right, given such low level of supply and which is one of the reasons we've been able to produce solid results, even though we are in a low demand growth environment. But the magnitude, if we're talking about, will be really dependent on job growth.\nBrad Heffern : Okay. And then, Barb, on the new guidance, I think the fourth quarter implied core FFO number is down slightly from the third quarter. Normally, the seasonal pattern with you guys is that the fourth quarter is the highest FFO quarter. So I'm just curious if there's something that's offsetting that? Or are there something timing-related that's falling into the fourth quarter?\nBarb Pak: Yes. It's most of the timing on the preferred redemption. So we've got $50 million to date. Most of that occurred in July. And then the rest of it is slated for beginning of the -- end of the third quarter, beginning of the fourth quarter. So we'll see the biggest impact from those redemptions then, and that's what's causing that anomaly.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nHaendel St. Juste : Thanks for taking my question. I was intrigued by some of the comments you made about seeing positive migration into Northern California for the first time since I think pre-COVID and hearing more of employees enforcing return on office mandates. So I guess I'm curious, are you seeing that translating at all into more demand or applications, anything tangible that you can point to. And if that's perhaps something that could drive perhaps some rent or any upside over the next couple of quarters?\nAngela Kleiman: Haendel, that's a great question. Ultimately, we're seeing pricing power and that's translating to our outperformance and you've seen us raise guidance twice and primarily driven by demand because we've always seen that having that low supply environment, we're in a really good position here. As far as where that's going to land, it's hard to say because it depends on the weight of the return. And so just to give you some data points, during COVID, about 400,000 people migrated out of our markets. And what's interesting is the majority of the out migration was to tertiary markets within Washington and California. And so say about a third, 35% of them actually went out to the Sun Belt and East Coast. And so what we're seeing right now is about 1.25 of that has returned. So about 100,000 has come back. And it's generally in line with that proportion of one-third out of Washington and California and two-thirds within the tertiary markets. So there's still some legs here. The question here is when and how much. And that is -- we just don't have enough visibility on the timing about that one.\nHaendel St. Juste: Okay. No, I appreciate that. And I guess we'll be watching. And I think you also mentioned -- I guess, there was an earlier question about transaction activity. And I think you mentioned in your comments that you bought assets with some occupancy or perhaps some repositioning upside. So I guess I'm curious overall just to the state of seller psychology in the marketplace. Are you seeing more potential sellers willing to engage the assets that you're underwriting, what IRRs are you looking for and your overall level of interest in deploying more capital and what cap rate range you're broadly seeing in the market?\nRylan Burns: Hi, Haendel, this is Rylan here. Several questions in there. So if I forget one, please follow up. But in general, we've seen volumes pick up in the second quarter compared to a year ago as well as the first quarter. Cap rates are fairly consistent across our markets for high-quality, well-located buildings in the mid- to high 4 cap range. So we are looking for unique opportunities that we can put it onto our operating platform and generate some additional accretion just from operating a little bit more efficiently. We're always looking for ways that potentially can add incremental yield on the top line. So we are, again, pretty excited about the investments we're able to make in the second quarter. The one that was noted at the Elan was a high 4 cap. We're expecting some additional benefit from putting it onto our operating platform. This is a building probably 20% discount to replacement cost and with rents that are about 15% low pre-COVID levels. So those -- given our fundamental outlook for some of these submarkets, if we can find more opportunities like that, we will pursue as we have always aggressively but with great discipline as well.\nHaendel St. Juste: Any color on potential the IRRs that you're underwriting?\nRylan Burns: Yes, I don't want to provide too much detail just for competitive reasons, but back of the envelope math would suggest that these are above 8.\nHaendel St. Juste: Okay. I appreciate that. And last one, if I could squeeze one in. Just broadly, if you can give us a sense of where the loss or maybe gain to lease is across the major regions of the portfolio?\nAngela Kleiman: Sure, Haendel. For you, yes, you could squeeze another one in. So July loss is about 2%. And so it's certainly a good position, especially when we compare to last year July, it's a 50 basis point improvement. Last year, July was only at 1.6%. So things are moving in the right direction.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nAdam Kramer : Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions. I wanted to ask about competition from new supply in the market. I think looking at the kind of supply disclosure in the supplemental, really helpful, by the way. And it looks in multifamily supply is maybe lower than it was in the prior disclosure, but that there may be kind of more single-family new supply in kind of the way that you guys tabulated. So just wondering if you've kind of seen that have any effect in the market kind of competition from great or new single-family supply.\nAngela Kleiman: It's Angela. The best indication of new supply competition is looking at our concessionary activities. And with where we are today at two days and the concessionary environment has progressively improved over the past six months. We certainly are not seeing competition from the single-family side.\nAdam Kramer: Got it. That's helpful. And I just wanted to ask about kind of modeling and puts and takes with regards to the kind of the pref equity investments and then kind of buying those assets out. I know you did one in the quarter, maybe on subsequent to the quarter end. So just wondering how to think about kind of the trade-off there, right? You're buying needs a kind of fairly tight cap rates and you're losing yield that's a bunch higher. But just kind of the modeling puts it takes or how to think about kind of the short-term impact in terms of kind of gain of NOI and maybe lost equity income.\nBarb Pak: Yes. This is Barb. And I might have to follow up after with the puts and takes on that. What I will tell you is that on the two investments that we didn't acquire and we had preferred equity on, there was -- we originally forecasted in our guidance for 2024, no FFO impact. And so by buying them out, we actually gained about $0.01 for this year in terms of core FFO because we didn't have any preferred equity income baked into the model given they were on the watch list and given where values were at the end of last year, we took a conservative approach on accruing on those two. And so net-net, it did add about $0.01. So -- but I can follow up with you after and go through the NOI and the other various metrics.\nAdam Kramer: Great. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nJames Feldman: Thank you for taking the question. I guess maybe a question for Rylan. It sounds like you're getting more active on potentially the acquisition front. Your markets are at the leading edge or in the headlines probably the most in terms of rent control regulation. Obviously, Prop 13 is always out there. How do you underwrite potential long-term rent growth or at least handicap those risks to the top line and I guess the expense line? As you're looking at new assets going forward, especially given big election coming up and a lot seems to be on the table.\nRylan Burns: Jamie, yes, that's a fair question. I mean, at a high level, we believe the -- the cost of Hawkins regulations coming up this November. Again, we can go into some more detail. But historically, that has been resoundingly defeated and there's our base case that, that is going to happen again this year. Now we will look at -- there are specific submarkets that have rent control and that occasion will propose specific rent control, and we'll certainly factor that into our rent growth assumptions. But at a high level, our expectation is driven by our economic research model, and we are not anticipating any change to statewide rent regulation in the near term.\nJames Feldman: Okay. So you'll underwrite greater than 5% growth over the long term across any of your markets?\nRylan Burns: Assets, it's all on a case-by-case basis, but that's certainly feasible. And given AB-1482 that is certainly achievable. So we know that that's certainly possible. I would say, a possibility that is not our base case typically when we're looking at these market rent growth, we are thinking over the long term. And so they're closer to our long-term averages. And then in some instances, where again, some submarkets in Northern California where the affordability metrics, the future look on supply as well as some positive traction we're seeing in terms of potential demand. Those are the types of investments where we might be a little bit more aggressive in the near term as a catch-up on rent.\nJames Feldman: And then just thinking about your comments on the urban markets getting a little healthier on the turn. Like do you think you might get more -- you could get more aggressive, find better value buying in the urban markets now given what you think you're seeing or do you think you'll keep the portfolio balance? I know you kind of buy what you can get that hits your IRRs. But is there a play there of getting more aggressive in the cities, given that they've been more challenged?\nRylan Burns: It's certainly something that we're evaluating. We've seen much fewer transactions in the urban core across our markets, but they're starting to see some more product come to market, and that's something that we're certainly evaluating. Again, the majority of our portfolio located in great suburban markets near transportation nodes. That's kind of our bread and butter, but we will look at anything and everything has a price. So we are excited to potentially see some more opportunities throughout all of our markets in the coming quarters.\nJames Feldman: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Connor Mitchell with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\nConnor Mitchell : Thanks for taking my question. So there's been a lot of discussion on the bidding wars and cover environment and a lot of transaction activity. Just thinking about that and then maybe also the prospect of Fed rate cuts. Just wondering, does that increase opportunities for the preferred and mezzanine business investments? Or are you guys kind of weighing more on the acquisition opportunity still.\nRylan Burns: Yes. As you can see from our activity to date, we've been very focused on acquiring high-quality fee simple ownership properties and not that's kind of our base case. We are open to the preferred and the mezz investments, and we are pursuing several. So it's not that we've shut that off. That's really a large portion historically of our mezz investments have come as a result of development opportunities. So as the development pipeline has slowed considerably in the past year. There's just fewer opportunities for us to deploy in the prep space. So we are open, and I think we're well known within our markets as being a great partner for that product, and so we will continue to pursue. But as a result of supply coming down and the new development starts coming down, there's just been fewer opportunities.\nConnor Mitchell: Okay, appreciate it. And then in the opening comments, I think it would discuss the strength of Seattle. It's seeing less of an impact from supply and some more return to office. Just wondering if you guys can give an outlook on those two items for the Seattle market going forward in the back half of the year?\nAngela Kleiman: Sure, thanks. Seattle is an interesting market in that it's one of our more evolving markets because of supply. And what's interesting here is we originally had expected Seattle to continue to outperform in the second half. But now the supply got pushed it's going to end up being an offset because Seattle last year in the second half had fallen quite a bit. And so it has this odd combination of easier year-over-year comp, but now more supply. So it probably often to something neutral and slightly better.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Kim : Thank you. I wanted to follow up a couple of times rather than mentioned cap rates in mid- to high 4% range and rent growth expectations Rylan, I think you mentioned with a lot the rents were 15% pre-COVID levels. Is that the level of rent growth that you and competitive buyers are looking at today on acquisitions?\nRylan Burns: Just for clarity, those rents are about 15% below pre-COVID levels, and we are not anticipating that snaps back tomorrow, but we know that given the strong income growth we've seen in this submarket as well as what we feel is coming through the COVID and slowdown in the tech market that the fundamental setup is attractive, and I wouldn't be surprised if we recovered those rent growth within several years. So that is a factor. As to what our peers are doing, we are seeing some assets trade that we're not -- we're staying disciplined on at levels that don't make a lot of sense to us. So I do think there are other participants in the market underwriting even more aggressive rent growth in some of these submarkets. So it's difficult to parse through exactly what our competitors are underwriting. But in general, it feels like there's been a lot of capital demand and excitement about Northern California, given the fundamental setup that we've been talking about for a couple of years now.\nJohn Kim: And it seems on this call, there's been a lot of discussion on pricing power and some favorable trends your rent-to-income ratios are improving in your markets, and it seems to be some of the lowest in the country. Should we think about renewal rates exceeding the 5% that you've been getting recently?\nAngela Kleiman: John, if we had reached our peak, then that would be more of a likelihood. But at this point, what we're seeing is renewal rates trending downward. And relative to the prior months, it's been gradual. So the good news is it's not a huge deceleration. But from June to July, it's about 30-ish basis point cell and renewal ultimately will converge toward market rent. So that will be possible if suddenly there's a massive amount of job growth and demand and that -- and then the market rents take off, but that's not a likely scenario that we are seeing at this point in time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David [indiscernible] with Essex Property Trust.\nUnidentified Analyst : Thank you. I was curious if you could provide some color on what is changing with the multifamily supply forecast and whether some deliveries are being pushed into next year. And to the extent that you can comment on the outlook for 2025 supply growth relative to this year. Thank you.\nBarb Pak: Yes, this is Barb. So in -- as it relates to our 2024 forecast for supply, some properties in really Southern California were delayed more than we thought. And it's about 2,700 units effectively were pushed into next year. And in Seattle, some of our delay adjustments were too hard and they're delivering this year. So we pushed up some of the Seattle supply by about 2,000. So there's net a small reduction to our supply for multifamily this year. And then as we look to next year, we think Southern California will be slightly higher because of the delays that occurred this year. Northern California will be pretty neutral to this year, San Jose up slightly, but offset by lower supply in Oakland and then Seattle pretty neutral. So overall, it's going to be up a little bit, but our forecast right now calls for supply to be very muted 50 basis points of total stock, similar to this year, so no material change.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. And I'm curious, how does the delinquency issues in your portfolio compared to the broader market? And to what degree could delinquencies and the rest of the market still create some overhang in terms of competition for newly listed units.\nAngela Kleiman: Yes, that's a good question. We have very little visibility when it comes to the broader market. The one thing that we can tell is that when the entire state of California was going through the -- started going through the delinquency process, the court had a huge backlog, and it took about 12 months to process it and now it's down less than six months. And that's been a direct correlation to our ability to recover delinquent units and the related improvement in that area. And so as we see this improvement continues and as Barb mentioned, it could be lumpy. But if you look at it over blocks of time, say, a three-month period, it has continued pretty steadily. It wouldn't -- it would be surprising for that delinquency to increase suddenly and it's extremely. Obviously, the core processing time is key. And so as long as that whole study, then we should be in good shape.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nWes Golladay: Hello everyone. Just want to talk about the developer environment right now on the West Coast. It's been a very tough cycle. Are you seeing any developers exit the market permanently?\nRylan Burns: Yes. I think there was news actually just last week of an Atlanta-based developer that's decided to pull out of the West Coast. And given this is not surprise to us given what we've long said is a very challenging environment to develop in. So we're aware of it. And to be honest, we're not that concerned, fewer developers means less competitive product in the near future and should create additional opportunities for Essex.\nWes Golladay: Yes, that's what I was kind of going with. I mean I think you mentioned you had a -- you're targeting 100 basis point spread versus acquisitions as I figured you might be able to develop more countercyclical at this time. Can you comment on where your spread would be today, how much further it has to go?\nRylan Burns: That estimate is current today. Again, it's all dependent on our fundamental outlook for the specific submarket where we can acquire land at a regional basis that can really drive the numbers. And then we're tracking hard costs very closely. So I'd say we're closer today than we've been in many years. We haven't started a new development in almost four years. And so -- we've been really disciplined. We know it's very challenging to effectively develop and create value for shareholders through that process. So we're going to continue to be very disciplined. But the company has a long history of stepping in at bottom of the cycle, and we are cautiously optimistic that we're going to be able to rebuild that pipeline in the near future.\nWes Golladay: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ami Probandt with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nAmi Probandt: Hi, thanks. Bad debt ticked up a bit in Southern California, excluding L.A. County. So I'm wondering if that's lumpiness or if you're seeing residents potentially having difficulty paying or potentially signs or resurgence and bad actors.\nBarb Pak: Yes, this is Barb. The numbers do bounce around month-to-month, that's why we tend not to like to publish the monthly numbers because there is noise every month. So we're not overly concerned about it, nothing to flag there. It's just monthly noise.\nAmi Probandt: Great. Thanks for confirming. And then in terms of move-outs, have there been any notable changes recently in reasons for move out?\nAngela Kleiman: This is Angela here. Our reasons to move-out has remained steady. It's mostly job changes or change in households and that's remained relatively consistent.\nAmi Probandt: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Angela for closing remarks.\nAngela Kleiman: Well, thank you all for joining the Essex call and for all your questions, and we look forward to seeing all of you real soon.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining Essex's second quarter earnings call. Our pack will follow with prepared remarks, and Rylan Burns is here for Q&A. We are pleased to report a strong second quarter, with core FFO per share exceeding the high end of our guidance range by $0.05. As a result, we have our second notable increase to our full-year guidance. Today, my comments will focus on underlying drivers to our outperformance and operational highlights, followed by an update on the investment market. Starting with operating fundamentals. Year-to-date, demand for West Coast multifamily housing has exceeded our expectations, particularly in Northern California and Seattle regions. While we've traditionally relied on the BLS to assess housing demand, the reported data have not correlated to the strength we're experiencing on the ground. As such, we've analyzed alternative demand indicators from third-party sources for better insights into the key drivers supporting housing demand. The first of these is job openings at the top 20 technology companies. In June, openings in the Essex markets totaled over 17,000 jobs, which represent a 150% increase from the 2023 trough. While we have yet to return to the historical average of 25,000 jobs, the steady improvement so far has generated incremental demand in our markets and is a good precursor of the recovery, particularly in Northern California and Seattle. Another factor contributing to West Coast housing demand is migration. Real-time data using Placer AI shows a gradual improvement in domestic migration patterns on the West Coast. This is illustrated on page S16.1 of our supplemental. This data suggests that workers are relocating back to the coastal headquarters, generating a shadow demand similar to a new job being added. Additionally, this year, Northern California has positive net domestic migration for the first time since pre-COVID. As for supply dynamics, limited new housing combined with favorable rental affordability continue to underpin our market fundamentals. For example, the rate of income growth has outpaced rent growth, which has improved affordability metrics in our markets. Additionally, it is 2.8 times more expensive to own than to rent in our markets today, compared to 1.7 times back in 2019 when interest rates were near the historical low. Even if mortgage rates were to revert back to the 2019 level, homeownership in our markets will still remain significantly less affordable than renting. Turning to property operations, we experienced a solid peak leasing season with blended rent growth for same property portfolio of 3.4% for the quarter. Blended rent growth would have been 4.5%, so 110 basis points higher if we exclude LA and Alameda, the two counties with elevated delinquency-related turnover. As for regional highlights, Seattle has been our best-performing market today, achieving a 4.9% blended rent growth while maintaining strong occupancy level of 97% in the second quarter. The east side, which has been less impacted by supply than the CBD, led this region with 5% blended rent growth. There are two key factors that contributed to this strong performance. First, relative to our other regions, Seattle has the strongest job growth. Second, the new supply has been less impactful as timing delays resulted in fewer deliveries in the first half of the year. These two factors have led to a prolonged seasonal peak, in that this market typically peaks around late June, but this year the peak occurred a month later, around the end of July. Northern California was our second best-performing region, achieving a 3.3% blended rent growth in the second quarter, an occupancy of 96.3%. San Mateo and San Jose were the notable outperformers at around 4% growth, with Alameda County pulling down the regional average by 80 basis points due to delinquency turnover and the continued elevated supply in Oakland. Generally, rents in this region peaked around early July, consistent with historical patterns. Lastly, Southern California continues to be a steady performer. We achieved 2.8% blended rent growth for the quarter, which would have been 200 basis points higher if we were to exclude LA. In similar fashion, Southern California's average occupancy of 95.7% for the quarter was tempered by Los Angeles, with all other markets at or above 96% occupancy. Excluding LA, Southern California's rents peaked in late July, consistent with historical patterns. As we begin the third quarter, our portfolio is well-positioned, with average concession of less than two days, and occupancy is healthy at 96.2%. We are prepared to shift to an occupancy strategy as appropriate, while maintaining the optionality to minimize rental growth. Finally, on the transaction market, in the second quarter, there was a significant increase in investor demand for well-located, newer multifamily properties on the West Coast. In contrast, the number of marketed properties for sale remained low. This combination has resulted in a highly competitive bidding process, and a compression in cap rates in some markets. Over the past few months, Essex has selectively procured three high-quality communities in the Bay area. All three of these investments have significant upside potential, based on the favorable fundamental backdrop and efficiencies from our operating platform. We are pleased with the progress to date, with over $500 million in acquisitions closed, and are optimistic more opportunities will arise in the near future. As always, we remain disciplined and focus on maximizing shareholder value and enhancing the growth profile of the company. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barb. Hey, Austin. Good to hear from you. This is more in line with our approach to address seasonality in our business, and so typically as we approach the seasonal peak, we would push on rents, and now as we shift toward the seasonal, you know, slower time of demand, we start to migrate toward occupancy, ultimately, the goal is to maximize revenues. So it's not so much of anything we're seeing that is, you know, any red flags on the fundamentals. It's more of how we normally run our business to maximize rents and revenue. First thing, so on the new lease rates, net effect new lease rates, we are seeing Southern California holding steady, slight deceleration, but, you know, nothing material like 10, 20 basis points. Northern California is the more deceleration, about 200 basis points, and then Seattle about 50 to 60 basis points of deceleration. And once again, on the new lease, you know, activity here, it's pretty much what we had expected. There's nothing here that's giving us any alarm. This is normal business, you know, with us. Normally, Northern California peaks earlier than Southern California, and so this is on plan. That's a great question, Eric [ph]. We are not quite there on LA Alameda in terms of our operating strategy. We pretty much ran a occupancy-focused strategy starting late last year that has continued throughout the year. We've been able to kind of switch back and forth a little bit, but it really didn't last long. At this point, we made really good progress on delinquency, and essentially, it improved by almost 50%. We reduced by another 50% from beginning of the year, so we're making good traction there. We probably will not be able to have pricing power until we get through the rest of this year in LA and Alameda. Yes. We have that detail, concessions. So generally speaking, so Southern California has a heavier concession in L.A. for the most part, no surprise there. And Northern California concession environment is driven primarily by Oakland because of the higher -- the elevated supply. And so Southern California DQ with L.A. and Northern California, Oakland with supply. And those are the two primary drivers of higher concession levels. But ultimately, we're talking about, say, closer to for five days in those areas versus rest of the region where Seattle has essentially zero and everywhere else around one to two days. So that averages to the two days in July. Yes, for sending out renewals at around low 4% portfolio-wide. And based on the negotiations that we're seeing, we'll probably land somewhere between mid-3s to high 3s on the renewal side. That's a great question. Well, let's start with -- we have expected that full year our blended rents will be about 2.7%. And we achieved 2.9% in the first half. So there's an implied deceleration about 35 to 40 basis points and this is actually quite moderate. It's not seem to be nothing to be concerned about. But aside from what's going on out there in the political realm, the key drivers to our anticipation is really that we have tougher year-over-year comps. So last year, our seasonal peak actually occurred one to two months later, Northern California, a month later and Southern California two months later. And so that tougher year-over-year comp is a primary driver. And then the secondary factor is the renewals ultimately will converge toward market rate over time, and that's normal. That's a great question, Brad. I think that's going to depend on demand. So how quickly do we see job acceleration as we return back to that normal state to the pre-COVID level. And so fortunately, for us, we don't need much, right, given such low level of supply and which is one of the reasons we've been able to produce solid results, even though we are in a low demand growth environment. But the magnitude, if we're talking about, will be really dependent on job growth. Haendel, that's a great question. Ultimately, we're seeing pricing power and that's translating to our outperformance and you've seen us raise guidance twice and primarily driven by demand because we've always seen that having that low supply environment, we're in a really good position here. As far as where that's going to land, it's hard to say because it depends on the weight of the return. And so just to give you some data points, during COVID, about 400,000 people migrated out of our markets. And what's interesting is the majority of the out migration was to tertiary markets within Washington and California. And so say about a third, 35% of them actually went out to the Sun Belt and East Coast. And so what we're seeing right now is about 1.25 of that has returned. So about 100,000 has come back. And it's generally in line with that proportion of one-third out of Washington and California and two-thirds within the tertiary markets. So there's still some legs here. The question here is when and how much. And that is -- we just don't have enough visibility on the timing about that one. Sure, Haendel. For you, yes, you could squeeze another one in. So July loss is about 2%. And so it's certainly a good position, especially when we compare to last year July, it's a 50 basis point improvement. Last year, July was only at 1.6%. So things are moving in the right direction. It's Angela. The best indication of new supply competition is looking at our concessionary activities. And with where we are today at two days and the concessionary environment has progressively improved over the past six months. We certainly are not seeing competition from the single-family side. Sure, thanks. Seattle is an interesting market in that it's one of our more evolving markets because of supply. And what's interesting here is we originally had expected Seattle to continue to outperform in the second half. But now the supply got pushed it's going to end up being an offset because Seattle last year in the second half had fallen quite a bit. And so it has this odd combination of easier year-over-year comp, but now more supply. So it probably often to something neutral and slightly better. John, if we had reached our peak, then that would be more of a likelihood. But at this point, what we're seeing is renewal rates trending downward. And relative to the prior months, it's been gradual. So the good news is it's not a huge deceleration. But from June to July, it's about 30-ish basis point cell and renewal ultimately will converge toward market rent. So that will be possible if suddenly there's a massive amount of job growth and demand and that -- and then the market rents take off, but that's not a likely scenario that we are seeing at this point in time. Yes, that's a good question. We have very little visibility when it comes to the broader market. The one thing that we can tell is that when the entire state of California was going through the -- started going through the delinquency process, the court had a huge backlog, and it took about 12 months to process it and now it's down less than six months. And that's been a direct correlation to our ability to recover delinquent units and the related improvement in that area. And so as we see this improvement continues and as Barb mentioned, it could be lumpy. But if you look at it over blocks of time, say, a three-month period, it has continued pretty steadily. It wouldn't -- it would be surprising for that delinquency to increase suddenly and it's extremely. Obviously, the core processing time is key. And so as long as that whole study, then we should be in good shape. This is Angela here. Our reasons to move-out has remained steady. It's mostly job changes or change in households and that's remained relatively consistent. Well, thank you all for joining the Essex call and for all your questions, and we look forward to seeing all of you real soon."

            "name": "Barb Pak",
            "content": "Thanks, Angela. I'll begin with comments on our second quarter results, followed by the key components of our full year guidance raise, and conclude with an update on the balance sheet. Beginning with our second quarter results, we are pleased to report core FFO per share of $3.94, which exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.11. The outperformance was primarily driven by $0.05 of higher same-property revenues, which was largely the result of stronger net effect of rent growth. In addition, this quarter benefited from $0.04 of one-time revenues and lower operating expenses, which are timing related. Turning to our full year guidance revision, our strong second quarter results and healthy peak leasing season have enabled us to increase the midpoint of our same property revenue growth by 75 basis points to 3%. Our improved outlook is largely driven by blended rent growth outpacing our initial forecast, resulting in a 50 basis points increase to revenue growth. We now forecast blended rent growth to be 120 basis points higher than our initial forecast, driven by outperformance in Northern California and Seattle. As for same property operating expenses, higher utility costs and legal fees are the primary drivers of the 50 basis points increase in our midpoint to 4.75%. As it relates to controllable expenses, we have been effective in managing this aspect of the business despite the elevated cost environment. For the year, we expect controllable expenses to increase less than 3%. In total, we now expect same property NOI to grow by 2.3% at the midpoint, representing a 90 basis points improvement to our prior guidance and 170 basis points improvement from our initial outlook. Based on our strong second quarter results and the revision to same-property growth, we are raising full-year core FFO by $0.27 to $15.50 per share, which represents 3.1% year-over-year growth. In total, we've raised core FFO a notable $0.47 per share so far this year. As it relates to our third quarter guidance, we are forecasting $3.87 at the midpoint. The sequential decline from the second quarter relates to two factors. First, same-property NOI is expected to be $0.05 lower, which is driven by elevated operating expenses given the typical seasonality and spending for repairs and maintenance, taxes and utilities. And second, we had $0.02 of one-time items in the second quarter. Turning to the preferred equity portfolio. For the year, we expect between $125 million to $175 million in redemptions, of which we received $50 million to date. Our intention is to redeploy the proceeds into acquisitions depending on market opportunities. In terms of the watch list, we started the year with five properties on the list, of which three have been removed so far to date. Two of the properties were acquired and consolidated on our financials, and one of the investments had a significant equity infusion, which puts us in a better position in the capital stack. In total, the reduction in the watch list added approximately $0.04 to our full-year core FFO. The rest of the portfolio is performing as planned. Finally, our balance sheet metrics remain a key source of strength. We have no remaining consolidated maturities in 2024, our leverage levels remain healthy with net debt to EBITDA at 5.4 times, and we have over $1 billion in available liquidity. As such, we are well-positioned to capitalize on opportunities as they arise. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions. Hi, Nick. It's Barb. Yes, our guidance has about 1% baked into the rest of the year. Remember, the number can bounce around month to month, but we're pleased with the progress that we've made so far and feel comfortable that we'll continue to make progress. If we do make more progress in the 80 basis points, I'll just be upside to the high end or be to the high end of the guidance range. Yes, this is Barb. It is a difficult number to predict because it does bounce around month to month, and we are pleased with the progress. Keep in mind, we did take that -- we did increase our guidance in the first quarter by 40 basis points because we did lower bad debt to 1.1% for the full year. And through July, we are at 1.1% year-to-date. So we're in line with our forecast. And we do expect -- we're working hard to make progress, but it does depend on when tenants leave and when the courts process evictions. And so it's a little out of our control. So we've got 1% budgeted in the back half of the year. Yes. This is Barb. Yes, there's a lot of factors that go into it. And at the low end, it just does depend on how steep the decline is in the back half of the year in terms of the peak leasing season. We expect a normal season, but we've seen air pockets in the past. And so that factors into the low end, and that could impact occupancy and concessions. And then delinquency has been a wild card. It feels like it's less of a wildcard this year. But once again, that is something where we've seen blips every now and then. And so those are the factors that really led to the low end where it is. But we feel very comfortable with where our midpoint is at this point. Yes. It's most of the timing on the preferred redemption. So we've got $50 million to date. Most of that occurred in July. And then the rest of it is slated for beginning of the -- end of the third quarter, beginning of the fourth quarter. So we'll see the biggest impact from those redemptions then, and that's what's causing that anomaly. Yes. This is Barb. And I might have to follow up after with the puts and takes on that. What I will tell you is that on the two investments that we didn't acquire and we had preferred equity on, there was -- we originally forecasted in our guidance for 2024, no FFO impact. And so by buying them out, we actually gained about $0.01 for this year in terms of core FFO because we didn't have any preferred equity income baked into the model given they were on the watch list and given where values were at the end of last year, we took a conservative approach on accruing on those two. And so net-net, it did add about $0.01. So -- but I can follow up with you after and go through the NOI and the other various metrics. Yes, this is Barb. So in -- as it relates to our 2024 forecast for supply, some properties in really Southern California were delayed more than we thought. And it's about 2,700 units effectively were pushed into next year. And in Seattle, some of our delay adjustments were too hard and they're delivering this year. So we pushed up some of the Seattle supply by about 2,000. So there's net a small reduction to our supply for multifamily this year. And then as we look to next year, we think Southern California will be slightly higher because of the delays that occurred this year. Northern California will be pretty neutral to this year, San Jose up slightly, but offset by lower supply in Oakland and then Seattle pretty neutral. So overall, it's going to be up a little bit, but our forecast right now calls for supply to be very muted 50 basis points of total stock, similar to this year, so no material change. Yes, this is Barb. The numbers do bounce around month-to-month, that's why we tend not to like to publish the monthly numbers because there is noise every month. So we're not overly concerned about it, nothing to flag there. It's just monthly noise."

            "name": "Rylan Burns",
            "content": "Yes. This is Rylan here. It's a good question. I'd say working in our favor, we've started to see hard costs come down a little bit from a year ago. The vast majority of development that we underwrite, however, does not meet our return expectations. We're looking for a significant premium to where we can go purchase today given the risk inherent in development. But I would say the trends are favorable, and we are pursuing several opportunities that could lead to an increase in our development pipeline in the near future. Yes, it's case-by-case dependent, but a general rule would be in our markets today for a shovel-ready site entitlements. We'd be looking for at least 100 basis point spread to where we can go and buy a comparable product. Hi, Haendel, this is Rylan here. Several questions in there. So if I forget one, please follow up. But in general, we've seen volumes pick up in the second quarter compared to a year ago as well as the first quarter. Cap rates are fairly consistent across our markets for high-quality, well-located buildings in the mid- to high 4 cap range. So we are looking for unique opportunities that we can put it onto our operating platform and generate some additional accretion just from operating a little bit more efficiently. We're always looking for ways that potentially can add incremental yield on the top line. So we are, again, pretty excited about the investments we're able to make in the second quarter. The one that was noted at the Elan was a high 4 cap. We're expecting some additional benefit from putting it onto our operating platform. This is a building probably 20% discount to replacement cost and with rents that are about 15% low pre-COVID levels. So those -- given our fundamental outlook for some of these submarkets, if we can find more opportunities like that, we will pursue as we have always aggressively but with great discipline as well. Yes, I don't want to provide too much detail just for competitive reasons, but back of the envelope math would suggest that these are above 8. Jamie, yes, that's a fair question. I mean, at a high level, we believe the -- the cost of Hawkins regulations coming up this November. Again, we can go into some more detail. But historically, that has been resoundingly defeated and there's our base case that, that is going to happen again this year. Now we will look at -- there are specific submarkets that have rent control and that occasion will propose specific rent control, and we'll certainly factor that into our rent growth assumptions. But at a high level, our expectation is driven by our economic research model, and we are not anticipating any change to statewide rent regulation in the near term. Assets, it's all on a case-by-case basis, but that's certainly feasible. And given AB-1482 that is certainly achievable. So we know that that's certainly possible. I would say, a possibility that is not our base case typically when we're looking at these market rent growth, we are thinking over the long term. And so they're closer to our long-term averages. And then in some instances, where again, some submarkets in Northern California where the affordability metrics, the future look on supply as well as some positive traction we're seeing in terms of potential demand. Those are the types of investments where we might be a little bit more aggressive in the near term as a catch-up on rent. It's certainly something that we're evaluating. We've seen much fewer transactions in the urban core across our markets, but they're starting to see some more product come to market, and that's something that we're certainly evaluating. Again, the majority of our portfolio located in great suburban markets near transportation nodes. That's kind of our bread and butter, but we will look at anything and everything has a price. So we are excited to potentially see some more opportunities throughout all of our markets in the coming quarters. Yes. As you can see from our activity to date, we've been very focused on acquiring high-quality fee simple ownership properties and not that's kind of our base case. We are open to the preferred and the mezz investments, and we are pursuing several. So it's not that we've shut that off. That's really a large portion historically of our mezz investments have come as a result of development opportunities. So as the development pipeline has slowed considerably in the past year. There's just fewer opportunities for us to deploy in the prep space. So we are open, and I think we're well known within our markets as being a great partner for that product, and so we will continue to pursue. But as a result of supply coming down and the new development starts coming down, there's just been fewer opportunities. Just for clarity, those rents are about 15% below pre-COVID levels, and we are not anticipating that snaps back tomorrow, but we know that given the strong income growth we've seen in this submarket as well as what we feel is coming through the COVID and slowdown in the tech market that the fundamental setup is attractive, and I wouldn't be surprised if we recovered those rent growth within several years. So that is a factor. As to what our peers are doing, we are seeing some assets trade that we're not -- we're staying disciplined on at levels that don't make a lot of sense to us. So I do think there are other participants in the market underwriting even more aggressive rent growth in some of these submarkets. So it's difficult to parse through exactly what our competitors are underwriting. But in general, it feels like there's been a lot of capital demand and excitement about Northern California, given the fundamental setup that we've been talking about for a couple of years now. Yes. I think there was news actually just last week of an Atlanta-based developer that's decided to pull out of the West Coast. And given this is not surprise to us given what we've long said is a very challenging environment to develop in. So we're aware of it. And to be honest, we're not that concerned, fewer developers means less competitive product in the near future and should create additional opportunities for Essex. That estimate is current today. Again, it's all dependent on our fundamental outlook for the specific submarket where we can acquire land at a regional basis that can really drive the numbers. And then we're tracking hard costs very closely. So I'd say we're closer today than we've been in many years. We haven't started a new development in almost four years. And so -- we've been really disciplined. We know it's very challenging to effectively develop and create value for shareholders through that process. So we're going to continue to be very disciplined. But the company has a long history of stepping in at bottom of the cycle, and we are cautiously optimistic that we're going to be able to rebuild that pipeline in the near future."

As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. \n Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found on the company's filings with the SEC. \n It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Angela Kleiman, President and Chief Executive Officer; for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Ms. Kleiman. You may begin. \nAngela Kleiman: Good morning, and thank you for joining Essex's first quarter earnings call. Barb Park will follow with prepared remarks and Rylan Burns is here for Q&A. \n We are pleased to kick off our 2024 earnings with a notable increase in our full year guidance. This is primarily driven by solid first quarter results with core FFO per share of 4.9%, exceeding the high end of our original guidance. Barb will provide more details on our financial performance in a moment.\n Today, my comments will focus on market fundamentals and operational highlights, followed by an update on the investment market. Heading into 2024, consensus forecast was a slowdown for the U.S. and so far, U.S. job growth has trended better than initial forecast. Job quality, on the other hand, has been concentrated in government and low-wage service sectors. \n In the West Coast, the tech industry is a primary source of high-paying jobs and job growth in this industry has led because of evolving business strategies as companies reallocate resources to artificial intelligence opportunities. However, we have seen encouraging signs, including a steady increase in job openings in our markets by the top 20 tech companies. As for our near-term outlook, recent information data and Fed commentary have resulted in elevated uncertainty regarding the path of interest rate cuts. \n With this in mind, we do not anticipate an imminent improvement in job growth in the high-paying sectors, which is typically the key catalyst to accelerate demand for housing and rent growth. While job growth on the West Coast has remained soft. Our steady performance year-to-date is attributed to 2 factors: first, limited housing supply. This is a significant structural benefit and a pillar of our California investment thesis.\n Lengthy and costly entitlement process effectively deters housing supply. To this point, total housing permits as a percentage of stock continues to remain well below 1% in Essex, California markets. Our performance today demonstrates this supply advantage. It is a key stabilizer during soft demand periods and a driver of rent growth outcomes over the long term. \n The second positive factor is rental affordability which is driven by wages growing faster than rents in FX markets. Additionally, the cost of homeownership continues to rise. The median cost of owning a home is 2.5x more expensive than renting in our markets. Likewise, the percentage of our turnover attributed to purchasing a home has fallen from around 12% historically to 5% today. Accordingly, rental affordability supports a long runway for rent growth in the FX markets.\n Turning to first quarter operations. We achieved a 2.2% growth in blended lease rates, which consists of 10 basis points on new leases and 3.9% on renewals. Our new lease rates are tempered by delinquency-related turnover in LA and Alameda, which comprise of approximately 25% of our total same-store portfolio. If we excluded these 2 regions, new lease rates would have been 150 basis points higher at 1.6%. \n Moving on to regional highlights. Seattle was our best-performing region, achieving blended rates of 3.6% with new lease rate growth of 1.3%.  New lease rates turned positive in February, led by the east side and the positive trend has continued. Northern California was our second best performing region with 2.1% blended rate growth and flat new lease rates. San Mateo was our strongest market, offset by the east side, which remained challenged, primarily from delinquency impact in Alameda County. Excluding Alameda County, new lease rates in Northern California would have been 70 basis points. \n As for Southern California, this region continues to be a steady performer, generating blended rate growth of 1.7%, with negative 30 basis points in new lease rates caused by delinquency in Los Angeles. Excluding Los Angeles, average new lease rates would have been positive 3.1% in Southern California. Along with the improvement in eviction processing time, our operations and support teams have done an excellent job recovering long-term delinquent units at a faster pace, which has led to lower delinquency. We welcome this trend and continue to proactively build occupancy in anticipation of recapturing more units in this region. We view this temporary trade-off as net beneficial to long-term revenue growth.\n As for current operating conditions, at the end of April, we are in a solid position with 96% occupancy heading into peak leasing season. Concessions for the portfolio averaged only 3.5 days. And aside from areas with delinquency headwinds discussed earlier, we see opportunities to increase rental rates throughout our portfolio.\n Lastly on the  transaction market. Deal volume remains thin compared to recent years, and we continue to see strong investor demand for multifamily properties in our markets. with cap rates ranging from mid-4% for core to mid 5% for value-add communities. Against this backdrop of limited transaction volume, we have created external growth opportunities, generating FFO and NAV per share accretion through our joint venture platform. \n In the first quarter, we purchased our partner's interest in a $505 million joint venture portfolio that will produce almost $2 million of FFO accretion for us in 2024. In fact , since inception, our private equity platform has delivered a 20% IRR and over $160 million to promote income for our shareholders and remains an attractive alternative source of capital. \n In conclusion, we intend to pursue growth through acquisitions while maintaining our disciplined capital allocation strategy and our core principle of generating accretion to create significant value for our shareholders.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to Barb. \nBarb Pak: Thanks, Angela. I'll begin with comments on our first quarter results, provide an update on key changes to our full year guidance followed by comments on investment activities, capital markets and the balance sheet. I'm pleased to report core FFO per share exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.09 in the first quarter. The outperformance was primarily driven by higher same-property revenue growth, which accounted for $0.06 of the $0.09 [ beat ]. The first quarter also benefited from onetime lease termination fees within our commercial portfolio totaling $0.02, which are not expected to reoccur for the remainder of the year. \n Turning to our full year guidance revisions. As a result of the strong start to the year, we are increasing the midpoint of same-property revenue growth by 55 basis points to 2.25%. The increase is driven by 2 factors: First, delinquency has improved faster than our original expectations, which accounts for 40 basis points of the revision. We now project delinquency to be 1.1% of scheduled rent for the year. \n The second factor relates to higher other income as we have been successful at optimizing our portfolio through various initiatives, which has led to 15 basis points of better growth. While we are trending slightly ahead of our expectations on blended lease growth so far this year, especially on renewals, we have not factored any revision into our guidance as we want to get further into peak leasing season when we sign the bulk of our leases. \n The other key driver of our full year guidance revision relates to the consolidation of our partnership in the BEXAEW joint venture, which accounts for $0.03 of FFO accretion. And as Angela highlighted, this acquisition reinforces the value Essex has created for shareholders through our joint venture platform as well as our ability to grow externally in an otherwise challenging market. In total, we are raising core FFO by $0.20 per share, a 1.3% increase at the midpoint.\n Turning to our preferred equity investments. Subsequent to quarter end, we assume the sponsor's common equity interest affiliated with a preferred equity investment. This investment was previously on our watch list and was placed on nonaccrual status in the fourth quarter of 2023. As such, this transaction is beneficial to our 2024 core FFO forecast. The property is located adjacent to an existing Essex community, which will allow us to operate it efficiently within our collections model. Overall, we view the outcome favorably given that quality of the asset, our initial yield and our long-term view on the growth in the Sunnyvale submarket.\n Turning to Capital Markets. In March, we issued $350 million in 10-year unsecured bonds to refinance the last remaining portion of the company's 2024 debt maturities and to partially fund the BEXAEW transaction. We are pleased to have locked in 5.5% fixed rate debt in today's volatile interest rate environment.\n As it relates to equity, the company did not issue common stock to fund our year-to-date investments nor do we plan to issue equity at our current stock price. We have alternative sources of equity capital, such as retained cash flow and preferred equity redemption proceeds from last year and expected this year that can fund up to $400 million in investments, including transactions completed to date without the need for new equity.\n We will continue to look at all our sources of equity capital, including disposition proceeds or joint ventures in order to maximize growth in core FFO and NAV per share while preserving our balance sheet strength. We have been prudent stewards of shareholder capital over our 30-year history, which has served our shareholders well. \n In conclusion, Essex is in a strong financial position. Our leverage levels remain healthy with net debt-to-EBITDA at 5.4x, and we have over $1 billion in available liquidity. As such, we are well equipped to act as opportunities arise. \n I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. \nAustin Wurschmidt: You guys flagged the impacted select submarkets are having on your new lease rate growth this year, but I'm just curious if that overhang has been lifted in L.A. and Alameda or if you think that the continued improvement in sort of the long-term delinquency continues to have an impact or impacts others in the market, and you could continue to see kind of that weighing on -- are those markets weighing on new lease rate growth moving forward? \nAngela Kleiman: Austin, it's Angela here. You kind of cracked up in the earlier part of the question, but I believe you're asking whether the LA Alameda overhang is going to continue on new lease rates? \nAustin Wurschmidt: Yes, that's correct. \nAngela Kleiman: Okay. Great. What we're expecting is that L.A. is going to continue to provide -- be an overhang on the delinquency. Alameda improvement is steady, and it's a smaller part of our portfolio. So the heavier influence is really coming from L.A. just because when you have such a large volume that we're working through, it's going to take a longer period of time. The good news is that we are not seeing that bleeding into other markets. So it's really more focused in L.A. and our other markets are doing quite well. \nAustin Wurschmidt: So how should we think about, I guess, when you guys underwrote at the beginning of the year, you had a relatively tight spread in your new versus renewal lease rates. You flagged renewals are trending better, but that's been a little bit volatile, which I suspect is due to some factors on the comp month by month. But can you just give us a sense of or kind of updated thoughts on how you think the 2 of those trend from here? \nAngela Kleiman: Yes, sure thing. No, we have not reforecasted yet just because it is important to see how peak leasing season activities progress and because that's where the bulk of our leases occur at that point in time. So our data is with a few months into the year and a smaller set of leasing terms is turning. It's more limited. But having said that, what we're seeing right now is that Seattle and Northern California are trending slightly ahead of our original market rent forecast. Southern California is generally planned, but there is an LA drag.  \n And so because it's not a huge outperformance relative to plan at this point. The outperformance is really mostly in the benefits from delinquency that we're getting the -- recovering the units much faster in other income, it's once again, it's just too early to try to reforecast where market rents is going to be. I do want to say that with our performance on delinquency and our ability to essentially turn those units quickly. It speaks to the underlying fundamentals of our market, so that is quite solid. \nAustin Wurschmidt: Maybe more specifically, I mean trying to get to this in the question a little bit, but can you just give us a sense where renewals are going out for the next couple of months? That would be helpful. And then that's all for me. \nAngela Kleiman: Sure thing. So renewal rates for, say, May and June, they're going out in kind of that low to mid-4% range. They average for the portfolio around 4.3%. And we do -- there is some negotiations there. And what we try to do is anticipate where the market is going to be. And because we are seeing that we are trending slightly ahead, we, of course, are going to push renewals wherever possible. But keep in mind, our approach on renewals is still same as before. We are setting market appropriate pricing and with the goal of maximizing revenues. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. \nDaniel Tricarico: It's Daniel Tricarico on with Nick. Angela, you talked about the jobs backdrop in your prepared remarks. I was wondering if you could expand on the tech hiring trends in your markets? Are you seeing any green shoots from AI companies starting to take office space? Or general tech companies more active in return to work. Just want to understand the current state of the demand backdrop that many are hoping, obviously, including yourselves to drive an acceleration in the recovery within the Northern California and even Seattle markets. \nAngela Kleiman: Daniel, it's a good question there. We are seeing anecdotally hybrid workers moving closer to the office to essentially trying to reduce the commute because traffic has picked up. And -- we are seeing also the top 20 tech openings increasing, although it's very gradual. And so what we're seeing is that these job openings bottomed last year during the first quarter, and the opening was only about, say, 8,000 jobs. Today, in March, it's about 16,000 jobs. So it doubled but it is well below our pre-COVID average. The 3-year run rate was about 25,000.\n So hopefully, that gives you some sense of how things -- what we're seeing is that the fundamentals are moving in the right direction. But in order for acceleration to occur, we really need to see a more robust pickup on the high-paying jobs. And we do believe that we have the fundamental backdrop for that to occur. It just it's all about when, and that's the big question on our mind. \nDaniel Tricarico: Yes. I wanted to follow up on the Seattle market. It saw a nice sequential increase in occupancy and revenues in Q1. Could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing throughout the different submarkets, maybe give a breakdown of your portfolio, urban versus suburban exposure? And where you're expecting to see the greatest magnitude and timing of new supply in that market? \nAngela Kleiman: Sure thing, Daniel. We are predominantly in -- on the east side, so over 60% of our portfolio is more suburban in nature and the east side. And what that means is because supply is predominantly in the CBD, we are more insulated from that. And we -- so we're seeing much better activities coming from the east side of our portfolio. And where things are trending right now, we are seeing some demand -- some demand growth, which is healthy, which is a good indicator at this point.\n Downtown seems to be doing okay. It's holding its own. And what we expect is the cadence of supply to occur some more time between now and next quarter in terms of the bulk of the delivery. But as we've all experienced in this market that can get slightly pushed by a month or 2 in our markets, but that's what we're expecting at this point in time. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Wolfe with Citi. \nNicholas Joseph: It's Nick here with Eric. Angela, you mentioned kind of what's happening in L.A. and the overhang and kind of getting the units back, which obviously is a good thing, medium and longer term. Just curious if you've changed the underwriting in that market specifically to make sure you're rented to tenants that are going to be paying the rent? \nAngela Kleiman: Nick, Rylan will talk about how we're underwriting activities in our various markets, including L.A. \nRylan Burns: Nick, I think there's a higher degree of caution as it relates to what we're seeing in L.A. Thankfully, a double edge or we have a lot of exposure to that market. So I think we have pretty good data. And as we've shown over the past year or 2, we know how we are turning these delinquent units back into rent paying units and how quickly that can occur. So I feel like we've got pretty nuanced underwriting as it relates to L.A. market, but it is something that we're certainly factoring in. \nAngela Kleiman: Yes, Nick. And as it relates to the actual tenant underwriting itself for leasing activities, we have not needed to make any material change. Obviously, from building to building, there are always nuances and the tenant background and credit. We set a very solid bar for our credit. What has happened with delinquency really is not related to our underwriting. It's really a legislation result because eviction moratorium went on for so long. And then all the courts are backed up in terms of processing these evictions which is why the whole time line to get out these nonpaying tenants became prolonged. And so in terms of -- if you're talking about, say, new tenants going delinquent, we're not seeing that as a material problem at all. \nNicholas Joseph: Okay. Yes. That's exactly what I was asking about. So you're not seeing anything from new tenants? This is definitely more of a residual of what you've seen before because it seems like the bad debt has certainly been improving pretty rapidly recently. It feels like April was even better than the first quarter. \nAngela Kleiman: Yes, that's correct, Nick. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. \nAlexander Goldfarb: Angela, just going back a few questions back to the demand and jobs and tech jobs. What do you think is more the reason for this if tech is still sort of sluggish on the hiring front, would you say it's more about sort of markets returning to normalcy more about people, let's say, in Southern Cal enjoying that lifestyle? Or is this really just a function of housing shortage. And we can talk about all these other factors, but the reality is the lack of housing, the single-family slowdown, meaning since the credit crisis, the shortage, that's really the dominant driver. And therefore, all these other items that we talk about are sort of on the margin, but it's really the housing shortage that's driving the stronger-than-expected recovery in apartments. \nAngela Kleiman: Alex, that is an excellent point and, good job. You've been paying attention. What we are seeing is that the supply definitely is a significant benefit for our markets, and it's something that we've been stating for several years now, in that we don't need much demand for us to achieve our plan and to have a healthy performing market. And so these other incremental benefits are great signs in terms of whether it's moving a return to office.  \n We are seeing continued improvements in both domestic and international migration and in fact, we're showing a positive population growth for the first time in 3 years. So all these little anecdotal data on the margin is hopeful. But in terms of really driving acceleration, the other -- the high-paying job growth will need to kick in. But our markets are going to do just fine. \nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then the second question is just an update on the whole -- you have a third attempt on overturning Costa-Hawkins sort of, I guess, 6 months out. Is there a sense for -- what's the sense on the advocacy front, where both sides stand. And obviously, Gavin Newsom has been big into promoting new housing. But are there major political forces coming out in support of low returning Costa-Hawkins? Or the majority of the political might out of Sacramento is supporting -- keeping Costa-Hawkins against the ballot initiative? \nAngela Kleiman: Alex, that is an important question. What we are seeing is the vast majority of the legislature are not supporting overturning Costa-Hawkins. So they're on our side. And because they recognize, especially in our market, we have an acute shortage of housing. And so that is not -- that is an antigrowth initiative. We have maintained our coalition to support reasonable legislation and especially relating to housing. And of course, this proposal has been defeated overwhelmingly twice, and we just have not seen anything that shows that will be different this time. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. \nJames Feldman: If we ran our numbers right, it looks like your new lease rate growth was flat or even slightly declined month-over-month from March to April. So I guess first question, is that correct? And secondly, if it is correct, we're just wondering what drove the lower acceleration? And how do you expect that to trend into May? \nBarb Pak: Jamie, it's Barb. Yes, that's really driven by L.A. and Alameda between March and April. And once again, it's delinquency-related challenges which is ultimately a benefit to our revenues because we get those units back and can lease into a rent-paying tenant. And -- but if you pull out those 2, we did see a sequential increase. So I think it was primarily just driven by L.A. Alameda. \nJames Feldman: Okay. And then Secondly, the acquisition in your JV in the quarter seemed like a great opportunity. You didn't have to reassess your tax basis, you already had majority ownership. Can you just talk about the opportunities to continue doing deals like that? And then also just more broadly, I thought your comments on the transaction market were pretty interesting. I think you said 4.5% core cap rates. Can you just talk more about what's going on in the transaction market in terms of buyer interest? I think a lot of your peers have said things have pretty much taken a pause. So curious what you're seeing on the ground and your thoughts on putting capital to work. \nRylan Burns: Jamie, Rylan here. On the first point, we do have significant opportunities to continue to acquire from our joint venture partnerships. What we are going to do, however, is try to make the best capital allocation decision we can at any given point in time. So at the start of this year, this was a joint venture that was maturing, and we had the opportunity to purchase our partner's interest and it made sense. It was accretive for our shareholders, and that's why we decided to elect that route.\n So we have a pretty deep joint venture business that we can continue to look for opportunities, but we are not solely focused on one or the other. We're trying to find the highest and best returning investments that we can find.\n As it relates to the transaction market, I think what you've been hearing is generally correct. The volumes continue to be very low as they were all of last year approximately 1/5 of the transaction volumes we saw in '21 and '22. What we're seeing this year is there was an ample amount of capital looking to be put to work in particular, from our focus on the West Coast in multifamily. So there's a bit of a scarcity premium for well-located suburban product that's coming to market.\n And so you are seeing very competitive bidding pools for the few transactions that have made it to market. And our expectation is that, that is going to continue. So we're tracking a couple of deals right now. We have very deep bidder pools, both levered and unlevered buyers and I think some of our public investors would be surprised at where these transaction cap rates are going to come out. So more to come there. \nJames Feldman: Great. Does that motivate you to sell more? \nRylan Burns: It's certainly something we're considering. Again, we are trying to grow the portfolio, but we need to be cautious about where we where our highest and best use of capital can be. So we have both opportunities that we are evaluating. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America. \nJoshua Dennerlein: I want to go back to your comments, Angela, about where you're sending out May and June renewals. It sounded like mid to low 4s. If I recall correctly on the last call, 4Q, I think renewals, your guidance was assuming like a slowing to like market rent growth, like the 1.25%. Is this kind of what was expected in guidance? Or is that ahead of schedule? And just like how should we think about like the cadence for the rest of the year? \nAngela Kleiman: Josh, we are slightly ahead of schedule. And what we haven't done is because we have not reforecasted, it's a little too early to talk about the actual cadence. And -- but I will say that we're ahead of schedule everywhere else except for L.A. and Alameda. So I do want to caveat that. But the things are doing fine right now. \nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. And what's your -- could you remind us what your typical like negotiation spread is on those renewals, they come back to you, they're signed before you send them out? \nAngela Kleiman: Yes, it could range anywhere from 0 depending on market strength to, say, close to 100 basis points depending on what else is going on. It could be supply, it could be jobs environment, a whole host of things. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. \nHaendel St. Juste: A couple of quick ones for me. I guess, first of all, I'm curious, if there's any remaining benefit to your renewal rates from the burn off of concessions? Or is that a tailwind that's now behind us? \nAngela Kleiman: Haendel, there's a little bit in May and then no more in June and July. \nHaendel St. Juste: Okay. And where is the overall loss and lease of the portfolio today? And maybe if you could break that down by region? \nAngela Kleiman: Sure thing. So loss to lease for the Essex portfolio in April is about 20 basis points. So nothing exciting there once again. But keep in mind, we have a L.A-Alameda overhang. So if you exclude L.A. Alameda. Loss to lease will be a little over 1%. And just to compare to last year, around April, loss lease was 80 basis points. So absent of L.A. Alameda, things are looking slightly better. We're not talking about massive acceleration, but it is slightly better. So in terms of just the disbursement, Seattle has the best loss lease at about 80 basis points; Northern California, about 10 basis points; and Southern California about 10 basis points. So that gives you kind of the range where things stand. \nHaendel St. Juste: I appreciate the color. And then last one, just on the -- maybe talking about the health of the mezz book, I think you put 2 loans on watch list last quarter. So maybe talk about your -- the book or your perception of the credit risk there and maybe your overall interest in adding to the book today, especially with rates looking to stay higher for longer? \nBarb Pak: Haendel, yes. It's Barb. So on our last call, we had 5 that were either on nonaccrual status or on our watch list. And then we've obviously taken back one of those in the first quarter. So we're down to 4. And of those 4 assets, 3 of them have loans maturing in the next 2 to 3 quarters. So we'll have an outcome there sooner rather than later, I believe. On the other asset, there's one other asset that we're having productive conversations with the sponsor to contribute additional equity, which will put us in a safer position in the capital stack.\n On that one, we will likely have more information on our next call on that one. So net-net, it's trended a little bit more favorably in terms of the amount that it's on our watch list. Nothing new was added. The book continues to perform. None of them -- none of our sponsors are in default with the senior lender or with us. And so the sponsorship really does matter here and we have really good sponsors. So no new updates. \nHaendel St. Juste: Okay. And then your thought process perhaps on adding? Or is that not being considered at the moment? \nBarb Pak: Yes, that includes adding anything new. We go through a comprehensive review of the portfolio every quarter. And we scrub it. And so yes, that does include that process. So there was no new added to the watch list this quarter. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. \nJohn Kim: Barb, just following up on that. So what is the earnings impact of consolidating Sunnyvale. I realize there's no impact from the impairment, but you've already had that on nonaccrual. So I would imagine be accretive going forward? \nBarb Pak: Yes. So in our 2024 initial forecast, we didn't assume any accrual on the Sunnyvale asset. So it was a 0 in our forecast. Now given that we consolidated it, we did pay off the debt. We think it's about a $0.05 benefit this year. Keep in mind, it's a small asset and then growing from there as we see better rent growth. \nJohn Kim: Okay. And can you quantify how much of the first quarter blended spreads benefited from reduced concessions on a year-over-year basis? And just remind us how that trends for the remainder of the year. \nAngela Kleiman: Sure thing. John, it's Angela here. So first quarter concessions pickup impacted renewals by about 60 basis points. And then we're -- what we're seeing in April -- Barb, do you have them in front of you? \nBarb Pak: Yes, it's about the same. \nAngela Kleiman: Okay. April is about the same is 60 basis points. And obviously, May, we don't know yet, but we know that we have concessions burning off in June, July, August will be flat and a slight pickup in September and into the fourth quarter, but not much. \nJohn Kim: So second and third quarter -- end of second and third quarter last year is when you started to really reduce concession? \nAngela Kleiman: Yes, yes, which is typical. And definitely second quarter and into -- a little bit into the third quarter, and then it picks up again in the fourth quarter. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley. \nAdam Kramer: I wanted to ask about maybe a little bit about some of the demographics of your renters and thinking about the different jobs kind of your job growth commentary earlier on in the call in the opening comments. I think you kind of mentioned that the tech industry and some of the higher-paying jobs having really recovered. I think people typically think of your portfolio as more Class B, right, a little bit more suburban, a little bit more Class B. Maybe just walk us through whether it's your tech exposure, whether it's the type of renters that are renting with you guys and maybe a little bit more just about the specific jobs that are within your tenant base? And how has job growth fared among those different industries? \nAngela Kleiman: Yes. Sure thing, Adam. Our tech exposure hasn't changed too much. it's about somewhere around mid 5% of our total portfolio, of course, much higher in Seattle than Northern California and very little in Southern California. And so when you look at our portfolio as a whole, it's actually quite diversified. And what that means is a job is coming through all the different industries. And so recently, the growth -- in job growth has really been in government and health and education services. And so we see that the impact throughout our portfolio. \nAdam Kramer: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And the implication would be there's fewer renters within your tenant base from those government and other service teacher types of industries. Would that be the kind of implication? \nAngela Kleiman: Well, Adam, I think what I was trying to say is that our tenant pool is pretty well diverse and there's employers from all job sectors. It mirrors the U.S. pretty well with the exception of higher professional services, generally speaking. And so we're not going to be that different. And of course, with the Northern region having a higher concentration in tech, that's the one benefit. \nAdam Kramer: Got it. That's really helpful, Angela. Maybe just switching gears. Look, I think the commentary around -- I think you kind of mentioned you didn't buy back any shares, but also an issue in your equity -- maybe just walk us through how you kind of view your equity cost of capital today and kind of the other potential cost of the other potential capital sources and cost of capital there, whether it's -- and again, financial a little bit, but just kind of capital allocation strategy from here? Is this more kind of an asset-light approach in asset late year, if you will? \nBarb Pak: Yes. This is Barb. No, it's a good question. I mean you have seen us in the past, buy back stock when we're trading at significant discounts to NAV. And and we can accretively sell an asset and ARP the difference between public and private market pricing. I think today, we don't love our stock. We haven't issued a stock or common stock in many years because of where we're trading relative to where we think the value is trading. \n And to Ryland's point, where we're seeing private markets trade our cost of equity capital is not an attractive source for us, and we will look to other alternatives. We have free cash flow, the preferred redemptions and then look at where we can sell assets or JVs, if our stock price is still not where we like it, if there's an alternative acquisition opportunity or alternative source of use of those proceeds. So we've done this for -- since the founding of the company, we've always looked at all the sources of capital and will remain disciplined on that front. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. \nBrad Heffern: A couple on the press book. Can you give the yield that you ended up at on Sunnyvale and also say how much debt you paid off as a part of that process? \nBarb Pak: Yes. So our yield is 4.75%. It is a high-quality condo-style property. And Essex because we own the property next store, we can operate it much more efficiently than the prior owner. And then in terms of the debt payoff, it was about $32 million in debt that was paid off. \nBrad Heffern: Okay. Got it. And then, Barb, can you give the interest income that's associated with the assets that are not being accrued? Just what that would be if they paid? \nBarb Pak: If -- for the 4 assets that are nonaccrual, I don't have that in front of me. I would have to -- I have to follow up with you offline on that. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with SMBC. \nRichard Anderson: No, no. Wedbush. So I have a question on the dividend increase. I know you guys are a dividend aristocrat, which sounds great. but you also are counting on free cash flow as a source of capital in the absence of raising equity, you mentioned that upfront. I'm curious how married you are to this annual increase to the dividend, particularly now when cash is king and free cash flow is important to you more now so than ever, perhaps. So if you can comment on the dividend policy going forward and staying on this Aristocrat list. \nBarb Pak: Rich, it's Barb. It is very important for us to stay on the dividend aristocrat list and maintain the dividend and continue to increase it. We do like free cash flow, but we also have a lot of planning that goes on behind the scenes in terms of how we do raise our dividend. And we do target a certain percent of our FFO and our AFFO yield to go out as a percent of the dividend payment. So all that gets factored into how much we increase the dividend annually. And it won't be 6% every year. It just does depend on a variety of things behind the scenes that are going on. But maintaining the dividend and keeping our long history of increasing it every year is something that's very important to the company. \nRichard Anderson: Okay. And my second question is understanding the makeup of job growth has not been your sweet spot yet to this point. But I'm wondering when you think of the jobs that are being created, do they have no shot to being a resident with you guys? Or could there be a situation where they would qualify in a doubling up scenario? I'm just curious to the extent there is some areas of the job growth market that don't immediately look great to Essex, but is there a path to them becoming residents nonetheless because of some sort of set up like that? \nAngela Kleiman: Rich, it's Angela here. That's a good question because when we look at the median income, it actually is pretty darn good, and it matches the profile of our property quite well. And so we're -- it's my way of saying we don't have an issue with the demographics in that they can't qualify for our properties because within a market, we have a diversified pool. So even though we're solely in the West Coast, within each submarket, we do have different levels of properties where tenants can qualify. And the quality of jobs I'm speaking to really more relates to our ability to accelerate rent growth. And that's the key when I'm talking about the high paying jobs. \nOperator: We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. And with that, this will conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. Goodbye.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Angela Kleiman",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining Essex's first quarter earnings call. Barb Park will follow with prepared remarks and Rylan Burns is here for Q&A. \n We are pleased to kick off our 2024 earnings with a notable increase in our full year guidance. This is primarily driven by solid first quarter results with core FFO per share of 4.9%, exceeding the high end of our original guidance. Barb will provide more details on our financial performance in a moment.\n Today, my comments will focus on market fundamentals and operational highlights, followed by an update on the investment market. Heading into 2024, consensus forecast was a slowdown for the U.S. and so far, U.S. job growth has trended better than initial forecast. Job quality, on the other hand, has been concentrated in government and low-wage service sectors. \n In the West Coast, the tech industry is a primary source of high-paying jobs and job growth in this industry has led because of evolving business strategies as companies reallocate resources to artificial intelligence opportunities. However, we have seen encouraging signs, including a steady increase in job openings in our markets by the top 20 tech companies. As for our near-term outlook, recent information data and Fed commentary have resulted in elevated uncertainty regarding the path of interest rate cuts. \n With this in mind, we do not anticipate an imminent improvement in job growth in the high-paying sectors, which is typically the key catalyst to accelerate demand for housing and rent growth. While job growth on the West Coast has remained soft. Our steady performance year-to-date is attributed to 2 factors: first, limited housing supply. This is a significant structural benefit and a pillar of our California investment thesis.\n Lengthy and costly entitlement process effectively deters housing supply. To this point, total housing permits as a percentage of stock continues to remain well below 1% in Essex, California markets. Our performance today demonstrates this supply advantage. It is a key stabilizer during soft demand periods and a driver of rent growth outcomes over the long term. \n The second positive factor is rental affordability which is driven by wages growing faster than rents in FX markets. Additionally, the cost of homeownership continues to rise. The median cost of owning a home is 2.5x more expensive than renting in our markets. Likewise, the percentage of our turnover attributed to purchasing a home has fallen from around 12% historically to 5% today. Accordingly, rental affordability supports a long runway for rent growth in the FX markets.\n Turning to first quarter operations. We achieved a 2.2% growth in blended lease rates, which consists of 10 basis points on new leases and 3.9% on renewals. Our new lease rates are tempered by delinquency-related turnover in LA and Alameda, which comprise of approximately 25% of our total same-store portfolio. If we excluded these 2 regions, new lease rates would have been 150 basis points higher at 1.6%. \n Moving on to regional highlights. Seattle was our best-performing region, achieving blended rates of 3.6% with new lease rate growth of 1.3%.  New lease rates turned positive in February, led by the east side and the positive trend has continued. Northern California was our second best performing region with 2.1% blended rate growth and flat new lease rates. San Mateo was our strongest market, offset by the east side, which remained challenged, primarily from delinquency impact in Alameda County. Excluding Alameda County, new lease rates in Northern California would have been 70 basis points. \n As for Southern California, this region continues to be a steady performer, generating blended rate growth of 1.7%, with negative 30 basis points in new lease rates caused by delinquency in Los Angeles. Excluding Los Angeles, average new lease rates would have been positive 3.1% in Southern California. Along with the improvement in eviction processing time, our operations and support teams have done an excellent job recovering long-term delinquent units at a faster pace, which has led to lower delinquency. We welcome this trend and continue to proactively build occupancy in anticipation of recapturing more units in this region. We view this temporary trade-off as net beneficial to long-term revenue growth.\n As for current operating conditions, at the end of April, we are in a solid position with 96% occupancy heading into peak leasing season. Concessions for the portfolio averaged only 3.5 days. And aside from areas with delinquency headwinds discussed earlier, we see opportunities to increase rental rates throughout our portfolio.\n Lastly on the  transaction market. Deal volume remains thin compared to recent years, and we continue to see strong investor demand for multifamily properties in our markets. with cap rates ranging from mid-4% for core to mid 5% for value-add communities. Against this backdrop of limited transaction volume, we have created external growth opportunities, generating FFO and NAV per share accretion through our joint venture platform. \n In the first quarter, we purchased our partner's interest in a $505 million joint venture portfolio that will produce almost $2 million of FFO accretion for us in 2024. In fact , since inception, our private equity platform has delivered a 20% IRR and over $160 million to promote income for our shareholders and remains an attractive alternative source of capital. \n In conclusion, we intend to pursue growth through acquisitions while maintaining our disciplined capital allocation strategy and our core principle of generating accretion to create significant value for our shareholders.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to Barb. Austin, it's Angela here. You kind of cracked up in the earlier part of the question, but I believe you're asking whether the LA Alameda overhang is going to continue on new lease rates? Okay. Great. What we're expecting is that L.A. is going to continue to provide -- be an overhang on the delinquency. Alameda improvement is steady, and it's a smaller part of our portfolio. So the heavier influence is really coming from L.A. just because when you have such a large volume that we're working through, it's going to take a longer period of time. The good news is that we are not seeing that bleeding into other markets. So it's really more focused in L.A. and our other markets are doing quite well. Yes, sure thing. No, we have not reforecasted yet just because it is important to see how peak leasing season activities progress and because that's where the bulk of our leases occur at that point in time. So our data is with a few months into the year and a smaller set of leasing terms is turning. It's more limited. But having said that, what we're seeing right now is that Seattle and Northern California are trending slightly ahead of our original market rent forecast. Southern California is generally planned, but there is an LA drag.  \n And so because it's not a huge outperformance relative to plan at this point. The outperformance is really mostly in the benefits from delinquency that we're getting the -- recovering the units much faster in other income, it's once again, it's just too early to try to reforecast where market rents is going to be. I do want to say that with our performance on delinquency and our ability to essentially turn those units quickly. It speaks to the underlying fundamentals of our market, so that is quite solid. Sure thing. So renewal rates for, say, May and June, they're going out in kind of that low to mid-4% range. They average for the portfolio around 4.3%. And we do -- there is some negotiations there. And what we try to do is anticipate where the market is going to be. And because we are seeing that we are trending slightly ahead, we, of course, are going to push renewals wherever possible. But keep in mind, our approach on renewals is still same as before. We are setting market appropriate pricing and with the goal of maximizing revenues. Daniel, it's a good question there. We are seeing anecdotally hybrid workers moving closer to the office to essentially trying to reduce the commute because traffic has picked up. And -- we are seeing also the top 20 tech openings increasing, although it's very gradual. And so what we're seeing is that these job openings bottomed last year during the first quarter, and the opening was only about, say, 8,000 jobs. Today, in March, it's about 16,000 jobs. So it doubled but it is well below our pre-COVID average. The 3-year run rate was about 25,000.\n So hopefully, that gives you some sense of how things -- what we're seeing is that the fundamentals are moving in the right direction. But in order for acceleration to occur, we really need to see a more robust pickup on the high-paying jobs. And we do believe that we have the fundamental backdrop for that to occur. It just it's all about when, and that's the big question on our mind. Sure thing, Daniel. We are predominantly in -- on the east side, so over 60% of our portfolio is more suburban in nature and the east side. And what that means is because supply is predominantly in the CBD, we are more insulated from that. And we -- so we're seeing much better activities coming from the east side of our portfolio. And where things are trending right now, we are seeing some demand -- some demand growth, which is healthy, which is a good indicator at this point.\n Downtown seems to be doing okay. It's holding its own. And what we expect is the cadence of supply to occur some more time between now and next quarter in terms of the bulk of the delivery. But as we've all experienced in this market that can get slightly pushed by a month or 2 in our markets, but that's what we're expecting at this point in time. Nick, Rylan will talk about how we're underwriting activities in our various markets, including L.A. Yes, Nick. And as it relates to the actual tenant underwriting itself for leasing activities, we have not needed to make any material change. Obviously, from building to building, there are always nuances and the tenant background and credit. We set a very solid bar for our credit. What has happened with delinquency really is not related to our underwriting. It's really a legislation result because eviction moratorium went on for so long. And then all the courts are backed up in terms of processing these evictions which is why the whole time line to get out these nonpaying tenants became prolonged. And so in terms of -- if you're talking about, say, new tenants going delinquent, we're not seeing that as a material problem at all. Yes, that's correct, Nick. Alex, that is an excellent point and, good job. You've been paying attention. What we are seeing is that the supply definitely is a significant benefit for our markets, and it's something that we've been stating for several years now, in that we don't need much demand for us to achieve our plan and to have a healthy performing market. And so these other incremental benefits are great signs in terms of whether it's moving a return to office.  \n We are seeing continued improvements in both domestic and international migration and in fact, we're showing a positive population growth for the first time in 3 years. So all these little anecdotal data on the margin is hopeful. But in terms of really driving acceleration, the other -- the high-paying job growth will need to kick in. But our markets are going to do just fine. Alex, that is an important question. What we are seeing is the vast majority of the legislature are not supporting overturning Costa-Hawkins. So they're on our side. And because they recognize, especially in our market, we have an acute shortage of housing. And so that is not -- that is an antigrowth initiative. We have maintained our coalition to support reasonable legislation and especially relating to housing. And of course, this proposal has been defeated overwhelmingly twice, and we just have not seen anything that shows that will be different this time. Josh, we are slightly ahead of schedule. And what we haven't done is because we have not reforecasted, it's a little too early to talk about the actual cadence. And -- but I will say that we're ahead of schedule everywhere else except for L.A. and Alameda. So I do want to caveat that. But the things are doing fine right now. Yes, it could range anywhere from 0 depending on market strength to, say, close to 100 basis points depending on what else is going on. It could be supply, it could be jobs environment, a whole host of things. Haendel, there's a little bit in May and then no more in June and July. Sure thing. So loss to lease for the Essex portfolio in April is about 20 basis points. So nothing exciting there once again. But keep in mind, we have a L.A-Alameda overhang. So if you exclude L.A. Alameda. Loss to lease will be a little over 1%. And just to compare to last year, around April, loss lease was 80 basis points. So absent of L.A. Alameda, things are looking slightly better. We're not talking about massive acceleration, but it is slightly better. So in terms of just the disbursement, Seattle has the best loss lease at about 80 basis points; Northern California, about 10 basis points; and Southern California about 10 basis points. So that gives you kind of the range where things stand. Sure thing. John, it's Angela here. So first quarter concessions pickup impacted renewals by about 60 basis points. And then we're -- what we're seeing in April -- Barb, do you have them in front of you? Okay. April is about the same is 60 basis points. And obviously, May, we don't know yet, but we know that we have concessions burning off in June, July, August will be flat and a slight pickup in September and into the fourth quarter, but not much. Yes, yes, which is typical. And definitely second quarter and into -- a little bit into the third quarter, and then it picks up again in the fourth quarter. Yes. Sure thing, Adam. Our tech exposure hasn't changed too much. it's about somewhere around mid 5% of our total portfolio, of course, much higher in Seattle than Northern California and very little in Southern California. And so when you look at our portfolio as a whole, it's actually quite diversified. And what that means is a job is coming through all the different industries. And so recently, the growth -- in job growth has really been in government and health and education services. And so we see that the impact throughout our portfolio. Well, Adam, I think what I was trying to say is that our tenant pool is pretty well diverse and there's employers from all job sectors. It mirrors the U.S. pretty well with the exception of higher professional services, generally speaking. And so we're not going to be that different. And of course, with the Northern region having a higher concentration in tech, that's the one benefit. Rich, it's Angela here. That's a good question because when we look at the median income, it actually is pretty darn good, and it matches the profile of our property quite well. And so we're -- it's my way of saying we don't have an issue with the demographics in that they can't qualify for our properties because within a market, we have a diversified pool. So even though we're solely in the West Coast, within each submarket, we do have different levels of properties where tenants can qualify. And the quality of jobs I'm speaking to really more relates to our ability to accelerate rent growth. And that's the key when I'm talking about the high paying jobs."

            "name": "Barb Pak",
            "content": "Thanks, Angela. I'll begin with comments on our first quarter results, provide an update on key changes to our full year guidance followed by comments on investment activities, capital markets and the balance sheet. I'm pleased to report core FFO per share exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.09 in the first quarter. The outperformance was primarily driven by higher same-property revenue growth, which accounted for $0.06 of the $0.09 [ beat ]. The first quarter also benefited from onetime lease termination fees within our commercial portfolio totaling $0.02, which are not expected to reoccur for the remainder of the year. \n Turning to our full year guidance revisions. As a result of the strong start to the year, we are increasing the midpoint of same-property revenue growth by 55 basis points to 2.25%. The increase is driven by 2 factors: First, delinquency has improved faster than our original expectations, which accounts for 40 basis points of the revision. We now project delinquency to be 1.1% of scheduled rent for the year. \n The second factor relates to higher other income as we have been successful at optimizing our portfolio through various initiatives, which has led to 15 basis points of better growth. While we are trending slightly ahead of our expectations on blended lease growth so far this year, especially on renewals, we have not factored any revision into our guidance as we want to get further into peak leasing season when we sign the bulk of our leases. \n The other key driver of our full year guidance revision relates to the consolidation of our partnership in the BEXAEW joint venture, which accounts for $0.03 of FFO accretion. And as Angela highlighted, this acquisition reinforces the value Essex has created for shareholders through our joint venture platform as well as our ability to grow externally in an otherwise challenging market. In total, we are raising core FFO by $0.20 per share, a 1.3% increase at the midpoint.\n Turning to our preferred equity investments. Subsequent to quarter end, we assume the sponsor's common equity interest affiliated with a preferred equity investment. This investment was previously on our watch list and was placed on nonaccrual status in the fourth quarter of 2023. As such, this transaction is beneficial to our 2024 core FFO forecast. The property is located adjacent to an existing Essex community, which will allow us to operate it efficiently within our collections model. Overall, we view the outcome favorably given that quality of the asset, our initial yield and our long-term view on the growth in the Sunnyvale submarket.\n Turning to Capital Markets. In March, we issued $350 million in 10-year unsecured bonds to refinance the last remaining portion of the company's 2024 debt maturities and to partially fund the BEXAEW transaction. We are pleased to have locked in 5.5% fixed rate debt in today's volatile interest rate environment.\n As it relates to equity, the company did not issue common stock to fund our year-to-date investments nor do we plan to issue equity at our current stock price. We have alternative sources of equity capital, such as retained cash flow and preferred equity redemption proceeds from last year and expected this year that can fund up to $400 million in investments, including transactions completed to date without the need for new equity.\n We will continue to look at all our sources of equity capital, including disposition proceeds or joint ventures in order to maximize growth in core FFO and NAV per share while preserving our balance sheet strength. We have been prudent stewards of shareholder capital over our 30-year history, which has served our shareholders well. \n In conclusion, Essex is in a strong financial position. Our leverage levels remain healthy with net debt-to-EBITDA at 5.4x, and we have over $1 billion in available liquidity. As such, we are well equipped to act as opportunities arise. \n I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions. Jamie, it's Barb. Yes, that's really driven by L.A. and Alameda between March and April. And once again, it's delinquency-related challenges which is ultimately a benefit to our revenues because we get those units back and can lease into a rent-paying tenant. And -- but if you pull out those 2, we did see a sequential increase. So I think it was primarily just driven by L.A. Alameda. Haendel, yes. It's Barb. So on our last call, we had 5 that were either on nonaccrual status or on our watch list. And then we've obviously taken back one of those in the first quarter. So we're down to 4. And of those 4 assets, 3 of them have loans maturing in the next 2 to 3 quarters. So we'll have an outcome there sooner rather than later, I believe. On the other asset, there's one other asset that we're having productive conversations with the sponsor to contribute additional equity, which will put us in a safer position in the capital stack.\n On that one, we will likely have more information on our next call on that one. So net-net, it's trended a little bit more favorably in terms of the amount that it's on our watch list. Nothing new was added. The book continues to perform. None of them -- none of our sponsors are in default with the senior lender or with us. And so the sponsorship really does matter here and we have really good sponsors. So no new updates. Yes, that includes adding anything new. We go through a comprehensive review of the portfolio every quarter. And we scrub it. And so yes, that does include that process. So there was no new added to the watch list this quarter. Yes. So in our 2024 initial forecast, we didn't assume any accrual on the Sunnyvale asset. So it was a 0 in our forecast. Now given that we consolidated it, we did pay off the debt. We think it's about a $0.05 benefit this year. Keep in mind, it's a small asset and then growing from there as we see better rent growth. Yes, it's about the same. Yes. This is Barb. No, it's a good question. I mean you have seen us in the past, buy back stock when we're trading at significant discounts to NAV. And and we can accretively sell an asset and ARP the difference between public and private market pricing. I think today, we don't love our stock. We haven't issued a stock or common stock in many years because of where we're trading relative to where we think the value is trading. \n And to Ryland's point, where we're seeing private markets trade our cost of equity capital is not an attractive source for us, and we will look to other alternatives. We have free cash flow, the preferred redemptions and then look at where we can sell assets or JVs, if our stock price is still not where we like it, if there's an alternative acquisition opportunity or alternative source of use of those proceeds. So we've done this for -- since the founding of the company, we've always looked at all the sources of capital and will remain disciplined on that front. Yes. So our yield is 4.75%. It is a high-quality condo-style property. And Essex because we own the property next store, we can operate it much more efficiently than the prior owner. And then in terms of the debt payoff, it was about $32 million in debt that was paid off. If -- for the 4 assets that are nonaccrual, I don't have that in front of me. I would have to -- I have to follow up with you offline on that. Rich, it's Barb. It is very important for us to stay on the dividend aristocrat list and maintain the dividend and continue to increase it. We do like free cash flow, but we also have a lot of planning that goes on behind the scenes in terms of how we do raise our dividend. And we do target a certain percent of our FFO and our AFFO yield to go out as a percent of the dividend payment. So all that gets factored into how much we increase the dividend annually. And it won't be 6% every year. It just does depend on a variety of things behind the scenes that are going on. But maintaining the dividend and keeping our long history of increasing it every year is something that's very important to the company."

So I think we have pretty good data. And as we've shown over the past year or 2, we know how we are turning these delinquent units back into rent paying units and how quickly that can occur. So I feel like we've got pretty nuanced underwriting as it relates to L.A. market, but it is something that we're certainly factoring in. Jamie, Rylan here. On the first point, we do have significant opportunities to continue to acquire from our joint venture partnerships. What we are going to do, however, is try to make the best capital allocation decision we can at any given point in time. So at the start of this year, this was a joint venture that was maturing, and we had the opportunity to purchase our partner's interest and it made sense. It was accretive for our shareholders, and that's why we decided to elect that route.\n So we have a pretty deep joint venture business that we can continue to look for opportunities, but we are not solely focused on one or the other. We're trying to find the highest and best returning investments that we can find.\n As it relates to the transaction market, I think what you've been hearing is generally correct. The volumes continue to be very low as they were all of last year approximately 1/5 of the transaction volumes we saw in '21 and '22. What we're seeing this year is there was an ample amount of capital looking to be put to work in particular, from our focus on the West Coast in multifamily. So there's a bit of a scarcity premium for well-located suburban product that's coming to market.\n And so you are seeing very competitive bidding pools for the few transactions that have made it to market. And our expectation is that, that is going to continue. So we're tracking a couple of deals right now. We have very deep bidder pools, both levered and unlevered buyers and I think some of our public investors would be surprised at where these transaction cap rates are going to come out. So more to come there. It's certainly something we're considering. Again, we are trying to grow the portfolio, but we need to be cautious about where we where our highest and best use of capital can be. So we have both opportunities that we are evaluating."
