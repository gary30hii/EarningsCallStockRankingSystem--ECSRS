        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to PepsiCo's Fourth Quarter Earnings Question-and-Answer Session. Your lines have been placed on listen-only until it is your turn to ask a question. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Ravi Pamnani, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Pamnani, you may begin.\nRavi Pamnani: Thank you, Operator. I hope everyone has had a chance this morning to review our press release and prepared comments, both of which are available on our Web site. Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. We may make forward-looking statements on today's call, including about our business plans, 2021 outlook, and the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties and only reflect our view as of today, and we are under no obligation to update. When discussing our results, we may refer to non-GAAP measures, which exclude certain items from reported results. Please refer to today's earnings release and 10-Q, available on pepsico.com, for definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures and additional information regarding our results, including a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from forward-looking statements. Joining me today are PepsiCo's Chairman and CEO, Ramon Laguarta; and PepsiCo's Vice Chairman and CFO, Hugh Johnston. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question. And with that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Goldman Sachs.\nBonnie Herzog: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nRamon Laguarta: Good morning.\nBonnie Herzog: Good morning. I had a question on your marketing, and how we should be thinking about your ad spend levels this year. It seems quite obvious, I guess that you can operate now at lower ad spend levels. So I guess I wanted to clarify with both of you that you expect to pull back on the absolute level of your ad spend this year. And then how should we think about this from a long-term perspective, especially when I think about it in the context of the overall health of whether it's your categories, and certain your brand equity and how you're going to maintain that? Thanks.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, good morning, Bonnie. Yes, this Ramon. Listen, the advertising levels, I don't think we are maximized on -- [technical difficulty] in the investments. What we think is that the A&M line has opportunities for optimization, especially in what we call, Non-working, and we're working hard on optimizing that part. And obviously, we're working on optimizing the return on investment on the advertising part of the media that impacts the consumer. One of the decisions we took this year was, and if you look at Frito-Lay, for example, or some of our international business, we actually increased our A&M. And the reason for that is that within the formula for success of our portfolio we have to have our large brands growing at a decent pace, at the market level hopefully, and for that we need to keep them modernized, we have to keep innovating on those large brands. But also, we need to invest in the growth spaces of the category where sometimes we need to create new brands. And that requires a well-funded, a kind of support package to get those brands up and running. For example, if you think about the Frito portfolio, obviously we want to grow our Cheetos, Doritos, Tostitos, Lay's, Ruffles at a very good pace, and I think we're doing that. But at the same time we need to build healthier portfolios, some brands like Off the Eaten Path or Smartfoods or PopCorners or Bayer, all those brands need to grow to have a portfolio in the future, the same with our beverage portfolio, with Bubly or with some of the smaller brands we're creating. So, that's how we're thinking about our A&M optimization, obviously on the non-working, get the maximum ROI on the working part but ensure that we can support both the large brands and the smaller future brands in a way that we have a sustainable growth for the future.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey, guys. So first, just a detailed question, as we look at your earnings guidance for 2021, it's in line with the long-term algorithm despite having nearly $800 million in COVID costs in 2020 that I assume will drop off significantly. So, just trying to understand why there couldn't be upside to the long-term algorithm should those costs drop off, if to assume reinvestment or higher commodities or other factors? And then second, Ramon, just sort of further on the question you just answered, we did see a pretty big shift in A&M spend at the Frito side this year, obviously pullback in beverage given the COVID situation. So I'd love to hear your thoughts on the ROI behind the higher spend in Frito, and if you think you're getting significant incremental revenue from that or the yield on those investments as you shifted the allocation within the portfolio, in 2020? Thanks.\nRamon Laguarta: Great. Okay, Hugh, you want to take the first part, on the how we're thinking about the short-term, long-term, and in our algorithm.\nHugh Johnston: Yes, I'm happy to, Ramon. Good morning, Dara. Dara, obviously that there is a lot of items that are in our P&L, we've identified the COVID cost as something we wanted to call out because it was extraordinary. There will be COVID costs and significant COVID costs still in 2021. So you really can't pull all of that to the bottom line. In addition to that, we're [pouring some] [Ph] to the A&M, as Ramon mentioned, in the snack food business and a bit in the beverage business as well. But as we [technical difficulty] given the level of uncertainty, we felt like our long-term algorithm from a revenue and profit perspective was an appropriate goal for us. And I think if we hit these numbers as we expected I think it'll be a good -- [technical difficulty].\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, Dara. And so, that's -- we're thinking about, obviously, maximizing the short-term, but not at the expense of the long-term. And I think it's -- and to start a year thinking about our long-term algorithm is a good way to start focusing the company on a sustainable performance for many years. So that's how we're thinking about it. Then with regards to the marketing ROI, listen, we're getting much better at measuring the ROI in our marketing spends. And we think that -- actually we're, based on this measurement, we're getting much better at the ROI delivery of our investments. We're putting tools, and we're putting kind of performance metrics to our marketing teams. In particular, where you were saying about Frito, Frito has a very low level of advertising, I mean full A&M actually below 4% for a brand -- for a business that has so many multiple brands and has so much growth potential if you think about the share of macro-snacks that we have. So, I would think that if you think about the levers of growth for Frito in the future, I think A&M and an increased A&M should be part of it. As we think about our push model, it's pretty optimized with our DSD execution capabilities. I think on the pull side, we have opportunities probably to maximize the frequency and to maximize the other consumer connection with our brands and Frito versus what we do with other -- with some other parts of our business. So that's how we'll be thinking about the A&M investments at Frito.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you. Good morning. So my question is on the use of capital, as you emphasize the buybacks and you're focusing more on CapEx, on investment in capacity to meet demand or perhaps M&A. So if you can comment on your capital allocation, Hugh? And Ramon, I was positively impressed with Europe and the recovery momentum there. Is that going -- do you think it's going to go and continue into 2021, and embedded in your guidance? And conversely, what are your thoughts on the deceleration in LatAm?\nRamon Laguarta: Okay, let me start with the geography part, and then Hugh, you can talk about the capital. There the, I would say, Europe, we're seeing different Europes. Now we're seeing Eastern Europe quite strong, I would say Russia extremely -- extremely strong, Turkey very strong. Some parts in Central Europe much better, by Central Europe I mean Germany and some of the more developed Europe. We're seeing the south of Europe very impacted by, obviously, the lack of tourism and people not going there for weekends or longer vacations. So that is how we see Europe. When we look at '21 we think, obviously, as mobility increases we're going to see even better performance in Western Europe. And hopefully we can continue to see the good performance in the East. What we can see in Europe across the board is we're becoming more competitive, our share of market performance both in beverages and snacks was very good this year, so we managed to gain share almost in every single market, which is actually the metric that we're following the most in a period of time where the markets go up and down depending on lockdowns, et cetera. In Latin America, actually Brazil has been very strong throughout the year. And we feel very good about our Brazilian business also in terms of share of market, but also category growth has been very, very positive in Brazil. Mexico, at the beginning of the pandemic, we suffered a little bit in the [cap pillar] [Ph] part of our business, so the more kind of smaller fragment trade, we saw traffic down and that impacted our sales given that we have a very good distribution and availability in the market. The business came back to much more solid performance in the last quarter in Mexico. And although we've been gaining share across the year, we're seeing also the category recovering in Mexico. So hopefully we see a much better performance in Mexico this year in absolute terms, relative terms, I think we'll continue to gain share in the market. So those are the two big markets in Latin America, you get a good sign from those two. And Hugh, you want to talk about the capital principles that we have?\nHugh Johnston: Yes, happy to, Ramon. Overall, our capital allocation strategy hasn't changed. We've talked about this many times. Number one, make sure that we fund the business to compete and grow. Number two is dividend. Number three is tuck-in M&A. And number four is share repurchase. One and two, obviously we've talked about in terms of our guidance. I would not expect, from the standpoint of the third one, I would not expect much in the way of M&A as we go through the course of this year and certainly nothing large. So, from that perspective, I think we have got a lot to digest right now. We're happy with where the portfolio sits. And then, last in terms of share repurchase, obviously we're trying to balance our debt rating versus our cash return to shareholders. We felt like the dividend increase was important. And at the same time, given the level of M&A that we had over the last couple of years, balancing that out with the debt rating, we made a decision that we're going to have significant share repurchase in this year. That's purely based on balancing the debt rating with our return to equity shareholder; nothing more that driving that decision.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala of Credit Suisse.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Hi, would you guys mind providing some insights on how you are looking at the commodity cost environment? Where you are seeing maybe raw material inflation? And then, how you plan on addressing it through pricing or mix or trade spend?\nRamon Laguarta: Hugh?\nHugh Johnston: Yes, I am happy to take that, Ramon. Kaumil, obviously there is some pressure in commodities. We're viewing commodities as manageable right now. I'll remind you that we do forward buy on areas where we can of about -- typically about nine months ahead. But, we can't forward on everything. And obviously there is inflation in certain aspect of our cost structure. That said, the overall mix is as manageable between pricing and the balance of the P&L such that we don't expect it to be disruptive for the algorithm this year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane: Hey, good morning everyone. I guess I had a follow-up question just related to Andrea's question around cash flow. And Hugh, maybe can you talk about the CapEx levels and will they be elevated from multiple years? And then, I guess maybe on some color on just where like where that incremental CapEx spending is going. Is it capacity? Is it capability? Just trying to get an understanding of whether or not we are going to be with an elevated CapEx cycle for awhile? And then, also just where the capital is going?\nHugh Johnston: Yes. Ramon, would you like to handle a little.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, please, go ahead. I'll add to it.\nHugh Johnston: Okay. Bryan, a couple of things on that, yes, it is elevated. We sort of have been running as you know about 5% of sales and now we are running a little bit north of 6%. And couple of big drivers behind it. Number one is the IT and digitalization spending that we are doing. That will be elevated for a couple of years as we sort of get through the combination of an ASP upgrade as well as a whole variety of digitalization efforts that we have going on in our supply chain and selling system. The second piece is primarily around growth capacity. And we expect that to be elevated for a couple of years. If you look at the way that we used to run the business, we ran capacity pretty close to the edge. And as we pivoted to more a growth strategy, we're taking capacity utilization down little bit to enable us to capture more of the growth opportunities that are out there. So, that's a big piece of the spend. And then, the last is productivity CapEx as we are looking at automation and looking at putting more capabilities into the plants that will yield cost savings that obviously is a big driver. So, I would say I would expect the capital spending to remain elevated for the next couple of years. And then, I would expect it to return back to our typical norms.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet of Guggenheim.\nLaurent Grandet: Hi, good morning, Ramon and Hugh, and congrats on the strong hand of the year. I'd like to focus my question on the energy category. So, in 2020, we saw you making an effort to move into the energy category with the acquisition of Rockstar and the agreement to distribute Bang. So, could you please update us on where you stand in your journey to become a leading energy player, like to understand your view on the Rockstar revamp? We saw the Super Bowl ad, but like to understand a bit more on that, and obviously, your assessment of the situation we span, but also what are you planning to do with other brands like Dew and DNH category?\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. Thank you, Lauren, and yes, a good question. Listen, let's talk first about Bang quickly. We're surprised by this move by VPX and especially given that, it was a very good performance value PBNA on the distribution metrics, but at the end of the day, we plan to continue to be in the distributor of Bang until October 23. And we're going to do our best to make that brand well distributed in the marketplace, but the core of our energy study was never Bang it's a distribution cherry on top. It was obviously what we could do with our brands after the acquisition of Rockstar kind of free adapt from some of the contractual obligations we had. So, the first pillar is obviously Rockstar. Rockstar re-launch both in the U.S. and its expansion internationally as of our core energy kind of mainstream proposition. I would say the integration of Rockstar into our supply chain is starting to happen. It's going to be a bit of a process until we got all the formulations and everything into our system, but obviously that's going to make it a better supply chain in itself. From the consumer point of view we are -- you saw we're planning to invest in the brand. I think we found a consumer space where it's going to be a bit quite differentiated and then were you are improving the formulas and we're improving the building different propositions for multiple spaces in that kind of mainstream energy. At the same time, you will be seeing shortly some announcements on Mountain Dew launch in the spring time. This is going to be the first big move for Mountain Dew into the energy space. We're very happy with the way the product concept, the support package and the support we're getting from our customers in terms of the launch. So that, that there would be a good event and it will be the first move of Mountain Dew and there will be future moves as well from Mountain Dew into the energy space. Obviously, one of our big pillars in energies are Starbucks partnership, which is I think is at an all-time high in terms of their relationship and the market performance. We continue to innovate on the -- kind of coffee, energy, Triple Shot, Double Shots. And we have some good ideas that will I'm sure will make into the market shortly. So, and then we're looking at other brands in the sports area and some other kind of spaces within the energy management, energy up, energy down that I think we can have a multiple set of solutions and brands that drive consumer solutions in a space that is obviously growing and as a lot of consumer pools. So, it's important for us, as we said, both from the growth point of view and the margin expansion point of view, and we feel good about the steps we're taking brick by brick to build a solid foundation for us to play in energy over many years. So, that's pretty much long, and you will see more news from us in the coming weeks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen.\nVivien Azer: Hi, thank you. Good morning. I was hoping that you could touch on your agreement with Beyond Meat and explain kind of the aspirations there in terms of the partnership as well as any embedded economic impacts in your 2021 guidance? Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, great question. Yes. As you think about we're creating spaces for future growth, one of them is plant-based snacking, plant-based convenient solutions. We've seen that Beyond Meat was the right partner in terms of -- we did a lot of due diligence in terms of R&D capabilities and kind of willingness to share with us in the future. And we have high expectations for that. There should be no implication for our 2021 kind of investment or high sales is going to be still a small business for us in 2021, but we plan to be in the market within this year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Great, thanks. Good morning. I was curious as thinking back to kind of your longer term plan, Ramon, that you laid out now almost exactly two years ago. Is it fair -- I think first order of business was seemingly to kind of shore up and reinvest in your bigger franchises. And I felt like the language in the prepared remarks today, there was a little bit more emphasis on -- it's stepping up the investment in the more -- and some of the ancillary, but critical growth opportunities, whether it's smaller brands or kind of healthier segments of the categories. Can you speak to the degree to which maybe the environmental last year kind of accelerated the support you were giving to your big brands and the impact that that really had on accelerating, I guess your progress vis-\u00e0-vis your long-term goals? I'd be curious to hear sort of a progress report. Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, that's great. Good question. Listen, if you think back and you see the growth opportunity for PepsiCo, we are -- you think about the large LRB category globally were about less than 10% on a $600 billion category, growing out of 4% or 5%. And pretty much the same with micro snacks, a large category, $500 billion-$600 billion globally and we are less than 10%. So, growth as the lever for the long-term value creation of these companies is clearly the number one.\n, : If you just think about other models that we're working, clearly our SodaStream has been a fantastic acquisition for us, and it gives us a platform not only to have a sweet spot between better for you and better for the planet, which I think is going to be a sweet spot of growth globally, that also a new way to customize drinks. The same we're thinking about, for example, the questions I just got on beyond me then the partnerships. So, we're building a lot of future opportunities for our portfolios to grow. At the same time, we don't want to keep our eyes off what are the core brands that drive the majority of the growth in absolutely dollars of this company and that have a massive runway for growth in the future. So that gives you a sense of how we're thinking about growth. Growth being our number one value creation; profitable growth, obviously, and I think we can do that over time by also creating those smaller spaces, where I think we can enter and win in the future.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy of Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: Great, thanks. Good morning, everyone, and congratulations on a strong year. Ramon and Hugh, for that may I just building of the last question around sort of balanced growth. I wanted to come back to the margin opportunity at North America beverages, because this has come up. So I want a number of times on previous calls. In your prepared remarks today, it's been more about delivering a better balance and improving profitability. Last quarter, I think it seemed to me at least the tone was more on improving profitability. So, I just want to get a better understanding here if the current commodity cost environment, which you commented on a moment ago, as well as the spending intentions of your key competitor because one would argue that they probably never been more constrained than they have been this past year. So I'm just curious if this is will be another year of sort of really limited margin enhancement, given these factors at North America beverages and want to get a better understanding of how bigger priority this is for the organization and then when can we expect to return to this sort of elusive mid-teens operating margin. So thanks for that.\nRamon Laguarta: Great, listen, let me take it first, and then, Hugh can add. I think the conversations were started about a couple of years ago was we want to make sure that we got PBNA to be a growth engine. And I think, brick-by-brick, we've been able to build kind of make sure our brands are all growth brands. And I think we're there and the latest quarter five plus growth shows that, okay, we're most of our brands are performing at a very good level, that was critical, because we thought that, there's no way to cut your costs in a way that is sustainable. So, now we have, I think good, good machine that has the right local execution capabilities, and the good brands and innovation now, we have the intentions to work obviously, on the margin expansion of PBNA. That is a priority for us, a priority for the business. We see this business long-term in mid-teens. We want to do it in a sustainable way where we keep growing with a category and expand our margins. And we have, obviously ideas on how do we be able to categories, segments of the category that are highly more profitable, how we get better at selling the right pack in the right place at the right price. So, our revenue management capabilities, we have a lot of cost opportunities in the end-to-end supply chain management, and also the way we support the business in some of our G&A expenses and a little bit of on our A&M as you mentioned, optimizations are all of that should give us the opportunities to continue to grow, add the category, and it's starting to expand the margins, this year should be a year where you see already some movement in that regard. And as I said earlier, we see this business getting into the teens margins over the long run, and without sacrificing competitive performance.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.\nNik Modi: Yes, good morning everyone. Ramon, I was hoping you could just talk about, what's going on at retail in terms of assortment, SKU management at the retail level, because it seems like retailers are finally starting to focus on higher velocity items, and really trying to simplify their shelves, because they all learned the lessons of COVID, and not having enough stock of higher target brands. So just wanted to get your perspective on that, and some of the things we've heard from retailers at Quaker has been under a little bit of space pressure. So just hoping you can provide some clarity there.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, I think listen, obviously, we all had to take a look at our supply chain, right during this year, because it's been a challenging year from the supply chain point of view, given the number of infected people that we had in our supply chain, and so on. So, simplifying our portfolios has been a solution to continue to have elevated levels of supply to our customers, which has been our focus. I think as we go forward, and consumers move back to more of a bit of more of a normal life and physical stores, continue to be a meaningful part of their shopping experience, I think consumers will go back to experimenting a little bit more. And they will be looking for innovation and smaller SKUs. So I think we're going to see a small, slow return back to a bit more complex portfolios. But I think we've all learned that maybe the tail of their portfolio was not really delivering the returns that we needed to have for every SKU that we had in the marketplace. So I think there's going to be an optimization of the portfolios, but an increasing complexity as well versus what we have today, even though the consumers will be asking for a bit more experimentation and especially in our categories, where variety is a key driver of purchase.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: Hey, great, thanks. Maybe just two things, first, Hugh, if you could given the higher CapEx that you mentioned, just your thoughts on free cash flow and free cash flow conversion for the year I guess, I'm thinking that a round about 80% free cash flow conversion is a reasonable place to start for the year consistent with 2020. But any thoughts you might have as to why that could be materially higher or lower? And then, Ramon, just because maybe can you talk a little bit about the Gatorade franchise, it had a really strong 2020, behind Zero, and other initiatives. And I'm curious to how you're thinking about it into '21. And maybe as part of that you mentioned, kind of a sports energy convergence and your answer to Lauren's question, and it looks to me like you're increasingly positioning 24 to play in that area. So maybe you could talk a little bit more about how those lines may be blurring. Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Okay, Hugh, you want to?\nHugh Johnston: Yes, I will do. Obviously, Steve, we didn't give specific cash flow guidance, but I think generally speaking, the profile of our cash flow will be similar to what you saw in 2020.\nRamon Laguarta: No, hold on, let me just say a few words on the Gatorade. I think Gatorade we're seeing Gatorade, clearly, growing very fast. Part of it is our innovation; especially Zero has been an amazing innovation is proud that $1 billion retail sales value already for a year, I mean, that's a meaningful sizable innovation. And we're seeing obviously people exercising more. And obviously, that's helping us drive additional consumption. As we think about the future of Gatorade, we couldn't be more excited about what we see obviously, moving into other spaces, like I said, Natural. Obviously, you mentioned energy, those could be spaces. But where we see the biggest opportunity for Gatorade is in creating more of a personalized solution for athletes, and kind of amateur athletes like most of us, and creating a much more engaged relationship where we become advisors of the athletes of their hydration needs of all their nutrition needs. And we see an opportunity to create much more of a full ecosystem of engagement with the consumer, we provide solutions, we provide products, and we provide information. And I think that's the real future of Gatorade, which is a massive brand that has so much trust from consumers, I think we can leverage that trust in providing much more than just liquid hydration.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein of Evercore.\nRobert Ottenstein: Great, thank you very much. Just first a follow-up question on Energy. And that is can you talk about, as you look at your guidance for 2021, how much does your energy strategy built into it? What is the impact that you're modeling for Rockstar and Mountain Dew on your 2021 guidance? So that's just kind of follow-up question. And then, the bigger picture question is how do you assess the impact of people staying, spending more time at home, on the snacks business? How much increased demand did you see in 2020 from that particularly in the U.S. and the likelihood of that continuing? Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Hugh, you want to start with the energy?\nHugh Johnston: Energy, I'm happy to, Robert in terms of being one of the impact items for PBNA quickly the energy strategy is important to us. That's broad based, it's Rockstar, it's what we might do with Mountain Dew and obviously, the contributor as well, in terms of overall PepsiCo, yes it matters but I wouldn't call it a make or break type of item for the company this year. If things don't go as well as we expect, I think we've got enough other levers that that will be fine. It's important for PBNA to be sure.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, on the impact of the kind of the new mobility habits on snacks, I would say, we've lost a lot of high profit volume in both the convenience channel and the away from home channel. I mean, we always talk about beverages, but snacks had a pretty good impulse and away from home opportunity that we've lost and though that was high margin. On the opposite side, we're obviously seeing more consumption at home both kind of indulgence in terms of kind of at the end of the day, there's people need a break or during the day or during the day some break. And we are seeing more solo consumption, so more multi-pack small portion format. At the end probably bit of a net positive for the category. But, not massively in terms of what we are seeing across the world. Maybe a bit more developed -- in developed markets where we have more in-home consumption, maybe a more positive impact. But in developing markets where there is more of an away from home consumption, a negative impact. So, that's how -- for company those are the drivers depending on how the per capita consumption is built between in-home and out-home on the different occasions.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities.\nChris Carey: Hi, good morning. So, I just wanted to follow up a little bit on PD&A, and specifically around pricing and promotion. So, three quarters running of strong net pricing in the division. And I guess -- and you can see this showing up in the data as well. I mean are you getting more comfortable around the concepts of using price as more of a lever in PD&A over time? And then, maybe specifically, we are at record low promotions across the categories including you're your portfolio in North America. Do you think that you can keep these promotional levels lower as a strategy? And just in general, how sustainable you think these low promotions are? Or, whether we're going to see some sort of reversal in 2021 and that's factored in your outlook? Thanks.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. I think strategically we see the beverage category trying to understand better the consumer and give the consumer what he or she needs for every occasion and with the right pack and right price. That's a hugely lever of growth for our partners -- retail partners and for us. So trying to build kind of a profitable growth along the lines of the value we create for the consumer from the particular occasion. That's a big driver of opportunity. I think we have -- we are getting at that at PD&A and globally across the world understanding the really the drivers of every occasion and what is best and what is the portion, what is the sizing, what is the -- what will drive purchasing and consumption. So, that's a strategic driver. In terms of the promotional effort, I think we simplified promotional calendars with our customers everywhere given the simplification of the supply chain that we had to do. I think we have all learnt that there is some opportunities there. But, I am sure there will be a little bit of additional promotional efforts as the world opens up again. But, I think we've all learnt that the relative price of the beverage category in some format in the U.S. even you compare to other markets around the world was very, very low. And so, I think there is a strategic journey to make this category a bit more higher valued in general terms. And that's the journey that we are all in and that will obviously drive additional value for our retail partners and for ourselves.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Ramon Laguarta for any closing remarks.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, I wanted to thank you all of you for your support during the year and for your investments in PepsiCo. And hopefully, everybody stay safe, and all the best to all of you. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in PepsiCo's fourth quarter earnings question-and-answer session. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

Dara, obviously that there is a lot of items that are in our P&L, we've identified the COVID cost as something we wanted to call out because it was extraordinary. There will be COVID costs and significant COVID costs still in 2021. So you really can't pull all of that to the bottom line. In addition to that, we're [pouring some] [Ph] to the A&M, as Ramon mentioned, in the snack food business and a bit in the beverage business as well. But as we [technical difficulty] given the level of uncertainty, we felt like our long-term algorithm from a revenue and profit perspective was an appropriate goal for us. And I think if we hit these numbers as we expected I think it'll be a good -- [technical difficulty]. Yes, happy to, Ramon. Overall, our capital allocation strategy hasn't changed. We've talked about this many times. Number one, make sure that we fund the business to compete and grow. Number two is dividend. Number three is tuck-in M&A. And number four is share repurchase. One and two, obviously we've talked about in terms of our guidance. I would not expect, from the standpoint of the third one, I would not expect much in the way of M&A as we go through the course of this year and certainly nothing large. So, from that perspective, I think we have got a lot to digest right now. We're happy with where the portfolio sits. And then, last in terms of share repurchase, obviously we're trying to balance our debt rating versus our cash return to shareholders. We felt like the dividend increase was important. And at the same time, given the level of M&A that we had over the last couple of years, balancing that out with the debt rating, we made a decision that we're going to have significant share repurchase in this year. That's purely based on balancing the debt rating with our return to equity shareholder; nothing more that driving that decision. Yes, I am happy to take that, Ramon. Kaumil, obviously there is some pressure in commodities. We're viewing commodities as manageable right now. I'll remind you that we do forward buy on areas where we can of about -- typically about nine months ahead. But, we can't forward on everything. And obviously there is inflation in certain aspect of our cost structure. That said, the overall mix is as manageable between pricing and the balance of the P&L such that we don't expect it to be disruptive for the algorithm this year. Yes. Ramon, would you like to handle a little. Okay. Bryan, a couple of things on that, yes, it is elevated. We sort of have been running as you know about 5% of sales and now we are running a little bit north of 6%. And couple of big drivers behind it. Number one is the IT and digitalization spending that we are doing. That will be elevated for a couple of years as we sort of get through the combination of an ASP upgrade as well as a whole variety of digitalization efforts that we have going on in our supply chain and selling system. The second piece is primarily around growth capacity. And we expect that to be elevated for a couple of years. If you look at the way that we used to run the business, we ran capacity pretty close to the edge. And as we pivoted to more a growth strategy, we're taking capacity utilization down little bit to enable us to capture more of the growth opportunities that are out there. So, that's a big piece of the spend. And then, the last is productivity CapEx as we are looking at automation and looking at putting more capabilities into the plants that will yield cost savings that obviously is a big driver. So, I would say I would expect the capital spending to remain elevated for the next couple of years. And then, I would expect it to return back to our typical norms. Yes, I will do. Obviously, Steve, we didn't give specific cash flow guidance, but I think generally speaking, the profile of our cash flow will be similar to what you saw in 2020. Energy, I'm happy to, Robert in terms of being one of the impact items for PBNA quickly the energy strategy is important to us. That's broad based, it's Rockstar, it's what we might do with Mountain Dew and obviously, the contributor as well, in terms of overall PepsiCo, yes it matters but I wouldn't call it a make or break type of item for the company this year. If things don't go as well as we expect, I think we've got enough other levers that that will be fine. It's important for PBNA to be sure."

            "name": "Ramon Laguarta",
            "content": "Good morning. Yes, good morning, Bonnie. Yes, this Ramon. Listen, the advertising levels, I don't think we are maximized on -- [technical difficulty] in the investments. What we think is that the A&M line has opportunities for optimization, especially in what we call, Non-working, and we're working hard on optimizing that part. And obviously, we're working on optimizing the return on investment on the advertising part of the media that impacts the consumer. One of the decisions we took this year was, and if you look at Frito-Lay, for example, or some of our international business, we actually increased our A&M. And the reason for that is that within the formula for success of our portfolio we have to have our large brands growing at a decent pace, at the market level hopefully, and for that we need to keep them modernized, we have to keep innovating on those large brands. But also, we need to invest in the growth spaces of the category where sometimes we need to create new brands. And that requires a well-funded, a kind of support package to get those brands up and running. For example, if you think about the Frito portfolio, obviously we want to grow our Cheetos, Doritos, Tostitos, Lay's, Ruffles at a very good pace, and I think we're doing that. But at the same time we need to build healthier portfolios, some brands like Off the Eaten Path or Smartfoods or PopCorners or Bayer, all those brands need to grow to have a portfolio in the future, the same with our beverage portfolio, with Bubly or with some of the smaller brands we're creating. So, that's how we're thinking about our A&M optimization, obviously on the non-working, get the maximum ROI on the working part but ensure that we can support both the large brands and the smaller future brands in a way that we have a sustainable growth for the future. Great. Okay, Hugh, you want to take the first part, on the how we're thinking about the short-term, long-term, and in our algorithm. Yes, Dara. And so, that's -- we're thinking about, obviously, maximizing the short-term, but not at the expense of the long-term. And I think it's -- and to start a year thinking about our long-term algorithm is a good way to start focusing the company on a sustainable performance for many years. So that's how we're thinking about it. Then with regards to the marketing ROI, listen, we're getting much better at measuring the ROI in our marketing spends. And we think that -- actually we're, based on this measurement, we're getting much better at the ROI delivery of our investments. We're putting tools, and we're putting kind of performance metrics to our marketing teams. In particular, where you were saying about Frito, Frito has a very low level of advertising, I mean full A&M actually below 4% for a brand -- for a business that has so many multiple brands and has so much growth potential if you think about the share of macro-snacks that we have. So, I would think that if you think about the levers of growth for Frito in the future, I think A&M and an increased A&M should be part of it. As we think about our push model, it's pretty optimized with our DSD execution capabilities. I think on the pull side, we have opportunities probably to maximize the frequency and to maximize the other consumer connection with our brands and Frito versus what we do with other -- with some other parts of our business. So that's how we'll be thinking about the A&M investments at Frito. Okay, let me start with the geography part, and then Hugh, you can talk about the capital. There the, I would say, Europe, we're seeing different Europes. Now we're seeing Eastern Europe quite strong, I would say Russia extremely -- extremely strong, Turkey very strong. Some parts in Central Europe much better, by Central Europe I mean Germany and some of the more developed Europe. We're seeing the south of Europe very impacted by, obviously, the lack of tourism and people not going there for weekends or longer vacations. So that is how we see Europe. When we look at '21 we think, obviously, as mobility increases we're going to see even better performance in Western Europe. And hopefully we can continue to see the good performance in the East. What we can see in Europe across the board is we're becoming more competitive, our share of market performance both in beverages and snacks was very good this year, so we managed to gain share almost in every single market, which is actually the metric that we're following the most in a period of time where the markets go up and down depending on lockdowns, et cetera. In Latin America, actually Brazil has been very strong throughout the year. And we feel very good about our Brazilian business also in terms of share of market, but also category growth has been very, very positive in Brazil. Mexico, at the beginning of the pandemic, we suffered a little bit in the [cap pillar] [Ph] part of our business, so the more kind of smaller fragment trade, we saw traffic down and that impacted our sales given that we have a very good distribution and availability in the market. The business came back to much more solid performance in the last quarter in Mexico. And although we've been gaining share across the year, we're seeing also the category recovering in Mexico. So hopefully we see a much better performance in Mexico this year in absolute terms, relative terms, I think we'll continue to gain share in the market. So those are the two big markets in Latin America, you get a good sign from those two. And Hugh, you want to talk about the capital principles that we have? Hugh? Yes, please, go ahead. I'll add to it. Yes. Thank you, Lauren, and yes, a good question. Listen, let's talk first about Bang quickly. We're surprised by this move by VPX and especially given that, it was a very good performance value PBNA on the distribution metrics, but at the end of the day, we plan to continue to be in the distributor of Bang until October 23. And we're going to do our best to make that brand well distributed in the marketplace, but the core of our energy study was never Bang it's a distribution cherry on top. It was obviously what we could do with our brands after the acquisition of Rockstar kind of free adapt from some of the contractual obligations we had. So, the first pillar is obviously Rockstar. Rockstar re-launch both in the U.S. and its expansion internationally as of our core energy kind of mainstream proposition. I would say the integration of Rockstar into our supply chain is starting to happen. It's going to be a bit of a process until we got all the formulations and everything into our system, but obviously that's going to make it a better supply chain in itself. From the consumer point of view we are -- you saw we're planning to invest in the brand. I think we found a consumer space where it's going to be a bit quite differentiated and then were you are improving the formulas and we're improving the building different propositions for multiple spaces in that kind of mainstream energy. At the same time, you will be seeing shortly some announcements on Mountain Dew launch in the spring time. This is going to be the first big move for Mountain Dew into the energy space. We're very happy with the way the product concept, the support package and the support we're getting from our customers in terms of the launch. So that, that there would be a good event and it will be the first move of Mountain Dew and there will be future moves as well from Mountain Dew into the energy space. Obviously, one of our big pillars in energies are Starbucks partnership, which is I think is at an all-time high in terms of their relationship and the market performance. We continue to innovate on the -- kind of coffee, energy, Triple Shot, Double Shots. And we have some good ideas that will I'm sure will make into the market shortly. So, and then we're looking at other brands in the sports area and some other kind of spaces within the energy management, energy up, energy down that I think we can have a multiple set of solutions and brands that drive consumer solutions in a space that is obviously growing and as a lot of consumer pools. So, it's important for us, as we said, both from the growth point of view and the margin expansion point of view, and we feel good about the steps we're taking brick by brick to build a solid foundation for us to play in energy over many years. So, that's pretty much long, and you will see more news from us in the coming weeks. Yes, great question. Yes. As you think about we're creating spaces for future growth, one of them is plant-based snacking, plant-based convenient solutions. We've seen that Beyond Meat was the right partner in terms of -- we did a lot of due diligence in terms of R&D capabilities and kind of willingness to share with us in the future. And we have high expectations for that. There should be no implication for our 2021 kind of investment or high sales is going to be still a small business for us in 2021, but we plan to be in the market within this year. Yes, that's great. Good question. Listen, if you think back and you see the growth opportunity for PepsiCo, we are -- you think about the large LRB category globally were about less than 10% on a $600 billion category, growing out of 4% or 5%. And pretty much the same with micro snacks, a large category, $500 billion-$600 billion globally and we are less than 10%. So, growth as the lever for the long-term value creation of these companies is clearly the number one. Great, listen, let me take it first, and then, Hugh can add. I think the conversations were started about a couple of years ago was we want to make sure that we got PBNA to be a growth engine. And I think, brick-by-brick, we've been able to build kind of make sure our brands are all growth brands. And I think we're there and the latest quarter five plus growth shows that, okay, we're most of our brands are performing at a very good level, that was critical, because we thought that, there's no way to cut your costs in a way that is sustainable. So, now we have, I think good, good machine that has the right local execution capabilities, and the good brands and innovation now, we have the intentions to work obviously, on the margin expansion of PBNA. That is a priority for us, a priority for the business. We see this business long-term in mid-teens. We want to do it in a sustainable way where we keep growing with a category and expand our margins. And we have, obviously ideas on how do we be able to categories, segments of the category that are highly more profitable, how we get better at selling the right pack in the right place at the right price. So, our revenue management capabilities, we have a lot of cost opportunities in the end-to-end supply chain management, and also the way we support the business in some of our G&A expenses and a little bit of on our A&M as you mentioned, optimizations are all of that should give us the opportunities to continue to grow, add the category, and it's starting to expand the margins, this year should be a year where you see already some movement in that regard. And as I said earlier, we see this business getting into the teens margins over the long run, and without sacrificing competitive performance. Yes, I think listen, obviously, we all had to take a look at our supply chain, right during this year, because it's been a challenging year from the supply chain point of view, given the number of infected people that we had in our supply chain, and so on. So, simplifying our portfolios has been a solution to continue to have elevated levels of supply to our customers, which has been our focus. I think as we go forward, and consumers move back to more of a bit of more of a normal life and physical stores, continue to be a meaningful part of their shopping experience, I think consumers will go back to experimenting a little bit more. And they will be looking for innovation and smaller SKUs. So I think we're going to see a small, slow return back to a bit more complex portfolios. But I think we've all learned that maybe the tail of their portfolio was not really delivering the returns that we needed to have for every SKU that we had in the marketplace. So I think there's going to be an optimization of the portfolios, but an increasing complexity as well versus what we have today, even though the consumers will be asking for a bit more experimentation and especially in our categories, where variety is a key driver of purchase. Okay, Hugh, you want to? No, hold on, let me just say a few words on the Gatorade. I think Gatorade we're seeing Gatorade, clearly, growing very fast. Part of it is our innovation; especially Zero has been an amazing innovation is proud that $1 billion retail sales value already for a year, I mean, that's a meaningful sizable innovation. And we're seeing obviously people exercising more. And obviously, that's helping us drive additional consumption. As we think about the future of Gatorade, we couldn't be more excited about what we see obviously, moving into other spaces, like I said, Natural. Obviously, you mentioned energy, those could be spaces. But where we see the biggest opportunity for Gatorade is in creating more of a personalized solution for athletes, and kind of amateur athletes like most of us, and creating a much more engaged relationship where we become advisors of the athletes of their hydration needs of all their nutrition needs. And we see an opportunity to create much more of a full ecosystem of engagement with the consumer, we provide solutions, we provide products, and we provide information. And I think that's the real future of Gatorade, which is a massive brand that has so much trust from consumers, I think we can leverage that trust in providing much more than just liquid hydration. Hugh, you want to start with the energy? Yes, on the impact of the kind of the new mobility habits on snacks, I would say, we've lost a lot of high profit volume in both the convenience channel and the away from home channel. I mean, we always talk about beverages, but snacks had a pretty good impulse and away from home opportunity that we've lost and though that was high margin. On the opposite side, we're obviously seeing more consumption at home both kind of indulgence in terms of kind of at the end of the day, there's people need a break or during the day or during the day some break. And we are seeing more solo consumption, so more multi-pack small portion format. At the end probably bit of a net positive for the category. But, not massively in terms of what we are seeing across the world. Maybe a bit more developed -- in developed markets where we have more in-home consumption, maybe a more positive impact. But in developing markets where there is more of an away from home consumption, a negative impact. So, that's how -- for company those are the drivers depending on how the per capita consumption is built between in-home and out-home on the different occasions. Yes. I think strategically we see the beverage category trying to understand better the consumer and give the consumer what he or she needs for every occasion and with the right pack and right price. That's a hugely lever of growth for our partners -- retail partners and for us. So trying to build kind of a profitable growth along the lines of the value we create for the consumer from the particular occasion. That's a big driver of opportunity. I think we have -- we are getting at that at PD&A and globally across the world understanding the really the drivers of every occasion and what is best and what is the portion, what is the sizing, what is the -- what will drive purchasing and consumption. So, that's a strategic driver. In terms of the promotional effort, I think we simplified promotional calendars with our customers everywhere given the simplification of the supply chain that we had to do. I think we have all learnt that there is some opportunities there. But, I am sure there will be a little bit of additional promotional efforts as the world opens up again. But, I think we've all learnt that the relative price of the beverage category in some format in the U.S. even you compare to other markets around the world was very, very low. And so, I think there is a strategic journey to make this category a bit more higher valued in general terms. And that's the journey that we are all in and that will obviously drive additional value for our retail partners and for ourselves. Yes, I wanted to thank you all of you for your support during the year and for your investments in PepsiCo. And hopefully, everybody stay safe, and all the best to all of you. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to PepsiCo\u2019s Third Quarter Earnings Question-and-Answer Session. Your lines have been placed on listen only until it is your turn to ask a question. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s call is being recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Ravi Pamnani, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Pamnani, you may begin.\nRavi Pamnani: Thank you, operator. I hope everyone has had a chance this morning to review our press release and prepared comments, both of which are available on our website. Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. We may make forward\u2010looking statements on today\u2019s call, including about our business plans, 2020 outlook and the potential impact of the COVID\u201019 pandemic on our business. Forward\u2010looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties and only reflect our view as of today, and we are under no obligation to update. When discussing our results, we may refer to non\u2010GAAP measures, which exclude certain items from reported results. Please refer to today\u2019s earnings release and 10-Q available on pepsico.com for definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures and additional information regarding our results, including a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from forward-looking statements. Joining me today are PepsiCo\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Ramon Laguarta; and PepsiCo\u2019s Vice Chairman and CFO, Hugh Johnston. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question. And with that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: Hi, can you hear me?\nRamon Laguarta: We can.\nDara Mohsenian: Okay, great. So good morning. With the better-than-expected results here in Q3 and for full-year earnings guidance, we\u2019re likely to end up with a pretty solid 2020 earnings result, all things considered post-COVID. So I know you won\u2019t guide explicitly for next year. But just trying to understand at a high level, do you view 2020 as a depressed earnings result in sort of a depressed earnings base that we should see outsize growth off of as we look out for 2021, particularly as COVID cost drop off, or is your bias more to reinvest any assumed drop off in COVID cost? And perhaps you can just discuss some of the key puts and takes potentially looking out to 2021 relative to what\u2019s obviously an abnormal 2020?\nRamon Laguarta: Okay. Good morning, Dara. Yes, listen, we\u2019re very happy with the quarter and how our investments are starting to deliver in terms of, I would say, a global market share improvement and sustained top line acceleration, and also how some of that is flowing down to the bottom of the P&L, as you saw in our EPS numbers. In terms of your question of, are we going to keep investing or not? You \u2013 I think, you know our philosophy, we\u2019ve been trying to have sustainable growth for the business, top line, bottom line, very balanced in that respect. I think there are continuous reinvestment required in terms of brands pivoting into new spaces or new capabilities require because of the new ways consumers are shopping, especially around the omni-channel transformation, their sustainability reinvestment is required. So we\u2019re going to continue to run the business in a very balanced way, right, where we\u2019re going to flow to the bottom line, along the lines of what we said a couple of years ago when we define our high single-digit ambition for EPS long-term. And \u2013 but make sure that we don\u2019t sacrifice their investments that are required for a company of our scale to remain competitive long-term, given what\u2019s going on externally. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about the business. Obviously, we\u2019ll give you more information in February. We\u2019ll know more about how the pandemic evolves, the cost that will still be required to run the business. I would not be assuming at this point that the pandemic cost will go away by next year. I think, we\u2019ll continue to have to put some costs back into the business to run the business safely. So, more in February, but I just wanted you to get the philosophy how we\u2019re thinking about the long-term reinvestment in the business and the delivery of our EPS on a yearly basis.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: Hi, good morning, and I hope all is well. So you just spoke on the resilience of the business in developed markets and the recovery in beverage, in particular, North American and also in Europe. So I was hoping if you can elaborate more, Ramon, on the trends for the on-premises with the reopening? And how are you planning your price points in places in emerging markets where the recession may be, will be hitting more of the consumer?\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. Hi, Andrea. Good. Yes, listen \u2013 yes, I can give you a bit more color on the away-from-home business. It has rebounded from the very lows of April, May, right? It\u2019s better. There\u2019s more mobility. There\u2019s more traffic in some channels. I would say there\u2019s a lot of innovation in a lot of the customers, so they\u2019re adapting to the new reality, especially restaurants and some entrepreneurs are finding ways to adjust. So \u2013 but it still is a very big drag into \u2013 in our business. I would say, in the levels of 30% to 40% versus drag or negative still in most of the developed markets. So it\u2019s still a very negative. It\u2019s better than the minus 60, 70s that we had in the April, May. But I\u2019m sure, it\u2019s going to be improving, right? We see some channels still hurting a lot, like hospitality or entertainment or transportation. Those are still very low. We see some other channels improving. And we\u2019re obviously going to lean into those channels to capture most of the growth. So that\u2019s the first part. On the second part, Andrea, the \u2013 yes, we see developing markets, especially I would say, Latin America, parts of Africa, Middle East, starting to feel the economic challenges for a lot of the households. So people are starting to \u2013 there\u2019s a bit more unemployment. And there\u2019s, obviously, these possible income challenges for many families. We tend to do well in those circumstances. Our \u2013 we can adjust our price points quite fast and we have good playbooks on how to play in recessions, how to adjust entry points to the category, how to deliver good value on some of the family sizes that are now preferred as well. So I think, we\u2019re going to do okay. We tend to do okay in this situations. But yes, there is, I would say, Latin America and Africa, Middle East, signs of economic challenges for many households.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Goldman Sachs.\nBonnie Herzog: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I had a question on your FY 2020 guidance, which implies that organic sales growth should, I guess, modestly accelerate to, I think, around 5% in Q4 versus the 4.2% you recorded in Q3. But then when I think about your full-year EPS guidance, that implies EPS growth in the fourth quarter will moderate a fair amount to around \u2013 or from the 9% that you\u2019re reporting in Q3 to around 3%. So I just really wanted to understand how conservative your guidance might be, especially as I think about you facing maybe even fewer COVID-related headwinds as you round up the year. And then, maybe you guys could touch on what that assumes for A&M spending in Q4? I guess, it could assume a pretty big step up and maybe put pressure on your margins, but drive an acceleration in your top line. So any color there would be helpful. Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Hugh, you want to cover this one?\nHugh Johnston: Yes, happy to. Good morning, Bonnie. A couple of things. Maybe you and Ravi can talk a little bit. My math is a little different on the top line for Q4. I think it lands somewhere in the mid-4s based on the implied full-year backing into Q4. In terms of the margin implications, probably the biggest factor in all of it will continue to be the COVID cost. We mentioned that we had about $150 million worth of COVID costs in Q3 and that will continue to some degree in Q4 as well. And it\u2019s a bit of a longer quarter in that regard. In addition to that, you know that where our A&M spend is booked on a curve. And as we get into the fourth quarter, the curve will be affected by the full-year A&M spend. So I think it\u2019s a bit more of a drag in Q4 than it was in Q3. So nothing beyond those things, nothing in terms of other big notable costs other than higher A&M and COVID costs that, that will continue based on what you\u2019ve seen so far.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane: Hey, good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask question about PBNA and good sequential improvement in the third quarter. And I guess, Ramon, what I\u2019d like to understand now is, now that you\u2019ve got an energy drink \u2013 a more comprehensive energy drink portfolio can you elaborate a little bit more on some of the things you\u2019re going to do to potentially, I guess, take advantage of this situation? You\u2019ve got a largely company-owned bottling system, you\u2019ve got the resources to spend. So are there opportunities to begin to accelerate market share from here? And then maybe if you could just touch on in this \u2013 in the third quarter, specifically, were there any market share issues or any issues with out of stocks relative to maybe can shortages or packaging?\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. Hey, Bryan, how are you? Good \u2013 yes, good question. Listen, when we talked about PBNA about a year ago, I would say, we\u2019re going to try to go one step at a time trying to fix all the different opportunities we had with different brands, right? And the truth is that Q3 is a good reflection of that effort that the team has done over the last year, year-and-a-half. If you look at every one of our large brands is accelerating, so Pepsi is growing, Mountain Dew, good growth. Gatorade, good \u2013 very good growth, I would say. Our coffees, our teas, our juices are growing double-digit. So very good performance across. We\u2019ve then \u2013 with regards to the energy integration, as you can imagine, there\u2019s a lot of small details, right, in \u2013 operational details in integrating a business like Bang, which is quite sizable and trying to move it from a very dispersed distribution setup to a more consolidated one. So in every state, we had different anecdotes and also the Rockstar integration. So I think the team has done a very good job in terms of both the integration and now we\u2019re starting to run it as a full business now. So to your question on the future, I think, we\u2019re going to continue to double down on what I think has driven the success, which is very good innovation, right? So if you think about all our Zero, innovation is doing very well. Gatorade Zero, massive innovation. Mountain Dew Zero is doing very well. It\u2019s starting to bring new consumers into the franchise, a younger consumers that we had not been very successful with. So we feel good about that. Pepsi Zero, growing very nicely, then, obviously, bubly continues to do very well. So we\u2019ll continue to double down on innovation as a lever. We\u2019ll continue to double down on execution and becoming a better operating company. So I think, the changes we made to our organization to more of a division structure is giving us more granularity and more local excellence, if you wish. In terms of execution, we\u2019re going to double down on that. The energy portfolio gives us a much more scale in the convenience channel, which was a \u2013 some sort of a weakness for us. And so we\u2019re improving in that channel, if you see the market share in convenience stores in the summer, great progress. So we\u2019re happy with how we\u2019re doing in that respect. So we\u2019ll continue with the playbook, it\u2019s working for us. Now we have one more set of tools in our arsenal with this energy portfolio. We\u2019re happy with the way Gatorade is working. We\u2019re seeing a lot of more people exercising is a good trend. We like it. People are exercising at home. People are embracing daily routines of exercising that helps the sports during category and obviously Gatorade as a leader in that category. So we see a lot of positives for growth in the portfolio and then we\u2019re happy with Mountain Dew. Mountain Dew Zero has been a great addition to the team. And it\u2019s, I mean, it\u2019s getting to scale and is getting very good trial, very good repeats in \u2013 and is very incremental to the brand. So I think, you will see, I think, that sustained performance in PBNA. And hopefully, we can \u2013 yes, improve our market competitiveness as we go along.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.\nNik Modi: Hi. Good morning, everyone. I just had a quick clarification question than my real question. Ramon, I was hoping you could just clarify your comments around the COVID-related costs and saying that, you expect them to stick around in 2021, or beyond this year. I just wanted to see if you can just clarify like how much of it actually, out of the total pool of COVID costs, do you actually think we\u2019ll stick around? And then my actual question is just on Pepsi Beverages North America and its margin profile. So, margins today are 400, 500 basis points below the peak. So I\u2019m just trying to understand how you\u2019re philosophically thinking about the migration of that margin backup to kind of where they used to be? I mean, is this something that you want to really see happen quickly? Or you think it\u2019ll be much more of a measured pace? Any thoughts around that would be helpful?\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. To \u2013 yes, on the COVID costs, my point is, I don\u2019t know how the pandemic would evolve. But I think it\u2019s going to be very likely that we still have to be very careful and keep our people safe for a large part of the year, next year. It\u2019s not going to be as much as what we had these years, especially at the beginning. I think, we\u2019re getting better at this or finding much effective ways to run the business under this difficult circumstances. But there\u2019s going to be a \u2013 still some inefficiency and some additional costs because of COVID. So that was my point. With regards to the PBNA business and the shape of its \u2013 the portfolio and profitability, obviously, we want to get back to a much higher levels. The speed of the transition to the higher levels will depend on our success to drive market share and to drive efficiency on our, especially S&D and supply chain, which is where I think we have more of the opportunity. So we have a sense of urgency in all these in becoming a better performing top line company and improving the efficiency of the business. As you can see from the Q3 results, it\u2019s a good performance. But we\u2019re not going to sacrifice the long-term for the short-term. So we\u2019re going to continue to invest in our brands, make sure that they\u2019re well funded, that we continue to keep our consumers in our brands, keep them engaged. We innovate with well-funded innovation, and that we invest in data, especially data and infrastructure investments are required to pivot to the multi, the omni-channel world that we\u2019re living. And we\u2019re not going to sacrifice those investments for an accelerated profit improvement, but you should see profit improvement in PBNA going forward.\nHugh Johnston: Hey, Ramon, if I can just add to next question a bit on the COVID cost. Nik, to build on Ramon\u2019s answer, but I obviously upfront there were sort of two implications. One was around taking reserves around potential losses due to customer \u2013 customers exiting their businesses, particularly in the foodservice area. And then the second piece of the cost is personal protective equipment and sanitation and things like that, which is more ongoing. In Q3 and Q4, those numbers are sort of landing at about $150-or-so-million. Depending on the course of the pandemic for next year, obviously, we\u2019re going to need to continue to protect our people. So those costs, obviously, will continue until we get to a point where we have a different outcome from the perspective of the virus.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Good morning. You touched a little bit on your ability to move quickly in emerging markets to adjust pricing in a challenging macroeconomic environment. I was curious, number one, the degree to which you\u2019ve already started to make those moves, because in some of those markets, that price mix was a little bit below what I\u2019ve modeled the volume was a bit better. So I was curious kind of to what degree you\u2019ve already started to put that playbook into place? And then from a longer-term perspective, Ramon, I think, a year-and-a-half ago, when you first started communicating with the Street about your longer-term plans, you talked about the need to broaden out the portfolio in international staffing into the value tiers, and that\u2019s where kind of your share performance wasn\u2019t quite what it could be. So I was curious if you\u2019ve made any progress on that front, of course, knowing COVID kind of interrupted business as usual. But I was curious about any progress there as well?\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, yes, it\u2019s good. No, listen, I think, international is probably the biggest opportunity we have long-term, right? I mean, the per caps in both our beverages and our snacks is very low. And we see that as our number one driver of future value for the company. So that\u2019s a big focus for us. We\u2019ve seen the levers to drive per capita consumption. Affordability clearly is a big one for us. And we continue to make progress on adjusting our cost structures to the different market realities. And that allows us to have much more flexibility on the price points and on the \u2013 then what we decide to do with the different levels of tearing of the market. So the big enabler if you want for being a really affordable product, and that would drive per caps is our cost structures. And I think we\u2019re making great progress on adjusting a lot of the leavers off that at the end are the cost be it in the supply chain, be it in the G&A, be it in the selling and distribution. So we\u2019re \u2013 I think, we\u2019re making great progress on adjusting the decisions we make on supply, delivery, and management for the different realities in the different developing markets. And that\u2019s driving affordability. That\u2019s driving, as you were saying, volume increase, even in a situation where a lot of those markets are suffering. Obviously, a lot of smaller stores are still closed. And there\u2019s a lot of adjustment to the COVID reality in many of those markets from the consumer and customer point of view. But our strategic intent continues to be that one, reduction of costs, adjustment of the price points and continue to invest in the brands and the innovation that will drive the per cap development in international.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala of Credit Suisse.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Hey, good morning, guys. Can we talk a little bit about Quaker and if we should be thinking about Quaker differently long-term. And that right now, obviously, it\u2019s benefiting from the environment that we\u2019re in. But is there anything happening there that might suggest trends could look different on a run rate basis for that part of your business?\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. A couple of things there. Number one, we\u2019re gaining penetration in a good way with Quaker, most of the segments in the Quaker business in these last six months. So we\u2019ve gained penetration. We\u2019re investing to retain those new families. And obviously, to increase frequency in the \u2013 was a pretty large penetrated brand is known as more penetrated. So again, make sure that consumers kind of reconnect with the brand. And with the transformation we made to the portfolio in the last few years, eliminating artificials or making the product, I would say, more forward-looking products. So I think that, that work is in motion. And I think consumers are voting that they like our products and they\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019re gaining share in many of the sub-segments of the Quaker family. Now, going forward, our assumptions and \u2013 but it\u2019s still to be validated with future. We need to see where the consumer really ends up. I think, there\u2019s going to be more cooking and eating occasions at home going forward. Especially we think that breakfast, there will be at least one or two more occasions at home every week, because I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to go back to work in the same way that we used to. And that\u2019s our assumption at this point, obviously, we can be right or we can be wrong. But if you judge by how in developed markets, everybody is thinking about their return to the offices, I think, it\u2019s going to be a much more flexible environment and much more tech-enabled remote kind of work, where consumers will be at home a few days of the week. And that will drive, I think, a different behavior in terms of breakfast consumption and potentially some of the other meals during the day, especially lunch. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about the long-term category growth and we\u2019re trying to position ourselves to compete well in that new environment, where they should be more occasions for our products.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein of Evercore.\nRobert Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. First, just a clarification of your pre-recorded tape, in which you said, you expect the U.S. to be fairly steady, but international being somewhat choppy. I\u2019m wondering if you could tell us kind of what you actually saw in September in international markets to drive that? And then my main question is, you put out now some very interesting direct-to-consumer businesses in the U.S., realizing that they\u2019re very small today. But can you talk about what you\u2019re learning from those in terms of the consumer behavior habits and innovation? And how you expect to use those direct-to-consumer channels in the future? Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. The direct-to-consumer models, as you\u2019re saying, is more of a \u2013 an attempt for us to stay closer to the consumer, read them, understand reaction to early innovation, and then obviously taken mainstream into the balance of the channels. So it is still, as you\u2019re saying, very embryonary, smaller percentage, but we\u2019re getting a good insights. And we\u2019re going to \u2013 we plan to obviously scale them up a little bit and get better at reading consumers early, test and learning with our innovation and also improving the way we segment consumers. We have prototypes of consumers that we can innovate and talk to in our communication. So that that\u2019s the journey going forward. In terms of the COVID in international, as you read around, there is an increase in COVID cases in, especially Europe, I would say. They had managed to control the pandemic pretty well. Now, September, they\u2019ve seen a number of cases going up. The way we\u2019re seeing governments managing the situation so far is with local restrictions. When that happens, the business gets a little bit impacted, but not as much, obviously, as it was during the April, May more dramatic restrictions on people mobility. So we\u2019re not seeing the business being impacted much at this point. That doesn\u2019t mean that, as the winter comes, and there is either have \u2013 the government have to take more restrictions that, the business may be a little bit more impacted, especially on the away-from-home and some of the more popular channels. So far we haven\u2019t seen that. And we\u2019ve seen the governments making very \u2013 a bit more balanced decisions between keeping the economy going and trying to protect everybody against the spread of the pandemic. So that\u2019s the situation, especially in Europe, as we \u2013 as we\u2019ve seen the situation evolve in there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: Yes. Thanks very much. Ramon, when you think back to the original, faster, better, stronger framework that you laid out early last year, any investment priorities that you laid out alongside that? I guess, I\u2019m curious just to hear whether the experiences of 2020 have altered those priorities at all. I\u2019m interested, whether there are key things that have been permanently accelerated or added new to the mix versus other things that maybe have been deprioritized, even if only temporarily? And I guess, related to that, maybe this is for Hugh. Just \u2013 I just know that CapEx for the year is about \u2013 is now coming in about $1 billion lower versus your original outlook when 2020 started? And should we consider that simply a deferral? Or have you found efficiencies to more structurally reduce those investments? Thanks.\nRamon Laguarta: That\u2019s good question. Listen, I think, we\u2019re happy that we had that framework going into these pandemic, right, both The PepsiCo Way is with very clear behaviors for our people and has helped us a lot in managing through the pandemic, especially when we have now a more kind of empower organization making more decisions in the frontline. And they have a very, I think, good framework clarity on what\u2019s expected, and that \u2013 and that\u2019s helping us perform. In terms of the three vectors you were referring to the fastest, stronger, better, we\u2019re happy with the faster. Clearly, we\u2019re becoming more competitive in the marketplace. As we look into the future, I think, we \u2013 the \u2013 we\u2019re going to have to probably go more after drivers of share, because categories might slowdown a little bit. So I think innovation brands, execution will play a very high role in trying to capture that market share. When you look at the stronger, we had some, obviously, it was part of the agenda to invest in becoming a much better omni-channel company, right? So e-commerce was big. Supply chain flexibility was big to enable that omni-channel. Obviously, I mean, the \u2013 what\u2019s happened that you saw the numbers, the penetration of e-commerce or e-grocery is just accelerated by three years now. So we had forecasted to be three, four years from now, it\u2019s happening now. So that is a big focus of the organization, how do we accelerate the pivot into the omni-channel much faster, which means that, we\u2019re going to have to hop some of the capabilities that, that we have. I think we\u2019ve made great progress in how we deal with consumer data and how we have much more performance marketing, we improve in a lot of the \u2013 those capabilities, creating internal content, all that is happening on the flexibility of the supply chain as well. I think we were lucky that we made a lot of investments in additional capacity last year, and that\u2019s helping us this year, big time and helping us to have more flexibility. So good progress there. I think, we need to pivot with more of a sense of urgency. The other area where we\u2019re doubling down is what we call holistic cost management. Holistic cost management was a capability we had. But clearly, we need more of that in terms of being able to repurpose money from one part of the P&L to another part of P&L. And where we have inefficiencies to get rid of those inefficiencies to reinvest back, where the \u2013 where we\u2019re going to get the best ROI in terms of growth and flow through. So that, that capability, I think, we\u2019ve made good progress. That\u2019s another area where we put in a lot of emphasis. On the better side, I would say, the social consciousness. I mean, the need for becoming much more of a social company, no social company, but social aware company, both in terms of the environment and the inequalities, I think, has also increased, given the pandemic. So you saw, we increased the foundation funding. We\u2019re also quite focused on improving all our environmental footprint. So those are areas that more than changing the trajectory is more a sense of urgency to get them done earlier, as the consumer and society is expecting us to, I think, go faster in those areas.\nOperator: Your next question\u2026\nHugh Johnston: Yes. And Steve, to finish off on your question around CapEx. Clearly, there\u2019s some element of timing as COVID has made it more difficult to execute capital projects. But I would also tell you, we spent a lot of time and energy around identifying new low-cost sources of capital and doing things in a much more efficient way that clearly is going to benefit the level of spending going forward. So in terms of specifics, more to come in February. But I would tell you, we are getting more efficient with capital spending.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy of Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: Great. Thanks. Congratulations, guys. Great results so far year-to-date. Ramon, question for you. We\u2019ve covered a lot of ground. I did want to ask you about your openness to moving into the alcohol space, specifically hard seltzer. So, as you know, the category has been growing rapidly. You\u2019ve seen Coca-Cola\u2019s launch here with Topo Chico in Latin America. Recently, they plan to launch in the U.S. next year with Molson Coors. There\u2019s also discussion that Monster and perhaps some others, non-alcohol players may be moving into the space. So I was hoping you could comment on your openness to moving into hard seltzers. Is this an area that PepsiCo is looking at? How much time are you spending internally? And then maybe some of the governors that may be in place around that possible decision? Thank you very much.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, welcome. Listen, our focus today, 100% focus is getting the energy strategy right, in terms of executing that. I think, as I said earlier, is a multi-vector strategy that requires, both Rockstar doing very well. It requires to do a great job with Bang. It requires innovation in Mountain Dew to move into that space and then do a great job with Starbucks. So those four big pillars, that\u2019s taking a lot of our focus and that\u2019s going to be our priority, right, especially 2021. And I think you will see great progress in all those four fronts. Now, obviously, we look at every opportunity, right, there is in the industry \u2013 and a couple of years ago, it was CBD. Now, it\u2019s more alcohol. So we get a lot of opportunities in front of us. Of course, we\u2019re looking at all of them and, of course, we have people that are thinking more long-term versus the very immediate 2021. So, we\u2019re reflecting. We\u2019re thinking, what are the best options. And we will make the decisions in the coming quarters, whether this is an area where PepsiCo wants to play. And then more importantly, how do we capture a lot of value of this opportunity is \u2013 given this three-tier system is not obvious how you capture a lot of value. So there is a, first, I would say, do we play or not? Second, very important is who do we play with and who do we partner to maximize the value for PepsiCo?\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet of Guggenheim.\nLaurent Grandet: Hey, good morning, Ramon and Hugh. And despite the current environment, we could see a strong quarter. So congrats to the entire team. Let us uncover [ph]. So just a clarification, maybe on PBNA\u2019s results, strong results in the quarter, especially in the on-premises, as the on-premises in there continued to suffer. So maybe you could help us reconcile the difference between what we are seeing in Nielsen from your reporting numbers. So could you tell us how big value is e-commerce and on-premise channels for PBNA and the growth you\u2019re seeing in those two channels? Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, Laurent. I mean, there has been quite a discrepancy always between the Nielsen numbers and the full performance of PBNA. So I would not go into the details of what is its channel. Obviously, e-commerce is booming and e-commerce is large. But there\u2019s much more than e-commerce between the final, I would say, results of the company and what Nielsen covers in its review samples. So, that\u2019s as much as I can say. There\u2019s obviously away-from-home. There\u2019s many channels that are not well covered, including some, I would say, organized channels that are not well covered by Nielsen.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Bill Chappell of Truist Securities.\nGrant O\u2019Brien: Hey, this is actually Grant on for Bill. Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick one on Frito and the competitive dynamics in that space. You have a fairly large regional competitor that is now public and talked about some geographic expansion opportunities across the U.S. So wondering if you guys have seen anything different so far in the competitive dynamics we\u2019re pricing in that space? Or if you would expect to maybe over the next couple of years, I know, there has been a focus on share and holding share, gaining share in this call. So wondering if that changed your strategy or their strategy going forward? Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, great question. We like, obviously, our category savory, and there\u2019s all the people that like it as well. So it\u2019s obviously driving new entrants from people that were not playing in savory and people that were playing savory and have extended their ambitions to play beyond their original geographical limitation. So I think we welcome competition in that sense to me. The more competitors and more investments in the brands, the higher \u2013 the larger and the category becomes. That\u2019s my experience globally, and I think it\u2019s everywhere in the world. So we welcome players to the arena, players that they play with the levers that, I think, develop the category, which is advertising, innovation, better products. Those are the levers that develop a category and we welcome anyone in the business. It\u2019s hard to compete with freedom, right, given the advantages that the company has the scale of the brands, the distribution systems, the cost advantage, everything else. So, it\u2019s not easy to compete with Frito, but I think it\u2019s good that we have multiple competitors and that develops a category.\nOperator: That was our final question. Are there any closing remarks?\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. Thank you very much, everybody, for your time this morning and your questions \u2013 insightful questions. And thank you for the confidence you\u2019ve put in the company and your investments in PepsiCo. And please stay safe and look forward to talking to you soon. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s PepsiCo third quarter earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Hugh Johnston",
            "content": "Yes, happy to. Good morning, Bonnie. A couple of things. Maybe you and Ravi can talk a little bit. My math is a little different on the top line for Q4. I think it lands somewhere in the mid-4s based on the implied full-year backing into Q4. In terms of the margin implications, probably the biggest factor in all of it will continue to be the COVID cost. We mentioned that we had about $150 million worth of COVID costs in Q3 and that will continue to some degree in Q4 as well. And it's a bit of a longer quarter in that regard. In addition to that, you know that where our A&M spend is booked on a curve. And as we get into the fourth quarter, the curve will be affected by the full-year A&M spend. So I think it's a bit more of a drag in Q4 than it was in Q3. So nothing beyond those things, nothing in terms of other big notable costs other than higher A&M and COVID costs that, that will continue based on what you've seen so far. Hey, Ramon, if I can just add to next question a bit on the COVID cost. Nik, to build on Ramon's answer, but I obviously upfront there were sort of two implications. One was around taking reserves around potential losses due to customer \u2013 customers exiting their businesses, particularly in the foodservice area.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Ramon Laguarta",
            "content": "We can. Okay. Good morning, Dara. Yes, listen, we're very happy with the quarter and how our investments are starting to deliver in terms of, I would say, a global market share improvement and sustained top line acceleration, and also how some of that is flowing down to the bottom of the P&L, as you saw in our EPS numbers. In terms of your question of, are we going to keep investing or not? You \u2013 I think, you know our philosophy, we've been trying to have sustainable growth for the business, top line, bottom line, very balanced in that respect. I think there are continuous reinvestment required in terms of brands pivoting into new spaces or new capabilities require because of the new ways consumers are shopping, especially around the omni-channel transformation, their sustainability reinvestment is required. So we're going to continue to run the business in a very balanced way, right, where we're going to flow to the bottom line, along the lines of what we said a couple of years ago when we define our high single-digit ambition for EPS long-term. And \u2013 but make sure that we don't sacrifice their investments that are required for a company of our scale to remain competitive long-term, given what's going on externally. So that's how we're thinking about the business. Obviously, we'll give you more information in February. We'll know more about how the pandemic evolves, the cost that will still be required to run the business. I would not be assuming at this point that the pandemic cost will go away by next year. I think, we'll continue to have to put some costs back into the business to run the business safely. So, more in February, but I just wanted you to get the philosophy how we're thinking about the long-term reinvestment in the business and the delivery of our EPS on a yearly basis. Yes. Hi, Andrea. Good. Yes, listen \u2013 yes, I can give you a bit more color on the away-from-home business. It has rebounded from the very lows of April, May, right? It's better. There's more mobility. There's more traffic in some channels. I would say there's a lot of innovation in a lot of the customers, so they're adapting to the new reality, especially restaurants and some entrepreneurs are finding ways to adjust. So \u2013 but it still is a very big drag into \u2013 in our business. I would say, in the levels of 30% to 40% versus drag or negative still in most of the developed markets. So it's still a very negative. It's better than the minus 60, 70s that we had in the April, May. But I'm sure, it's going to be improving, right? We see some channels still hurting a lot, like hospitality or entertainment or transportation. Those are still very low. We see some other channels improving. And we're obviously going to lean into those channels to capture most of the growth. So that's the first part. On the second part, Andrea, the \u2013 yes, we see developing markets, especially I would say, Latin America, parts of Africa, Middle East, starting to feel the economic challenges for a lot of the households. So people are starting to \u2013 there's a bit more unemployment. And there's, obviously, these possible income challenges for many families. We tend to do well in those circumstances. Our \u2013 we can adjust our price points quite fast and we have good playbooks on how to play in recessions, how to adjust entry points to the category, how to deliver good value on some of the family sizes that are now preferred as well. So I think, we're going to do okay. We tend to do okay in this situations. But yes, there is, I would say, Latin America and Africa, Middle East, signs of economic challenges for many households. Hugh, you want to cover this one? Yes. Hey, Bryan, how are you? Good \u2013 yes, good question. Listen, when we talked about PBNA about a year ago, I would say, we're going to try to go one step at a time trying to fix all the different opportunities we had with different brands, right? And the truth is that Q3 is a good reflection of that effort that the team has done over the last year, year-and-a-half. If you look at every one of our large brands is accelerating, so Pepsi is growing, Mountain Dew, good growth. Gatorade, good \u2013 very good growth, I would say. Our coffees, our teas, our juices are growing double-digit. So very good performance across. We've then \u2013 with regards to the energy integration, as you can imagine, there's a lot of small details, right, in \u2013 operational details in integrating a business like Bang, which is quite sizable and trying to move it from a very dispersed distribution setup to a more consolidated one. So in every state, we had different anecdotes and also the Rockstar integration. So I think the team has done a very good job in terms of both the integration and now we're starting to run it as a full business now. So to your question on the future, I think, we're going to continue to double down on what I think has driven the success, which is very good innovation, right? So if you think about all our Zero, innovation is doing very well. Gatorade Zero, massive innovation. Mountain Dew Zero is doing very well. It's starting to bring new consumers into the franchise, a younger consumers that we had not been very successful with. So we feel good about that. Pepsi Zero, growing very nicely, then, obviously, bubly continues to do very well. So we'll continue to double down on innovation as a lever. We'll continue to double down on execution and becoming a better operating company. So I think, the changes we made to our organization to more of a division structure is giving us more granularity and more local excellence, if you wish. In terms of execution, we're going to double down on that. The energy portfolio gives us a much more scale in the convenience channel, which was a \u2013 some sort of a weakness for us. And so we're improving in that channel, if you see the market share in convenience stores in the summer, great progress. So we're happy with how we're doing in that respect. So we'll continue with the playbook, it's working for us. Now we have one more set of tools in our arsenal with this energy portfolio. We're happy with the way Gatorade is working. We're seeing a lot of more people exercising is a good trend. We like it. People are exercising at home. People are embracing daily routines of exercising that helps the sports during category and obviously Gatorade as a leader in that category. So we see a lot of positives for growth in the portfolio and then we're happy with Mountain Dew. Mountain Dew Zero has been a great addition to the team. And it's, I mean, it's getting to scale and is getting very good trial, very good repeats in \u2013 and is very incremental to the brand. So I think, you will see, I think, that sustained performance in PBNA. And hopefully, we can \u2013 yes, improve our market competitiveness as we go along. Yes. To \u2013 yes, on the COVID costs, my point is, I don't know how the pandemic would evolve. But I think it's going to be very likely that we still have to be very careful and keep our people safe for a large part of the year, next year. It's not going to be as much as what we had these years, especially at the beginning. I think, we're getting better at this or finding much effective ways to run the business under this difficult circumstances. But there's going to be a \u2013 still some inefficiency and some additional costs because of COVID. So that was my point. With regards to the PBNA business and the shape of its \u2013 the portfolio and profitability, obviously, we want to get back to a much higher levels. The speed of the transition to the higher levels will depend on our success to drive market share and to drive efficiency on our, especially S&D and supply chain, which is where I think we have more of the opportunity. So we have a sense of urgency in all these in becoming a better performing top line company and improving the efficiency of the business. As you can see from the Q3 results, it's a good performance. But we're not going to sacrifice the long-term for the short-term. So we're going to continue to invest in our brands, make sure that they're well funded, that we continue to keep our consumers in our brands, keep them engaged. We innovate with well-funded innovation, and that we invest in data, especially data and infrastructure investments are required to pivot to the multi, the omni-channel world that we're living. And we're not going to sacrifice those investments for an accelerated profit improvement, but you should see profit improvement in PBNA going forward. Yes, yes, it's good. No, listen, I think, international is probably the biggest opportunity we have long-term, right? I mean, the per caps in both our beverages and our snacks is very low. And we see that as our number one driver of future value for the company. So that's a big focus for us. We've seen the levers to drive per capita consumption. Affordability clearly is a big one for us. And we continue to make progress on adjusting our cost structures to the different market realities. And that allows us to have much more flexibility on the price points and on the \u2013 then what we decide to do with the different levels of tearing of the market. So the big enabler if you want for being a really affordable product, and that would drive per caps is our cost structures. And I think we're making great progress on adjusting a lot of the leavers off that at the end are the cost be it in the supply chain, be it in the G&A, be it in the selling and distribution. So we're \u2013 I think, we're making great progress on adjusting the decisions we make on supply, delivery, and management for the different realities in the different developing markets. And that's driving affordability. That's driving, as you were saying, volume increase, even in a situation where a lot of those markets are suffering. Obviously, a lot of smaller stores are still closed. And there's a lot of adjustment to the COVID reality in many of those markets from the consumer and customer point of view. But our strategic intent continues to be that one, reduction of costs, adjustment of the price points and continue to invest in the brands and the innovation that will drive the per cap development in international. Yes. A couple of things there. Number one, we're gaining penetration in a good way with Quaker, most of the segments in the Quaker business in these last six months. So we've gained penetration. We're investing to retain those new families. And obviously, to increase frequency in the \u2013 was a pretty large penetrated brand is known as more penetrated. So again, make sure that consumers kind of reconnect with the brand. And with the transformation we made to the portfolio in the last few years, eliminating artificials or making the product, I would say, more forward-looking products. So I think that, that work is in motion. And I think consumers are voting that they like our products and they're \u2013 we're gaining share in many of the sub-segments of the Quaker family. Now, going forward, our assumptions and \u2013 but it's still to be validated with future. We need to see where the consumer really ends up. I think, there's going to be more cooking and eating occasions at home going forward. Especially we think that breakfast, there will be at least one or two more occasions at home every week, because I don't think we're going to go back to work in the same way that we used to. And that's our assumption at this point, obviously, we can be right or we can be wrong. But if you judge by how in developed markets, everybody is thinking about their return to the offices, I think, it's going to be a much more flexible environment and much more tech-enabled remote kind of work, where consumers will be at home a few days of the week. And that will drive, I think, a different behavior in terms of breakfast consumption and potentially some of the other meals during the day, especially lunch. So that's how we're thinking about the long-term category growth and we're trying to position ourselves to compete well in that new environment, where they should be more occasions for our products. Yes. The direct-to-consumer models, as you're saying, is more of a \u2013 an attempt for us to stay closer to the consumer, read them, understand reaction to early innovation, and then obviously taken mainstream into the balance of the channels. So it is still, as you're saying, very embryonary, smaller percentage, but we're getting a good insights. And we're going to \u2013 we plan to obviously scale them up a little bit and get better at reading consumers early, test and learning with our innovation and also improving the way we segment consumers. We have prototypes of consumers that we can innovate and talk to in our communication. So that that's the journey going forward. In terms of the COVID in international, as you read around, there is an increase in COVID cases in, especially Europe, I would say. They had managed to control the pandemic pretty well. Now, September, they've seen a number of cases going up. The way we're seeing governments managing the situation so far is with local restrictions. When that happens, the business gets a little bit impacted, but not as much, obviously, as it was during the April, May more dramatic restrictions on people mobility. So we're not seeing the business being impacted much at this point. That doesn't mean that, as the winter comes, and there is either have \u2013 the government have to take more restrictions that, the business may be a little bit more impacted, especially on the away-from-home and some of the more popular channels. So far we haven't seen that. And we've seen the governments making very \u2013 a bit more balanced decisions between keeping the economy going and trying to protect everybody against the spread of the pandemic. So that's the situation, especially in Europe, as we \u2013 as we've seen the situation evolve in there. That's good question. Listen, I think, we're happy that we had that framework going into these pandemic, right, both The PepsiCo Way is with very clear behaviors for our people and has helped us a lot in managing through the pandemic, especially when we have now a more kind of empower organization making more decisions in the frontline. And they have a very, I think, good framework clarity on what's expected, and that \u2013 and that's helping us perform. In terms of the three vectors you were referring to the fastest, stronger, better, we're happy with the faster. Clearly, we're becoming more competitive in the marketplace. As we look into the future, I think, we \u2013 the \u2013 we're going to have to probably go more after drivers of share, because categories might slowdown a little bit. So I think innovation brands, execution will play a very high role in trying to capture that market share. When you look at the stronger, we had some, obviously, it was part of the agenda to invest in becoming a much better omni-channel company, right? So e-commerce was big. Supply chain flexibility was big to enable that omni-channel. Obviously, I mean, the \u2013 what's happened that you saw the numbers, the penetration of e-commerce or e-grocery is just accelerated by three years now. So we had forecasted to be three, four years from now, it's happening now. So that is a big focus of the organization, how do we accelerate the pivot into the omni-channel much faster, which means that, we're going to have to hop some of the capabilities that, that we have. I think we've made great progress in how we deal with consumer data and how we have much more performance marketing, we improve in a lot of the \u2013 those capabilities, creating internal content, all that is happening on the flexibility of the supply chain as well. I think we were lucky that we made a lot of investments in additional capacity last year, and that's helping us this year, big time and helping us to have more flexibility. So good progress there. I think, we need to pivot with more of a sense of urgency. The other area where we're doubling down is what we call holistic cost management. Holistic cost management was a capability we had. But clearly, we need more of that in terms of being able to repurpose money from one part of the P&L to another part of P&L. And where we have inefficiencies to get rid of those inefficiencies to reinvest back, where the \u2013 where we're going to get the best ROI in terms of growth and flow through. So that, that capability, I think, we've made good progress. That's another area where we put in a lot of emphasis. On the better side, I would say, the social consciousness. I mean, the need for becoming much more of a social company, no social company, but social aware company, both in terms of the environment and the inequalities, I think, has also increased, given the pandemic. So you saw, we increased the foundation funding. We're also quite focused on improving all our environmental footprint. So those are areas that more than changing the trajectory is more a sense of urgency to get them done earlier, as the consumer and society is expecting us to, I think, go faster in those areas. Yes, welcome. Listen, our focus today, 100% focus is getting the energy strategy right, in terms of executing that. I think, as I said earlier, is a multi-vector strategy that requires, both Rockstar doing very well. It requires to do a great job with Bang. It requires innovation in Mountain Dew to move into that space and then do a great job with Starbucks. So those four big pillars, that's taking a lot of our focus and that's going to be our priority, right, especially 2021. And I think you will see great progress in all those four fronts. Now, obviously, we look at every opportunity, right, there is in the industry \u2013 and a couple of years ago, it was CBD. Now, it's more alcohol. So we get a lot of opportunities in front of us. Of course, we're looking at all of them and, of course, we have people that are thinking more long-term versus the very immediate 2021. So, we're reflecting. We're thinking, what are the best options. And we will make the decisions in the coming quarters, whether this is an area where PepsiCo wants to play. And then more importantly, how do we capture a lot of value of this opportunity is \u2013 given this three-tier system is not obvious how you capture a lot of value. So there is a, first, I would say, do we play or not? Second, very important is who do we play with and who do we partner to maximize the value for PepsiCo? Yes, Laurent. I mean, there has been quite a discrepancy always between the Nielsen numbers and the full performance of PBNA. So I would not go into the details of what is its channel. Obviously, e-commerce is booming and e-commerce is large. But there's much more than e-commerce between the final, I would say, results of the company and what Nielsen covers in its review samples. So, that's as much as I can say. There's obviously away-from-home. There's many channels that are not well covered, including some, I would say, organized channels that are not well covered by Nielsen. Yes, great question. We like, obviously, our category savory, and there's all the people that like it as well. So it's obviously driving new entrants from people that were not playing in savory and people that were playing savory and have extended their ambitions to play beyond their original geographical limitation. So I think we welcome competition in that sense to me. The more competitors and more investments in the brands, the higher \u2013 the larger and the category becomes. That's my experience globally, and I think it's everywhere in the world. So we welcome players to the arena, players that they play with the levers that, I think, develop the category, which is advertising, innovation, better products. Those are the levers that develop a category and we welcome anyone in the business. It's hard to compete with freedom, right, given the advantages that the company has the scale of the brands, the distribution systems, the cost advantage, everything else. So, it's not easy to compete with Frito, but I think it's good that we have multiple competitors and that develops a category. Yes. Thank you very much, everybody, for your time this morning and your questions \u2013 insightful questions. And thank you for the confidence you've put in the company and your investments in PepsiCo. And please stay safe and look forward to talking to you soon. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to PepsiCo\u2019s Second Quarter Earnings Question-and-Answer Session. Your lines have been placed on listen-only until it is your turn to ask a question. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s call is being recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com. It is now my pleasure to introduce, Mr. Ravi Pamnani, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Pamnani, you may begin.\nRavi Pamnani: Thank you, operator. I hope everyone has had the chance this morning to review our press release and prepared comments, both of which are available on our website. Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. We may make forward-looking statements on today\u2019s call, including about our business plans and the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties and only reflect our view as of today, and we are under no obligation to update. When discussing our results, we refer to non-GAAP measures, which exclude certain items from reported results. Please refer to today\u2019s earnings release and 10-Q available on pepsico.com for definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures and additional information regarding our results, including a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from forward-looking statements. Joining me today are PepsiCo's Chairman and CEO, Ramon Laguarta; and PepsiCo's Vice Chairman and CFO, Hugh Johnston. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question. And with that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey, guys. First of all, the format is very helpful. So, kudos to your IR team for sort of pioneering this new format on the street. I was hoping for a bit more color on some of the more volatile areas of your business. You obviously mentioned improvements sequentially within the quarter and guided to the organic sales growth acceleration globally in Q3. So, A, can you just give us a better sense of what specifically is driving that? And then, B, I was hoping you could spend some time within that just discussing what you\u2019re seeing channel wise in the U.S beverage business and what you're seeing across snacks and beverages in some of your key emerging markets? Are you expecting pretty linear progress sequentially going forward in terms of improving sales growth or more volatility, particularly with some of the state restrictions cropping up in the U S and just given the developing market, country performance is pretty divergent in Q2? Thanks.\nRamon Laguarta: Okay. Good morning, Dara. I hope you're doing well. Listen, let me try and then, Hugh, will add some comments as well. Listen, as we look around the world, we see a couple of factors that are driving our business. Number one, as you can imagine is overall mobility in the country. And that is by far the number one factor and we're monitoring mobility through various means just to understand potential future performance of the business. That's number one. Number two, and that impacts mostly developing markets, is the universe of stores are opened. What we're seeing in developing markets is that when situation -- when the infection goes up in the country, there's about 10% to 15% of the stores that close and sometimes even higher, and that drives a lot of the performance. So that's number two. Number three, obviously is where do people eat most of their meals and that's related to whether people are working from home or they're not working from home. And so that's a third factor that is impacted most of the food consumption. So, there could be mobility, but then people still have their meals at home. And so those three are the key factors. Obviously, there's a fourth factor I think will be more important going forward, which is disposable income in the economy and that's related to unemployment and that's related to how much money that governments are putting back into the economy. And that is -- it hasn't impacted the U.S yet. It is impacting some of the other countries around the world, as the governments don\u2019t have the muscle to put so much money back into the economy. So those four are probably the most critical kind of factors that impact the business, and that's what we're modeling for various scenarios as we go forward. So that -- that's kind of from a very macro point of view. Obviously, I said in the last conference call that we had in April that this was not going to be a linear recovery, right? There's going to be a lot of ups and downs, and we're seeing these happening as we speak right in the business. You see countries that we thought the pandemic was behind, especially in far East, that the pandemic is going back in very local situations, but still impacting both the actual supply chain and also consumer perception, right? We're seeing this here in the U.S obviously, as you know we're all familiar with it. So first it was the Northeast. Now it's other parts of the country that are being severely impacted by the infection. And that obviously impacts our organization, because we operate within a community, right? And obviously the number of impacted associates in our business it's a consequence of the community infection. So that puts a lot of pressure on our supply chain as well. So, hopefully that gives you a sense of the different variables, and the fact that this is going to be a roller coaster, if you want going forward. I think we're getting much better at managing our supply chain within this complexity. We're hiring more people, we're training more people, we're making sure that we can maintain the supply chain in any circumstance, but it's still -- it's pretty complex as you can imagine.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane: Hey, good morning, everyone. And I hope everybody is doing well. So my question is just related to the COVID related expenses in the quarter, and you were at $378 million for the quarter. And I think if I've got it right in the 10-Q about $224 million of that was employee compensation expense. So I guess as we're trying to frame the size of the expense in the back half of the year is $378 million a good run rate? And as we're looking at the components of this expense, maybe if you could help us just walk through what we should be looking at as recurring for the next 3 or 4 quarters and what might fall off?\nRamon Laguarta: Hugh, you want to try that -- this one?\nHugh Johnston: Yes, happy to. Okay, Bryan. No, Bryan, that's not a good run rate going forward. The number going forward will be less than that. It will still be substantial, but nowhere near that number. If you break it into pieces things like personal protective equipment that that's obviously going to continue. Things like sanitation that that's going to continue. The allowance for doubtful accounts on customers, obviously it's going to be variable depending on what we learn over time and how the customer base responds to the current environment. Frontline and employee costs will still be there, but that number should be moderated pretty significantly going forward. So, we're not kind of getting into to piecemeal guidance, but that should give you a little of a sense as to the types of things that are going to be ongoing and the types of things that ought to diminish pretty significantly.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, Bryan, the most important component, as you can imagine, or factor that impact is, is the number of infected employees that we have, right, and therefore the quarantine number. I mean, the biggest factor is when you have an employee that is -- that\u2019s got the virus or supposed to have the virus, then we quarantine a lot of people, that's the number one driver of cost. And obviously that will depend on the evolution of the pandemic in different parts of the world. So right now, Hugh, I think mentioned the different components and how we're thinking about it, but obviously if the pandemic goes up massively, then that cost will go up.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you and morning. I hope you're doing well. And I understand that this is not a straight line and your comment that, obviously the emerging markets is the main question mark, but could you help us understand how you left the second quarter in terms of cadence on the on-premises and convenience and gas? And so I'm trying -- just trying to bridge the low single digits in the three quarter that you guided for? Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Hi, Andrea. Yes. Listen, just to give you a sense of how the different components I was referring to earlier impact the different channels. Obviously, mobility has a very direct correlation with smallest store sales, right? And in the U.S its convenience stores, around the world its other channels that play that same role, but we see a big correlation between mobility and convenience store or on-premise -- sorry, small channel performance. Obviously, as we went through the quarter, April was very low consumption in that channel. Second half of May, June was an improvement, substantial improvement in that channel. The away from home channel is much more complex, right? There's a lot of different need states that consumers are going after there. And so there was also an improvement overall throughout the quarter that is still substantially below last year. I mean, like a big number below last year and also different components of the channel with different levels of performance. So you see channels like transportation still very low, hospitality is still very low, universities closed. You saw restaurants coming back, especially more informal type of restaurants coming back, and more formal restaurants less so. So you see different performances, Andrea, across the different channels. In terms of geography, China came back pretty quickly. I would say that almost in growth in the last part of the quarter. You saw Europe slower, the comeback of the -- both the kind of the small store channel and the away-from-home channel in Europe was a bit slower. We're seeing it better lately as people are starting to move around Europe and going on vacation to some areas in the South of Europe. So let's see how it evolves now. Obviously, there's less people moving around Europe compared to other years, but its improved. In the U.S we saw an improvement as I said in May, June in specialty, everything that had to do with smaller channels. Now, let's see how this latest news in the evolution of the pandemic in the South and the West of the country impacts those channels, and the decisions that regulators take in terms of protecting the overall community, right? So that probably gives you a sense of how this is impacted. As we see the pandemic evolving now into Africa, South America, parts of the Middle East, India, we're seeing obviously an impact in the traffic in stores and that drives the business. So it's still very fluid overall. It's an improvement versus the April timeframe, for sure. And that's why we're guiding to a small growth in the Q -- in the Q3.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy of Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: Hey, good morning, everyone. And I hope that you're doing well. Ramon, I had a strategy related question for you specifically around market share, because it certainly seems to be an area of greater emphasis on your leadership. And if I'm not mistaken also taking on a more prominent role in a management incentive structure as well. So with that as context, is that a fair characterization, number one. If so, how do you drive that behavior? How do you intend to prioritize innovation and premiumization and mix to support market share initiatives? And how do you balance that with the potential risk that this push on market share does not devolve into more promotional pricing, like particularly North America carbonated soft drinks where the industry has gotten away from that behavior now for a number of years. Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Thank you, Kevin. And that's a good -- it's a very good question. Yes, listen, the share of market is -- it's being central to our strategy, and it will continue so, right? It has been during the pandemic, one of the key principles that we have set for ourselves that we're going to try to improve market share. Obviously, we are trying to develop our market share position in a sustainable way. So it's more related to the strength of our supply chain, the strength of our go-to-market execution, our ability to innovate faster into spaces that we see consumer value, our customer relationships. Those elements that we think are sustainable, the part of our brands, obviously. And you saw us making a lot of investments in '19, both in capacity and infrastructure in stronger brands. We innovated into new spaces, that's helping us navigate better the current situation and we're continuing to do so. There's some spaces in the market that are I think we will determine the share of market of the future. For example, I think e-commerce, if you see the growth of e-commerce, it is going to be quite strategic. I think whoever wins in e-commerce now and is able to capture those families that are trying this e-grocery service for the first time I think is going to win those families in the future. So we're investing heavily in trying to be the first in that channel and trying to -- and again, the investments that we made in the last few years, last year in particular, are helping us both from the data availability, the agility of our infrastructure to supply those channels, etcetera. So e-commerce is a key area where we think we can gain market share. Second is, the strength of our DSD system and our ability to service the stores directly, I think is a capability that is quite unique. And it gives us the advantage to keep the supply chain going in spite of all the challenges we're all facing. So that's also an area where we plan to double down that improves our execution in store and the inventory in store. And that is also a sustainable advantage. The third one is brands. I know we had -- we're seeing consumers going back to brands that they trust. And we have quite a lot in many markets that consumers trust. There's big brands that have been around for some time, we\u2019ve modernized them, we\u2019ve kept them relevant to the consumer. And then we're seeing spaces, like healthier parts of the consumer demand where we have a lot of beautiful brands as well and we're reinvesting in those brands, either the zero prepositions in beverages, both Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Gatorade, we're investing a lot in those parts of the portfolio and they keep growing. And also in snacks with brands like Off the Eaten Path or Smartfood or the all the Simply range or PopCorners or whatever. So there's a lot of spaces where we think that we invest in those spaces, we're going to capture market share for the future. The other one we're investing very substantial amounts and it's working very well for us is SodaStream, right? SodaStream is a beautiful business for this situation we're living today. So we -- consumers don't have to leave their houses. They have perfect choices. We're putting our Pepsi brands in the SodaStream model in Europe, and it's working very well. We're investing in those. So it's sustainable long-term market share across multiple parts of the value chain that I think is going to give us a stronger -- is going to make us a stronger company going forward. So that's how we're thinking about share of market and sustainable share of market.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Goldman Sachs.\nBonnie Herzog: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I had a question on your price mix of 1.5% in the quarter, which was better-than-expected, especially for PB&A, where your price mix was up 3%. So hoping you could drill down on some of the key drivers of this. I guess, I'm trying to understand the strength in your price mix given the negative channel mix shift, and then I assume negative packaging mix. So, with the strong price mix in PB&A, a function of lower promos in the quarter? And then really how sustainable is this positive price mix going forward, especially in this environment? Thanks.\nRamon Laguarta: Hugh, do you want a go at this?\nHugh Johnston: Sure. Happy to, Ramon. Hi, Bonnie. Yes, price mix at 1.5% for the company, obviously that that's a complicated number because it's global and sort of incorporates almost everything. Going a little bit deeper on PB&A, I think the primary factors were around less promotional depth than what we had seen in the past. I think frequency is pretty similar, but the depth wasn't quite there. Obviously, supply can -- supply chains were a bit constrained in that regard. So it didn't make sense to go as deep. So I think that that's the biggest factor.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivian Acer of Cowan.\nVivien Azer: Hi. Thank you. Good morning. Ramon, I appreciate your commentary around investing behind emerging brands and relevant brands like SodaStream. Just hoping for either you or Hugh to comment on the reduction in nonessential advertising and really just reconciling that. It seems like perhaps, the COVID recovery is taking longer than perhaps we would have anticipated when you reported earnings a quarter ago. So just curious to hear how you're thinking about that line item. Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Advertising is a key component of our strategy, Vivien, and it will continue. We still think that it's critical that we continue to use that lever to drive penetration of the brands and trial and just the image of the brand. So that is -- hasn't changed at all. There has been a bit of an adjustment, especially in some markets early on in the quarter, because the truth is that the consumer habits change a lot and we modify some of the A&M decisions. We also have become a bit more selective about the type of A&M that we're doing and some of the activities that had lower ROI where we're stopping them and we're putting more money against the initiatives that had more return on investment. So I think we are -- we become better, and sometimes a crisis helps to be more selective and to be more impactful and to kind of generate internal momentum against simplification and against focus against fewer and bigger. And that's what we're trying to do. It's -- as you see from our results it is working quite well. Obviously, balance of the year we continue to invest as we see the consumers moving around and demand for our products starting to be a bit higher, yes, we'll keep investing and -- again, not trying to lose that focus on fewer and bigger and trying to minimize the lower ROI initiatives that sometimes we have in what is a very large business. Yes, so that's how we're thinking about A&M. Hugh, I don't know if there's anything else from your side.\nHugh Johnston: Yes. The one thing I wanted to add as well, Ramon is, Vivien, as we've talked about being stronger, part of that has been building some more capability to do A&M in-house. It's got a couple of benefits. One, it improves our speed; and number two, it has proven to be more efficient over time. So we can actually get same or more value for less money, which is obviously a terrific outcome for the company.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thank you. I felt like in the prepared remarks that the tone around kind of cost control and the investment was maybe a little bit different than it was 3 months ago. I would describe it maybe it's a little bit more measured where last quarter you were talking about staying on the attack. Of course, still a strong criteria for ROI. And this quarter we're talking about zero based mindset, earning your budget. So I guess by no stretch do I think that you didn't anticipate that the environment was going to be rough. I think that was very clear 3 months ago and it's remained as such. But what is it that's really changed in your thinking in your approach then versus now. Yes, just it did feel a bit different, still very proactive, but sort of from a different step. Thanks.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. Good, Lauren. The idea -- the concept of holistic cost management that we put early on, I mean, it was early last year as one of the principles of how we would get stronger, it's a capability we\u2019ve been, I would say investing and focusing everybody around the company in this concept of holistic cost management, which basically it is the concept that you're referring to, which is you earn your budget every year. And we're trying to be much more granular around composition of the budget and what really is required now going forward versus what it was required, let's say last year or two years ago, and going through that process of rethinking the budget every year, and reallocating costs against what's going to give us the best return in the year and going forward. So that capability is there. We're emphasizing it more, because obviously what we're seeing is that there is a challenging time. We're having to put $500 million of costs in COVID related expenses. We will have to put some more going forward. So, we have to find ways to fund that, and we have to find ways to continue to invest in our brands and our commercial activities to keep growing and gaining market share. So we have to be super selective on where do we put the money in every single line of the P&L. So we're emphasizing that from the position that every cent has to work for the growth drivers of the company. So that is the principle that we\u2019re -- that is being adopted across the organization in every single market. On the other side, we are seeing that -- potentially as unemployment goes up in several parts of the world. I think companies will have to be much more cautious about obviously the resources that we use and how do we use those resources. So I think this capability is going to come very helpful for us. And that's what we're talking about in the sense of, let's be very diligent in how we look at every single line of our budget and how we reallocate those monies into the highest return on investment growth drivers. And with that, I think we'll be successful in gaining share of market and driving growth hopefully flowing that growth back into profits for the sustainability of the company.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet of Guggenheim.\nLaurent Grandet: Hey, good morning, Ramon and Hugh. And first congratulation on different specific -- very specific initiatives you are taking to address Black Life Matters. I would like to focus my question on the energy category in the -- in your prior remark, you mentioned the bank business was already almost fully transferred to your system as well as much quicker than most expected, so that's great. Could you please tell us what was the retailers' reaction to the push you\u2019re making in the energy category and what they expect from PepsiCo and also regarding ROCKSTAR specifically how long do you think it would take to reenergize the brand? Thanks.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. Hello, Laurent. Yes, good question. Listen, yes, we are almost completed with the integration of the Bang brand into our selling systems. It's been a complex process because Bang had between 250, 300 distributors across the country. So as you can imagine the details of that transition has been quite exhausting for Kirk and the beverage team, but they've done a great job of integrating that brand. And also the same with integrating ROCKSTAR in parts of the country that we didn\u2019t distribute the brand in the past. So that is, I would say, by the end of July, that will be almost complete and then we\u2019re ready to go. From the customer relationship point of view, I think the customers see us as a very good partner that can bring insight, that can bring activation to the brands, that can bring better store execution, a lot of drivers that we know -- we can deliver and will drive growth for the category. So I would say the reception from our retail partners has been very positive and early signals of it is that they\u2019re -- we're getting support and that we\u2019re executing with good quality. And it -- the fact that we have now a full portfolio that has Bang, ROCKSTAR and some of the Mountain Dew brands as energy offer, it is a positive development for us versus having smaller brands. So we're seeing positive signals. And as we said last call in April, this is very strategic for us. We continue to focus on the three components of the strategy, driving revitalizing ROCKSTAR, and you will see some news coming out of ROCKSTAR soon, both on the advertising front and the packaging front, reformulation, integrating Bang into our business and there's distribution opportunities and velocity opportunities in some parts of the country. And then moving Dew with more intentionality into spaces of energy that are not well covered we think today, and that we can do a better job. Obviously, we continue to be very focused on Starbucks. Starbucks is a critical part of our energy strategy and Tripleshot, Doubleshot are -- is booming and even more now with people at home. So we're seeing all of those components working for us in the future. We're very optimistic about this part of the business and certainly there's a lot of energy in our teams to get it done. And the team is doing a fantastic job by the way.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein of Evercore.\nRob Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. So wondering if you could talk a little bit about how your dialogue with retailers has evolved from March through June, July, how that -- how that's changed? Maybe also touch on the various things that you were doing to help retailers get through this and where things are in terms of shelf sets. A lot of the -- or most of the spring resets never really happened, when do you expect that to happen and how you look positioned for those? Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Right. Good question, Robert. Listen, in our principles, and as we started the pandemic, taking care of our associates was priority number one, and taking care of our customers was priority number two, similar to number one. So I think that was the focus of the company trying to even elevate even more the partnership with our -- with all our customers across any country around the world. So that is a focus of the teams. I think we've been agile, we\u2019ve been closer to the -- to our partners. We've been transparent with our supply chain challenges in some cases. But I would say in general, we're getting very positive comments from our partners on how we are talking to them, helping them to stay in stock and on time, driving business for both and evolving for the future of demand especially around the space of e-commerce that I mentioned earlier, that it's clearly growing at a very fast pace, faster than we had all forecasted about half a year ago. So that's the dynamic. We've made some choices in our supply chain to -- we've reduced some of the tail of our portfolio. We\u2019ve discussed that with our partners, retail partners and we both agreed that it's probably the best thing to do to eliminate the less -- let's say, the smaller SKUs in the portfolio to maximize the best selling SKUs and be in stock. As I said earlier, our DSD system, I think is a fundamental advantage in the way we're able to service our customers. And I think they appreciate that we've made the effort adjusting delivery schedules and increasing delivery schedules to make sure that we keep our brands in stock and we help obviously our partners. So that is the level of the commitment we have with our partners. And I think the dialogue is in a very good space and I think this situation will give us a strategic relationship with our partners that I think we had in the past, but it's probably at a higher level today.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: Yes, great. Thanks. So I know you've sped up your R&D processes considerably over the course of time. But as we think about today's consumer behavior relative to just a few months ago, and the difficulty of predicting where we'll be in the quarters ahead, how is that impacting, how your teams are thinking about new plans and product introductions, even looking out to 2021? Because I think those plans might differ in a world where we're at home versus in a world where we're on the move. And I guess, is there a way to think about that, or is it that your cycle times on new products at this point are such that you feel like you can keep pace with the change that we're all going through right now?\nRamon Laguarta: Listen, I think we have improved a lot, as you mentioned. We have segmented our innovation processes in different quick cycle innovations, more lift and shift, more strategic innovation that takes longer. So, we have a good segmentation of processes across the company and ways of investing and dealing with innovation through different stage, case, approvals and everything related to the size and the velocity that we want from each type of innovation. Yes, the truth is that we're never satisfied enough, right? I mean, so the sense of urgency in anything we do is going up and I think we have improving innovation and we want to improve even more. So from that point of view, we'll continue to make the adjustments to some of the process required. In terms of what you're saying, are consumers changing meaningfully some of their needs, and are we adopting quickly enough? I would say there are a few spaces where we're trying to move quickly. Immunity being one, and we're seeing that our consumers are looking for immunity more, our juice business is booming and we think that -- we can come up with other beverages and even snacks that go against that need. Our snacks, business are being part of meals. We're seeing that more and more. Consumers are cooking more at home and that means that obviously brands like Quaker or some of our Quaker portfolio is being incorporated into meals. But also some of our snacks, like Tostitos, obviously Sabra, and some other brands are being used for meals, right? A Lay's or Ruffles. We are going to obviously move our advertising and our consumer support in terms of giving them recipes and helping them with solutions that, kind of go incentivize that habit. So, there's a marketing element to this. There's also an innovation element to these in terms of packaging or other solutions that we can help consumers moving to that space. So, yes, we're moving quickly. We are never satisfied with our speed of our capabilities. And if you hear the conversations with our internal teams, speed is a key word and we're trying to get better at that. We're trying to be the -- as close as we can to start up with a scale of a large company. So that is one of our aspirations. And I think it's going to be a long journey of improvements, but we're in the right direction.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Sean King of UBS.\nSean King: Hey, good morning. Hugh, you mentioned a $3 billion in the full year e-com, or roughly -- probably 5% of sales, I guess, that doubled in North America in the quarter. How much of that is transitory due to the stay-at-home dynamics, or can some of that continue?\nHugh Johnston: Yes. Hey, Sean, happy to get in on that one. A couple of things. One, just to be clear that $3 billion number is a retail sales number. It's not a net revenue number for PepsiCo, so you've got to discount it for that. Number two, that is the great question. Not clear at this point. I think a lot of that will be dependent on how much consumers or shoppers find that the experiences is very good for them. Out of stocks, obviously, it's -- is always going to be a big question for them, because if you get a lot of out of stocks, you have to go to the store anyway, which sort of defeats the purpose. And then the other one is to the degree that they're paying any kind of an up charge is, is it worth the money? So, don't have a real good projection on that right now. We're prepared for it to stay large and we can manage that well, if need be the case, both from a -- an execution perspective, as well as from a financial perspective, but not clear at this point,\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Ramon Laguarta for any closing remarks.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. Thank you everyone for joining us today. It's great to hear from everybody. And for the confidence you've placed in us with your investments. We hope you'll stay safe and healthy. And we look forward to updating you as the year progresses. Thank you again, and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in PepsiCo's second quarter earnings question-and-answer session. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Yes, happy to. Okay, Bryan. No, Bryan, that's not a good run rate going forward. The number going forward will be less than that. It will still be substantial, but nowhere near that number. If you break it into pieces things like personal protective equipment that that's obviously going to continue. Things like sanitation that that's going to continue. The allowance for doubtful accounts on customers, obviously it's going to be variable depending on what we learn over time and how the customer base responds to the current environment. Frontline and employee costs will still be there, but that number should be moderated pretty significantly going forward. So, we're not kind of getting into to piecemeal guidance, but that should give you a little of a sense as to the types of things that are going to be ongoing and the types of things that ought to diminish pretty significantly. Sure. Happy to, Ramon. Hi, Bonnie. Yes, price mix at 1.5% for the company, obviously that that's a complicated number because it's global and sort of incorporates almost everything. Going a little bit deeper on PB&A, I think the primary factors were around less promotional depth than what we had seen in the past. I think frequency is pretty similar, but the depth wasn't quite there. Obviously, supply can -- supply chains were a bit constrained in that regard. So it didn't make sense to go as deep. So I think that that's the biggest factor. Yes. The one thing I wanted to add as well, Ramon is, Vivien, as we've talked about being stronger, part of that has been building some more capability to do A&M in-house. It's got a couple of benefits. One, it improves our speed; and number two, it has proven to be more efficient over time.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Ramon Laguarta",
            "content": "Okay. Good morning, Dara. I hope you're doing well. Listen, let me try and then, Hugh, will add some comments as well. Listen, as we look around the world, we see a couple of factors that are driving our business. Number one, as you can imagine is overall mobility in the country. And that is by far the number one factor and we're monitoring mobility through various means just to understand potential future performance of the business. That's number one. Number two, and that impacts mostly developing markets, is the universe of stores are opened. What we're seeing in developing markets is that when situation -- when the infection goes up in the country, there's about 10% to 15% of the stores that close and sometimes even higher, and that drives a lot of the performance. So that's number two. Number three, obviously is where do people eat most of their meals and that's related to whether people are working from home or they're not working from home. And so that's a third factor that is impacted most of the food consumption. So, there could be mobility, but then people still have their meals at home. And so those three are the key factors. Obviously, there's a fourth factor I think will be more important going forward, which is disposable income in the economy and that's related to unemployment and that's related to how much money that governments are putting back into the economy. And that is -- it hasn't impacted the U.S yet. It is impacting some of the other countries around the world, as the governments don't have the muscle to put so much money back into the economy. So those four are probably the most critical kind of factors that impact the business, and that's what we're modeling for various scenarios as we go forward. So that -- that's kind of from a very macro point of view. Obviously, I said in the last conference call that we had in April that this was not going to be a linear recovery, right? There's going to be a lot of ups and downs, and we're seeing these happening as we speak right in the business. You see countries that we thought the pandemic was behind, especially in far East, that the pandemic is going back in very local situations, but still impacting both the actual supply chain and also consumer perception, right? We're seeing this here in the U.S obviously, as you know we're all familiar with it. So first it was the Northeast. Now it's other parts of the country that are being severely impacted by the infection. And that obviously impacts our organization, because we operate within a community, right? And obviously the number of impacted associates in our business it's a consequence of the community infection. So that puts a lot of pressure on our supply chain as well. So, hopefully that gives you a sense of the different variables, and the fact that this is going to be a roller coaster, if you want going forward. I think we're getting much better at managing our supply chain within this complexity. We're hiring more people, we're training more people, we're making sure that we can maintain the supply chain in any circumstance, but it's still -- it's pretty complex as you can imagine. Hugh, you want to try that -- this one? Yes, Bryan, the most important component, as you can imagine, or factor that impact is, is the number of infected employees that we have, right, and therefore the quarantine number. I mean, the biggest factor is when you have an employee that is -- that's got the virus or supposed to have the virus, then we quarantine a lot of people, that's the number one driver of cost. And obviously that will depend on the evolution of the pandemic in different parts of the world. So right now, Hugh, I think mentioned the different components and how we're thinking about it, but obviously if the pandemic goes up massively, then that cost will go up. Hi, Andrea. Yes. Listen, just to give you a sense of how the different components I was referring to earlier impact the different channels. Obviously, mobility has a very direct correlation with smallest store sales, right? And in the U.S its convenience stores, around the world its other channels that play that same role, but we see a big correlation between mobility and convenience store or on-premise -- sorry, small channel performance. Obviously, as we went through the quarter, April was very low consumption in that channel. Second half of May, June was an improvement, substantial improvement in that channel. The away from home channel is much more complex, right? There's a lot of different need states that consumers are going after there. And so there was also an improvement overall throughout the quarter that is still substantially below last year. I mean, like a big number below last year and also different components of the channel with different levels of performance. So you see channels like transportation still very low, hospitality is still very low, universities closed. You saw restaurants coming back, especially more informal type of restaurants coming back, and more formal restaurants less so. So you see different performances, Andrea, across the different channels. In terms of geography, China came back pretty quickly. I would say that almost in growth in the last part of the quarter. You saw Europe slower, the comeback of the -- both the kind of the small store channel and the away-from-home channel in Europe was a bit slower. We're seeing it better lately as people are starting to move around Europe and going on vacation to some areas in the South of Europe. So let's see how it evolves now. Obviously, there's less people moving around Europe compared to other years, but its improved. In the U.S we saw an improvement as I said in May, June in specialty, everything that had to do with smaller channels. Now, let's see how this latest news in the evolution of the pandemic in the South and the West of the country impacts those channels, and the decisions that regulators take in terms of protecting the overall community, right? So that probably gives you a sense of how this is impacted. As we see the pandemic evolving now into Africa, South America, parts of the Middle East, India, we're seeing obviously an impact in the traffic in stores and that drives the business. So it's still very fluid overall. It's an improvement versus the April timeframe, for sure. And that's why we're guiding to a small growth in the Q -- in the Q3. Thank you, Kevin. And that's a good -- it's a very good question. Yes, listen, the share of market is -- it's being central to our strategy, and it will continue so, right? It has been during the pandemic, one of the key principles that we have set for ourselves that we're going to try to improve market share. Obviously, we are trying to develop our market share position in a sustainable way. So it's more related to the strength of our supply chain, the strength of our go-to-market execution, our ability to innovate faster into spaces that we see consumer value, our customer relationships. Those elements that we think are sustainable, the part of our brands, obviously. And you saw us making a lot of investments in '19, both in capacity and infrastructure in stronger brands. We innovated into new spaces, that's helping us navigate better the current situation and we're continuing to do so. There's some spaces in the market that are I think we will determine the share of market of the future. For example, I think e-commerce, if you see the growth of e-commerce, it is going to be quite strategic. I think whoever wins in e-commerce now and is able to capture those families that are trying this e-grocery service for the first time I think is going to win those families in the future. So we're investing heavily in trying to be the first in that channel and trying to -- and again, the investments that we made in the last few years, last year in particular, are helping us both from the data availability, the agility of our infrastructure to supply those channels, etcetera. So e-commerce is a key area where we think we can gain market share. Second is, the strength of our DSD system and our ability to service the stores directly, I think is a capability that is quite unique. And it gives us the advantage to keep the supply chain going in spite of all the challenges we're all facing. So that's also an area where we plan to double down that improves our execution in store and the inventory in store. And that is also a sustainable advantage. The third one is brands. I know we had -- we're seeing consumers going back to brands that they trust. And we have quite a lot in many markets that consumers trust. There's big brands that have been around for some time, we've modernized them, we've kept them relevant to the consumer. And then we're seeing spaces, like healthier parts of the consumer demand where we have a lot of beautiful brands as well and we're reinvesting in those brands, either the zero prepositions in beverages, both Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Gatorade, we're investing a lot in those parts of the portfolio and they keep growing. And also in snacks with brands like Off the Eaten Path or Smartfood or the all the Simply range or PopCorners or whatever. So there's a lot of spaces where we think that we invest in those spaces, we're going to capture market share for the future. The other one we're investing very substantial amounts and it's working very well for us is SodaStream, right? SodaStream is a beautiful business for this situation we're living today. So we -- consumers don't have to leave their houses. They have perfect choices. We're putting our Pepsi brands in the SodaStream model in Europe, and it's working very well. We're investing in those. So it's sustainable long-term market share across multiple parts of the value chain that I think is going to give us a stronger -- is going to make us a stronger company going forward. So that's how we're thinking about share of market and sustainable share of market. Hugh, do you want a go at this? Advertising is a key component of our strategy, Vivien, and it will continue. We still think that it's critical that we continue to use that lever to drive penetration of the brands and trial and just the image of the brand. So that is -- hasn't changed at all. There has been a bit of an adjustment, especially in some markets early on in the quarter, because the truth is that the consumer habits change a lot and we modify some of the A&M decisions. We also have become a bit more selective about the type of A&M that we're doing and some of the activities that had lower ROI where we're stopping them and we're putting more money against the initiatives that had more return on investment. So I think we are -- we become better, and sometimes a crisis helps to be more selective and to be more impactful and to kind of generate internal momentum against simplification and against focus against fewer and bigger. And that's what we're trying to do. It's -- as you see from our results it is working quite well. Obviously, balance of the year we continue to invest as we see the consumers moving around and demand for our products starting to be a bit higher, yes, we'll keep investing and -- again, not trying to lose that focus on fewer and bigger and trying to minimize the lower ROI initiatives that sometimes we have in what is a very large business. Yes, so that's how we're thinking about A&M. Hugh, I don't know if there's anything else from your side. Yes. Good, Lauren. The idea -- the concept of holistic cost management that we put early on, I mean, it was early last year as one of the principles of how we would get stronger, it's a capability we've been, I would say investing and focusing everybody around the company in this concept of holistic cost management, which basically it is the concept that you're referring to, which is you earn your budget every year. And we're trying to be much more granular around composition of the budget and what really is required now going forward versus what it was required, let's say last year or two years ago, and going through that process of rethinking the budget every year, and reallocating costs against what's going to give us the best return in the year and going forward. So that capability is there. We're emphasizing it more, because obviously what we're seeing is that there is a challenging time. We're having to put $500 million of costs in COVID related expenses. We will have to put some more going forward. So, we have to find ways to fund that, and we have to find ways to continue to invest in our brands and our commercial activities to keep growing and gaining market share. So we have to be super selective on where do we put the money in every single line of the P&L. So we're emphasizing that from the position that every cent has to work for the growth drivers of the company. So that is the principle that we're -- that is being adopted across the organization in every single market. On the other side, we are seeing that -- potentially as unemployment goes up in several parts of the world. I think companies will have to be much more cautious about obviously the resources that we use and how do we use those resources. So I think this capability is going to come very helpful for us. And that's what we're talking about in the sense of, let's be very diligent in how we look at every single line of our budget and how we reallocate those monies into the highest return on investment growth drivers. And with that, I think we'll be successful in gaining share of market and driving growth hopefully flowing that growth back into profits for the sustainability of the company. Yes. Hello, Laurent. Yes, good question. Listen, yes, we are almost completed with the integration of the Bang brand into our selling systems. It's been a complex process because Bang had between 250, 300 distributors across the country. So as you can imagine the details of that transition has been quite exhausting for Kirk and the beverage team, but they've done a great job of integrating that brand. And also the same with integrating ROCKSTAR in parts of the country that we didn't distribute the brand in the past. So that is, I would say, by the end of July, that will be almost complete and then we're ready to go. From the customer relationship point of view, I think the customers see us as a very good partner that can bring insight, that can bring activation to the brands, that can bring better store execution, a lot of drivers that we know -- we can deliver and will drive growth for the category. So I would say the reception from our retail partners has been very positive and early signals of it is that they're -- we're getting support and that we're executing with good quality. And it -- the fact that we have now a full portfolio that has Bang, ROCKSTAR and some of the Mountain Dew brands as energy offer, it is a positive development for us versus having smaller brands. So we're seeing positive signals. And as we said last call in April, this is very strategic for us. We continue to focus on the three components of the strategy, driving revitalizing ROCKSTAR, and you will see some news coming out of ROCKSTAR soon, both on the advertising front and the packaging front, reformulation, integrating Bang into our business and there's distribution opportunities and velocity opportunities in some parts of the country. And then moving Dew with more intentionality into spaces of energy that are not well covered we think today, and that we can do a better job. Obviously, we continue to be very focused on Starbucks. Starbucks is a critical part of our energy strategy and Tripleshot, Doubleshot are -- is booming and even more now with people at home. So we're seeing all of those components working for us in the future. We're very optimistic about this part of the business and certainly there's a lot of energy in our teams to get it done. And the team is doing a fantastic job by the way. Right. Good question, Robert. Listen, in our principles, and as we started the pandemic, taking care of our associates was priority number one, and taking care of our customers was priority number two, similar to number one. So I think that was the focus of the company trying to even elevate even more the partnership with our -- with all our customers across any country around the world. So that is a focus of the teams. I think we've been agile, we've been closer to the -- to our partners. We've been transparent with our supply chain challenges in some cases. But I would say in general, we're getting very positive comments from our partners on how we are talking to them, helping them to stay in stock and on time, driving business for both and evolving for the future of demand especially around the space of e-commerce that I mentioned earlier, that it's clearly growing at a very fast pace, faster than we had all forecasted about half a year ago. So that's the dynamic. We've made some choices in our supply chain to -- we've reduced some of the tail of our portfolio. We've discussed that with our partners, retail partners and we both agreed that it's probably the best thing to do to eliminate the less -- let's say, the smaller SKUs in the portfolio to maximize the best selling SKUs and be in stock. As I said earlier, our DSD system, I think is a fundamental advantage in the way we're able to service our customers. And I think they appreciate that we've made the effort adjusting delivery schedules and increasing delivery schedules to make sure that we keep our brands in stock and we help obviously our partners. So that is the level of the commitment we have with our partners. And I think the dialogue is in a very good space and I think this situation will give us a strategic relationship with our partners that I think we had in the past, but it's probably at a higher level today. Listen, I think we have improved a lot, as you mentioned. We have segmented our innovation processes in different quick cycle innovations, more lift and shift, more strategic innovation that takes longer. So, we have a good segmentation of processes across the company and ways of investing and dealing with innovation through different stage, case, approvals and everything related to the size and the velocity that we want from each type of innovation. Yes, the truth is that we're never satisfied enough, right? I mean, so the sense of urgency in anything we do is going up and I think we have improving innovation and we want to improve even more. So from that point of view, we'll continue to make the adjustments to some of the process required. In terms of what you're saying, are consumers changing meaningfully some of their needs, and are we adopting quickly enough? I would say there are a few spaces where we're trying to move quickly. Immunity being one, and we're seeing that our consumers are looking for immunity more, our juice business is booming and we think that -- we can come up with other beverages and even snacks that go against that need. Our snacks, business are being part of meals. We're seeing that more and more. Consumers are cooking more at home and that means that obviously brands like Quaker or some of our Quaker portfolio is being incorporated into meals. But also some of our snacks, like Tostitos, obviously Sabra, and some other brands are being used for meals, right? A Lay's or Ruffles. We are going to obviously move our advertising and our consumer support in terms of giving them recipes and helping them with solutions that, kind of go incentivize that habit. So, there's a marketing element to this. There's also an innovation element to these in terms of packaging or other solutions that we can help consumers moving to that space. So, yes, we're moving quickly. We are never satisfied with our speed of our capabilities. And if you hear the conversations with our internal teams, speed is a key word and we're trying to get better at that. We're trying to be the -- as close as we can to start up with a scale of a large company. So that is one of our aspirations. And I think it's going to be a long journey of improvements, but we're in the right direction. Yes. Thank you everyone for joining us today. It's great to hear from everybody. And for the confidence you've placed in us with your investments. We hope you'll stay safe and healthy. And we look forward to updating you as the year progresses. Thank you again, and have a great day."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to PepsiCo\u2019s First Quarter Earnings Question-and-Answer Session. Your lines have been placed on listen-only until it is your turn to ask a question. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s call is being recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com. It is now my pleasure to introduce, Mr. Ravi Pamnani, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Pamnani, you may begin.\nRavi Pamnani: Thank you operator. I hope everyone has had the chance this morning to read our press release and listen to our prepared comments, both of which are available on our website. Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. We may make forward-looking statements on today\u2019s call, including about our business plans and 2020 guidance and the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties and only reflect our view as of today, and we are under no obligation to update. When discussing our results, we refer to non-GAAP measures, which exclude certain items from reported results. Please refer to today\u2019s earnings release and 10-Q available on pepsico.com for definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures and additional information regarding our results, including a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from forward-looking statements. Joining me today are PepsiCo's Chairman and CEO, Ramon Laguarta; and PepsiCo's Vice Chairman and CFO, Hugh Johnston. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question. And with that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: Hi, gentlemen, hope you're well in this environment. So Ramon I just wanted to touch on the market share opportunity in snacks and beverages going forward. It sounded like the momentum was pretty strong through February pre-COVID and in the COVID environment. But I was hoping you could discuss if there's opportunity for improved share structurally longer term as you look coming out of the COVID crisis. Theoretically in snacks there's a shift to larger trusted brands, which is in your wheelhouse and you've got the DSD distribution advantage. So from a retailer and consumer standpoint there could potentially be a shift there. And then in beverages, theoretically less exposure to the away-from-home channel than some of your competitors should enable you to invest behind the business. So just, sort of, curious if you could run through how you're positioning yourselves for market share advantages coming out of this COVID crisis and if you think there could be some structural improvement longer term beyond what you've already seen over the last year or so.\nRamon Laguarta: Yeah, good morning, Dara. Yeah, it's a good question. Obviously in a moment when it's hard to predict where the category will go right in the coming months then share of market becomes clearly the number one priority for the organization. And as you were saying the investments we made in the business last year both in our structural capabilities but also the strength of our brands and in particular markets gave us a lot of momentum. And as you saw in Q1, it was our fastest growing quarter in a long time even if you deduct the last couple of weeks where we had a positive impact from the stockpiling in the U.S. So you would -- even though -- if you were to ask our people on the ground share of market is the key variable. We see ourselves as you were saying, it's a moment where large brands that people trust, strong supply chains and go-to-markets like we have. Very importantly the talented people that we have in the marketplace, experienced and very talented I think superior teams probably in the marketplace should give us an edge in terms of competing in these few months ahead of us where there's going to be a lot of volatility and being agile and strong. I think it's going to be a very positive opportunity for ourselves.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nBryan Spillane: Hey, good morning, everyone. And maybe just a follow-up on Dara's question. As I was listening to the recorded message, I guess what I took away from it was there is going to be still some investment in SG&A this year some of it in response to the environment, some of it maybe be opportunistic in terms of market share gains. So I guess is that a correct characterization of it as we're thinking about as the year unfolds and the pressure points or the stresses in the P&L? You're looking to spend in SG&A this year because you want the business to exit stronger and also there's going to be some investments to adapt to the environment?\nRamon Laguarta: Hi, Bryan. Good morning. Yes. Of course, I mean, we were in an investment position, and we were very selective, obviously, where we're putting the investments and trying to look for the highest ROI investments everywhere around the world in the different categories. We're not planning to change that position even we might have opportunities ahead of us that tell us that probably the best decision would be to even double down on some of those market opportunities where we can take maybe a short-term advantage now, which will be structural gains for long term. On the other hand, we're looking at all our discretionary costs with a lot of intensity. And as we said in the note, we're looking holistically and very intentionally at unnecessary costs in our P&L at this point both, obviously, to things that are unnecessary, we're going to stop them, but also to have the flexibility to reallocate into areas of the business where we see acceleration. For example, we're seeing, obviously, as you're hearing from everybody else e-commerce being a high-growth channel at this point. So we're reallocating resources from other parts of the P&L into e-commerce and capturing consumers in that particular channel, and then obviously, we'll be -- keep investing to retain those consumers as they probably stay in the e-commerce. There are some brands that are benefiting from this more consumption at home like Quaker. Well, I think we want to invest in some of those brands that are getting consumer tailwinds now because we want to retain those consumers with the brands as we exit the crisis situation. So, yes, our mentality was -- going into the crisis was a mentality of attack. I think we continue to be on the attack, same mentality, obviously put in some strong criteria of ROI to those investments and being very, very kind of tough with every single line of our P&L to make sure that whatever is unnecessary is not there anymore.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Goldman Sachs.\nBonnie Herzog: Thank you. Good morning. I have few questions for you guys on energy drinks. You're certainly stepping up your game here with the announcement you made this morning to distribute Bang. So hoping you could give us a little more color on how you're going to manage the energy category with the different brands. Now you've got Rockstar and now distributing Bang and eventually Mountain Dew. So curious to hear how you're going to prioritize these different brands and how you see the different positioning of them. And then could you guys give us a sense as to how you're going to hit the ground running now that the Rockstar deal is closed? I'm just curious if your plans have changed given everything going on with COVID also as it relates to Mountain Dew. Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Good morning. Yes, let me give you a -- I mean, this is consistent with what we have been saying in the past that we see the energy need state as a very large need state that will stay for many years. I think consumers will need energy during the day in developing markets, developed markets all over the world and that we're going after that consumer occasion with multiple vectors. We're playing with the coffee category, and we continue to think that the coffee category is a great opportunity to capture a lot of occasions there. So with our partnership with Starbucks and some of the innovation we had there, we've been very successful to play in energy need state. Obviously, we have our own innovation with GameFuel and some other innovations we had in the past. The Rockstar deal gives us the opportunity to play with more of these spaces in -- that energy provides. So yes, we'll have the Rockstar portfolio, which I think has been underinvested in the past. So now there are more incentives for our people to drive that business, and we're going to invest in Rockstar. So that's going to be a good segment for us. Obviously, Bang has been a beautiful addition to our portfolio in terms of a differentiated brand that has a lot of momentum in the US in particular channels. A lot of opportunities still in terms of additional distribution and some channels that are not available. So I think our distribution muscle will give Bang an additional push, and there's clearly a lot of consumer positive reception to that brand, so we'll benefit from that. And then as we said in the past, we have a brand in our portfolio, Mountain Dew, that I think has a lot of opportunities in that space as well, and it's kind of natural for Mountain Dew to play in the energy boost category. So you will see some more innovation of our Mountain Dew brand to play more intentionally in that space. And that's how we think about the multiple tools that we can use to play into what is a huge need state. And I think we'll continue with people moving to mega cities and people having very hectic lifestyles.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.\nNik Modi: Hi, good morning, everyone. Ramon I was hoping you can talk about go-to-market and I'm thinking more on the Gatorade side. I mean clearly having availability in a time like this has been critical. And so when you think about warehouse versus DSD of Gatorade between the channels small format, large format and some of the tests that you're running in the Midwest, then I was hoping you could just kind of opine on how you think this should evolve in the future given that this could potentially happen again at some point in the future?\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, that's a great question. I think probably the difficult logistic situation that we've seen in the marketplace in the last few weeks in the U.S. but across the world has probably brought more light to the opportunity that we have in finding better ways to move our Gatorade products into the stores. And although, we have been with great collaboration with all our customers and our partners to find solutions to get that brand quickly into the store because there is a lot of demand for it we've seen some bottlenecks. So as you say we're considering multiple options. Obviously the final decision is always a combination of top line growth and additional cost and complexity to the organization. So it's a complex decision given the size of the brand and the complexities from the logistics point of view. It's a very seasonal brand that has a lot of volume between say May to September, right? So it's a huge spike to our logistics system. So it is a big strategic decision. It's one that we're as you say we're testing different options. We're giving it a lot of thinking time. And the decision will be made together with our partners in the retail space and obviously internally looking at all the different variables. It's a potentially big outlook for Gatorade but also a difficult decision from many points of view.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: Hi, good morning and thank you for taking my question. I hope all is well with all of you. So I was hoping if you can talk about the strength in at-home consumption. So I'm assuming your shipping is still below your demand and you are not worried about any stock destocking in the second quarter. So I was just thinking in your outlook of the low single-digit decline for the second quarter. Are you just assuming as we cycle through the immediate consumption channels, they're still going to be very much impaired through most of the second quarter? And if you can give us an idea what happened in some of the places where the restrictions were lifted. Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Andrea, good morning. Listen we're seeing a lot of uncertainties on how the economies will go back to normal, right? And we have \u2013 obviously, as you can imagine, we have multiple scenarios in what could happen. There are a lot of scenarios that say that it's not going to be so linear as you \u2013 well you're saying that economies will go back to opening right away and that's going to be it, right? I think there might be some scenarios where there will be ups and downs in the way the virus spreads and there will be some particular local areas that could be more exposed in particular moments of time and so on. It might require some additional lockdown decisions or other sort of decisions by the government. So our \u2013 the fact that we're saying that we see uncertainties on geography channels and categories is because we're \u2013 many of our scenarios done are not as linear as you're saying. You're right in pointing out that most of the impact in our categories, especially beverages is related to lack of mobility of people and then there are particular channels that are very linked to mobility and transportation and obviously, some of the out-of-home food. Obviously, if consumers are moving around, there will be more consumption, especially in convenience and gas channel and a bit more on workplaces where we have a good business as well. So that should improve assuming that the consumer will stay \u2013 will be able to continue to move around for the foreseeable months. Now \u2013 but the reason why we're seeing more uncertainty is because we don't think it's going to be a straight line once people go back to moving around. It's going to be a restricted mobility I think and with potential second waves in some particular markets. That's why we're staying cautious and we prefer to have that kind of flexibility in our guidance at this point.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala of Credit Suisse.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Everybody, good morning. Can you talk a bit more about the Bang deal? It obviously makes sense and congratulations on becoming a lot more meaningful in the energy space in what seems like a fairly short period of time. But maybe just some more specifics. It looks like it's a distribution deal and historically distribution deals have favored the founder or supplier a bit more than they favored the distributor. Is there a path to ownership? I think, there's been some deals in the past where a lack of a path to ownership has been detrimental. And maybe just some other basics as in time horizon how long is this deal. Is it perpetual? Things like that. Thanks.\nRamon Laguarta: Hugh, you want to give it your perspective?\nHugh Johnston: Yes. Yes, happy, to do that Ramon. Good morning, Kaumil. A couple of things on it. Obviously, we're not going to disclose all of the details of the deal. The way I'd characterize it is, I think, it presents great upside for the Bang people. It gives them broader and deeper distribution than what they've had to date. It also -- it represents a nice win for us and it really helps us fill out the energy portfolio as we move to a more assertive posture on this category. In terms of any forward deals or sort of M&A contemplated, none of that is in there. So we expect this to sustain for a good period of time. And the last comment I'd make is, unlike the Rockstar deal, we really don't have meaningful restrictions in terms of the way that we manage our portfolio. So we certainly feel, as we take a more assertive posture, we have the freedom to operate in the energy space a great deal.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Good morning.\nRamon Laguarta: Good morning.\nLauren Lieberman: In the prepared remarks, you guys have talked about developing in emerging markets, feeling pressure and that that was sort of thing you were thinking about, discretionary coming under pressure and how the macroeconomic could hurt categories. So I just wanted to get a little bit more on that your thoughts around, because I think category development of packaged snacks is a big part of the kind of long-term plan in international markets and the investments that you've been making, particularly, to promote and support some of your bigger brands, make them a bigger global footprint. So I know it's still pretty early days in all of this, but if you could just talk about D&E market development for snacks as you think about how this crisis unfolds.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, yes. Hi, Lauren. And just a bit of -- as you say, it's still very early, right, in -- if you think about Latin America or Middle East, Africa. Eastern Europe has been in the crisis for a bit longer parts of Asia. What we're seeing in short term is two-fold. One is, there's a good part of the universe of outlets that we service that are shut down or partially shut down during the lockdown. And that impacts a numerical distribution, but also the initial channel sell-in and that impacts our sales. Then the -- if you think about the consumer occasions in those markets, developing markets, there's a lot of on-the-go occasions in those markets, especially -- it tends to be a younger population that buys our products, snacks especially. And a lot of the occasion had to do with moving around or either from school to home or hanging out with friends on the streets. I mean, those kind of occasions are big. And those are somehow limited, right, in the current realities. So that is being impacted. Structurally we don't see any challenge to date, right? What we see is actually probably the opposite. I think, we have, as I was saying at the beginning, very strong supply chains in most of these markets and the brands are quite established. And we're very good at managing the affordability levels in those markets. So where price points or pack price is very important, we have a lot of flexibility in our snack business to adapt the price points in the packs to whatever the currency impacts are in the cost and the price points. So I think there is a lot of know-how. I think we see this as an opportunity for us to even go deeper in our distribution eventually and to double down to accelerate share of market in those -- in a lot of the geographies where we participate. So we see some short-term impact because of the distribution challenges that I told you at the beginning. As soon as the retailers are back to business and we see that happening in many markets after a couple of weeks, obviously, they cannot be opened from the family income point of view, they go back to opening their stores and then life goes back to normal. So we think that this could be actually a boost to our acceleration of the per cap development, our market share presence in a lot of the international markets. The relative size of our business versus competitors tends to be quite large in a lot of our snack businesses globally and we see that as an opportunity today.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein of Evercore.\nRob Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. Guys, at a time when a lot of companies are suspending or cutting their dividend, cutting or stopping share buybacks you guys have basically committed to your initial guidance on those $2 billion of share buybacks, which is just a tremendous financial strength. My question is, is given how the world has changed, how you're thinking about capital allocation now and priorities. Does opportunistic M&A make more sense? How are you weighing all these things in terms of priority also including perhaps even stepping up marketing which was increased a lot last year? And in Q4 you said, it may or may not be increased ahead of sales this year. That was something you were considering, so, just kind of big picture how you're reevaluating capital allocation. Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Hugh, do you want to take that one?\nHugh Johnston: Yeah. Happy to. Rob, a lot of ways there really isn't much change in the way that we think about capital allocation relative to what we've talked about in the past. You're right we do have terrific financial strength. We've actually been in the debt markets both short term and long term and are able to get money at extended maturities at quite attractive rates. So we do have the financial flexibility to continue with the share repurchase as well as obviously pay the dividend. In terms of the capital allocation priorities, it's really number one invest in the business and we'll do that as we see opportunity to do that. Number two, we'll pay the dividend. Number three, we'll continue to look at M&A, but as always we're very selective in the past and as in very selective as in the past and for the number of things that we look at we execute against very, very few. And then last share repurchase, so no real change in that regard. And thankfully, because of the way that we've put together the balance sheet, and because of the strength of the cash flows of the company, we're in a position to continue to execute cash return to shareholders.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen.\nVivien Azer: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for the question. I was hoping to dive a little bit deeper on your commentary around increased at-home per capital consumption during your prepared remarks around consumers eating more breakfast and snacking more at home. That seems to be apparent in the Nielsen data that's come out today, where salty snacks continues to grow though it did decelerate. But I think, it does kind of raise the bigger question that it seems like some categories are seeing a pantry load and a de-load like with sports drinks down in the current four-week period and some still stronger. So as you're thinking about the second quarter, which categories do you think can sustain higher levels of per capita consumption in the at-home occasion? And where do you expect to see some pantry destocking? Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Good. Yeah, let me try that. We're seeing, yeah, as you're saying both obviously our Quaker range increasing penetration massively. So the number of families that have bought Quaker in the last six weeks has gone up a lot. And we're seeing obviously, I mean there's one clear reason, right? People are cooking at home and therefore they're using the product more. And we're seeing the cycle of repurchase also good. So I don't think there's much stocking in the house as long as people continue to have breakfast or continue to cook at home. And we're emphasizing in our marketing not only the breakfast opportunity, but also the cooking and the recipes where our oats can be part of that cooking opportunity. And this is here in the U.S., but it's also in Latin America where we've moved 100% to recipes on oats and some of our Quaker products. The good news for us is, we've made a lot of positive changes to Quaker products, right? We reduced sugar. We reduced artificials. We improved the formulas. I think we have better-tasting products as well. So hopefully, this is an opportunity for the consumers to reassess the brand and to give it a structural boost. So we're dedicating our market investments to that particular trial and repurchase of the Quaker range of product, which I think are extremely good and great tasting. Then, when you see the snack product, obviously, I mean there's many more occasions in the family now with the kids at home, and with \u2013 we're all taking breaks during the day between our busy days and then occasions watching TV together as a family or whatever. So, there are a lot of occasions at home now that they were not there six or seven weeks ago. So we're also emphasizing the \u2013 in our advertising the opportunities that the snacks category give consumers to have moments of enjoyment during this confinement. We're seeing our multipacks, our variety packs increasing massively. We're seeing our Tostitos brand, our dips going up a lot. I mean, obviously, every single brand, but those are where we're seeing the highest growth. And the beauty to your point on stocking, the beauty of our snacks is that, it can only last for a certain period of time and they have expiry dates. So consumers will eat them. They will not stock them forever. So we see the cycles of repurchase also very clear on the snack business and those are products that people buy put in their pantry and they get consumed by the whole family.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: Hey good morning guys. Hope you're well. Ramon looking out over the horizon and I guess building on some of the comments you made in response to Andrea's question. I was hoping you could elaborate a bit further on your early thoughts around an exit strategy from current lockdown conditions specifically in North America and Western Europe, maybe building on any lessons learned from China and commenting on whether that strategy and its timing is likely to vary at all snacks versus beverages in your view. And I guess, I'd also love any thoughts you have as -- or expectations around how your approach and the timing may differ across markets whether based on consumer -- customer mentalities, your competitive standing or just governmental policy. Just what does the exit strategy look like?\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. No I was -- my point was more about the fact that will it be very linear or not. And I think as we're obviously looking at all the different scenarios and as we imagine managing the company now is -- there's a lot of scenario planning and a lot of options and staying super agile. That's kind of the way, we're empowering the front line being super agile and just playing scenarios. I mean that's the way we're managing the company today. So in our scenario planning, I mean the chances of every country opening up and every state opening up and not having second waves, I think are low. right? I mean you've seen the virus. The virus is still around. We don't have treatments and we don't have vaccines. So until we have good treatments and good vaccine, we should be very cautious, right? And therefore it's going to be down to a lot of -- billion of people, individual behaviors whether we get contaminated or not. So that's what I meant, right, when I said we need to be careful that we don't project straight lines, the moment the state opens we're all free and that business will come back. I think there's going to be a lot of iterations. Our approach to this is, I would say extremely aggressive on the commercial side in the sense that we want to be the first knocking at the door or every single store that opens with our mechanics and our salesmen trying to fix the equipment and refill the coolers and putting our racks in the first position and making sure that every consumer that walks into that store buys our products. So that's -- from the commercial mentality that's how we're approaching this opportunity of restarting a lot of points of sale. From the safety of our employees, obviously we're being extremely cautious and want to make sure that our people are extremely well protected and that are -- we care for them in a way that is better than anybody else. So, those are the tensions in the business: on the one hand protecting our people 100%; on the other hand being the most aggressive commercially, so that when a store opens in any state in any country around the world, we're the first company that knocks on the door to place our equipment. And that's the balance that we're trying to be the best at. And that's why I was referring earlier at the beginning that having very good people on the ground extremely talented very experienced with a lot of -- having been through a lot of ups and downs in the marketplace, gives me a lot of confidence that we can deliver in an advantage way. And that's how we're thinking about all this complexity ahead of us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet of Guggenheim.\nLaurent Grandet: Hey good morning Ramon and Hugh, innovative format to read your results this morning. I like that. I have a follow-up question on energy actually. On Bang how much will you be able to distribute immediately? And how fast are you planning to exit from existing distribution agreements? And then clearly upside in energy is primarily affecting the U.S., could you help us understand how internationally -- international could benefit from the Rockstar acquisition as in some countries like in the U.K., I mean the current distributor has been communicating that there was no change to its distribution agreement. And also why Bang distribution did it just for the U.S.? So what's the plan basically for international in energy?\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. Hey, Laurent, good morning. Listen, I won't give you a lot of details on the details of the movement from the existing distribution network of Bang to our network. But it will be progressive. It will start in some channels as early as, early May. And I would assume that by the beginning of Q4, it should pretty much be in our tracks. I mean that's how we're thinking about it. There will be exceptions but that should be -- that's our ongoing assumptions. Internationally, we have very strong energy businesses in many countries with our own brands Sting or Ad Rush in Russia and all of Eastern Europe. Pretty strong brands. Now, the Rockstar brand and formulations give us another tool to penetrate that market. It's going to be elevated as one of the priorities of the company internationally in our beverage business. And obviously, we will be applying the framework that we applied to any opportunity in our beverage market which is stronghold, battleground, or challenge your markets and make sure that we segment the way we operate our priorities commercially in those markets based on that framework. So, we'll do the same with Rockstar. But you should -- obviously, long-term you'll see more markets carrying our Rockstar brands internationally and being a bit more of an active player in the energy category.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sean King of UBS.\nSean King: Thanks for the question. Mountain Dew I guess returned to growth. Is this the sustainable inflection we were looking for or is there an aspect of the pre-COVID pantry loading to help drive that?\nRamon Laguarta: Listen we've been investing a lot in Mountain Dew. And obviously, there's a return on that investment, right? The growth in Q1 there's been a very good innovation for us that has been Zero Mountain Dew and that seems to be getting a lot of good reception by consumers. And we knew that we were losing some segment of consumers to other non-sugar brands. So, the fact of having a zero proposition in Mountain Dew I think it's getting some of those consumers back into the franchise. Our marketing is also obviously helping us to get consumers into higher frequency levels. I think the fact that we now have more freedom to innovate in Mountain Dew and be a bit more intentional about energy would also give us another vector of opportunity for Mountain Dew. So, I wouldn't say that we're 100% out of the woods in Mountain Dew, but I see a lot of bright spots in how the brand is performing in particular channels. It is now impacted a little bit more than others in convenience stores. I mean that brand has particular higher penetration in impulse channel and convenience stores. So, the fact that convenience stores are down in traffic and obviously, given the current transportation limitations that impacts Mountain Dew a bit more than other brands. But obviously as soon as people are driving around and moving around, we'll see that brand coming back and we'll be ready with our commercial programs when that circumstance occur.\nOperator: Our final question today will come from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust.\nBill Chappell: Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick question on kind of commodity outlook and any changes you're doing or thinking about in terms of near or long-term hedges and how we should look at it in terms of is it largely -- the benefit largely offset by currency in terms of kind of your outlook. I realize you're not giving guidance, but just kind of how we should think about it. Or is there more we just have yet to see as it kind of flows through the supply chain over the next two three quarters? So, any color there would be great.\nRamon Laguarta: Hugh do you want to take that please?\nHugh Johnston: Yes. Yes, I've got it. Hey Bill. As you know we've been sort of systematically buying for a number of years now. We tend to be six to 18 months out. Right now we expect low single-digit commodity inflation both for Q2 and for the balance of the year and that includes transaction FX. At this point, we're about 80% covered on market-traded commodities and about two-thirds over the entire basket. We haven't made any huge material changes. We did go a little bit longer on oil as the market went so far down as to be in in a lot of cases below the cost of production. But other than that, I would expect us to continue to run our systematic forward-buying program because it has set us up well for predictability in cost as well as predictability in pricing in the marketplace. So, I think that strategy continues to serve us well.\nRamon Laguarta: Very good. So, thank you all for joining us today and for the confidence that you've placed in us with your investments. We hope that you all stay safe and healthy and we look forward to updating you on -- as the year progresses on our performance. Thank you very much. Stay safe please.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in PepsiCo's first quarter 2020 earnings Q&A session. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Yes. Yes, happy, to do that Ramon. Good morning, Kaumil. A couple of things on it. Obviously, we're not going to disclose all of the details of the deal. The way I'd characterize it is, I think, it presents great upside for the Bang people. It gives them broader and deeper distribution than what they've had to date. It also -- it represents a nice win for us and it really helps us fill out the energy portfolio as we move to a more assertive posture on this category. In terms of any forward deals or sort of M&A contemplated, none of that is in there. So we expect this to sustain for a good period of time. And the last comment I'd make is, unlike the Rockstar deal, we really don't have meaningful restrictions in terms of the way that we manage our portfolio. So we certainly feel, as we take a more assertive posture, we have the freedom to operate in the energy space a great deal. Yeah. Happy to. Rob, a lot of ways there really isn't much change in the way that we think about capital allocation relative to what we've talked about in the past. You're right we do have terrific financial strength. We've actually been in the debt markets both short term and long term and are able to get money at extended maturities at quite attractive rates. So we do have the financial flexibility to continue with the share repurchase as well as obviously pay the dividend. In terms of the capital allocation priorities, it's really number one invest in the business and we'll do that as we see opportunity to do that. Number two, we'll pay the dividend. Number three, we'll continue to look at M&A, but as always we're very selective in the past and as in very selective as in the past and for the number of things that we look at we execute against very, very few. And then last share repurchase, so no real change in that regard. And thankfully, because of the way that we've put together the balance sheet, and because of the strength of the cash flows of the company, we're in a position to continue to execute cash return to shareholders. Yes. Yes, I've got it. Hey Bill. As you know we've been sort of systematically buying for a number of years now. We tend to be six to 18 months out. Right now we expect low single-digit commodity inflation both for Q2 and for the balance of the year and that includes transaction FX.

            "name": "Ramon Laguarta",
            "content": "Yeah, good morning, Dara. Yeah, it's a good question. Obviously in a moment when it's hard to predict where the category will go right in the coming months then share of market becomes clearly the number one priority for the organization. And as you were saying the investments we made in the business last year both in our structural capabilities but also the strength of our brands and in particular markets gave us a lot of momentum. And as you saw in Q1, it was our fastest growing quarter in a long time even if you deduct the last couple of weeks where we had a positive impact from the stockpiling in the U.S. So you would -- even though -- if you were to ask our people on the ground share of market is the key variable. We see ourselves as you were saying, it's a moment where large brands that people trust, strong supply chains and go-to-markets like we have. Very importantly the talented people that we have in the marketplace, experienced and very talented I think superior teams probably in the marketplace should give us an edge in terms of competing in these few months ahead of us where there's going to be a lot of volatility and being agile and strong. I think it's going to be a very positive opportunity for ourselves. Hi, Bryan. Good morning. Yes. Of course, I mean, we were in an investment position, and we were very selective, obviously, where we're putting the investments and trying to look for the highest ROI investments everywhere around the world in the different categories. We're not planning to change that position even we might have opportunities ahead of us that tell us that probably the best decision would be to even double down on some of those market opportunities where we can take maybe a short-term advantage now, which will be structural gains for long term. On the other hand, we're looking at all our discretionary costs with a lot of intensity. And as we said in the note, we're looking holistically and very intentionally at unnecessary costs in our P&L at this point both, obviously, to things that are unnecessary, we're going to stop them, but also to have the flexibility to reallocate into areas of the business where we see acceleration. For example, we're seeing, obviously, as you're hearing from everybody else e-commerce being a high-growth channel at this point. So we're reallocating resources from other parts of the P&L into e-commerce and capturing consumers in that particular channel, and then obviously, we'll be -- keep investing to retain those consumers as they probably stay in the e-commerce. There are some brands that are benefiting from this more consumption at home like Quaker. Well, I think we want to invest in some of those brands that are getting consumer tailwinds now because we want to retain those consumers with the brands as we exit the crisis situation. So, yes, our mentality was -- going into the crisis was a mentality of attack. I think we continue to be on the attack, same mentality, obviously put in some strong criteria of ROI to those investments and being very, very kind of tough with every single line of our P&L to make sure that whatever is unnecessary is not there anymore. Good morning. Yes, let me give you a -- I mean, this is consistent with what we have been saying in the past that we see the energy need state as a very large need state that will stay for many years. I think consumers will need energy during the day in developing markets, developed markets all over the world and that we're going after that consumer occasion with multiple vectors. We're playing with the coffee category, and we continue to think that the coffee category is a great opportunity to capture a lot of occasions there. So with our partnership with Starbucks and some of the innovation we had there, we've been very successful to play in energy need state. Obviously, we have our own innovation with GameFuel and some other innovations we had in the past. The Rockstar deal gives us the opportunity to play with more of these spaces in -- that energy provides. So yes, we'll have the Rockstar portfolio, which I think has been underinvested in the past. So now there are more incentives for our people to drive that business, and we're going to invest in Rockstar. So that's going to be a good segment for us. Obviously, Bang has been a beautiful addition to our portfolio in terms of a differentiated brand that has a lot of momentum in the US in particular channels. A lot of opportunities still in terms of additional distribution and some channels that are not available. So I think our distribution muscle will give Bang an additional push, and there's clearly a lot of consumer positive reception to that brand, so we'll benefit from that. And then as we said in the past, we have a brand in our portfolio, Mountain Dew, that I think has a lot of opportunities in that space as well, and it's kind of natural for Mountain Dew to play in the energy boost category. So you will see some more innovation of our Mountain Dew brand to play more intentionally in that space. And that's how we think about the multiple tools that we can use to play into what is a huge need state. And I think we'll continue with people moving to mega cities and people having very hectic lifestyles. Yes, that's a great question. I think probably the difficult logistic situation that we've seen in the marketplace in the last few weeks in the U.S. but across the world has probably brought more light to the opportunity that we have in finding better ways to move our Gatorade products into the stores. And although, we have been with great collaboration with all our customers and our partners to find solutions to get that brand quickly into the store because there is a lot of demand for it we've seen some bottlenecks. So as you say we're considering multiple options. Obviously the final decision is always a combination of top line growth and additional cost and complexity to the organization. So it's a complex decision given the size of the brand and the complexities from the logistics point of view. It's a very seasonal brand that has a lot of volume between say May to September, right? So it's a huge spike to our logistics system. So it is a big strategic decision. It's one that we're as you say we're testing different options. We're giving it a lot of thinking time. And the decision will be made together with our partners in the retail space and obviously internally looking at all the different variables. It's a potentially big outlook for Gatorade but also a difficult decision from many points of view. Andrea, good morning. Listen we're seeing a lot of uncertainties on how the economies will go back to normal, right? And we have \u2013 obviously, as you can imagine, we have multiple scenarios in what could happen. There are a lot of scenarios that say that it's not going to be so linear as you \u2013 well you're saying that economies will go back to opening right away and that's going to be it, right? I think there might be some scenarios where there will be ups and downs in the way the virus spreads and there will be some particular local areas that could be more exposed in particular moments of time and so on. It might require some additional lockdown decisions or other sort of decisions by the government. So our \u2013 the fact that we're saying that we see uncertainties on geography channels and categories is because we're \u2013 many of our scenarios done are not as linear as you're saying. You're right in pointing out that most of the impact in our categories, especially beverages is related to lack of mobility of people and then there are particular channels that are very linked to mobility and transportation and obviously, some of the out-of-home food. Obviously, if consumers are moving around, there will be more consumption, especially in convenience and gas channel and a bit more on workplaces where we have a good business as well. So that should improve assuming that the consumer will stay \u2013 will be able to continue to move around for the foreseeable months. Now \u2013 but the reason why we're seeing more uncertainty is because we don't think it's going to be a straight line once people go back to moving around. It's going to be a restricted mobility I think and with potential second waves in some particular markets. That's why we're staying cautious and we prefer to have that kind of flexibility in our guidance at this point. Hugh, you want to give it your perspective? Good morning. Yes, yes. Hi, Lauren. And just a bit of -- as you say, it's still very early, right, in -- if you think about Latin America or Middle East, Africa. Eastern Europe has been in the crisis for a bit longer parts of Asia. What we're seeing in short term is two-fold. One is, there's a good part of the universe of outlets that we service that are shut down or partially shut down during the lockdown. And that impacts a numerical distribution, but also the initial channel sell-in and that impacts our sales. Then the -- if you think about the consumer occasions in those markets, developing markets, there's a lot of on-the-go occasions in those markets, especially -- it tends to be a younger population that buys our products, snacks especially. And a lot of the occasion had to do with moving around or either from school to home or hanging out with friends on the streets. I mean, those kind of occasions are big. And those are somehow limited, right, in the current realities. So that is being impacted. Structurally we don't see any challenge to date, right? What we see is actually probably the opposite. I think, we have, as I was saying at the beginning, very strong supply chains in most of these markets and the brands are quite established. And we're very good at managing the affordability levels in those markets. So where price points or pack price is very important, we have a lot of flexibility in our snack business to adapt the price points in the packs to whatever the currency impacts are in the cost and the price points. So I think there is a lot of know-how. I think we see this as an opportunity for us to even go deeper in our distribution eventually and to double down to accelerate share of market in those -- in a lot of the geographies where we participate. So we see some short-term impact because of the distribution challenges that I told you at the beginning. As soon as the retailers are back to business and we see that happening in many markets after a couple of weeks, obviously, they cannot be opened from the family income point of view, they go back to opening their stores and then life goes back to normal. So we think that this could be actually a boost to our acceleration of the per cap development, our market share presence in a lot of the international markets. The relative size of our business versus competitors tends to be quite large in a lot of our snack businesses globally and we see that as an opportunity today. Hugh, do you want to take that one? Good. Yeah, let me try that. We're seeing, yeah, as you're saying both obviously our Quaker range increasing penetration massively. So the number of families that have bought Quaker in the last six weeks has gone up a lot. And we're seeing obviously, I mean there's one clear reason, right? People are cooking at home and therefore they're using the product more. And we're seeing the cycle of repurchase also good. So I don't think there's much stocking in the house as long as people continue to have breakfast or continue to cook at home. And we're emphasizing in our marketing not only the breakfast opportunity, but also the cooking and the recipes where our oats can be part of that cooking opportunity. And this is here in the U.S., but it's also in Latin America where we've moved 100% to recipes on oats and some of our Quaker products. The good news for us is, we've made a lot of positive changes to Quaker products, right? We reduced sugar. We reduced artificials. We improved the formulas. I think we have better-tasting products as well. So hopefully, this is an opportunity for the consumers to reassess the brand and to give it a structural boost. So we're dedicating our market investments to that particular trial and repurchase of the Quaker range of product, which I think are extremely good and great tasting. Then, when you see the snack product, obviously, I mean there's many more occasions in the family now with the kids at home, and with \u2013 we're all taking breaks during the day between our busy days and then occasions watching TV together as a family or whatever. So, there are a lot of occasions at home now that they were not there six or seven weeks ago. So we're also emphasizing the \u2013 in our advertising the opportunities that the snacks category give consumers to have moments of enjoyment during this confinement. We're seeing our multipacks, our variety packs increasing massively. We're seeing our Tostitos brand, our dips going up a lot. I mean, obviously, every single brand, but those are where we're seeing the highest growth. And the beauty to your point on stocking, the beauty of our snacks is that, it can only last for a certain period of time and they have expiry dates. So consumers will eat them. They will not stock them forever. So we see the cycles of repurchase also very clear on the snack business and those are products that people buy put in their pantry and they get consumed by the whole family. Yes. No I was -- my point was more about the fact that will it be very linear or not. And I think as we're obviously looking at all the different scenarios and as we imagine managing the company now is -- there's a lot of scenario planning and a lot of options and staying super agile. That's kind of the way, we're empowering the front line being super agile and just playing scenarios. I mean that's the way we're managing the company today. So in our scenario planning, I mean the chances of every country opening up and every state opening up and not having second waves, I think are low. right? I mean you've seen the virus. The virus is still around. We don't have treatments and we don't have vaccines. So until we have good treatments and good vaccine, we should be very cautious, right? And therefore it's going to be down to a lot of -- billion of people, individual behaviors whether we get contaminated or not. So that's what I meant, right, when I said we need to be careful that we don't project straight lines, the moment the state opens we're all free and that business will come back. I think there's going to be a lot of iterations. Our approach to this is, I would say extremely aggressive on the commercial side in the sense that we want to be the first knocking at the door or every single store that opens with our mechanics and our salesmen trying to fix the equipment and refill the coolers and putting our racks in the first position and making sure that every consumer that walks into that store buys our products. So that's -- from the commercial mentality that's how we're approaching this opportunity of restarting a lot of points of sale. From the safety of our employees, obviously we're being extremely cautious and want to make sure that our people are extremely well protected and that are -- we care for them in a way that is better than anybody else. So, those are the tensions in the business: on the one hand protecting our people 100%; on the other hand being the most aggressive commercially, so that when a store opens in any state in any country around the world, we're the first company that knocks on the door to place our equipment. And that's the balance that we're trying to be the best at. And that's why I was referring earlier at the beginning that having very good people on the ground extremely talented very experienced with a lot of -- having been through a lot of ups and downs in the marketplace, gives me a lot of confidence that we can deliver in an advantage way. And that's how we're thinking about all this complexity ahead of us. Yes. Hey, Laurent, good morning. Listen, I won't give you a lot of details on the details of the movement from the existing distribution network of Bang to our network. But it will be progressive. It will start in some channels as early as, early May. And I would assume that by the beginning of Q4, it should pretty much be in our tracks. I mean that's how we're thinking about it. There will be exceptions but that should be -- that's our ongoing assumptions. Internationally, we have very strong energy businesses in many countries with our own brands Sting or Ad Rush in Russia and all of Eastern Europe. Pretty strong brands. Now, the Rockstar brand and formulations give us another tool to penetrate that market. It's going to be elevated as one of the priorities of the company internationally in our beverage business. And obviously, we will be applying the framework that we applied to any opportunity in our beverage market which is stronghold, battleground, or challenge your markets and make sure that we segment the way we operate our priorities commercially in those markets based on that framework. So, we'll do the same with Rockstar. But you should -- obviously, long-term you'll see more markets carrying our Rockstar brands internationally and being a bit more of an active player in the energy category. Listen we've been investing a lot in Mountain Dew. And obviously, there's a return on that investment, right? The growth in Q1 there's been a very good innovation for us that has been Zero Mountain Dew and that seems to be getting a lot of good reception by consumers. And we knew that we were losing some segment of consumers to other non-sugar brands. So, the fact of having a zero proposition in Mountain Dew I think it's getting some of those consumers back into the franchise. Our marketing is also obviously helping us to get consumers into higher frequency levels. I think the fact that we now have more freedom to innovate in Mountain Dew and be a bit more intentional about energy would also give us another vector of opportunity for Mountain Dew. So, I wouldn't say that we're 100% out of the woods in Mountain Dew, but I see a lot of bright spots in how the brand is performing in particular channels. It is now impacted a little bit more than others in convenience stores. I mean that brand has particular higher penetration in impulse channel and convenience stores. So, the fact that convenience stores are down in traffic and obviously, given the current transportation limitations that impacts Mountain Dew a bit more than other brands. But obviously as soon as people are driving around and moving around, we'll see that brand coming back and we'll be ready with our commercial programs when that circumstance occur. Hugh do you want to take that please? Very good. So, thank you all for joining us today and for the confidence that you've placed in us with your investments. We hope that you all stay safe and healthy and we look forward to updating you on -- as the year progresses on our performance. Thank you very much. Stay safe please."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning and welcome to PepsiCo's 2021 Fourth Quarter Earnings Question-and-Answer Session. Your lines have been placed on listen-only until it is your turn to ask a question. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Ravi Pamnani, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Pamnani you may begin.\nRavi Pamnani: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. I hope everyone has had a chance this morning to review our press release and prepared remarks. Both of which are available on our website. Before we begin please take note of our cautionary statement. We may make forward-looking statements on today's call, including about our business plans, 2022 guidance and long-term financial targets and the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties and only reflect our view as of today, February 10, 2022 and we are under no obligation to update. When discussing our results, we refer to non-GAAP measures, which exclude certain items from reported results. Please refer to our fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings release and 2021 Form 10-K available on pepsico.com for definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures and additional information regarding our results, including a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from forward-looking statements. Joining me today are PepsiCo's Chairman and CEO, Ramon Laguarta; and PepsiCo's Vice Chairman and CFO, Hugh Johnston. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question. And with that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: Good morning guys.\nRamon Laguarta: Good morning Dara.\nDara Mohsenian: So I wanted to focus on the 2022 top line guidance. Obviously very strong Q4 results. But look you're guiding towards the higher end of the long-term range in terms of 6% organic sales growth in 2022 despite a really tough comparison if we look at 2021. So I just wanted to understand the key drivers for 2022 top line, particularly price mix versus volume, and any thoughts on demand elasticity? And then also just from a broader long-term perspective as you look out beyond 2022, are you more confident your strategies are sustainably paying off? Could top line growth be more at the higher end of that mid-single-digit long-term top line range? How do you think about the long-term beyond 2022 given what's expected to be pretty robust growth despite the tough comp? Thanks.\nRamon Laguarta: Yeah. Dara let me start and maybe Hugh can add. We see our categories very healthy moving into 2022 and long-term, both our convenient foods and beverages. So that makes us feel very comfortable. The investments that we have made over the last three years in brands, in more capable go-to-market systems, in more insights, better execution that's clearly paying off in the form of share of market gains in across multiple developing markets snacks and beverages. So we feel good about our ability to continue to grow ahead of our categories in 2022 and beyond. And, obviously, we are big players in those categories. So, we carry the responsibility to make this category stay healthy and stay growing faster than food overall. So, that's how we see our long-term. And yes we -- obviously, if you think about next year, yes, we're at the top end of our long-term guidance. This year, obviously, we -- I mean last year we obviously crossed that long-term guidance. So, you see compounded, yes, we're at the high end of our 4% to 6%. And obviously we -- that's the objective of the whole organization to stay within the - that guidance and beat in good years.\nHugh Johnston: Yes. And the only thing I'll add there in terms of some of the financial pieces of it you saw in Q4, we had about five points of volume and about seven points of price/mix. Obviously, we're -- as our hedges roll off and we move into a new round of commodities, we're going to price in a way that allows us at least for the full year to try to keep our margins pretty well intact, which means that that seven pricing will probably be around there. Maybe even a little bit stronger for the year. We'll see how it plays out and react to what happens with the facts in the marketplace. But it's going to be a pretty healthy pricing year to accommodate the cost increases.\nDara Mohsenian: And if I can follow-up or -- what are you assuming in terms of demand elasticity? And what's been the experience so far you've seen in terms of consumer demand elasticity to pricing? Seem like there clearly wasn't a lot in Q4, but what are you assuming for 2022? Thanks.\nHugh Johnston: Yes. So, I mean for 2022 Dara you're right. Obviously there wasn't a lot in Q4, but that's a relatively short period of time. Right now we've built multiple scenarios around elasticity and where we have plans to react to any of them. So, frankly, we'll -- we're going to have to be very agile this year in the way that we plan. But you know that our history on guidance is we tend to have multiple ways to get there and we'll react to what the marketplace gives us.\nDara Mohsenian: Thanks.\nRamon Laguarta: I think Dara if you think about all the investments we've made in the last few years both in the brand's strength or some of our net revenue capabilities, even our execution capabilities the granularity that we can execute in the stores, that's clearly giving us a lot of I would say tools to play the marketplace and to manage the price increases in better ways than we used to do it in the past. So, we're also contemplating that as a factor as we're building our 2022 scenarios.\nDara Mohsenian: Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs.\nBonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you. good morning. Actually had a question on your A&M spend in the quarter. I guess on a dollar basis, it seemed to have almost doubled in the quarter versus Q3 and then came in at maybe a record as a percentage of sales at almost 8% in the quarter versus your typical, call it I don't know 6.5%. So, I just was hoping you guys could give us a little more color on where you stepped up the spending in the quarter. And then how much do you think that did contribute to your robust topline growth in Q4? And then thinking about it typically there is a lag with spending. So, I'm also wondering if this is partly what you expect to drive your topline guidance at the high end of your long-term growth how it go.\nHugh Johnston: Yes. Hi Bonnie, it's Hugh. A couple of things on that. One A&M for the year was up 11%. For the quarter, it was up 15%. But remember when you're dealing with the quarter, that's not necessarily what's in the marketplace. That's sort of the A&M curve and we book A&M on the revenue curve. In terms of spend \u2013 the spend was up in the quarter for sure. I don't know that, it was disproportionately up relative to the rest of the year. And in terms of go-forward, I expect our A&M as it generally has will probably be in or around the same level of growth as the sales growth number is. Obviously, we feel terrific about the advertising we're doing. We think it's having the right impact. But we clearly were the beneficiaries of in North America some reduction. And we think that's also played well. We generally are spending at a competitive level and we're trying to compete on quality of the A&M not necessarily the quantity of the A&M.\nRamon Laguarta: Yeah. Bonnie one of the things we're \u2013 I think we're getting better at is measuring our return on investment on our marketing. And we're \u2013 the more data we have and obviously we're becoming a better data company, we're able to put better numbers to those investments and have the marketing teams, and the commercial teams overall choosing different levers that give us the best return overall. And that's playing very well. It's obviously, one of the reasons why we're gaining market share across many categories. It's strategically \u2013 we want to continue with this kind of investments being very rational in the way we invest in A&M, but understanding that a company like ours the core competence is building brands. And that's what give us in situations like we're having this year where we have to price, we have consumers following us in spite of higher prices. So I think strategically, it's a very important element in our overall growth strategy.\nBonnie Herzog: Okay. Helpful. Seems to be working. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to just talk about PBNA volumes, because accelerated sequentially and on a two-year basis and now putting up growth on growth. And I was just curious, how you might kind of bucket the drivers of that. And I'm going to guess part of it you're going to say oh it's a little bit of everything. But zeros have been in the market, I think arguably all year. And I thought, maybe there's something to be said for the reorganization of the market, and that may be starting to click in a different way. So just curious on any perspective on the accelerating trends in PBNA that would be great. Thanks.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. Lauren, the \u2013 I would say, if you take a bigger picture I think there is a elevated in-home consumption that has stayed like that. I think Home-as-a-hub is a clear trend, and we're seeing \u2013 we're capturing pretty good that consumption at home. And obviously, during the quarter, there's been more mobility across the multiple markets in the US obviously, but globally, I would say. And then some of the Away from Home business has accelerated as well. So what you see there is a combination of all these channels, I think playing at a very high level. Then, if you go into our own business, I would say, it's a combination of branding, better execution. And the truth is that in Q4 we've seen an improvement sequentially of our supply chain. And some of our large brands, and I would name Gatorade for example, clearly has improved substantially in its running rates and fill rates in the last part of the quarter. So that's reflected as well in a better overall performance for the business. But we're very pleased in general with the way the North America business is performing in beverages and snacks as well. And both the margin expansion, the top line, the fact that it grew with the market a bit faster than the market in a very challenging year with a lot of supply chain complexities and bottlenecks for several reasons. So we're very pleased. We're feeling comfortable as well for 2022. It's very strong commercial programs, very strong brand programs. And as you were saying, probably a better execution machine for many reasons, data and intelligence, but also more empowered organization that makes more local decisions and that's obviously reflected in the performance of the business. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Teixeira with JPMorgan. \nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you. Good morning. I have a question on sports drinks and then a clarification on the pricing. First on Gatorade. It was a brand that obviously was pressured in 2021 from supply chain challenges and competition. And as you go into 2022, can you talk about the supply dynamics there and inventory for the brand? And then on the pricing, I think, embedded in your guidance I understand that it's assuming only the pricing that is already in the market. And therefore I wanted to see if we can bridge from Hugh's comments and seeing the visibility of the gross margin curve potentially recovered by the end of the year and potentially being up year-over-year for the full year. Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, Andrea. Let me talk to you about the Gatorade and then Hugh can talk more about the pricing. We're very optimistic with this sports drink category. But we think of it broadly than just hydration, we think about overall nutrition. And the way Gatorade play in that space along with some other brands like Propel, Muscle Milk, Evolve and some other assets that we have in that space, it is growing very fast. We see continued consumer adoption of this category. Consumers are exercising more. And we think that's a very positive trend for the segment. When it comes to Gatorade, the brand equity is stronger than ever. And the innovation that we've done this year and you will see more next year be it Zero, be it Gatorade, be it some of the more science related with the sweat patch and how we can be much more customized for the consumer based on their hydration profile. So there's a lot of positive value that I think we can create in higher parts of the category with Gatorade and some of the other brands. So we feel good about the demand momentum. On the supply, obviously, we have reacted to the situation. And we've expanded capacity both ourselves and some of our co-packers. And we're ready for what we think will be another year of successful growth for Gatorade and continue to build the brand in spaces that will be hard to match by a competitor. So that's how we are approaching Gatorade and the full category next year.\nHugh Johnston: Yes. Andrea, how are you? I'll expand on the -- your question on the other side. Our assumptions on the guidance are based on the pricing that we have in the marketplace right now. And that pricing is based on the visibility that we have into, both the productivity and the cost structure and commodities, which we have pretty good visibility into on the commodities about, eight, nine months of the year, as you would expect based on some of the things I've communicated in the past. Q4 is a bit -- still a bit open, but there are obviously pricing windows as we get into the fourth quarter as well. So as those facts become more known, we'll make decisions on that front. Regarding your question on margins, obviously, we don't give guidance on margins. But I think given the combination of what we know about costs and what we know about pricing, we ought to be able to get through the year pretty well intact on margins, acknowledging the fact that earlier in the year the cost pressure is a little bit higher than it is later in the year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane: Hey, good morning. Just \u2013 maybe just two follow-ups. One is just Hugh, your answer in response to Andrea's question, when you're saying margins, are you talking about EBIT margins or gross margins? \nHugh Johnston: Both actually. \nBryan Spillane: Okay. Okay. And then my question is about just the share repurchases coming back in this year. Hugh, can you talk a little bit about where we stand now in terms of cash return to shareholders? I think part of the motivation to maybe pull back on repurchases at the beginning of 2021 was your CapEx is going to be elevated for a while. And I know you're watching the leverage or \u2013 the credit rating. So is this just a \u2013 now you're \u2013 there's more comfort with being able to return more cash to shareholders, or is it a change in CapEx outlook? Just trying to understand if we can \u2013 how you're thinking about that. \nHugh Johnston: Yes. I mean we \u2013 obviously, we made the decision not just based on what we see this year but what we see over the next couple of years. Number one, we really had a pretty good year on cash generation last year, which gave us a little bit of extra room. In addition to that obviously, we had the Tropicana transaction, which brought us some room as well. And we just really closed that over the course of the last week or so. So the combination of those two factors led us to the decision. As I mentioned last year, CapEx will be elevated for another year or two. But frankly I think that's well within the sort of overall envelope that we're working on and we got comfortable with going back to share repurchase. And obviously, it's a one of the levers we use to help drive company performance and shareholder returns.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim.\nLaurent Grandet: Hey, good morning, Ramon and Hugh. Well, I do \u2013 I'd like to focus this morning on the energy platform. So it has been about two years since the acquisition of Rockstar that unlocked the energy platform an advantage PepsiCo has over your competitor that is limited because of its contract with Monster. So could you please update us on where you are seeing your \u2013 where you're heading? Because the beginning of been \u2013 has been a bit more challenged than expected with the difficulty with bank management, nothing to rise name change and Rockstar taking a bit more time to further rise. So that is a high growth, high profitability segment of the business, it doesn't impact on PP&M and the rest of the business. So could you please update us on what you are seeing and where you're heading? Thanks.\nRamon Laguarta: Thank you, Laurent. Good to talk to you. Listen, we're executing the playbook as we told you we've been quite consistent on the last few calls. And we're quite pleased with what we're seeing. Obviously, Rockstar, we always said it was the most complex transformation. We repositioned the brand. We changed packaging. We're seeing growth in Rockstar both in the areas, where it's more developed, areas of the country was more developed and new areas obviously, where the distribution system is making a difference. We're seeing especially very good performance in new innovation segments like no sugar and some more Hispanic-focused innovation. So we're hopeful on Rockstar and we're seeing the metrics that we set for ourselves are becoming reality. Then on Mountain Dew Energy, we had this legal situation which we move very quickly. Super agile actually. The teams did a great job turning that in six weeks. And it's in the market. And it's gone back to the platform exactly where it was. So clearly there is a consumer that likes the product. And it's -- we're ready to now invest obviously this year in building that platform under the Mountain Dew Energy branding. And that's a pretty good position even though we had that legal situation. With bank which was the other part of the strategy we -- after that initial hiccup, I think we're -- actually we're doing a pretty good job as a distributor of the brand and the brand is more points of sale than it used to be. And we continue to focus on driving that performance during the length of the contract. And then -- but the other one that we're very pleased is the Starbucks relationship. That is -- that JV relationship is better than ever I would say. And both Double Shot Triple Shot is growing at a very high levels. And I don't know if you're aware we just launched Baja Energy which is a full natural energy brand new brand to the system. It's the first time we launched it both in retail and in Starbucks outlets. Great product good levels of caffeine coming from natural source. We're very optimistic on that platform. It's very incremental, if you see the full portfolio of brands that we have on energy. So Baja will be a positive addition incremental. So I think the machine is firing in a lot of cylinders. It is -- as always it is an area of focus. You need to test and learn and adjust and tweak your execution. I'm pleased with what I'm seeing. The other element that we don't talk so much about Rockstar is that, this year it's going to be in 17 international markets. It was in 10 markets. We expanded in 2021 to -- I think it was 22, 23 markets. Now next year -- this year '22 we'll be in 70 markets. So clearly another part of the growth story of Rockstar as we acquire the business. So we'll keep updating you in our regular calls, but we're positive on how the full energy strategy is working.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen. \nVivien Azer: Hi good morning. Thank you. I wanted to follow up please on Dara's question on price elasticities. Hugh, I appreciated your comment that you guys are looking at multiple scenarios and clearly do have a lot of levers at your disposal. But I was hoping you could dive a little bit more please on Pepsi Beverages North America. And specifically, how you think about cross-category elasticities across your US beverage business? And as a quick follow-up to that to the extent that consumers' ability to absorb pricing were to diminish at all like are there certain categories you'd be watching more closely as a leading indicator of that? Thank you.\nHugh Johnston: Yes. Happy to go there a bit. And as I said elasticities to me are basically a portfolio of risks that we try to manage rather than kind of zeroing in a single number, right? And a portfolio as complex as this it's hard to have that conversation. What I would tell you Vivien that we've seen over the last couple of years is in the North America beverage business, category elasticity\u2019s are relatively low. I think the reason for that is particularly in the multi-bag multi-serve area prices are pretty remarkably low, right? Whether you're looking at two liters or 12 packs and if you compare those prices to elsewhere in the world, the prices in this market are actually quite low. It's a tremendous value for consumers. So as we move into a world of higher inflation, I do expect that the category prices probably will go up. And at least to date we haven't seen much in the way of elasticity. As you might imagine, I can't point to any one. I think we watch elasticity\u2019s on everything, both the value packages and the premium packages. And the good news is our system is agile enough to react to it. But right now the elasticity\u2019s are in line with our expectations. And frankly that's what gives us confidence in the guide for the year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: Great. Thanks. Good morning everyone. Thanks for the question. First, just a clarification on Laurent's line of questioning around energy. Ramon, can you just comment -- you mentioned firing on all cylinders and you're pleased with energy. Would you rule out M&A? So if you could just comment on that that would be helpful. My broader strategic question is really on the business venture with Boston Beer regarding Hard Mountain Dew. Can you just update us on how that partnership has progressed? And importantly as you spend more time studying the alcohol space, can you provide some updated thoughts on broader ambitions to play not only as it pertains to new product innovation, but also the potential to distribute non PepsiCo alcohol products through your distribution? So thanks for that.\nRamon Laguarta: Yeah Kevin. Listen on M&A I think we have sufficient brands right to play in that space. So I -- we're not thinking about any M&A in the energy space at this point. Now with regards to alcohol, great question. And I think it's a very interesting development for the LRB category and for the alcohol category. So clearly consumers are choosing to converge in a way. And so we see that space as a strategically very incremental. It's sizable and it's profitable. So, obviously, we'd like to participate in a consistent and structural way for us. Obviously we will play from the brand point of view on innovation licensing our brands to beer manufacturers that can help us with the manufacturing. We don't have the technologies to make some of these products. But we're creating strong partnerships. You mentioned one. And I think we have brands that can extend into those spaces. So that will be one way how we do it. On the other hand, I think there is a very interesting play for us to leverage some of our distribution assets to provide capital distribution and consistent execution across the country. And we're working on that solution. We have, obviously, some market tests undergoing. And we will continue to roll out those -- that potential distribution opportunity. I think it could be an advantage for us if we do it well and that's where we're planning to do. So we see us participating from the consumer point of view and also from the infrastructure and execution and granularity of execution point of view as well. Those two areas could create value for PepsiCo long-term.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Ottenstein with Evercore. \nRob Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. We focused mostly on the U.S. today. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how you're viewing your global footprint. In the past, for instance, the company has made acquisitions to expand the offerings in Russia and South Africa. Any thoughts along those lines in other geographies? Any things that are going on, on the international side that we should be aware of in terms of strategic direction, or changes of how you're looking at the business? And then just a quick follow-up on the hedging and the commodities, it\u2019d be -- I think it would be helpful if, to the extent you can, kind of, talk about some of the key commodities and what percentage of your cost structure they represent. Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Great. Robert, I'll talk about international a bit and then Hugh can talk about the commodities. And you know we're quite limited on what we'd say about our detailed P&L. The -- on international, I've always said and continue to say that, this is the -- by the largest growth opportunity we have in PepsiCo. I think, where -- we have a strong market positions in snacks and pretty good in beverages in many markets. Some others a bit more challenging positions, but we're working to strengthen those. I think we have the portfolio of brands and we have the portfolio of assets and the teams in place to continue to work on that opportunity. Last year, we grew double-digit internationally, pretty much across the board from Asia to Middle East Africa. Europe was very close to double-digit full year, if I recall. And then Latin America did double-digits. So pretty good performance. And if I look at the top 15 markets for the company, we are gaining share in most of those markets, which is to me the key indicator of progress in the system. Obviously, as we scale up those markets, profitability gets much better. And that's the model we're trying to play. For next year, we see good signs. Obviously, the geopolitics in some parts of the world are complex. We hope that that will not materialize in anything that will impact our system. And we see inflation going up everywhere. We have the brands. And we have, again, the capabilities to price as what we're doing in majority of the market. We feel good about the elasticities as we discussed earlier, both developing market and emerging. I'm a bit more cautious on emerging markets. I want to see a few more months to understand how the consumer is kind of absorbing all these high cost in multiple parts of their budget, household budgets. But we're feeling good about how consumers are staying loyal to our brands in spite of some of our pricing decisions. So, yes, that should cover international. And maybe the -- yes.\nHugh Johnston: Yes. So in terms of commodities just a couple of facts. Number one, the overall commodity basket is about $16 billion $17 billion. It's a super broad basket. There's not a single commodity that even accounts for 10% of the overall spend. So a fairly diverse basket. But that said, clearly, commodities are inflationary pretty well across the board. And that's what we're dealing with so.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo.\nChris Carey: Hey. Good morning. Thanks so much. Just on that last line of questioning there on commodities. Do you expect pricing to offset commodities just in the context of your comments on full year margins? And then, on North America, there was a comment in the prepared remarks just around expectations for PBNA margins to expand next year. I think the margin drivers of this business have obviously evolved with product mix and pricing, and I wonder if you could just comment on how you see the drivers of that business go forward in the context of some evolution of the business? Thanks so much.\nHugh Johnston: Sure. In terms of commodities and the way we approach it from a pricing perspective, obviously, we always try to do what we can in terms of productivity to manage an inflationary environment. But obviously, when inflation is this high, we need to take some pricing. In general, in developed markets, we do price through the commodity increases. In developing and emerging, we have the variable to consider of affordability and consumer reaction to it. And our history has been \u2013 we'll initially price through two-thirds to three-quarters, and then go back and get the rest of it later. That said overall, as I mentioned earlier in the call, I think the combination of our productivity and our pricing should put us in a position where we ought to be able to keep margins pretty well intact for the year. So that's kind of where I think we land on that. In terms of PBNA, we do expect margins to continue to improve as we've talked about in the past. Drivers are generally the same ones that we've talked about. It's a combination of some pricing, some product mix as the energy category is more successful for us, some level of productivity as we get returns on the investments, we've made in capacity and digitalization and the like. And we continue to use global business services as a mechanism to drive G&A productivity as well. So it's a broad bucket of actions that over the course of several years, we'll get PBNA margins closer and closer to the company average.\nRamon Laguarta: Great. I think, this is the last question. So I just would like to say, thank you for everyone that joined us today, and for the confidence you've placed in PepsiCo and in all of us your investment. And we hope that, you guys stay safe and healthy. So thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day. Speakers, please stand by.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Hugh Johnston",
            "content": "Yes. And the only thing I'll add there in terms of some of the financial pieces of it you saw in Q4, we had about five points of volume and about seven points of price/mix. Obviously, we're -- as our hedges roll off and we move into a new round of commodities, we're going to price in a way that allows us at least for the full year to try to keep our margins pretty well intact, which means that that seven pricing will probably be around there. Maybe even a little bit stronger for the year. We'll see how it plays out and react to what happens with the facts in the marketplace. But it's going to be a pretty healthy pricing year to accommodate the cost increases. Yes. So, I mean for 2022 Dara you're right. Obviously there wasn't a lot in Q4, but that's a relatively short period of time. Right now we've built multiple scenarios around elasticity and where we have plans to react to any of them. So, frankly, we'll -- we're going to have to be very agile this year in the way that we plan. But you know that our history on guidance is we tend to have multiple ways to get there and we'll react to what the marketplace gives us. Yes. Hi Bonnie, it's Hugh. A couple of things on that. One A&M for the year was up 11%. For the quarter, it was up 15%. But remember when you're dealing with the quarter, that's not necessarily what's in the marketplace. That's sort of the A&M curve and we book A&M on the revenue curve. In terms of spend \u2013 the spend was up in the quarter for sure. I don't know that, it was disproportionately up relative to the rest of the year. And in terms of go-forward, I expect our A&M as it generally has will probably be in or around the same level of growth as the sales growth number is. Obviously, we feel terrific about the advertising we're doing. We think it's having the right impact. But we clearly were the beneficiaries of in North America some reduction. And we think that's also played well. We generally are spending at a competitive level and we're trying to compete on quality of the A&M not necessarily the quantity of the A&M. Yes. Andrea, how are you? I'll expand on the -- your question on the other side. Our assumptions on the guidance are based on the pricing that we have in the marketplace right now. And that pricing is based on the visibility that we have into, both the productivity and the cost structure and commodities, which we have pretty good visibility into on the commodities about, eight, nine months of the year, as you would expect based on some of the things I've communicated in the past. Q4 is a bit -- still a bit open, but there are obviously pricing windows as we get into the fourth quarter as well. So as those facts become more known, we'll make decisions on that front. Regarding your question on margins, obviously, we don't give guidance on margins. But I think given the combination of what we know about costs and what we know about pricing, we ought to be able to get through the year pretty well intact on margins, acknowledging the fact that earlier in the year the cost pressure is a little bit higher than it is later in the year. Both actually. Yes. I mean we \u2013 obviously, we made the decision not just based on what we see this year but what we see over the next couple of years.

So the combination of those two factors led us to the decision. As I mentioned last year, CapEx will be elevated for another year or two. But frankly I think that's well within the sort of overall envelope that we're working on and we got comfortable with going back to share repurchase.

            "name": "Ramon Laguarta",
            "content": "Good morning Dara. Yeah. Dara let me start and maybe Hugh can add. We see our categories very healthy moving into 2022 and long-term, both our convenient foods and beverages. So that makes us feel very comfortable. The investments that we have made over the last three years in brands, in more capable go-to-market systems, in more insights, better execution that's clearly paying off in the form of share of market gains in across multiple developing markets snacks and beverages. So we feel good about our ability to continue to grow ahead of our categories in 2022 and beyond. And, obviously, we are big players in those categories. So, we carry the responsibility to make this category stay healthy and stay growing faster than food overall. So, that's how we see our long-term. And yes we -- obviously, if you think about next year, yes, we're at the top end of our long-term guidance. This year, obviously, we -- I mean last year we obviously crossed that long-term guidance. So, you see compounded, yes, we're at the high end of our 4% to 6%. And obviously we -- that's the objective of the whole organization to stay within the - that guidance and beat in good years. I think Dara if you think about all the investments we've made in the last few years both in the brand's strength or some of our net revenue capabilities, even our execution capabilities the granularity that we can execute in the stores, that's clearly giving us a lot of I would say tools to play the marketplace and to manage the price increases in better ways than we used to do it in the past. So, we're also contemplating that as a factor as we're building our 2022 scenarios. Yeah. Bonnie one of the things we're \u2013 I think we're getting better at is measuring our return on investment on our marketing. And we're \u2013 the more data we have and obviously we're becoming a better data company, we're able to put better numbers to those investments and have the marketing teams, and the commercial teams overall choosing different levers that give us the best return overall. And that's playing very well. It's obviously, one of the reasons why we're gaining market share across many categories. It's strategically \u2013 we want to continue with this kind of investments being very rational in the way we invest in A&M, but understanding that a company like ours the core competence is building brands. And that's what give us in situations like we're having this year where we have to price, we have consumers following us in spite of higher prices. So I think strategically, it's a very important element in our overall growth strategy. Yes. Lauren, the \u2013 I would say, if you take a bigger picture I think there is a elevated in-home consumption that has stayed like that. I think Home-as-a-hub is a clear trend, and we're seeing \u2013 we're capturing pretty good that consumption at home. And obviously, during the quarter, there's been more mobility across the multiple markets in the US obviously, but globally, I would say. And then some of the Away from Home business has accelerated as well. So what you see there is a combination of all these channels, I think playing at a very high level. Then, if you go into our own business, I would say, it's a combination of branding, better execution. And the truth is that in Q4 we've seen an improvement sequentially of our supply chain. And some of our large brands, and I would name Gatorade for example, clearly has improved substantially in its running rates and fill rates in the last part of the quarter. So that's reflected as well in a better overall performance for the business. But we're very pleased in general with the way the North America business is performing in beverages and snacks as well. And both the margin expansion, the top line, the fact that it grew with the market a bit faster than the market in a very challenging year with a lot of supply chain complexities and bottlenecks for several reasons. So we're very pleased. We're feeling comfortable as well for 2022. It's very strong commercial programs, very strong brand programs. And as you were saying, probably a better execution machine for many reasons, data and intelligence, but also more empowered organization that makes more local decisions and that's obviously reflected in the performance of the business. Yes, Andrea. Let me talk to you about the Gatorade and then Hugh can talk more about the pricing. We're very optimistic with this sports drink category. But we think of it broadly than just hydration, we think about overall nutrition. And the way Gatorade play in that space along with some other brands like Propel, Muscle Milk, Evolve and some other assets that we have in that space, it is growing very fast. We see continued consumer adoption of this category. Consumers are exercising more. And we think that's a very positive trend for the segment. When it comes to Gatorade, the brand equity is stronger than ever. And the innovation that we've done this year and you will see more next year be it Zero, be it Gatorade, be it some of the more science related with the sweat patch and how we can be much more customized for the consumer based on their hydration profile. So there's a lot of positive value that I think we can create in higher parts of the category with Gatorade and some of the other brands. So we feel good about the demand momentum. On the supply, obviously, we have reacted to the situation. And we've expanded capacity both ourselves and some of our co-packers. And we're ready for what we think will be another year of successful growth for Gatorade and continue to build the brand in spaces that will be hard to match by a competitor. So that's how we are approaching Gatorade and the full category next year. Thank you, Laurent. Good to talk to you. Listen, we're executing the playbook as we told you we've been quite consistent on the last few calls. And we're quite pleased with what we're seeing. Obviously, Rockstar, we always said it was the most complex transformation. We repositioned the brand. We changed packaging. We're seeing growth in Rockstar both in the areas, where it's more developed, areas of the country was more developed and new areas obviously, where the distribution system is making a difference. We're seeing especially very good performance in new innovation segments like no sugar and some more Hispanic-focused innovation. So we're hopeful on Rockstar and we're seeing the metrics that we set for ourselves are becoming reality. Then on Mountain Dew Energy, we had this legal situation which we move very quickly. Super agile actually. The teams did a great job turning that in six weeks. And it's in the market. And it's gone back to the platform exactly where it was. So clearly there is a consumer that likes the product. And it's -- we're ready to now invest obviously this year in building that platform under the Mountain Dew Energy branding. And that's a pretty good position even though we had that legal situation. With bank which was the other part of the strategy we -- after that initial hiccup, I think we're -- actually we're doing a pretty good job as a distributor of the brand and the brand is more points of sale than it used to be. And we continue to focus on driving that performance during the length of the contract. And then -- but the other one that we're very pleased is the Starbucks relationship. That is -- that JV relationship is better than ever I would say. And both Double Shot Triple Shot is growing at a very high levels. And I don't know if you're aware we just launched Baja Energy which is a full natural energy brand new brand to the system. It's the first time we launched it both in retail and in Starbucks outlets. Great product good levels of caffeine coming from natural source. We're very optimistic on that platform. It's very incremental, if you see the full portfolio of brands that we have on energy. So Baja will be a positive addition incremental. So I think the machine is firing in a lot of cylinders. It is -- as always it is an area of focus. You need to test and learn and adjust and tweak your execution. I'm pleased with what I'm seeing. The other element that we don't talk so much about Rockstar is that, this year it's going to be in 17 international markets. It was in 10 markets. We expanded in 2021 to -- I think it was 22, 23 markets. Now next year -- this year '22 we'll be in 70 markets. So clearly another part of the growth story of Rockstar as we acquire the business. So we'll keep updating you in our regular calls, but we're positive on how the full energy strategy is working. Yeah Kevin. Listen on M&A I think we have sufficient brands right to play in that space. So I -- we're not thinking about any M&A in the energy space at this point. Now with regards to alcohol, great question. And I think it's a very interesting development for the LRB category and for the alcohol category. So clearly consumers are choosing to converge in a way. And so we see that space as a strategically very incremental. It's sizable and it's profitable. So, obviously, we'd like to participate in a consistent and structural way for us. Obviously we will play from the brand point of view on innovation licensing our brands to beer manufacturers that can help us with the manufacturing. We don't have the technologies to make some of these products. But we're creating strong partnerships. You mentioned one. And I think we have brands that can extend into those spaces. So that will be one way how we do it. On the other hand, I think there is a very interesting play for us to leverage some of our distribution assets to provide capital distribution and consistent execution across the country. And we're working on that solution. We have, obviously, some market tests undergoing. And we will continue to roll out those -- that potential distribution opportunity. I think it could be an advantage for us if we do it well and that's where we're planning to do. So we see us participating from the consumer point of view and also from the infrastructure and execution and granularity of execution point of view as well. Those two areas could create value for PepsiCo long-term. Great. Robert, I'll talk about international a bit and then Hugh can talk about the commodities. And you know we're quite limited on what we'd say about our detailed P&L. The -- on international, I've always said and continue to say that, this is the -- by the largest growth opportunity we have in PepsiCo. I think, where -- we have a strong market positions in snacks and pretty good in beverages in many markets. Some others a bit more challenging positions, but we're working to strengthen those. I think we have the portfolio of brands and we have the portfolio of assets and the teams in place to continue to work on that opportunity. Last year, we grew double-digit internationally, pretty much across the board from Asia to Middle East Africa. Europe was very close to double-digit full year, if I recall. And then Latin America did double-digits. So pretty good performance. And if I look at the top 15 markets for the company, we are gaining share in most of those markets, which is to me the key indicator of progress in the system. Obviously, as we scale up those markets, profitability gets much better. And that's the model we're trying to play. For next year, we see good signs. Obviously, the geopolitics in some parts of the world are complex. We hope that that will not materialize in anything that will impact our system. And we see inflation going up everywhere. We have the brands. And we have, again, the capabilities to price as what we're doing in majority of the market. We feel good about the elasticities as we discussed earlier, both developing market and emerging. I'm a bit more cautious on emerging markets. I want to see a few more months to understand how the consumer is kind of absorbing all these high cost in multiple parts of their budget, household budgets. But we're feeling good about how consumers are staying loyal to our brands in spite of some of our pricing decisions. So, yes, that should cover international. And maybe the -- yes. Great. I think, this is the last question. So I just would like to say, thank you for everyone that joined us today, and for the confidence you've placed in PepsiCo and in all of us your investment. And we hope that, you guys stay safe and healthy. So thank you very much."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning and welcome to PepsiCo's 2021 Third Quarter earnings question and answer session. Your lines have been placed on listen-only until it is your turn to ask a question. [Operator Instructions]. Today's call is being recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Ravi Pamnani, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Pamnani, you may begin.\nRavi Pamnani: Thank you, Operator. I hope everyone has had a chance this morning to review our press release and prepared remarks, both of which are available on our website. Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. We may make forward-looking statements on today's call, including about our business plans and updated 2021 guidance, and the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties and only reflect our view as of today, October 5, 2021, and we are under no obligation to update. When discussing our results, we refer to non-GAAP measures which exclude certain items from reported results. Please refer to our Q3 2021 earnings release and Q3 2021 Form 10-Q available on pepsico.com for definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures and additional information regarding our results, including a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from forward-looking statements. Joining me today are PepsiCo's Chairman and CEO, Ramon Laguarta, and PepsiCo's Vice Chairman and CFO, Hugh Johnston. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question. And with that, I will turn it over to the Operator for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey. Good morning, guys.\nRamon Laguarta: Good Morning there.\nDara Mohsenian: Obviously very strong topline results again here in Q3, and for the full year you now expect 8% organic sales growth, may be the best results we've seen in recent history. Can you just discuss some of the key drivers behind the recent acceleration in top-line growth, how sustainable they are as you look out longer term? And then also just near-term, are you confident you can sustain the mid-single digit organic sales growth in line with the long-term algorithm, particularly as maybe you catch up on supply or as we look specifically at 2022, could there be some risk as you cycle these difficult comparisons from 2021? How you guys think about that conceptually would be helpful.\nRamon Laguarta: Hi, Dara. Good morning. Yeah, listen, I think we're very pleased with the performance of the business overall. Categories are healthy, both our beverage and food categories. Snacks categories are growing faster than food and beverage overall in the U.S. but globally. I think we're playing in categories that are doing very well, I would say, during the pandemic and now as we are exiting the pandemic in many markets around the world. So that's one thing. The other component of our success is I think we're becoming much more competitive across both our categories in most of the markets where we operate. And that's been a consequence of the investments we've been making in the brands, I think pretty good innovation. Obviously, investments we've made in go-to-market capacity, new capabilities, talent, everything else we've been talking to you for the last couple of years. So, we\u2019re seeing the momentum across the business and we're seeing that momentum continuing into the balance of the year. That's why we are kind of elevating our guidance for top-line and we think that that momentum will continue well into the year 2022. I think Hugh, if you can --\nHugh Johnston: Yeah, I'm happy to jump in as well.\nDara Mohsenian: [Indiscernible] some parts of the question.\nHugh Johnston: Yeah. Dara, specifically on '22. And I know obviously there's always going to be lots of questions on that. And historically, you've been with us for a long time, you know we typically don't talk about the following year until we get to February. But given the level of question and given the level of volatility, I think we thought it was prudent at least to give some indication of where we are on '22. In short, we expect our organic revenue growth and our core constant currency EPS growth to be in line with our long-term objectives in 2022. Now, I know that's going to create a lot of additional questions, and candidly we're not ready to get into all of the details of that because, frankly, we're still early in our planning process. But I think we can say with confidence that we expect both revenue and core EP -- core constant currency EPS to be in line with the long-term objectives for '22. Hopefully, that gives everyone some level of comfort that as we emerge from Q4, we emerge with a lot of momentum in the top-line as well as a business that has got its supply chain well-managed and on good footing to deliver another good year next year.\nDara Mohsenian: Thanks very helpful.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs.\nBonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nHugh Johnston: Hi, Bonnie.\nBonnie Herzog: I guess I have a bit of a follow-on question as it relates to top-line and maybe specifically on innovation where we're hearing from some of our industry contacts that your innovation pipeline for next year, from what we've seen and what we've heard, it looks very robust. Just love to hear some color from you in terms of if you are, in fact, stepping up your innovation significantly versus prior years. And if so, do you think you're going to need to also step up your A&M spend to really support that pipeline and ensure that these innovations really get the support they need in the bottom market? Thanks.\nRamon Laguarta: Thank you, Bonnie. Well, it's good that you're hearing from our customers that innovation is good. It's always a good feedback. Listen now, more seriously, I think we've always seen innovation as a key driver of our competitive advantage in the marketplace. And we've been investing a lot in R&D, we're investing a lot in insights, and we're connecting better at the insights with R&D and the whole commercial execution to get the maximum return on those innovations. So, I think the machine is ready and it keeps getting better year after year. So yes, our pipeline is strong. I would say our pipeline in 2021 was very strong as well, and we're seeing the return from that innovation across the world. We're trying to be much more local, much more mid-term and long-term, much more incremental in the way we think about our innovation. When it comes to the investment behind the innovation, I think we have the right level of A&M, Bonnie, in our business to support innovation in a big way. And it's not only A&M, but as you know, we have a very strong push system that allows us to give innovation a lot of visibility and separate it from the rest of the category and make sure that the trial levels are higher and the repeat levels are good. I would say, yes, there will be a strong innovation across beverages and snacks. We think it's going to be quite incremental, and I would think we have the right level of resources to support that innovation within our current algorithm, so I would not expect a higher A&M next year.\nBonnie Herzog: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you, and good morning to all. I just wanted to go back to the balance of cost supply chain and labor. In the prepared remarks, Hugh did talk about those. Obviously, it's no surprise to anyone. But it was a 14 percentage point impact on EBIT. And I understand that your cost inflation had been running around mid-single-digits. And as such, I think like the EPS and you're having the pricing coming through also in the fourth quarter strongly. So should we read the EPS floor of a $1.47 a reflection of increased A&M you said, and not necessarily for 2022, but perhaps you are not going to flow all of the upside that we saw so far in the year into the EPS for the year just because of these investments, is it just that you're up for a strong 2022. Is that the way we should read?\nHugh Johnston: Yeah, Andrea, good question. I think I would think about it this way; obviously, we've given you some pretty specific guidance in terms of where we would expect EPS to land for Q4. You know that we fore advise by 6 months to 9, months, those hedges that we had in the beginning of the year are starting to roll off, the new ones that are in place are higher costs. We had shared on the last call, as well as in the prepared remarks today that we expect to be able to price through the inflation that we're facing whether it be commodities inflation or other types of operating expense inflation. Some of that pricing occurred in the summer, much more of it is occurring in the fall in the beverage business and substantially all of it for 2021 in the snack food business is occurring really as we speak during these weeks right now. You also know that we forwarded by that 6 months to 9 months out, so we will have a better handle on where exactly 2022 costs are going to land as we get into the first quarter of 2022. And I would expect this to price a bit more to be reflective of some of that sort finalization of costs during the course of 2022. So Q4, some of the pricing coming through, the balance of it coming in Q1 of 2022, and the EPS guidance is reflective of all of that.\nAndrea Teixeira: Great. Thank you. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Just to follow up on that. I mean, Hugh, your comments on you forward by 6 months to 9 months, and so you have more visibility to get into the first quarter onto the cost base. That suggests a lot of pricing, and so I was hoping you could just comment on elasticity. Whether what you're seeing in terms of your models, if you're seeing less elasticity than traditionally because the innovation has been so strong, if it's tough to really get a read because of all of the COVID comparisons that are flowing through consumer behavior right now. But curious on the elasticity piece because it does imply a lot of pricing. Thanks.\nRamon Laguarta: Yeah. Lauren, I'll take a first go at this and then maybe Hugh can add some more comments. What we're seeing across the world is much lower elasticity on the pricing that we've seen historically, and that applies to developing markets, Western Europe, and the U.S. Across the world consumer seems to be looking at pricing a little bit differently than before. It could be several hypotheses. I think in our case, our brands are stronger and I think our innovation is stronger as you were saying, so that could be a factor. There could be also some behaviors as consumers are shopping faster in-store and they might be paying less attention to pricing as a decision factor, and they might be giving more relevance to the brands or brands that they feel more -- a bit closer to a more closer -- yeah, I would say closer more and more emotionally attached to us as our brand. We're seeing less elasticity and we're adjusting our models as we go. And that's obviously informing our decisions as we price the balance of the year and into 2022.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane: Hey, good morning everyone. My question is around AMESA and APAC. And if we look at the year-to-date profit contribution from those two segments, it's contributing about a quarter of the operating profit, just incremental dollars. If you look at it on a currency-neutral basis, you've got a pretty healthy gap on currency neutral operating profit growth versus what the currency-neutral organic sales growth is. So, I guess my question is just, are we at a point in those two segments where there's enough scale where you could really start to see a sustained margin improvement and profit contribution to the total going forward or is there something just unusual in the near-term that's just driving those margins?\nRamon Laguarta: I think, Bryan, your two hypotheses are valid. I think there is a lapping effect especially AMESA last year suffered a lot given its geography, so India, Pakistan, Middle East, and Africa clearly were challenged last year. They are coming back, is a very beverage-focused business so clearly it was more impacted by the COVID mobility restrictions, so we're seeing those businesses coming back, and we have high scale and we have high share in many of those markets, and our advertising and marketing is doing very well. So part of that is lapping. Your second question on scale, yes, scale is getting -- obviously, every year, you see the growth level on the top-line. We're getting to scale levels that are pretty good in many of the critical markets in that region, and that's giving us obviously the opportunity to do better in the marketplace and the flow-through is also stronger. I think the two are relevant. If you think about the business going forward, those are very strategic markets for us going forward. And we continue to invest in everything from technologies so we can expand the portfolio, talent. Obviously, there is a war for talent in that part of the world. I think we're a scale Company that does a good job with developing talent in that part of the world. And then obviously our go-to-market being very strong, we have very good bottlers. And wherever we have our own operations, especially in the food business, we're also investing in digitalization and everything that goes with being more precise and more agile. Hopefully, I'm answering both the short-term, but also more especially for me, the long-term of how we see that part of the world, yeah.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim.\nLaurent Grandet: Hey, good morning everyone, and congrats on this strong quarter and that very good client environment.\nHugh Johnston: Thank you, Laurent.\nLaurent Grandet: Talking about innovation, it's great to see you leading the Company, pushing the usual boundaries. So during the quarter you announced a partnership with the Boston Beer Company to introduce Hard Mtn Dew in the U.S.. The question is not so much about the potential of that initiative, but more on the route-to-market you decided to choose. So we'd like to understand why you decided to create your own distribution rather than rely on the Boston Beer wholesaler network. What is the end game here and by extension, your strategy in alcohol here in the U.S. and internationally? Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Thank you Laurent. Well, listen, we have a good partnership with The Boston Beer Company and they have the R&D, and the knowledge in this space that we don't. We have the brand, so Mountain Dew, I think it will play very well in that space. It will be quite differentiated in terms of the flavor profile and the emotional connection. That's how we're thinking about it in terms of the first step into this market. From the distribution point of view, we think we have an opportunity to create a distribution system in the U.S. that is quite unique in the sense that would be an integrated distribution system that can make coordinated decisions across multiple states from one decision point. And that could be, I think, competitively advantaged. We're starting with a number of states where we have the license to operate, and we will take it from there. We feel optimistic, we think it will be very incremental. It would help us with the drop size. It will help us with the economics of their routes eventually. And we think the same as we're doing with a chill distribution system, that goes very popular and it's unique and it covers the whole country. We think we could eventually vision distribution system that can be quite [Indiscernible] and quite integrated on the low alcohol part of our portfolio as well.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Vivien Azer, from Cowen.\nVivien Azer: Hi. Yeah. I was just hoping actually to follow up on the hard seltzer questions, please. Just curious your impressions of the overall category, it's obviously been incredibly contentious, the decelerating trends, and whether you at all discussed perhaps introducing Mountain Dew as a canned cocktail as opposed to a hard seltzer because it does seem the best where the consumer is moving Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Yeah. Listen, our view on the category is it's very sizable, I think it's almost $9 billion retail value now, and growing 20%, and with high -- good margins above the average of the categories. Clearly a space where we should be playing, and that's how we're thinking about this. We see consumer trends that favor that this category will continue to grow in its current form or with new innovation. That's why we decided to participate our first entries with Mountain Dew, and Mountain Dew is going to be a flavor malt beverage, not a hard seltzer. I think it will be a differentiated flavor and with a very unique brand. So I think we can carve out our own space in that what is in relatively crowded market. And we'll take it from there. Obviously, we have a pipeline of ideas that we will be disclosing as we go.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: Hey. Good morning, everyone and congratulations on the strong result. Ramon, I want to ask you about the decision to sell the juice businesses and the sort of overall satisfaction with the portfolio. So the Trop business, of course, has been with the Company for, if I'm not mistaken, over two decades. You go back over the years, the Quaker business has had a nice balance, I think there has been some discussion in the marketplace about a potential divestiture there from time to time. Maybe you could just sort of walk us through the decision to sell the juice business, what went into it. Can you maybe comment on preliminary thoughts on uses of the proceeds when the deal closes? And then, Ramon, just broadly overall satisfaction in potential other areas of divestiture. Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Kevin, good morning. Listen, I think we've been looking obviously at our portfolio since I started with Hugh on the team and we've added some assets to the Company in high-growth spaces, long-term. We've added assets in Africa, we've added assets in China, we've added assets here in the U.S. that allow us to grow into new spaces, value-added dairy, or energy, or healthier snacks. We've made some decisions over the last 3 years to add assets that will give us accelerated growth. At the same time, we've been looking at other parts of the portfolio where probably the long-term growth and the long-term margin creation is less exciting. And in that context is where we see the juice business is a good business, but it's probably not a business that we think we can grow at the speed and with the margins that we want to grow PepsiCo overall. And that's why we decided to make this decision. We found a great partner in PAI, they have very good experience with previous similar partnerships with other large food companies. We believe we have a way for this JV that we're creating to continue to create synergies on the operational side for the juice business, continue to innovate and make sure that our brands, because we want to be 40% of that JV, continue to thrive and compete in a better way that they would probably do in our portfolio where we have a lot of choices where to invest on, where to focus. That's the -- that's Kevin, the logic behind this. That -- now Hugh can tell you about the -- more of the financial part, which is also very attractive, I would say.\nHugh Johnston: Yeah, Kevin, no change to what we have previously communicated on use of proceeds. Number one, we'll use it to reduce that. Obviously, we're losing some EBITDA, so we'll adjust our debt levels to reflect that. Number two, is we have been -- we'll use the funds to invest in organic CapEx back into the business. Obviously, it begs the question, and I can see where people might go to, what does it mean for share repurchase in 2022? And the answer is we'll talk about share repurchase in February on all of that. That's a broader question on guidance, but I know that question is out there, so wanted to at least say we'll deal with that when we get to '22.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Wendy Nicholson with Citi.\nWendy Nicholson: Hi. And my question is a follow-up, but not specifically on share repurchases. But this year, sensibly, you said you wouldn't be buying back as much stock because you wanted to invest in some of the acquired businesses, and I have two questions on that. Number one, we haven't, as of the 9 months, seen Capex actually tick up meaningfully, so I'm wondering what sort of investments you are making. Is it still Capex to come in some of those acquired businesses? But also, you cited those acquired businesses as being a primary reason for your gross margin erosion in the quarter, and I'm wondering how long that will persist. Are those businesses just structurally lower gross margin? Do you think that's going to be something in perpetuity? Or are there things you can do either pricing or restructuring-wise to get the gross margins in those acquired businesses up?\nHugh Johnston: Yeah. Wendy, I'll address both of those questions. Regarding the investments, I think the indication was that we're going to invest broadly back in the business, not just specifically into those acquired businesses as relates to Capex. Clearly, they have near a part of that mix so you're absolutely right, but it was a broader comment around Capex. And Capex is at a higher sustained level than it was perhaps a few years ago as we're driving a faster rate of growth in the Company and in making or supply chain more resilient as well. So I think from that standpoint the numbers are pretty consistent with the strategic intent that we had articulated a bit earlier. Regarding the balance of -- what was it, again?\nRamon Laguarta: International M&A.\nHugh Johnston: Oh, yeah, in terms of the international M&A piece, we're through the overlap period, the biggest driver on that obviously was Pioneer to some degree, the [Indiscernible] as well as, it's the lower gross margin business. We really are through that as of the end of the second quarter, so that's not an impact in mixing our margins down any further, but we're past that as of the Q3 results.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.\nNik Modi: Yeah, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Ramon, I was hoping you can comment on just general strength in packaged beverage. I mean, I think all of us have been pretty surprised by the strength, especially with all the pricing in the marketplace. I was wondering, just from a consumer insight standpoint, what do you think is driving that despite the mobility improvements we're seeing?\nRamon Laguarta: Yeah, Nik, listen clearly the category isn't very healthy across the world. Obviously, the U.S., Western Europe, and also developing markets. We're seeing, obviously, the away - from -home business picking up. We think in Q3 our away from home business is a 90% index to '19. It keeps going up with every month that goes by. Clearly that's a very positive sign. Now, our convenience store business continues to do very well as consumers are having higher mobility. But the remarkable thing is that they in-home consumption continues to be quite high. Consumers are not -- are still using the home as a hub and continue to entertain at home, and continue to do more things at home. And that's driving additional consumption at home versus the previous '19 level. I think, we're in a very good place where consumption at home is higher, consumption on-the-go is increasing and most of the channels in our food service business are picking up. Pretty good momentum. We expect those strengths to continue for a while, and we think that consumers have changed some of their habits from what we're reading in our insights. And we think that the beverage category is in a very positive situation for the upcoming future. We see the same with snacks, by the way. The snack business which is obviously a big part of our growth and sales and profit s, we see that category very consistent across the world. And it was during the pandemic, it is now growing in a very fast pace as consumers are gaining mobility as well. So I think, as I said at the beginning, our 2 categories where we operate are growing significantly higher than the food and beverage categories overall. And that is an advantage that we have as a Company as we play into categories that are from the consumer point of view are very preferred.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore.\nRobert Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much and apologies if somebody asked this, my phone dropped for a few minutes. But -- so I'm wondering if you can give us any kind of update in terms of your shelf space in North America on beverages. There was obviously -- resets were delayed in 2020, we've had some this year and particularly on the C-store side where I think you were really focused on improving your position there with the energy drink offerings. Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Great. Yes. Listen, I won't go into a lot of specifics, it's widely available information, but I would say that we're gaining space both inconvenience as you were saying, it was a focus and we invested to gain additional space, not only for our energy business, but for making sure that our innovation was incremental in space, as that's what really makes a difference in the overall output of the Company. We have -- if you think about the other variable which is secondary displays or overall inventory on the floor. Because we've had some supply chain constraints in some of our products, we've pulled back on some of the inventory on the perimeter during the summer voluntarily, I would say, just to make sure that we were able to service the customers on the right level, that's something temporary that, obviously, we will push back as we improve our reliability of the supply chain. But clearly, it's a positive I would say, of our mix, of our top-line growth, the additional space that we're driving for both our beverages or snacks across all the channels. That's where we see the value of our push model or DSDs really helping us to execute with precision and not just muscle, but we're putting more and more intelligence in where we drive this space. How do we execute that space and all the positive feedback loop that we're creating with our people on the ground, our associates on the ground, to make that a differentiation for our Company.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: Hey, thanks. Going back to the top-line, Ramon, as you look across the strength across your emerging market businesses, I wonder if there's anything you could speak to in terms of where that strength is coming from a channel perspective. Whether it's balanced, to whether you're seeing outside strength, perhaps some places where you may have not expected it when the year began. And I guess if that answer varies at all by key market, those insights would be helpful as well. Thanks.\nRamon Laguarta: Yeah. Steve, a couple of things, I would say, specifically to developing markets. We're seeing a higher mobility than we were expecting earlier in the year, so we've seen maybe we were a bit conservative as we were planning the year in terms of how COVID would impact some of the developing markets. Clearly, the consumers have found ways to increase their mobility and going back to their routines of work or of school or whatever, so that's helped us. The other thing we've seen positive, as I mentioned earlier, is that the elasticity to pricing has been better than we had initially in our models as well. We're seeing consumers staying with our brands better. I think that's a consequence of investments we've been putting in our brands. And the way we're executing our pricing decisions are much more informed by data and granularity and we're able to execute different strategies by channel, by brand in a very nuanced way. I think those two elements are reducing the elasticity impact on our business and making our international business I think more competitive and thriving in the majority of the market. Those two would be the element, Steve, if I had to single out what's been differential versus our original estimations.\nHugh Johnston: And Steve, just to add to Ramon 's answer with a few numbers. Overall, D&E markets were up 19%, so we saw a good strong growth across D&E. And then some of the biggest markets for us, Brazil, Russia, India, China, and Mexico were all up either in the teens or 20%. Very broad-based growth across all of the big key D&E markets for us.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Kumar Katari with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nKumar: Hey, everybody. Good morning. Can we -- would you guys mind giving us an update on SodaStream? You've obviously owned it for a good period of time. You're mentioning it a bit more now. It feels this pandemic could have been a moment that really and very structurally changed what the future of this business might look like. So maybe just starting with how big is it now, what's household penetration looking like, and perhaps some of your plans there? I think that'd be useful. Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. [Indiscernible] let me -- let me take we can go into specifics of[Indiscernible], but clearly the business, as we continue to invest in that business, it's very successful and it is a key strategic driver for our future growth as a Company. In terms of the performance, I would say we keep gaining penetration in what are the core markets, core markets being Central Europe, and Northern Europe, Canada and the U.S. some parts of the U.S. Household penetration is increasing, retention of those households is improving. There's a few things we're doing structurally with that business that I think will even accelerate its growth. One is we're building a direct-to-consumer business with SodaStream that is very relevant as it gives us a lot of first-party data and it allows us to have a lot of individual connection with consumers, understand their behaviors. And with that, we can ideate new products and we can also increase, let's say, the lifetime value of those consumers. So that's one big driver. The other thing we're doing, especially in Europe, we're putting our brands in the SodaStream model. So we're giving consumers the opportunity not only to drink sparkling water, but to drink sparkling water with the best-preferred flavors and the best brands or their favorite brands. The Bubly, be it Pepsi, be it Mountain Dew, 7Up, whatever in our international market. That's a big driver of how we think we can increase the lifetime value of those households and generate additional value. If you think about the -- our positive commitments and how we think we can change the footprint -- environmental footprint of our categories, Sodastream is a big driver of that future consumption model.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Sean King with UBS.\nSean King: Great, thanks for the question. It's a question about energy drinks. I guess you mentioned in the 10-Q seeing double-digit volume growth. It's not necessarily what we're seeing in the Nielsen data. Is that how you're defining the category or just channels that we're not capturing in the track channel data?\nHugh Johnston: Yeah. Sean, I think it's the latter. It's more channels that were -- you're not capturing in the Nielsen data. Obviously, energy is big in the unmeasured CNG channel. And given the DSG strength that we have, we're probably over-indexing those channels. So you're just not seeing the data relative to what we have.\nSean King: All right. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And our final question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo.\nChris Carey: Hi, thanks so much. Just a bit of a higher-level question that relates to a prior answer. Just -- can you just maybe discuss how Pep Positive is going to shape this portfolio over the longer term. I mean, clearly Tropicana had financial aspects as you noted, but there is other concepts such as health and wellness that are clearly relevant. It's clearly a desire to scale businesses with no single-use packaging, but obviously that's counter to much of your business today. I imagine this pushes innovation streams even more into health and wellness. I guess the question is just how Pep Positive is going to shape this portfolio over the longer-term beyond just what are obvious financial considerations of some of your recent transactions. Thanks so much.\nRamon Laguarta: Yeah, and maybe there's[Indiscernible] dealers to that positive one of them is precisely on the portfolio of positive choices, and I think you could vision -- visualize this as multiple vectors. One is, yes, we want to make sure that our products, current products are much better. Imagine Lay's -- let's say let's take Lay's, for example. You should imagine Lay's continuing to have the same great taste but having the lowest sodium levels in the market and being cooked with the best cooking oils. That is our commitment. We want to continue to give you the best tasting products in better, let's say, nutritional forms. Now, you should also imagine new consumption models. We're saying Gatorade in powder or in tablets, that's clearly better for the planet and probably easier for consumers as well. You should think about Sodastream as a consumption model or you should think about Sodastream professional in the offices, so we move consumption to -- with refillable, reusable models. And then you should also think about innovation in a way that we bring to the consumer products that are better for the consumer and better for the planet. For example, more legumes. We're adding legumes in our snacks portfolio. Legumes can be used as cover crops that clearly impact better agriculture, but at the same time are more nutritional to consumer chickpeas and others. You should think about innovations like -- we are working on with our Beyond Meat partnership, where we're going to have protein solutions that are not from animals and therefore it will be better for consumers and better for the planet. Multiple levers of how we're planning to evolve the portfolio with a lot of emphasis on making our current portfolio, which is beautiful more nutritious, innovating in new consumption models and also innovating in new platforms that will be better for consumers and better for the planet. That's how you should visualize the evolution of the portfolio in the coming years. Thank you to everybody for your good questions and your engagement, and for your confidence that you've placed in us with your investments. And we wish you all to stay safe and healthy and look forward to our next interactions. Thank you.\nOperator: This does confirm -- this does conclude today's PepsiCo Quarter 3, 2021 Earnings Conference Call. You may disconnect at anytime and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Hugh Johnston",
            "content": "Yeah, I'm happy to jump in as well. Yeah. Dara, specifically on '22. And I know obviously there's always going to be lots of questions on that. And historically, you've been with us for a long time, you know we typically don't talk about the following year until we get to February. But given the level of question and given the level of volatility, I think we thought it was prudent at least to give some indication of where we are on '22. In short, we expect our organic revenue growth and our core constant currency EPS growth to be in line with our long-term objectives in 2022. Now, I know that's going to create a lot of additional questions, and candidly we're not ready to get into all of the details of that because, frankly, we're still early in our planning process. But I think we can say with confidence that we expect both revenue and core EP -- core constant currency EPS to be in line with the long-term objectives for '22. Hopefully, that gives everyone some level of comfort that as we emerge from Q4, we emerge with a lot of momentum in the top-line as well as a business that has got its supply chain well-managed and on good footing to deliver another good year next year. Hi, Bonnie. Yeah, Andrea, good question. I think I would think about it this way; obviously, we've given you some pretty specific guidance in terms of where we would expect EPS to land for Q4. You know that we fore advise by 6 months to 9, months, those hedges that we had in the beginning of the year are starting to roll off, the new ones that are in place are higher costs. We had shared on the last call, as well as in the prepared remarks today that we expect to be able to price through the inflation that we're facing whether it be commodities inflation or other types of operating expense inflation. Some of that pricing occurred in the summer, much more of it is occurring in the fall in the beverage business and substantially all of it for 2021 in the snack food business is occurring really as we speak during these weeks right now. You also know that we forwarded by that 6 months to 9 months out, so we will have a better handle on where exactly 2022 costs are going to land as we get into the first quarter of 2022. And I would expect this to price a bit more to be reflective of some of that sort finalization of costs during the course of 2022. So Q4, some of the pricing coming through, the balance of it coming in Q1 of 2022, and the EPS guidance is reflective of all of that. Thank you, Laurent. Yeah, Kevin, no change to what we have previously communicated on use of proceeds. Number one, we'll use it to reduce that. Obviously, we're losing some EBITDA, so we'll adjust our debt levels to reflect that. Number two, is we have been -- we'll use the funds to invest in organic CapEx back into the business. Obviously, it begs the question, and I can see where people might go to, what does it mean for share repurchase in 2022? And the answer is we'll talk about share repurchase in February on all of that. That's a broader question on guidance, but I know that question is out there, so wanted to at least say we'll deal with that when we get to '22. Yeah. Wendy, I'll address both of those questions. Regarding the investments, I think the indication was that we're going to invest broadly back in the business, not just specifically into those acquired businesses as relates to Capex. Clearly, they have near a part of that mix so you're absolutely right, but it was a broader comment around Capex. And Capex is at a higher sustained level than it was perhaps a few years ago as we're driving a faster rate of growth in the Company and in making or supply chain more resilient as well. So I think from that standpoint the numbers are pretty consistent with the strategic intent that we had articulated a bit earlier. Regarding the balance of -- what was it, again? Oh, yeah, in terms of the international M&A piece, we're through the overlap period, the biggest driver on that obviously was Pioneer to some degree, the [Indiscernible] as well as, it's the lower gross margin business. We really are through that as of the end of the second quarter, so that's not an impact in mixing our margins down any further, but we're past that as of the Q3 results. And Steve, just to add to Ramon 's answer with a few numbers. Overall, D&E markets were up 19%, so we saw a good strong growth across D&E. And then some of the biggest markets for us, Brazil, Russia, India, China, and Mexico were all up either in the teens or 20%. Very broad-based growth across all of the big key D&E markets for us. Yeah. Sean, I think it's the latter. It's more channels that were -- you're not capturing in the Nielsen data. Obviously, energy is big in the unmeasured CNG channel.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Ramon Laguarta",
            "content": "Good Morning there. Hi, Dara. Good morning. Yeah, listen, I think we're very pleased with the performance of the business overall. Categories are healthy, both our beverage and food categories. Snacks categories are growing faster than food and beverage overall in the U.S. but globally. I think we're playing in categories that are doing very well, I would say, during the pandemic and now as we are exiting the pandemic in many markets around the world. So that's one thing. The other component of our success is I think we're becoming much more competitive across both our categories in most of the markets where we operate. And that's been a consequence of the investments we've been making in the brands, I think pretty good innovation. Obviously, investments we've made in go-to-market capacity, new capabilities, talent, everything else we've been talking to you for the last couple of years. So, we're seeing the momentum across the business and we're seeing that momentum continuing into the balance of the year. That's why we are kind of elevating our guidance for top-line and we think that that momentum will continue well into the year 2022. I think Hugh, if you can -- Thank you, Bonnie. Well, it's good that you're hearing from our customers that innovation is good. It's always a good feedback. Listen now, more seriously, I think we've always seen innovation as a key driver of our competitive advantage in the marketplace. And we've been investing a lot in R&D, we're investing a lot in insights, and we're connecting better at the insights with R&D and the whole commercial execution to get the maximum return on those innovations. So, I think the machine is ready and it keeps getting better year after year. So yes, our pipeline is strong. I would say our pipeline in 2021 was very strong as well, and we're seeing the return from that innovation across the world. We're trying to be much more local, much more mid-term and long-term, much more incremental in the way we think about our innovation. When it comes to the investment behind the innovation, I think we have the right level of A&M, Bonnie, in our business to support innovation in a big way. And it's not only A&M, but as you know, we have a very strong push system that allows us to give innovation a lot of visibility and separate it from the rest of the category and make sure that the trial levels are higher and the repeat levels are good. I would say, yes, there will be a strong innovation across beverages and snacks. We think it's going to be quite incremental, and I would think we have the right level of resources to support that innovation within our current algorithm, so I would not expect a higher A&M next year. Yeah. Lauren, I'll take a first go at this and then maybe Hugh can add some more comments. What we're seeing across the world is much lower elasticity on the pricing that we've seen historically, and that applies to developing markets, Western Europe, and the U.S. Across the world consumer seems to be looking at pricing a little bit differently than before. It could be several hypotheses. I think in our case, our brands are stronger and I think our innovation is stronger as you were saying, so that could be a factor. There could be also some behaviors as consumers are shopping faster in-store and they might be paying less attention to pricing as a decision factor, and they might be giving more relevance to the brands or brands that they feel more -- a bit closer to a more closer -- yeah, I would say closer more and more emotionally attached to us as our brand. We're seeing less elasticity and we're adjusting our models as we go. And that's obviously informing our decisions as we price the balance of the year and into 2022. I think, Bryan, your two hypotheses are valid. I think there is a lapping effect especially AMESA last year suffered a lot given its geography, so India, Pakistan, Middle East, and Africa clearly were challenged last year. They are coming back, is a very beverage-focused business so clearly it was more impacted by the COVID mobility restrictions, so we're seeing those businesses coming back, and we have high scale and we have high share in many of those markets, and our advertising and marketing is doing very well. So part of that is lapping. Your second question on scale, yes, scale is getting -- obviously, every year, you see the growth level on the top-line. We're getting to scale levels that are pretty good in many of the critical markets in that region, and that's giving us obviously the opportunity to do better in the marketplace and the flow-through is also stronger. I think the two are relevant. If you think about the business going forward, those are very strategic markets for us going forward. And we continue to invest in everything from technologies so we can expand the portfolio, talent. Obviously, there is a war for talent in that part of the world. I think we're a scale Company that does a good job with developing talent in that part of the world. And then obviously our go-to-market being very strong, we have very good bottlers. And wherever we have our own operations, especially in the food business, we're also investing in digitalization and everything that goes with being more precise and more agile. Hopefully, I'm answering both the short-term, but also more especially for me, the long-term of how we see that part of the world, yeah. Thank you Laurent. Well, listen, we have a good partnership with The Boston Beer Company and they have the R&D, and the knowledge in this space that we don't. We have the brand, so Mountain Dew, I think it will play very well in that space. It will be quite differentiated in terms of the flavor profile and the emotional connection. That's how we're thinking about it in terms of the first step into this market. From the distribution point of view, we think we have an opportunity to create a distribution system in the U.S. that is quite unique in the sense that would be an integrated distribution system that can make coordinated decisions across multiple states from one decision point. And that could be, I think, competitively advantaged. We're starting with a number of states where we have the license to operate, and we will take it from there. We feel optimistic, we think it will be very incremental. It would help us with the drop size. It will help us with the economics of their routes eventually. And we think the same as we're doing with a chill distribution system, that goes very popular and it's unique and it covers the whole country. We think we could eventually vision distribution system that can be quite [Indiscernible] and quite integrated on the low alcohol part of our portfolio as well. Yeah. Listen, our view on the category is it's very sizable, I think it's almost $9 billion retail value now, and growing 20%, and with high -- good margins above the average of the categories. Clearly a space where we should be playing, and that's how we're thinking about this. We see consumer trends that favor that this category will continue to grow in its current form or with new innovation. That's why we decided to participate our first entries with Mountain Dew, and Mountain Dew is going to be a flavor malt beverage, not a hard seltzer. I think it will be a differentiated flavor and with a very unique brand. So I think we can carve out our own space in that what is in relatively crowded market. And we'll take it from there. Obviously, we have a pipeline of ideas that we will be disclosing as we go. Kevin, good morning. Listen, I think we've been looking obviously at our portfolio since I started with Hugh on the team and we've added some assets to the Company in high-growth spaces, long-term. We've added assets in Africa, we've added assets in China, we've added assets here in the U.S. that allow us to grow into new spaces, value-added dairy, or energy, or healthier snacks. We've made some decisions over the last 3 years to add assets that will give us accelerated growth. At the same time, we've been looking at other parts of the portfolio where probably the long-term growth and the long-term margin creation is less exciting. And in that context is where we see the juice business is a good business, but it's probably not a business that we think we can grow at the speed and with the margins that we want to grow PepsiCo overall. And that's why we decided to make this decision. We found a great partner in PAI, they have very good experience with previous similar partnerships with other large food companies. We believe we have a way for this JV that we're creating to continue to create synergies on the operational side for the juice business, continue to innovate and make sure that our brands, because we want to be 40% of that JV, continue to thrive and compete in a better way that they would probably do in our portfolio where we have a lot of choices where to invest on, where to focus. That's the -- that's Kevin, the logic behind this. That -- now Hugh can tell you about the -- more of the financial part, which is also very attractive, I would say. International M&A. Yeah, Nik, listen clearly the category isn't very healthy across the world. Obviously, the U.S., Western Europe, and also developing markets. We're seeing, obviously, the away - from -home business picking up. We think in Q3 our away from home business is a 90% index to '19. It keeps going up with every month that goes by. Clearly that's a very positive sign. Now, our convenience store business continues to do very well as consumers are having higher mobility. But the remarkable thing is that they in-home consumption continues to be quite high. Consumers are not -- are still using the home as a hub and continue to entertain at home, and continue to do more things at home. And that's driving additional consumption at home versus the previous '19 level. I think, we're in a very good place where consumption at home is higher, consumption on-the-go is increasing and most of the channels in our food service business are picking up. Pretty good momentum. We expect those strengths to continue for a while, and we think that consumers have changed some of their habits from what we're reading in our insights. And we think that the beverage category is in a very positive situation for the upcoming future. We see the same with snacks, by the way. The snack business which is obviously a big part of our growth and sales and profit s, we see that category very consistent across the world. And it was during the pandemic, it is now growing in a very fast pace as consumers are gaining mobility as well. So I think, as I said at the beginning, our 2 categories where we operate are growing significantly higher than the food and beverage categories overall. And that is an advantage that we have as a Company as we play into categories that are from the consumer point of view are very preferred. Great. Yes. Listen, I won't go into a lot of specifics, it's widely available information, but I would say that we're gaining space both inconvenience as you were saying, it was a focus and we invested to gain additional space, not only for our energy business, but for making sure that our innovation was incremental in space, as that's what really makes a difference in the overall output of the Company. We have -- if you think about the other variable which is secondary displays or overall inventory on the floor. Because we've had some supply chain constraints in some of our products, we've pulled back on some of the inventory on the perimeter during the summer voluntarily, I would say, just to make sure that we were able to service the customers on the right level, that's something temporary that, obviously, we will push back as we improve our reliability of the supply chain. But clearly, it's a positive I would say, of our mix, of our top-line growth, the additional space that we're driving for both our beverages or snacks across all the channels. That's where we see the value of our push model or DSDs really helping us to execute with precision and not just muscle, but we're putting more and more intelligence in where we drive this space. How do we execute that space and all the positive feedback loop that we're creating with our people on the ground, our associates on the ground, to make that a differentiation for our Company. Yeah. Steve, a couple of things, I would say, specifically to developing markets. We're seeing a higher mobility than we were expecting earlier in the year, so we've seen maybe we were a bit conservative as we were planning the year in terms of how COVID would impact some of the developing markets.

Our first question is coming from Bonnie Herzog of Goldman Sachs.\nBonnie Herzog: Good morning, everyone.\nRamon Laguarta: Good morning, Bonnie.\nBonnie Herzog: Good morning. I guess I wanted to ask about PBNA, hoping you could provide a little bit more color on that business and the drivers of the robust top line growth that you saw in the quarter. I guess I'm wondering if the growth accelerated each month in the quarter and if you're seeing this double-digit growth continue so far in July? Also how big of a driver was the stepped-up marketing and advertising spend, which you mentioned, was up double digits in the quarter? How much did that help drive the top line? And then maybe finally, on this business, you mentioned revenue in your on-premise business doubled in the quarter. Clearly, that's off of a very easy comp, but just curious when you expect revenues from that business to be back to normal levels? Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, Bonnie, let me try to answer a few of those elements. I think the results of the PBNA business are a consequence of the work we've been doing for the last, I would say, three years or so, trying to improve the equity of the brands, improve the execution, improve the organizational focus, et cetera. We're very pleased with the performance of all our brands. We\u2019re - if you think about Mountain Dew, Pepsi, Gatorade, all our large brands are growing very nicely. And then on top of that, our, I\u2019d say, smaller, medium-sized brands like Starbucks or Pure Leaf or Bubly, others are also growing at a very nice pace. So I think the portfolio is working very well for us, the consequence of the great work the team has done on innovation and brand, and the field teams are doing on execution. So that is the area we feel more proud about. Obviously, as you mentioned, there is a channel shift as consumers are moving more in the U.S. There's more mobility of the foodservice away from home channel is growing faster in Q2, obviously, as you compare it to last year and that's a tailwind to the business that I think will continue over the next quarters. But the most important thing I think for us to assess is that the business has been investing and it's delivering as a consequence of that. We're gaining share. If you - I'm sure if you've looked at the share numbers for the business in the last few months, the business keeps gaining share, keeps getting more competitive. So that's a good sign of the return on those investments.\nHugh Johnston: The only thing I wanted to add to that, Bonnie, is A&M was up about 30% in the quarter to that specific question in PBNA -- I\u2019m sorry, total.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey, guys. So just to build on that question, obviously, a strong organic sales result in the quarter to your average trends also accelerated sequentially and presumably it was -- the top line was better than you expected with the raise for your sales guidance. So I was just hoping for a bit more granularity on how much of the upside or the acceleration sequentially was driven by stronger category growth? You mentioned the on-premise strength, obviously, in beverages versus accelerating corporate market share, and maybe just give us a little more detail and numbers around market share performance? And then on a go-forward basis, given the strong market share trends, given the gross margin pressure we saw in Q2, can you just talk a little bit conceptually about pricing plans going forward in Frito and beverages and how the near-term promotional environment also may impact that, but just sort of your thoughts around pricing going forward in light of the market share strength and some of the gross margin pressure? Thanks.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, Dara, let me try to cover and then Hugh will also add on to it. I think when you look at the overall PepsiCo business, obviously, I mean, the biggest highlight for me is that the resilience of our snack business, right? So if you think about last year, it grew high single-digit. This year, it\u2019s growing high single-digit. That is extraordinary if you think about the shift in consumer behavior, how our portfolio is able to adapt to a more of an in-home consumption pattern or more of an away from home consumption pattern. So that part of the business is solid. It continues to grow at a very high level in the U.S. and also internationally. Obviously, the beverage category is benefiting from the change of patterns and behaviors of consumers, and it was very negatively affected in the away from home consumption last year. Obviously, we're benefiting now from that and you see that in the acceleration of, obviously, our North America business, but globally, our beverage business is growing much faster in the away from home business obviously as the stores are open and people are moving around. So that\u2019s from the category dynamics. Across the board, we're seeing a share of market momentum in the business as a consequence of the investments we've been making for the last few years. And this is not only in the U.S., this is across most of our large markets internationally, developing and emerging markets. And that, as I said, is we're having better innovation, better focus on our brand messaging, better execution in store, better demand to supply connectivity. And so all that is working very well to our advantage. So that's in terms of growth and the key levers as you were asking on what's driven the acceleration of the business. When you come to our pricing and how are we going to deal with pricing in the coming months, I would say, obviously, same as everybody else, we're seeing inflation in our business across many of our raw ingredients and some of our inputs in labor and freight and everything else that we operate in the same context. We feel quite comfortable or confident that through a combination of net revenue management initiatives and increased productivity, we can navigate this. And I mean, we\u2019re looking at obviously staying within our long-term guidance for the coming year. So, it is a combination of tools that we're having. We're working with our partners in the retail space and in the away from home space to make the right decisions in pricing to give the consumers with us once we improve our margins.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Great, thanks. Good morning. I'd love to hear a little bit about PBNA\u2019s margins this quarter. Obviously, very strong top line, so there's going to be some operating leverage. But I was curious if you could talk a little bit about building blocks on the margin this quarter, what you're thinking of as a - we've kind of reached a new sustainable level in that build to that aspiration to build PBNA margins back into the mid-teens-type level. So, if you can share any kind of building blocks, channel mix, absence of COVID costs, straight - lower promotion, that would be really helpful context? Thanks.\nHugh Johnston: Yes. Hi, Lauren. It\u2019s Hugh. Actually, you just mentioned a couple of the important factors for sure. Channel mix, obviously, is a benefit as small foodservice as well as the convenience store channel continues to do well. Convenience grew double digits. The foodservice channel, as you saw, doubled. And that's a good profitable channel for us. So that clearly was a tailwind. But keep in mind, that's really getting us back to normal in a lot of ways as well. So I don't view this as extraordinary. I just view it as we're getting back to sort of a more normal world, although clearly not all the way back. In addition to that, the energy category, which we participate in, in a bigger way, obviously has higher margins. Mountain Dew Rise is off to a terrific start. Rockstar, we're slowly steadily making progress on that. As we said, we believe that would take some time and we continue to believe that will take some time, but we're seeing some of the right indications there. And then, as you noted, the combination of sort of operating leverage in the business, plus a reduction in COVID costs, as we expected, also contributed. So some of the things that we've talked about in past quarters in terms of getting PBNA on the road to much stronger margins, we are certainly very acutely aware of it and we are focused as a team on continuing to drive that improved performance.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy of Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: Great, thanks. Good morning, everyone, and congratulations on the strong results. Question on the extension of the restructuring initiative and how this may translate to profitability. So you now expect $1 billion in incremental annual savings through 2026. I think this was generally expected by the market and translates to over 100 basis points per annum of margins, pre any sort of reinvestment. So the question is, do you see a greater likelihood that shareholders could see a greater degree of earnings flow through in this phase of the restructuring program? And I ask that in the context of a clearly healthier top line coming out of the pandemic and multiyear investments that the company has made, some of which we've discussed on this call that have already been put into the P&L? So if the answer is no, what do you see as the most attractive areas of investments within the portfolio, whether this is by product line or geography? So thanks for that.\nHugh Johnston: Yes. Hey, Kevin, it\u2019s Hugh. A couple of things on that. Number one, look, we've obviously been delivering $1 billion of productivity -- over $1 billion a year for a number of years and we continue to find opportunities to do that. Number two, part of what we're trying to do is shape the company for the future. And in doing so, we're obviously taking cost out in certain places and then we're investing in certain places, like digitalizing the supply chain and making our interactions with customers and consumers much more efficient than they were in the past. So I think what you'll see is, to some degree, those things will balance out. We've always talked about something in the range of 30 bps of margin improvement, that 20 to 30 range that we've been in. And I think you should assume that that's where we're going to be going forward as well on an ongoing basis. Now, obviously, quarter-to-quarter, those things may shift around a little bit. But that's sort of the track that we remain on, along with accelerated revenue growth. So the combination of accelerating revenue growth and 20 to 30 basis points of margin improvement translates into nice EPS. How much we deliver on in every quarter, obviously, it will be a product of the specifics of that quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane: Hey, good morning, guys.\nHugh Johnston: Good morning, Bryan.\nBryan Spillane: Hey, Hugh, just wanted to touch a little bit on the kind of the dynamics within gross margin both in the quarter and I guess as we're looking forward. I know we've got raw materials and commodity costs moving, labor costs are higher. It sounds like there's also some just tightness in supply in some packaging items. So I guess, to the extent that raw material inflation probably is going to be with us for a while, just trying to understand as we're looking forward, how much of what you're seeing currently you expect to sort of stick around for a while, and how much of that you think begins to fade as we move -- as we begin to exit 2021?\nHugh Johnston: Yes, happy to answer that, Bryan, and maybe shape a couple of summary comments to sort of help frame the numbers a bit. Obviously, gross margin was down in the quarter. That was no surprise to anyone. The biggest driver of that by far were the big international acquisitions that we had that are just inherently lower gross margin businesses, still good businesses to be sure, but lower gross margin. So the math of that obviously dragged them down to some degree. In addition to that, obviously, there's sort of ongoing inflationary pressure. We insulate ourselves to some degree based on our forward buying program, and that has actually helped us clearly this year. There will be a bit more pressure in the back half. But at the same time, as you know, we tend to take pricing after Labor Day in both of our businesses, and I think you would expect to see that pattern continue. So is there some - somewhat more inflation out there? There is. Are we going to be pricing to deal with it? We certainly are. The investments in our brands and the investments that we've made in supplying our customers I think is what enables us to take that pricing as we have every year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: Hi, good morning and congrats on the strong results. So I think my question is a bit like you just said, Hugh, on the sales recovery. It implies -- the guidance implies about 4% to 5% growth in the second half. And it basically is acceleration on a two-year stack. So what is driving this more conservative assumption? Is that something outside the U.S., the lack of visibility given that you have the reopening, you have the single serving coming back, you just said, post Labor Day, you have the pricing coming in and you also commented on the energy becoming bigger for you, so all of those. Can you help us bridge why the second half would be acceleration in a two-year stack?\nHugh Johnston: Yes, Andrea, a couple of things I think that went through our guidance. First and I'll always start with this. When we deliver guidance to you all, it is a number that we intend to hit and we have high, high assurance of hitting it. So as we sort of evaluate scenarios for the balance of the year, we obviously contemplate both the opportunity factors that you've mentioned, all of which are quite real, as well as the risk factors of we're not fully out of the pandemic at this point yet. There's sort of lots of volatility to some degree in the U.S. and developed countries, but to an even greater degree in developing and emerging countries. So as we sort of think about our guidance, we sort of package all of that up and we adopt the posture that gives us the ability to deliver under pretty well almost all scenarios. And that's why we've been as consistent as we have been in delivering our guidance. So I think as you think about our posture, I'll just remind you that that's the way we tend to approach this.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, I think, Andrea, just to build on what Hugh is saying, I think we've seen obviously positive trends in many markets, but we also see the reality of the pandemic. I was just in Europe last week working with the European team and when we thought it was going to be out of the COVID lockdowns, they're back into lockdowns in many markets. So I think as Hugh said, we're confident on our marketplace performance. I think that will continue. We're counting on the resilience of our categories, but also where we're aware of the ups and downs that might come in the coming months, especially as we move into the colder months in the Northern Hemisphere. So that is all included in the forecast for the balance of the year.\nHugh Johnston: And the one thing I will remind you of is we're delivering 6% on a full year basis. That's on top of a 4%-2% last year and on top of a 4%-5% the previous year. So, it's pretty strong overall top line performance for the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet of Guggenheim.\nLaurent Grandet: Hi. Good morning, everyone. And I'd like to come back to some of the comments you made on the energy category, you did say your premium [ph] market was pretty strong and you mentioned that you still have some work to do on Rockstar. So, clearly we are seeing that Starbucks and Rise to some extent and Bang are doing very well, but Rockstar is a bit behind. So could you maybe give us a bit more granularity about the relaunch and when you\u2019re thinking numbers come in, in the U.S. but also internationally, specifically in Europe for Rockstar? And also wanted some indication about Mountain Dew Rise so that we understand what's going on in the energy category for you guys? Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Hi, Laurent. Yes, listen, I think you mentioned the four pillars of our strategy, right? So let me go back one by one. Starbucks, we\u2019re super happy with the performance of that portfolio and the partnership with Starbucks is stronger than ever, and we continue to innovate. And I think the new products are excellent. The execution is excellent. That business is growing. When take home and now away from home, it's really firing on all cylinders. The Mountain Dew Rise, we're very happy with the initial execution and the initial consumer reaction. So execution was very good from our teams. We tend to do that quite well. We have a good DSD system that executes laterally [ph] at a good level and we're seeing very good initial trial from consumers, very good repeats. If you follow on social networks, all the comments are extremely positive about the taste, about the efficacy of the other products, so good. It's 1% of energy. 1% share is clearly -- we're aspiring for much more, but it's only been in the market for three months. So a very good start. I think it's a solid foundation for what is going to be I think a great business. As you're saying, we continue to distribute the Bang business as per our commitments, and that's going well. And then on Rockstar, we were always very transparent. This is a multiyear effort, right, that we're trying to put strong foundations in the areas of product. So we're changing some of the formulas. I think the non-sugar portfolio is excellent and that's the area of the category that is growing the fastest. Our execution is improving a lot. We gained distribution and we gained better visibility of the brand. And I think our brand position is quite good as we found a niche that wasn\u2019t there. It clearly is differentiated from Red Bull and from Monster, and it's a unique position in there. We plan to insist on anything we're getting good feedback as well on that positioning. So as I said, it's going to be a multiyear. We're very focused on the domestic business here in the U.S., but also the international teams are very focused on that priority. And we will execute on a multi-quarter, multiyear basis. And we're very positive what we're seeing. Again, we'll keep updating you every quarter on how things are evolving, but positive so far.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen.\nVivien Azer: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. I was hoping you could please comment on trends for SodaStream in the quarter, and in particular how that business has responded to the recovery in waste and home consumption in the U.S.? Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, good. Vivien, the SodaStream business is a global business, right? So it has a very solid penetration in Europe. That business continues to thrive I would say in Europe and also in the U.S. We're gaining a lot of household penetration in the U.S. The latest thing we're doing and it's working quite well is putting some of our large beverage brands into the SodaStream, let\u2019s say, consumption model which started in Europe. In the U.S., we started with Bubly. Bubly drops are working very, very well as an enhancer of the SodaStream experience and we continue to push that combination of the Bubly flavors on the SodaStream sparkling water experience. So I would say still far from its potential. The household penetration is good in some Central European market is low. Everywhere else we continue to build that. We continue to build the direct-to-consumer model, trying to get many more insights on consumption behaviors. And that is helping us not only to develop the SodaStream business, but to develop the rest of our innovation and categories. So a pretty good ecosystem we're building of consumption at home, but also insights and innovation for the broader business. So we feel good about the momentum of the business and we\u2019ll continue to -- it's going to continue to be a priority for us going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: Yes. Hi. Good morning. Ramon, you commented on this just there a bit in the context of SodaStream, but as you step back, I was hoping you could expand on how you're viewing the performance of your recently acquired businesses in aggregate and where you're at in terms of integrating them into the broader portfolio relative to your plans coming into the year? And then, Hugh, in that context, I guess just to validate whether it's fair to assume that with the financial performance expected this year, that you feel you'll be on track to remove some of the financial constraints that you imposed upon yourself this year in terms of being able to resume elective buybacks and/or reenter the M&A market looking out beyond the end of this fiscal year? Just a health check there would be great. Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, that's great, Steve. Let me just go around the different M&A and give you an update. Obviously, we started with SodaStream. I think it's as a saying is a future consumption model that we're betting on. It's great in terms of consumer personalization of the product and obviously better for the planet. It's going very well. It's going to evolve our initial expectations for the business. We will continue to invest. When it comes to the U.S., several acquisitions. The CytoSport business, which -- that was Muscle Milk brand and Evolve brand and some others, that business is really thriving. Clearly, we\u2019ll see that consumers moving into protein and sport and that's a space that will continue to grow. Very positive momentum with the two brands. And there were some jewels in that business, like Evolve and some others that we\u2019re trying to take the maximum out of those brands as you will see in the coming future. The Rockstar I mentioned, Rockstar was an acquisition that gave us a great business, but also an enablement for a broader strategy. I think we're executing against those plans. We feel very good about it. The other acquisition we did in the U.S. in the snack business was the Better-For-You company, the PopCorners brands and some other brands that business had. That is an amazing performance. And we knew that there was a space for that popping technology and for the PopCorners brands playing in the healthier space for snacking and a bit premium. The truth is that it will keep adding capacity, and the Frito team are really doing a fantastic work in terms of expanding distribution and building the brand. So we feel very good about that one. Then when you go internationally, there were two focused acquisitions, one based in the Africa expansion, the Pioneer business, and we're in the middle of the integration. Obviously, COVID has had an impact in the integration of that business, but we're proceeding. This is a Horizon 5 type of investment. Africa will be a source of growth for all our companies around the world in the coming decades, and that's an investment with that time of -- that type of perspective. And the other business was the Be & Cheery business in China, which is a direct-to-consumer snack business that complement our potato chips and corn business in China with a lot of local snacks and you go to market in the form of direct to consumer. That is also working very well. We're starting to integrate. We're launching some of the Be & Cheery products into our, let's say, brick and mortar distribution system that's pretty good in China. And the other way around, we're putting some of our brands into the Be & Cheery direct to consumer model. So I would say the execution is good. The strategic intent that we had with all these acquisitions is working. The business case continues to be as we thought. So good progress, I would say, in all these different acquisitions.\nHugh Johnston: And then, Steve, to follow up on your questions on capital allocation, no change at all to what I previously said regarding M&A and no change regarding buybacks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.\nNik Modi: Yes, thanks. Good morning, everyone. So the question is really on international, if you could provide \u2013 obviously, you had some pretty strong performance. The COVID situation seems a bit asymmetric obviously between the U.S. and other parts of the world. So just wanted to get some context on away from home, at home, what you saw there? And then some of the channel work that we've done, which suggests that PepsiCo has -- at least the beverage has been quite active in the retail trade with promotions. So I just wanted to get some context around that. Was there certain opportunity that you saw of kind of pushing people into away from home consumption, because the -- sorry at home consumption because away from home was under pressure due to COVID? Thanks.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, Nik, let me tell you a bit -- how we see the situation, the different markets around the world. Obviously starting with China, China is obviously out of COVID already for some time and the trends are the away from home business grew last year, continues to grow. Our snacks business continues to do very strong, the same with beverages. So good macros in China. The rest of Asia, a bit more challenged. So we're seeing and when you think about Vietnam, Thailand, Japan, even Australia, there have been more challenges there and consumers going back to normal behavior, so that might take a bit of time. Obviously, Africa, Middle East, India, you guys are reading the news, so there is a lot of -- still a lot of challenges there with running normal operations in all those markets. So it will be a while before those markets go back to a normality. Eastern Europe, very strong actually in spite of some of the COVID challenges in Russia specifically. Consumers are moving around and Eastern Europe is very strong, Turkey included, where they had some latest lockdown. So we see those markets performing very well. Western Europe, obviously away from home is improving compared to last year. But still you don't see the normal traffic North-South in Europe this time of the day -- at this time of the year, sorry. Consumers are staying in their countries. There's not going to be the usual movement of people in Europe, North-South. So we plan for that and we plan to execute our summer programs around that. Latin America and I happen to be -- I was in Mexico a few weeks ago, still the pandemic is very visible but consumers are increasing their mobility and that obviously is having positive impact in our small shops performance and somehow the restaurant business, the same with Brazil. So that hopefully gives you a little bit of a picture of how the different parts of the world are behaving and the trends in our channels.\nHugh Johnston: Yes, the only thing I'd add is broadly the environment seems quite rational. We're managing through this successfully, and it obviously shows up in the results. The growth numbers were quite strong pretty well around the world.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein of Evercore.\nRob Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. Still early days and maybe premature, but love to get your thoughts on what the new normal is going to look like for the consumer channels? Any long-lasting behaviors that you're starting to pick up on that we'll see post-COVID? And to the extent there are, how you're changing or adapting the company to meet them? Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, good question. Listen, we are still obviously looking at consumer behaviors. And I think consumers are also trying to figure it out at this point. We see some trends that I think are going to stay. The most important one probably is the shopping behavior is changing. I think e-commerce or let's call it e-commerce in a broader sense, it's going to continue to be a preferred way of shopping, something that a lot of families tried during the pandemic and we're seeing those families stick into that behavior. So that is going to be a permanent trend, and obviously we've been investing in e-commerce for quite some time; capabilities, supply chain, advertising models, et cetera, and we're working very closely with all our customers to pivot to that. So I think that's something that is going to stay. The home as a hub is also a trend that we're seeing more. I think consumers are venturing out, but they are still doing a lot of their activities at home and we foresee a flexible working model where consumers are going to spend more time at home and they're not going to go back to the office kind of every day of the week. Obviously, certain type of people, not everybody. We see that as an opportunity for our snacks and our breakfast and our food business in general, and also for our beverages business. We see consumers in general being more concern about what we call holistic health; so mental health, physical health, consumers are exercising more, consumers are more -- making more balances between their food choices, which for us generates a couple of important trends. Portion control, we're seeing that as a strategy consumers are following and that's giving us a huge growth in our variety packs and multi-packs and that as a trend that we're capturing I think will continue. The other one is consumers move into healthier spaces in our categories. Clearly non-sugar is growing very fast. I think we're very well positioned from the R&D point of view and the innovation point of view on non-sugar. And the same for more permissible snacks where we -- in the last few years, we've been between acquisitions and on development. We have a very good portfolio that is gaining share in that particular space. So those are some of the trends that we're seeing. Obviously, consumers will continue to evolve, but obviously we're following very close what's happening across different parts of the world and adapting very fast our brands and our innovation, our channel resources to those new trends.\nOperator: And we have time for one more question. Our final question will come from the line of Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities.\nChris Carey: Hi. Thank you for the question. So you just noted on the trend to consume healthier products and in your prepared remarks, you also talked about continuing to invest behind Zero Sugar, both on the carbonated and non-carbonated side. I wonder if you could maybe just help lay the land here on how the portfolio is performing and how you see it positioned and where you think the investments will go both on a product and geographic basis? Obviously in the U.S., if diet Mountain Dew isn't losing some share, maybe Diet Pepsi got flat, snacks gaining, but still relatively small Bubly doing quite well. And so just any perspective on how important or the go-forward trends that you see in this business? And where you really expect to focus in the near, medium and longer term? Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, happy to discuss [ph]. Listen, I think the -- obviously consumers are moving I think and is going to be a long-term trend into healthier choices in beverages and in snacks, right. So we've been working on this for a long time in our R&D and I think we're getting very good at providing the consumers with very good taste experiences and functional experiences with Zero Sugar, and that is a great capability we have in the system. We have great examples of that. If you only think about, for example, Gatorade Zero, right, this is a massive innovation. It\u2019s over $1 billion innovation we only for a -- I would say 20 months something like that in the marketplace. So we're able to provide functionality, good taste, had a Zero Sugar even in spaces like Gatorade. Clearly for more refreshing experiences or more indulgent experiences, I think the Pepsi Zero solution or the Mountain Dew Zero solutions, those are extremely great tasting products that are getting a lot of consumer favor. If you think about our European business, for example, the equivalent of Pepsi Zero, which is Pepsi Max in Europe, is leader in many of the European markets. We have a much higher share in the non-sugar category than we have in the sugar category, and I think that's where we've been investing for a long time. We'll continue to invest. We see that trend not stopping for the foreseeable future and it\u2019s where we are putting our R&D investments, our brand investments and our innovation investments. Okay, I think we run out of time. So thank you very much everybody for joining us today and for the confidence you've placed in PepsiCo and in us with your investments. So we hope that you all stay healthy and safe. Thank you very much and talk to you again.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "The only thing I wanted to add to that, Bonnie, is A&M was up about 30% in the quarter to that specific question in PBNA -- I'm sorry, total. Yes. Hi, Lauren. It's Hugh. Actually, you just mentioned a couple of the important factors for sure. Channel mix, obviously, is a benefit as small foodservice as well as the convenience store channel continues to do well. Convenience grew double digits. The foodservice channel, as you saw, doubled. And that's a good profitable channel for us. So that clearly was a tailwind.

And in doing so, we're obviously taking cost out in certain places and then we're investing in certain places, like digitalizing the supply chain and making our interactions with customers and consumers much more efficient than they were in the past. So I think what you'll see is, to some degree, those things will balance out. We've always talked about something in the range of 30 bps of margin improvement, that 20 to 30 range that we've been in. And I think you should assume that that's where we're going to be going forward as well on an ongoing basis. Now, obviously, quarter-to-quarter, those things may shift around a little bit. But that's sort of the track that we remain on, along with accelerated revenue growth. So the combination of accelerating revenue growth and 20 to 30 basis points of margin improvement translates into nice EPS. How much we deliver on in every quarter, obviously, it will be a product of the specifics of that quarter. Good morning, Bryan. Yes, happy to answer that, Bryan, and maybe shape a couple of summary comments to sort of help frame the numbers a bit. Obviously, gross margin was down in the quarter. That was no surprise to anyone. The biggest driver of that by far were the big international acquisitions that we had that are just inherently lower gross margin businesses, still good businesses to be sure, but lower gross margin. So the math of that obviously dragged them down to some degree. In addition to that, obviously, there's sort of ongoing inflationary pressure. We insulate ourselves to some degree based on our forward buying program, and that has actually helped us clearly this year. There will be a bit more pressure in the back half. But at the same time, as you know, we tend to take pricing after Labor Day in both of our businesses, and I think you would expect to see that pattern continue. So is there some - somewhat more inflation out there? There is. Are we going to be pricing to deal with it? We certainly are. The investments in our brands and the investments that we've made in supplying our customers I think is what enables us to take that pricing as we have every year. Yes, Andrea, a couple of things I think that went through our guidance. First and I'll always start with this. When we deliver guidance to you all, it is a number that we intend to hit and we have high, high assurance of hitting it. So as we sort of evaluate scenarios for the balance of the year, we obviously contemplate both the opportunity factors that you've mentioned, all of which are quite real, as well as the risk factors of we're not fully out of the pandemic at this point yet. There's sort of lots of volatility to some degree in the U.S. and developed countries, but to an even greater degree in developing and emerging countries. So as we sort of think about our guidance, we sort of package all of that up and we adopt the posture that gives us the ability to deliver under pretty well almost all scenarios. And that's why we've been as consistent as we have been in delivering our guidance. So I think as you think about our posture, I'll just remind you that that's the way we tend to approach this. And the one thing I will remind you of is we're delivering 6% on a full year basis. That's on top of a 4%-2% last year and on top of a 4%-5% the previous year. So, it's pretty strong overall top line performance for the year. And then, Steve, to follow up on your questions on capital allocation, no change at all to what I previously said regarding M&A and no change regarding buybacks. Yes, the only thing I'd add is broadly the environment seems quite rational. We're managing through this successfully, and it obviously shows up in the results. The growth numbers were quite strong pretty well around the world."

            "name": "Ramon Laguarta",
            "content": "Good morning, Bonnie. Yes, Bonnie, let me try to answer a few of those elements. I think the results of the PBNA business are a consequence of the work we've been doing for the last, I would say, three years or so, trying to improve the equity of the brands, improve the execution, improve the organizational focus, et cetera. We're very pleased with the performance of all our brands. We're - if you think about Mountain Dew, Pepsi, Gatorade, all our large brands are growing very nicely. And then on top of that, our, I'd say, smaller, medium-sized brands like Starbucks or Pure Leaf or Bubly, others are also growing at a very nice pace. So I think the portfolio is working very well for us, the consequence of the great work the team has done on innovation and brand, and the field teams are doing on execution. So that is the area we feel more proud about. Obviously, as you mentioned, there is a channel shift as consumers are moving more in the U.S. There's more mobility of the foodservice away from home channel is growing faster in Q2, obviously, as you compare it to last year and that's a tailwind to the business that I think will continue over the next quarters. But the most important thing I think for us to assess is that the business has been investing and it's delivering as a consequence of that. We're gaining share. If you - I'm sure if you've looked at the share numbers for the business in the last few months, the business keeps gaining share, keeps getting more competitive. So that's a good sign of the return on those investments. Yes, Dara, let me try to cover and then Hugh will also add on to it. I think when you look at the overall PepsiCo business, obviously, I mean, the biggest highlight for me is that the resilience of our snack business, right? So if you think about last year, it grew high single-digit. This year, it's growing high single-digit. That is extraordinary if you think about the shift in consumer behavior, how our portfolio is able to adapt to a more of an in-home consumption pattern or more of an away from home consumption pattern. So that part of the business is solid. It continues to grow at a very high level in the U.S. and also internationally. Obviously, the beverage category is benefiting from the change of patterns and behaviors of consumers, and it was very negatively affected in the away from home consumption last year. Obviously, we're benefiting now from that and you see that in the acceleration of, obviously, our North America business, but globally, our beverage business is growing much faster in the away from home business obviously as the stores are open and people are moving around. So that's from the category dynamics. Across the board, we're seeing a share of market momentum in the business as a consequence of the investments we've been making for the last few years. And this is not only in the U.S., this is across most of our large markets internationally, developing and emerging markets. And that, as I said, is we're having better innovation, better focus on our brand messaging, better execution in store, better demand to supply connectivity. And so all that is working very well to our advantage. So that's in terms of growth and the key levers as you were asking on what's driven the acceleration of the business. When you come to our pricing and how are we going to deal with pricing in the coming months, I would say, obviously, same as everybody else, we're seeing inflation in our business across many of our raw ingredients and some of our inputs in labor and freight and everything else that we operate in the same context. We feel quite comfortable or confident that through a combination of net revenue management initiatives and increased productivity, we can navigate this. And I mean, we're looking at obviously staying within our long-term guidance for the coming year. So, it is a combination of tools that we're having. We're working with our partners in the retail space and in the away from home space to make the right decisions in pricing to give the consumers with us once we improve our margins. Yes, I think, Andrea, just to build on what Hugh is saying, I think we've seen obviously positive trends in many markets, but we also see the reality of the pandemic. I was just in Europe last week working with the European team and when we thought it was going to be out of the COVID lockdowns, they're back into lockdowns in many markets. So I think as Hugh said, we're confident on our marketplace performance. I think that will continue. We're counting on the resilience of our categories, but also where we're aware of the ups and downs that might come in the coming months, especially as we move into the colder months in the Northern Hemisphere. So that is all included in the forecast for the balance of the year. Hi, Laurent. Yes, listen, I think you mentioned the four pillars of our strategy, right? So let me go back one by one. Starbucks, we're super happy with the performance of that portfolio and the partnership with Starbucks is stronger than ever, and we continue to innovate. And I think the new products are excellent. The execution is excellent. That business is growing. When take home and now away from home, it's really firing on all cylinders. The Mountain Dew Rise, we're very happy with the initial execution and the initial consumer reaction. So execution was very good from our teams. We tend to do that quite well. We have a good DSD system that executes laterally [ph] at a good level and we're seeing very good initial trial from consumers, very good repeats. If you follow on social networks, all the comments are extremely positive about the taste, about the efficacy of the other products, so good. It's 1% of energy. 1% share is clearly -- we're aspiring for much more, but it's only been in the market for three months. So a very good start. I think it's a solid foundation for what is going to be I think a great business. As you're saying, we continue to distribute the Bang business as per our commitments, and that's going well. And then on Rockstar, we were always very transparent. This is a multiyear effort, right, that we're trying to put strong foundations in the areas of product. So we're changing some of the formulas. I think the non-sugar portfolio is excellent and that's the area of the category that is growing the fastest. Our execution is improving a lot. We gained distribution and we gained better visibility of the brand. And I think our brand position is quite good as we found a niche that wasn't there. It clearly is differentiated from Red Bull and from Monster, and it's a unique position in there. We plan to insist on anything we're getting good feedback as well on that positioning. So as I said, it's going to be a multiyear. We're very focused on the domestic business here in the U.S., but also the international teams are very focused on that priority. And we will execute on a multi-quarter, multiyear basis. And we're very positive what we're seeing. Again, we'll keep updating you every quarter on how things are evolving, but positive so far. Yes, good. Vivien, the SodaStream business is a global business, right? So it has a very solid penetration in Europe. That business continues to thrive I would say in Europe and also in the U.S. We're gaining a lot of household penetration in the U.S. The latest thing we're doing and it's working quite well is putting some of our large beverage brands into the SodaStream, let's say, consumption model which started in Europe. In the U.S., we started with Bubly. Bubly drops are working very, very well as an enhancer of the SodaStream experience and we continue to push that combination of the Bubly flavors on the SodaStream sparkling water experience. So I would say still far from its potential. The household penetration is good in some Central European market is low. Everywhere else we continue to build that. We continue to build the direct-to-consumer model, trying to get many more insights on consumption behaviors. And that is helping us not only to develop the SodaStream business, but to develop the rest of our innovation and categories. So a pretty good ecosystem we're building of consumption at home, but also insights and innovation for the broader business. So we feel good about the momentum of the business and we'll continue to -- it's going to continue to be a priority for us going forward. Yes, that's great, Steve. Let me just go around the different M&A and give you an update. Obviously, we started with SodaStream. I think it's as a saying is a future consumption model that we're betting on. It's great in terms of consumer personalization of the product and obviously better for the planet. It's going very well. It's going to evolve our initial expectations for the business. We will continue to invest. When it comes to the U.S., several acquisitions. The CytoSport business, which -- that was Muscle Milk brand and Evolve brand and some others, that business is really thriving. Clearly, we'll see that consumers moving into protein and sport and that's a space that will continue to grow. Very positive momentum with the two brands. And there were some jewels in that business, like Evolve and some others that we're trying to take the maximum out of those brands as you will see in the coming future. The Rockstar I mentioned, Rockstar was an acquisition that gave us a great business, but also an enablement for a broader strategy. I think we're executing against those plans. We feel very good about it. The other acquisition we did in the U.S. in the snack business was the Better-For-You company, the PopCorners brands and some other brands that business had. That is an amazing performance. And we knew that there was a space for that popping technology and for the PopCorners brands playing in the healthier space for snacking and a bit premium. The truth is that it will keep adding capacity, and the Frito team are really doing a fantastic work in terms of expanding distribution and building the brand. So we feel very good about that one. Then when you go internationally, there were two focused acquisitions, one based in the Africa expansion, the Pioneer business, and we're in the middle of the integration. Obviously, COVID has had an impact in the integration of that business, but we're proceeding. This is a Horizon 5 type of investment. Africa will be a source of growth for all our companies around the world in the coming decades, and that's an investment with that time of -- that type of perspective. And the other business was the Be & Cheery business in China, which is a direct-to-consumer snack business that complement our potato chips and corn business in China with a lot of local snacks and you go to market in the form of direct to consumer. That is also working very well. We're starting to integrate. We're launching some of the Be & Cheery products into our, let's say, brick and mortar distribution system that's pretty good in China. And the other way around, we're putting some of our brands into the Be & Cheery direct to consumer model. So I would say the execution is good. The strategic intent that we had with all these acquisitions is working. The business case continues to be as we thought. So good progress, I would say, in all these different acquisitions. Yes, Nik, let me tell you a bit -- how we see the situation, the different markets around the world. Obviously starting with China, China is obviously out of COVID already for some time and the trends are the away from home business grew last year, continues to grow. Our snacks business continues to do very strong, the same with beverages. So good macros in China. The rest of Asia, a bit more challenged. So we're seeing and when you think about Vietnam, Thailand, Japan, even Australia, there have been more challenges there and consumers going back to normal behavior, so that might take a bit of time. Obviously, Africa, Middle East, India, you guys are reading the news, so there is a lot of -- still a lot of challenges there with running normal operations in all those markets. So it will be a while before those markets go back to a normality. Eastern Europe, very strong actually in spite of some of the COVID challenges in Russia specifically. Consumers are moving around and Eastern Europe is very strong, Turkey included, where they had some latest lockdown. So we see those markets performing very well. Western Europe, obviously away from home is improving compared to last year. But still you don't see the normal traffic North-South in Europe this time of the day -- at this time of the year, sorry. Consumers are staying in their countries. There's not going to be the usual movement of people in Europe, North-South. So we plan for that and we plan to execute our summer programs around that. Latin America and I happen to be -- I was in Mexico a few weeks ago, still the pandemic is very visible but consumers are increasing their mobility and that obviously is having positive impact in our small shops performance and somehow the restaurant business, the same with Brazil. So that hopefully gives you a little bit of a picture of how the different parts of the world are behaving and the trends in our channels. Yes, good question. Listen, we are still obviously looking at consumer behaviors. And I think consumers are also trying to figure it out at this point. We see some trends that I think are going to stay. The most important one probably is the shopping behavior is changing. I think e-commerce or let's call it e-commerce in a broader sense, it's going to continue to be a preferred way of shopping, something that a lot of families tried during the pandemic and we're seeing those families stick into that behavior. So that is going to be a permanent trend, and obviously we've been investing in e-commerce for quite some time; capabilities, supply chain, advertising models, et cetera, and we're working very closely with all our customers to pivot to that. So I think that's something that is going to stay. The home as a hub is also a trend that we're seeing more. I think consumers are venturing out, but they are still doing a lot of their activities at home and we foresee a flexible working model where consumers are going to spend more time at home and they're not going to go back to the office kind of every day of the week. Obviously, certain type of people, not everybody. We see that as an opportunity for our snacks and our breakfast and our food business in general, and also for our beverages business. We see consumers in general being more concern about what we call holistic health; so mental health, physical health, consumers are exercising more, consumers are more -- making more balances between their food choices, which for us generates a couple of important trends. Portion control, we're seeing that as a strategy consumers are following and that's giving us a huge growth in our variety packs and multi-packs and that as a trend that we're capturing I think will continue. The other one is consumers move into healthier spaces in our categories. Clearly non-sugar is growing very fast. I think we're very well positioned from the R&D point of view and the innovation point of view on non-sugar. And the same for more permissible snacks where we -- in the last few years, we've been between acquisitions and on development. We have a very good portfolio that is gaining share in that particular space. So those are some of the trends that we're seeing. Obviously, consumers will continue to evolve, but obviously we're following very close what's happening across different parts of the world and adapting very fast our brands and our innovation, our channel resources to those new trends. Yes, happy to discuss [ph]. Listen, I think the -- obviously consumers are moving I think and is going to be a long-term trend into healthier choices in beverages and in snacks, right. So we've been working on this for a long time in our R&D and I think we're getting very good at providing the consumers with very good taste experiences and functional experiences with Zero Sugar, and that is a great capability we have in the system. We have great examples of that. If you only think about, for example, Gatorade Zero, right, this is a massive innovation. It's over $1 billion innovation we only for a -- I would say 20 months something like that in the marketplace. So we're able to provide functionality, good taste, had a Zero Sugar even in spaces like Gatorade. Clearly for more refreshing experiences or more indulgent experiences, I think the Pepsi Zero solution or the Mountain Dew Zero solutions, those are extremely great tasting products that are getting a lot of consumer favor. If you think about our European business, for example, the equivalent of Pepsi Zero, which is Pepsi Max in Europe, is leader in many of the European markets. We have a much higher share in the non-sugar category than we have in the sugar category, and I think that's where we've been investing for a long time. We'll continue to invest. We see that trend not stopping for the foreseeable future and it's where we are putting our R&D investments, our brand investments and our innovation investments. Okay, I think we run out of time. So thank you very much everybody for joining us today and for the confidence you've placed in PepsiCo and in us with your investments. So we hope that you all stay healthy and safe. Thank you very much and talk to you again."

[Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s call is being recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Ravi Pamnani, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Pamnani, you may begin.\nRavi Pamnani: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I hope everyone has had the chance this morning to review our press release and prepared remarks, both of which are available on our website. Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. We may make forward-looking statements on today\u2019s call, including about our business plans, 2021 outlook and the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties and only reflect our view as of today and we are under no obligation to update. When discussing our results, we may refer to non-GAAP measures, which exclude certain items from reported results. Please refer to today\u2019s earnings release and 10-Q available on pepsico.com for definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures and additional information regarding our results, including a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from forward-looking statements. Joining me today are PepsiCo\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Ramon Laguarta and PepsiCo\u2019s Vice Chairman and CFO, Hugh Johnston. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question. And with that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey, guys. Good morning. So I just wanted to spend some time on gross margins; a) first, just can you give us some sense of what adjusted gross margins would have been in the quarter ex the acquisitions and the supply chain challenges you mentioned in Texas at quarter end that you mentioned in the prepared remarks? And then b) looking out more longer term we have obviously \u2013 we are seeing a really pronounced rise in the commodity spectrum across the board in CPG lately, core. And certainly, one of those is up substantially year-over-year. So, can you talk about how much you are covered for 2021 on commodities? But what I am really more interested in strategically is in the event that these higher commodities do fully flow through your P&L as we look later in the year or even into 2022, because it does feel like we are certainly in a normal commodity environment, how do you approach that from an organizational standpoint? Can we expect more aggressive pricing? And how do you sort of approach that higher commodity spectrum theoretically as an organization given it does seem like an outsized increase? Thanks.\nHugh Johnston: Yes, I will jump in on that one, Dara. Thanks for the question and good morning. If you look at really over the last three quarters, the gross margin decline we have had is really primarily been driven by the mix impact of our recent international M&A, primarily the Pioneer acquisition and we expect that to continue into Q2 that\u2019s the last quarter before we finally lap out of that.  In terms of \u201821, there is certainly higher input inflation, but it\u2019s been factored into the \u201821 guidance, notably in terms of agricultural and packaging. In addition to that, we have also factored in the higher freight and transportation costs that we are experiencing out there right now. And again, just to remind you all, no single commodity accounts for more than 10% of our basket, so we do have a fairly broad exposure to commodities.  In terms of managing it, we will take a balanced approach in this as we always have between driving productivity and then being very surgical with the net revenue management opportunities that we have in the marketplace to mitigate pressures. And obviously, our eye is always towards making sure that our brand proposition holds up well with consumers.  If I put it all together, for 2021, Q1, up 140 basis point decline, about 100 basis points of that came out of the international M&A and about 30 basis points came out of the pressures that we experienced as a result of the winter storm in the middle of the country.  Going forward into the back half of the year, we do expect that to moderate considerably. And I would probably put our back half gross margin in the flattish range. As for \u201822, it\u2019s premature really to talk about that. I mean we are so early in the commodity cycle, particularly on ag products that I think that\u2019s something that we probably ought to wait some months before we start speculating on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Goldman Sachs.\nBonnie Herzog: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I had a question on Frito-Lay, certainly, a strong quarter despite really being the toughest comp of the year. So, maybe you could drill down further on some of the momentum you are seeing in this business and give us a sense of how strong results could have been without the winter storms? And then separately, could you help us understand consumer consumption patterns around pack sizes? Are your large pack sizes still driving the majority of the growth at Frito-Lay and maybe how you expect that to trend? And finally, just curious to hear if you have seen any recovery in the impulse portion of that business yet and then if not, why? Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Hi, good morning, Bonnie. I will take this one. Yes, Frito, a couple of highlights on their performance. The share performance of Frito has accelerated in the last 6 months, most notably in the last 3 months. So, we feel good about that part. And we have been investing in our brands, not only the big brands, but the smaller brands and our execution capabilities, our supply chain to make sure that we started to gain share. So, that\u2019s very positive.  Obviously, as you look at the Q1 numbers, Frito was particularly impacted by the winter storm, because we have a lot of infrastructure in the south, lot of our manufacturing and depots are there in the south. So it was particularly impacted. So, we are slowly recovering from that situation, both raw materials and actual manufacturing and we are very close to having a normal supply chain now. Your question on consumer trends, I think there is a structural trend that we have discussed in the past and is the fact that we are seeing more and more small portion consumption in the snacks business and to a certain extent, also in the beverage business.  So smaller units, especially now in the form of multi-packs given there is an increase in home consumption, that\u2019s the consumer packages that is growing the fastest. And I think that the team has been very good at providing more personalization around that creating more combination of multi-packs, which drives eventually given that consumers like variety, it drives performance and we are seeing a lot of growth there. I think that\u2019s going to be a structural trend in that business. Now, to your question on mobility, yes, we are seeing consumers in the U.S., obviously, moving around much more, which has a positive impact by definition in consumption trends in both large format and small format. So, we are seeing much more single-serve growth in both channels large format and small format. So, those are all some trends that we are seeing. There is still uncertainty around in-home consumption, I think and we are going to have more information about consumer behavior in the next few months as consumers decide how much they go back to working offices, how much they venture out for some of their meals during the day. So, we have obviously a lot of insights and we are \u2013 all our future projections are based on those insights. I think the consumer will show us more as we go along in the next, I would say, 6 to 9 months yes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you. Good morning. So, I wanted to go back to the top line and the cadence of the quarter as you obviously lapped the initial pantry load, but also as I mentioned before, the disruptions of the winter storms are likely behind you. So, it\u2019s a two-parter question. Number one, are you seeing foodservice less negative as you exited the quarter worldwide? And then second, your price/mix was pretty strong and obviously, your pack part of the business, the RGM has been negatively impacted by the large portions of large size packs. Are you seeing that improving and any opportunity to, along with that, mitigate some of the cost pressures with more pricing? Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Good morning, Andrea. Yes, on the foodservice trends, yes, we are seeing obviously as we are lapping the lockdowns of last year and we are seeing obviously much better traffic in that channel and we are going to see better consumption, especially as we go forward. Different levels of recovery across different channels within foodservice, but in general, we see positive trends and that should be very good for both our beverages and snack business. Obviously, that will have implications in-home as well. So, I think we will see a new equilibrium of consumption going forward. Sorry, what was the second one, I forgot, Andrea?\nOperator: Her line has been closed, sir.\nRamon Laguarta: Okay. Well, listen, in terms of future consumption trends, I think what I said to Bonnie earlier and what we are seeing in foodservice that will determine the future growth of our portfolio, yes.\nHugh Johnston: Yes. Ramon, just to add to that, I think she was also asking about large package versus small package and obviously as mobility increases, small package will tend to take on a more prominent role, which obviously has positive margin implications for us.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, which is along the lines of what I was telling Bonnie about, there are some structural trends on small format that will continue in our two categories going forward, yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to talk a little bit maybe about PBNA margins. I know you have talked about objectives to get those margins up significantly through portfolio mix, channel mix, cost savings. They were up 100 basis points in this quarter. I am guessing the lower promotion helps a bit. But if you could just talk a little bit about some of the key inputs to drive that margin improvement and how we should think about cadence? Is this quarter the start of it or is this more of a one-off in that trajectory? Thanks.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, hi. I think we have been improving margins at PBNA now for a few quarters. What we see in Q1 is a realization of the efforts the team are doing in the multiple vectors that we referred to earlier. So there is better portfolio mix. There is, as you say, a better revenue management across the different channels, but there is also an important productivity journey that the team started. So, our cost per unit across many levers of the P&L, are also improving. So we are seeing both a better mix management, better price realization and a better cost management through the P&L. We are also seeing a better returns on our A&M. We are seeing ROI on our A&M getting better, which will give us probably an opportunity also to optimize our A&M as we go forward in the year, so multiple vectors and good output from a lot of these different elements that will drive the overall profit improvement of PBNA.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of Am erica.\nBryan Spillane: Hey, good morning. Maybe just wanted to follow-up on, Ramon, the comments you just made on A&M efficiencies. Was looking in the 10-Q, it seems like advertising or marketing was down in a lot of segments. I am not sure if it was up or down at all for the total company. But I guess I was wondering given where we sit today in terms of the stage of reopening, are you still \u2013 are you spending like at marketing at normal levels currently or will that kind of unfold as things reopen, so really just trying to understand whether or not marketing was up or down, but more importantly, are you able to kind of spend that at full level yet or is the environment not really there to do that?\nRamon Laguarta: Hi Bryan, good morning, listen, our position on marketing has been always a positive one in terms of continuing to invest in our brands rationally. And we didn\u2019t got meaningful the A&M last year because I think that really gives us the right to compete and continue to develop the brand equity of our brands. Having said that, we are continuing to get much better at understanding and measuring the ROI of the different types of marketing we can do for the different brands, the different channels, the different types of content. And we are getting better at optimizing that, what is a very sizable A&M budget across the company. So clearly, we are \u2013 our strategic position is to continue to invest in A&M as a big driver of long-term growth and brand development. Obviously, we are trying to \u2013 as we do with every investment that we make across the company, we are trying to have the highest return on that A&M, both in terms of geographies, channels, brands and different opportunities. So that \u2013 the end number in the P&L is a combination of those 2 inputs.\nHugh Johnston: Hey, Ramon, if I can just add to your answer as well. In particular, Bryan, on North America Beverages, we have talked about in the past that there may be an opportunity to spend at a lower level while maintaining competitiveness. And to the degree that opportunity presents itself, we certainly expect to take advantage of it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet of Guggenheim.\nLaurent Grandet: Yes. Good morning everyone. I would like to focus a bit on the energy category I would like to understand the retail reception to your new energy offensive in the U.S., specifically in the revamp of Rockstar, the launch of Mountain Dew Rise and the situation with the Bang, which seems to be getting more smoothly, if we can say so. So \u2013 and that is important to understand because the segment is becoming even more dynamic than before with many more players, Monster having some of its own sales force, so I really like to understand how the retailers are seeing your offensive there? Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Good, Laurent, thank you. Listen, it\u2019s clearly a focused category for us with a lot of effort, not only in the U.S., but also internationally. So, let me go one by one on the different components of it. The first thing I would say, the Starbucks Energy segment, which is, as you know, we have been working on it for many years now, continues to grow double digit. So that is very unique and quite defensible for us. Our double shot, triple shots continued to grow at a double digit. And our partnership with Starbucks is at a very, very good relationship. Now, when you go into the pure energy, a couple of things, as you said, the Bang business is stabilized and actually growing very nicely. So, we are feeling good about that part.  When it comes to our brands, very early, but very positive reaction from the consumer early trial, I would say, from the customer, very strong reaction on our Mountain Dew Rise. Clearly, that\u2019s a product where I think our marketing teams and our R&D teams have done a phenomenal job in finding a very particular insight on there is a need for a morning energy drink that is unique and differentiated. I think the product delivers on that. And the early feedback we are getting from consumers and retailers is very good. The teams are full on in terms of distribution. And as you know, we signed with Lebron James, and that\u2019s going to create, I think, very, very good awareness for the brand and very good early trials. When it comes to Rockstar, also I think the teams have done a great job with the repositioning of the brand, with the reformulation of the products, with the international launch and re-launch here in the U.S. The early \u2013 again, it\u2019s only 6 weeks in the market, really with the new graphics and the new repositioning. We started with Super Bowl on the advertising front. Early reads are very positive compared to what was a flat to negative net sales growth. It\u2019s now in the positive territory and quite, quite high. But I would say, it\u2019s too early to call whether we are really bringing new consumers to the brand and whether those consumers stay with the brand. I think we are going to need a few more quarters to really understand what\u2019s happening at the consumer level, but from the selling and from the customer reaction, very positive across the four vectors. And it makes us feel confident that we have a good foundation from which to build upon with future innovation and future brand events, so good start in [indiscernible].\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen.\nVivien Azer: Hi, good morning, I was hoping to discuss your beverage innovation strategy, please. As we noticed that last week in Germany, you launched Rockstar + Hemp. So as it relates to that product, can you discuss your broader plans for that offering beyond Germany? And then related to that, can you also please discuss your appetite to introduce hemp or even a CBD beverage offering in the U.S., please? Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. Hi Vivien, listen, yes, we are testing innovation across the world, different consumer spaces. And we will see, depending on the performance of the products and we will decide to lift and shift. I would say the test in Germany is very particular for that country. There is a sizable segment of hemp drinks in Germany. We will read that. I wouldn\u2019t take any broader conclusions for the broader company. Our focus now is on the pure energy category. We have identified the morning occasion as an open opportunity that is not well covered by existing propositions. And I think we have also the coffee bar. We have some other priorities in our portfolio where we would like the team to focus. And we will test and learn from some of the other opportunities that we have globally.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Thank you. I got in again. I was hoping to talk a little bit about China because my sense is that with China being about two-thirds of Asia, if I am right at this point, the growth there has been very, very strong. And the comparisons in terms of COVID with only 2 months wouldn\u2019t have been that severe, just I guess the Chinese New Year portion. So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about China, if there is anything you are doing differently there, share progression? Yes, I would be curious on an update on China. Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Thank you. Yes, China is a bit of a very special case, now given that how COVID is clearly a different cycle than in other countries around the world. We are seeing \u2013 obviously, there is a little bit of noise in our Q1 numbers because of the different timing of Chinese New Year. So clearly, there was a very good performance in China this year. Part of that is the fact that we capture more Chinese New Year this year versus last year. But having said that, the trends in China are very positive in terms of consumer mobility and consumer spending, we are obviously benefiting from that. On top of it, in snacks, we continued to gain share. We are building new manufacturing. We are building new agro programs. We are building \u2013 we are investing in rural areas for better distribution of our snacks business. And we are, as you know, we bought Be & Cheery, which is a Chinese company that has a portfolio of macro snacks, which complements our strong potato chip business that we have been building for many years. On the snacks side, I would say, very encouraged by the positive share, by the mobility, by the return on the investments we have made on rural areas and more capital distribution. With regards to beverages, it\u2019s been a \u2013 it is really a very positive performance for the category. And we have been holding share, gaining a little bit of share in China in the categories where we perform. Clearly, the away-from-home business in China is improving, and that is giving the category very, very high growth numbers in general. So feeling good about China and feeling good about the balance of the year in that country. The growth expectations of the economy are positive as was recently laid out by the government, and we are seeing that in the consumption. Obviously, China is a very dynamic market and what we are seeing is massive changes in channels of consumption. So, there are a lot of new channels of consumption developing, social channels and new kind of entertainment, e-commerce type of channels that are driving changes in the consumer and the way companies need to adapt in their supply chain and their marketing spend. But overall, as a country, it continues to be a very important and very large business opportunity for us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala of Credit Suisse.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Hi, can you talk a little bit about \u2013 you mentioned being covered on commodities and the diversity of the commodity base, can you talk a bit about labor and staffing, what you are seeing there in terms of any price \u2013 cost pressure as well as what we should be expecting in terms of COVID costs and maybe the fading year-over-year of COVID costs that are in your P&L at the moment?\nRamon Laguarta: Hi Kaumil, yes, two things. On COVID, we are obviously \u2013 we go with the largest society. So whenever there is a drop in cases, our costs goes down. And we have seen that in the U.S. We have seen a drop early in the quarter, but then we see more cases now. In other parts of the world, we haven\u2019t seen a reduction, really. So, if you think about Latin America, if you think about Europe, Africa, we see actually pretty much the same number of cases that we are seeing late in the year. So, our COVID costs will continue to be, obviously, to a lower level than last year, but will continue to be a factor. And there is \u2013 we go with how the government or broader society is able to manage the pandemic in the different geographies. So, that is the situation. Hugh, do you want to take the other part?\nHugh Johnston: Yes. In terms of labor pressures, right now, in the U.S., Kaumil, it\u2019s actually okay. We haven\u2019t seen a lot of labor inflation and we are able to get employees reasonably well right now. So how that\u2019s going to play going forward remains to be seen as the economy picks up. But at least, as for right now, we are doing fine on that front. And then as you know, and as Ramon alluded to as well, last year, we had around $800 million of COVID costs. And as I have commented before, our exit rate on the quarter was about, I believe it was somewhere in the neighborhood of $20 million to $30 million a period. We ought to see that number stay the same to sequentially decline over time, as Ramon noted, given the \u2013 as COVID cases go away, obviously, our costs tend to go away as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: Yes. Hi, good morning. Thanks. Maybe as a follow-up in part to where Dara and Bonnie started off the call, in the past, when we have seen inflation in corn and other inputs that impact Frito-Lay, especially in North America, my perception is that PepsiCo has often ended up cost advantage for a period of time versus competition just because I think your hedging programs tend to be more structural and long dated versus peers. So, I guess is that fair and if so, do you see that phenomenon taking shape in the current year as well? And I guess if you do, do you see that more as an opportunity to improve profitability, maybe consolidate a bit more share while you are advantaged or perhaps a combination? Just how you are thinking about that and if my underlying premise is correct in the first place. Thanks.\nHugh Johnston: If you want, Ramon, I will jump in on that one. Steve, with the competition that we have right now, obviously, it\u2019s a pretty diverse group. My sense is you are probably right. We are probably a little bit further out. In the Frito-Lay business, we are going to sort of run our play. We have our pricing strategies in place right now, and my expectation is we will execute against those. And frankly, we will see how competition responds to them. So it\u2019s a little bit hard for me to project how it is they are going to operate. But I think we, by and large, have our pricing plans in place. Again, will we use some surgical net revenue management techniques during the course of the next few quarters? Yes, we will. But by and large, I think we\u2019re relatively locked into what we\u2019re looking to do for the year. I did want to clarify one thing in regards to Kaumil\u2019s question. I mentioned $20 million to $30 million of period \u2013 periods of internal term that we use. So I should qualify that as $60 million to $80 million a quarter is probably the exit rate that we had on COVID costs. And then we\u2019ll see where we land as the year progresses.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein of Evercore. \nRob Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. I want to just turn to a question on promos in the percentage of CSDs and beverages sold on promo in the U.S. And I was wondering if kind of if you kind of help us sort of level set maybe where it was in 2019, where it fell down to in 2020, what it looks like for the quarter and your expectations for the rest of the year? Thank you. \nRamon Laguarta: Yes, Robert, so listen, we\u2019re seeing a very rational environment for pricing and promotions in the U.S. at this point in time. In the category, I think the level of promotions that we\u2019re seeing in Q1, that we had in Q1 was lower than what we had in Q1 last year. And we \u2013 our expectations is that we should be seeing a rational market for the balance of the year. At this point, there are still shortages, I think, in supply from many of the players in the category. And we\u2019re all becoming better at understanding the \u2013 improving our net revenue management capabilities and understand the return on promotions and we\u2019re becoming more sophisticated, working with our partners on getting the best return on the promotion. So I think there is a \u2013 there is probably a high likelihood that the market will remain a rational for the next quarters, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do ourselves. And I expect the rest of the industry would follow a similar position.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. \nKevin Grundy: Great, thanks. Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Ramon, I wanted to return to North America Beverages, just sort of overall state of the union because this, of course, was a big focus for you when you took over as CEO. The question relates to market share progress for key brands, Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Gatorade. Looking at the Nielsen data, performance has been a bit mixed, particularly in sports drinks where Gatorade continues to lose quite a bit of share. So if you could comment on your overall level of satisfaction with trends, adequacy of investment, particularly as you look to restore margins in the segment here in the \u2013 not just this year, but in the coming years as well, that would be helpful. Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Thank you. Listen, we feel very good about our competitiveness in beverages in North America. And as we laid out a couple of years ago, we wanted to go one brand at a time and make sure that each one of our big brands became really competitive. And we\u2019ve done it very, I would say, very surgically and very consistently. So we started with Pepsi. Pepsi now is growing \u2013 has been growing for the last 1.5 years at a good level and starting to gain share in CSDs, outgrowing some of our competitors. We went in with Gatorade, our second-largest brand. And again, yes, Gatorade is not growing share in the sports drink category, but it\u2019s being 1 of the top 3 brands contributing to overall growth of LRB in 2020 and continues in 2021. I mean the growth of Gatorade has been very strong, not only because of what has been an amazing platform for the brand in Gatorade Zero, but also by growing the rest of the portfolio. And then third, Mountain Dew, which was our pending third brand. We \u2013 It took us a little bit longer but if you see the growth of Mountain Dew in the last two quarters, especially the last quarter, it\u2019s been very high, right? And it\u2019s not only the fact that we\u2019ve added innovation, but our base Mountain Dew is growing again at a very good level. So we see our three core brands continue to \u2013 or starting to be very consistently growing at the category pace or above. That complemented with the fact that we always said we want to continue to be leaders in some of the sub segments that are growing faster, right? So if you take coffee, a large segment in the beverage category in the U.S., where we\u2019re clearly outgrowing everybody else. If you see teas, we\u2019re also gaining share in teas with our Pure Leaf and our Lipton brands. If you think about sparkling water, bubly has been a big success. So we continue to play on the periphery, but we\u2019re making, what I would say, very good and consistent progress in what are the core brands of our business and obviously, very meaningful for the overall category. So we\u2019re very happy. We will continue to improve. As I said earlier, energy is our next big space where we have multiple tools that we will use very incrementally to each other to drive, hopefully, share gains as well in that \u2013 in what is a very dynamic category, as Laurent mentioned earlier. So we feel very good. I think the business is becoming much more competitive. The business is becoming much more agile. The business is becoming much more thoughtful about performing today and investing for the future, so a lot of positives that we see in the North America Beverages in the last, whatever, 2 years. And we\u2019re very hopeful that this will be a pretty good year for that business given the trends that we see in the market performance and the activities that we have planned for our brands. So we\u2019re feeling good. We\u2019re feeling very good about PBNA.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sean King of UBS.\nSean King: Hi, good morning. And just maybe more international focused, but does your outlook take into account any negative margin mix effects of a beverage rebound versus the tougher comparison on the snacking side or am I thinking about the dynamics sort of incorrectly with respect to international margins for snacking versus beverage?\nHugh Johnston: Yes. Yes. I\u2019ll jump in on that one. Yes, Sean, in short, yes, our outlook does account for what you just described. So in terms of margins outside the U.S., the snack margins tend to be lower relative to beverages where we\u2019re a franchise company. Obviously, franchise is a higher-margin business, but where we operate a company on bottling operation a little [indiscernible]. Overall, our outlook sort of captures all of those mix impacts. I don\u2019t expect anything to be disruptive over the course of 2021.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities. \nChris Carey: Hi, good morning. Just to clarify a prior answer. You mentioned that promo you expect it to remain rational. Is that to imply that you think it can remain structurally lower for the long term or you expect a normalization back to pre-COVID levels? I didn\u2019t quite get directionally which way you were talking about. And then the question just related to pricing, it was a historically high price in PBNA, and this is a trend we\u2019ve been seeing more. Can you just talk about how you view pricing power in that division, whether that is a split between certain brands or categories and just overall your overall comfort with price over volume-driven approach going forward? Thanks.\nRamon Laguarta: Hugh, do you want to start and then I\u2019ll complement?\nHugh Johnston: Yes. Happy to, Ramon. To be clear on that one, yes, we do think that there is an opportunity for longer term, what you term price rationality in the North American Beverage marketplace, both from the standpoint of competitive structure as well as what we think is the right way to compete, which is primarily around innovation and brand building and execution. So we think the environment is well set up for pricing to be positive going forward. That\u2019s not a temporary thing based on what\u2019s happening in the environment right now.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. Chris, I think what Hugh said, we\u2019re seeing everybody becoming more kind of capable and knowledgeable on consumer insights and apply to promotions and pricing and elasticities. And so we\u2019re going to see more application of those multiple levers to provide good value to the consumer rather than just driving prices down, which I don\u2019t think is a big idea for anybody in the industry. And obviously, with the set of inflation trends that we\u2019ve seen in some of the commodities and so on, there is probably going to be very little incentive for anybody to break what is a very rational environment as we see today. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it and how we\u2019re talking to some of our partners in the retail industry.\nRamon Laguarta: Okay. I think that was the last question. So thank you very much for your time this morning. Really appreciate it. I hope you guys stayed safe and healthy. And especially, thank you very much for the confidence that you\u2019ve all placed in us with your investments. Thank you very much, and I look forward to future meetings. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude PepsiCo\u2019s 2021 first quarter earnings question-and-answer session. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Hugh Johnston",
            "content": "Yes, I will jump in on that one, Dara. Thanks for the question and good morning. If you look at really over the last three quarters, the gross margin decline we have had is really primarily been driven by the mix impact of our recent international M&A, primarily the Pioneer acquisition and we expect that to continue into Q2 that's the last quarter before we finally lap out of that.  In terms of \u201821, there is certainly higher input inflation, but it's been factored into the \u201821 guidance, notably in terms of agricultural and packaging. In addition to that, we have also factored in the higher freight and transportation costs that we are experiencing out there right now. And again, just to remind you all, no single commodity accounts for more than 10% of our basket, so we do have a fairly broad exposure to commodities.  In terms of managing it, we will take a balanced approach in this as we always have between driving productivity and then being very surgical with the net revenue management opportunities that we have in the marketplace to mitigate pressures. And obviously, our eye is always towards making sure that our brand proposition holds up well with consumers.  If I put it all together, for 2021, Q1, up 140 basis point decline, about 100 basis points of that came out of the international M&A and about 30 basis points came out of the pressures that we experienced as a result of the winter storm in the middle of the country.  Going forward into the back half of the year, we do expect that to moderate considerably. And I would probably put our back half gross margin in the flattish range. As for \u201822, it's premature really to talk about that. I mean we are so early in the commodity cycle, particularly on ag products that I think that's something that we probably ought to wait some months before we start speculating on. Yes. Ramon, just to add to that, I think she was also asking about large package versus small package and obviously as mobility increases, small package will tend to take on a more prominent role, which obviously has positive margin implications for us. Hey, Ramon, if I can just add to your answer as well. In particular, Bryan, on North America Beverages, we have talked about in the past that there may be an opportunity to spend at a lower level while maintaining competitiveness. And to the degree that opportunity presents itself, we certainly expect to take advantage of it. Yes. In terms of labor pressures, right now, in the U.S., Kaumil, it's actually okay. We haven't seen a lot of labor inflation and we are able to get employees reasonably well right now. So how that's going to play going forward remains to be seen as the economy picks up. But at least, as for right now, we are doing fine on that front. And then as you know, and as Ramon alluded to as well, last year, we had around $800 million of COVID costs.

But by and large, I think we're relatively locked into what we're looking to do for the year. I did want to clarify one thing in regards to Kaumil's question.

            "name": "Ramon Laguarta",
            "content": "Hi, good morning, Bonnie. I will take this one. Yes, Frito, a couple of highlights on their performance. The share performance of Frito has accelerated in the last 6 months, most notably in the last 3 months. So, we feel good about that part. And we have been investing in our brands, not only the big brands, but the smaller brands and our execution capabilities, our supply chain to make sure that we started to gain share. So, that's very positive.  Obviously, as you look at the Q1 numbers, Frito was particularly impacted by the winter storm, because we have a lot of infrastructure in the south, lot of our manufacturing and depots are there in the south. So it was particularly impacted. So, we are slowly recovering from that situation, both raw materials and actual manufacturing and we are very close to having a normal supply chain now. Your question on consumer trends, I think there is a structural trend that we have discussed in the past and is the fact that we are seeing more and more small portion consumption in the snacks business and to a certain extent, also in the beverage business.  So smaller units, especially now in the form of multi-packs given there is an increase in home consumption, that's the consumer packages that is growing the fastest. And I think that the team has been very good at providing more personalization around that creating more combination of multi-packs, which drives eventually given that consumers like variety, it drives performance and we are seeing a lot of growth there. I think that's going to be a structural trend in that business. Now, to your question on mobility, yes, we are seeing consumers in the U.S., obviously, moving around much more, which has a positive impact by definition in consumption trends in both large format and small format. So, we are seeing much more single-serve growth in both channels large format and small format. So, those are all some trends that we are seeing. There is still uncertainty around in-home consumption, I think and we are going to have more information about consumer behavior in the next few months as consumers decide how much they go back to working offices, how much they venture out for some of their meals during the day. So, we have obviously a lot of insights and we are \u2013 all our future projections are based on those insights. I think the consumer will show us more as we go along in the next, I would say, 6 to 9 months yes. Good morning, Andrea. Yes, on the foodservice trends, yes, we are seeing obviously as we are lapping the lockdowns of last year and we are seeing obviously much better traffic in that channel and we are going to see better consumption, especially as we go forward. Different levels of recovery across different channels within foodservice, but in general, we see positive trends and that should be very good for both our beverages and snack business. Obviously, that will have implications in-home as well. So, I think we will see a new equilibrium of consumption going forward. Sorry, what was the second one, I forgot, Andrea? Okay. Well, listen, in terms of future consumption trends, I think what I said to Bonnie earlier and what we are seeing in foodservice that will determine the future growth of our portfolio, yes. Yes, which is along the lines of what I was telling Bonnie about, there are some structural trends on small format that will continue in our two categories going forward, yes. Yes, hi. I think we have been improving margins at PBNA now for a few quarters. What we see in Q1 is a realization of the efforts the team are doing in the multiple vectors that we referred to earlier. So there is better portfolio mix. There is, as you say, a better revenue management across the different channels, but there is also an important productivity journey that the team started. So, our cost per unit across many levers of the P&L, are also improving. So we are seeing both a better mix management, better price realization and a better cost management through the P&L. We are also seeing a better returns on our A&M. We are seeing ROI on our A&M getting better, which will give us probably an opportunity also to optimize our A&M as we go forward in the year, so multiple vectors and good output from a lot of these different elements that will drive the overall profit improvement of PBNA. Hi Bryan, good morning, listen, our position on marketing has been always a positive one in terms of continuing to invest in our brands rationally. And we didn't got meaningful the A&M last year because I think that really gives us the right to compete and continue to develop the brand equity of our brands. Having said that, we are continuing to get much better at understanding and measuring the ROI of the different types of marketing we can do for the different brands, the different channels, the different types of content. And we are getting better at optimizing that, what is a very sizable A&M budget across the company. So clearly, we are \u2013 our strategic position is to continue to invest in A&M as a big driver of long-term growth and brand development. Obviously, we are trying to \u2013 as we do with every investment that we make across the company, we are trying to have the highest return on that A&M, both in terms of geographies, channels, brands and different opportunities. So that \u2013 the end number in the P&L is a combination of those 2 inputs. Good, Laurent, thank you. Listen, it's clearly a focused category for us with a lot of effort, not only in the U.S., but also internationally. So, let me go one by one on the different components of it. The first thing I would say, the Starbucks Energy segment, which is, as you know, we have been working on it for many years now, continues to grow double digit. So that is very unique and quite defensible for us. Our double shot, triple shots continued to grow at a double digit. And our partnership with Starbucks is at a very, very good relationship. Now, when you go into the pure energy, a couple of things, as you said, the Bang business is stabilized and actually growing very nicely. So, we are feeling good about that part.  When it comes to our brands, very early, but very positive reaction from the consumer early trial, I would say, from the customer, very strong reaction on our Mountain Dew Rise. Clearly, that's a product where I think our marketing teams and our R&D teams have done a phenomenal job in finding a very particular insight on there is a need for a morning energy drink that is unique and differentiated. I think the product delivers on that. And the early feedback we are getting from consumers and retailers is very good. The teams are full on in terms of distribution. And as you know, we signed with Lebron James, and that's going to create, I think, very, very good awareness for the brand and very good early trials. When it comes to Rockstar, also I think the teams have done a great job with the repositioning of the brand, with the reformulation of the products, with the international launch and re-launch here in the U.S. The early \u2013 again, it's only 6 weeks in the market, really with the new graphics and the new repositioning. We started with Super Bowl on the advertising front. Early reads are very positive compared to what was a flat to negative net sales growth. It's now in the positive territory and quite, quite high. But I would say, it's too early to call whether we are really bringing new consumers to the brand and whether those consumers stay with the brand. I think we are going to need a few more quarters to really understand what's happening at the consumer level, but from the selling and from the customer reaction, very positive across the four vectors. And it makes us feel confident that we have a good foundation from which to build upon with future innovation and future brand events, so good start in [indiscernible]. Yes. Hi Vivien, listen, yes, we are testing innovation across the world, different consumer spaces. And we will see, depending on the performance of the products and we will decide to lift and shift. I would say the test in Germany is very particular for that country. There is a sizable segment of hemp drinks in Germany. We will read that. I wouldn't take any broader conclusions for the broader company. Our focus now is on the pure energy category. We have identified the morning occasion as an open opportunity that is not well covered by existing propositions. And I think we have also the coffee bar. We have some other priorities in our portfolio where we would like the team to focus. And we will test and learn from some of the other opportunities that we have globally. Thank you. Yes, China is a bit of a very special case, now given that how COVID is clearly a different cycle than in other countries around the world. We are seeing \u2013 obviously, there is a little bit of noise in our Q1 numbers because of the different timing of Chinese New Year. So clearly, there was a very good performance in China this year. Part of that is the fact that we capture more Chinese New Year this year versus last year. But having said that, the trends in China are very positive in terms of consumer mobility and consumer spending, we are obviously benefiting from that. On top of it, in snacks, we continued to gain share. We are building new manufacturing. We are building new agro programs. We are building \u2013 we are investing in rural areas for better distribution of our snacks business. And we are, as you know, we bought Be & Cheery, which is a Chinese company that has a portfolio of macro snacks, which complements our strong potato chip business that we have been building for many years. On the snacks side, I would say, very encouraged by the positive share, by the mobility, by the return on the investments we have made on rural areas and more capital distribution. With regards to beverages, it's been a \u2013 it is really a very positive performance for the category. And we have been holding share, gaining a little bit of share in China in the categories where we perform. Clearly, the away-from-home business in China is improving, and that is giving the category very, very high growth numbers in general. So feeling good about China and feeling good about the balance of the year in that country. The growth expectations of the economy are positive as was recently laid out by the government, and we are seeing that in the consumption. Obviously, China is a very dynamic market and what we are seeing is massive changes in channels of consumption. So, there are a lot of new channels of consumption developing, social channels and new kind of entertainment, e-commerce type of channels that are driving changes in the consumer and the way companies need to adapt in their supply chain and their marketing spend. But overall, as a country, it continues to be a very important and very large business opportunity for us. Hi Kaumil, yes, two things. On COVID, we are obviously \u2013 we go with the largest society. So whenever there is a drop in cases, our costs goes down. And we have seen that in the U.S. We have seen a drop early in the quarter, but then we see more cases now. In other parts of the world, we haven't seen a reduction, really. So, if you think about Latin America, if you think about Europe, Africa, we see actually pretty much the same number of cases that we are seeing late in the year. So, our COVID costs will continue to be, obviously, to a lower level than last year, but will continue to be a factor. And there is \u2013 we go with how the government or broader society is able to manage the pandemic in the different geographies. So, that is the situation. Hugh, do you want to take the other part? Yes, Robert, so listen, we're seeing a very rational environment for pricing and promotions in the U.S. at this point in time. In the category, I think the level of promotions that we're seeing in Q1, that we had in Q1 was lower than what we had in Q1 last year. And we \u2013 our expectations is that we should be seeing a rational market for the balance of the year. At this point, there are still shortages, I think, in supply from many of the players in the category. And we're all becoming better at understanding the \u2013 improving our net revenue management capabilities and understand the return on promotions and we're becoming more sophisticated, working with our partners on getting the best return on the promotion. So I think there is a \u2013 there is probably a high likelihood that the market will remain a rational for the next quarters, and that's what we're trying to do ourselves. And I expect the rest of the industry would follow a similar position. Thank you. Listen, we feel very good about our competitiveness in beverages in North America. And as we laid out a couple of years ago, we wanted to go one brand at a time and make sure that each one of our big brands became really competitive. And we've done it very, I would say, very surgically and very consistently. So we started with Pepsi. Pepsi now is growing \u2013 has been growing for the last 1.5 years at a good level and starting to gain share in CSDs, outgrowing some of our competitors. We went in with Gatorade, our second-largest brand. And again, yes, Gatorade is not growing share in the sports drink category, but it's being 1 of the top 3 brands contributing to overall growth of LRB in 2020 and continues in 2021. I mean the growth of Gatorade has been very strong, not only because of what has been an amazing platform for the brand in Gatorade Zero, but also by growing the rest of the portfolio. And then third, Mountain Dew, which was our pending third brand. We \u2013 It took us a little bit longer but if you see the growth of Mountain Dew in the last two quarters, especially the last quarter, it's been very high, right? And it's not only the fact that we've added innovation, but our base Mountain Dew is growing again at a very good level. So we see our three core brands continue to \u2013 or starting to be very consistently growing at the category pace or above. That complemented with the fact that we always said we want to continue to be leaders in some of the sub segments that are growing faster, right? So if you take coffee, a large segment in the beverage category in the U.S., where we're clearly outgrowing everybody else. If you see teas, we're also gaining share in teas with our Pure Leaf and our Lipton brands. If you think about sparkling water, bubly has been a big success. So we continue to play on the periphery, but we're making, what I would say, very good and consistent progress in what are the core brands of our business and obviously, very meaningful for the overall category. So we're very happy. We will continue to improve. As I said earlier, energy is our next big space where we have multiple tools that we will use very incrementally to each other to drive, hopefully, share gains as well in that \u2013 in what is a very dynamic category, as Laurent mentioned earlier. So we feel very good. I think the business is becoming much more competitive. The business is becoming much more agile. The business is becoming much more thoughtful about performing today and investing for the future, so a lot of positives that we see in the North America Beverages in the last, whatever, 2 years. And we're very hopeful that this will be a pretty good year for that business given the trends that we see in the market performance and the activities that we have planned for our brands. So we're feeling good. We're feeling very good about PBNA. Hugh, do you want to start and then I'll complement? Yes. Chris, I think what Hugh said, we're seeing everybody becoming more kind of capable and knowledgeable on consumer insights and apply to promotions and pricing and elasticities. And so we're going to see more application of those multiple levers to provide good value to the consumer rather than just driving prices down, which I don't think is a big idea for anybody in the industry. And obviously, with the set of inflation trends that we've seen in some of the commodities and so on, there is probably going to be very little incentive for anybody to break what is a very rational environment as we see today. So that's how we're thinking about it and how we're talking to some of our partners in the retail industry. Okay. I think that was the last question. So thank you very much for your time this morning. Really appreciate it. I hope you guys stayed safe and healthy. And especially, thank you very much for the confidence that you've all placed in us with your investments. Thank you very much, and I look forward to future meetings. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to PepsiCo's 2022 Fourth Quarter Earnings Question-and-Answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Ravi Pamnani, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Pamnani, you may begin.\nRavi Pamnani: Thank you, operator and good morning everyone. I hope everyone has had a chance this morning to review our press release and prepared remarks both of which are available on our website. Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. We may make forward-looking statements on today's call, including about our business and plans and 2023 guidance. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties and only reflect our view as of today, February 09, 2023, and we are under no obligation to update. As a reminder, PepsiCo\u2019s fourth quarter 2022 includes 17 weeks of results. And our fiscal 2022 year includes 53 weeks of results. When discussing our results, we refer to non-GAAP measures, which exclude certain items from reported results. Please refer to our Q4 2022 earnings release and 2022 Form 10-K available on pepsico.com for definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures and additional information regarding our results, including a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from forward-looking statements. Joining me today are PepsiCo's Chairman and CEO, Ramon Laguarta; and PepsiCo's Vice Chairman and CFO, Hugh Johnston. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question. And with that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey good morning guys.\nRamon Laguarta: Good morning, Dara.\nDara Mohsenian: So I just want to focus on the 2023 topline growth outlook after another very strong quarter here in Q4. Can you just give us a quick update on the business so far in 2023, given there are some concerns around macros and the consumer? Are you seeing momentum continue or any signs of incremental consumer weakness? And then second, how does that translate to price mix? Obviously, very strong pricing in Q4. In theory there is need for more pricing given the continued cost pressures in 2023, but as I just mentioned there are some worries around the consumer and the theory for retailer pushback, so just help us understand within that organic sales growth outlook how much is price mix? Are you -- is a lot of that carryover pricing from 2022 or are you assuming more pricing in 2023? Thanks.\nRamon Laguarta: Good morning, Dara, this is Ramon. Listen, the way, the way we feel about the consumer is based on employment data and wage growth around the world is positive. In our assumption for the year, we're thinking elasticities might get worse going into the second half of the year based on multiple scenarios that we have. Obviously, they are very changing. We just had some recent changes in some other in multiple parts of the world. But we\u2019re feeling that that might happen that there are worse elasticities in the second half of the year. And that's why we're guiding to a 6%. We feel comfortable with the way the business is going as you could see from Q4 a good momentum in our brands and good share momentum in many geographies around the world. But the key, the most important thing for you to think about is we're going to keep investing in the quality of our products. We're going to keep investing in the strength of our brands. We'll keep making our go-to-market systems stronger. So no matter what happens with the consumer, we're going to be I think preferred choice for a lot of the consumers and our customers. And that's how we are planning for next year.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Your line is open.\nLauren Lieberman: Great, thanks. Good morning. I was curious in the release there were a couple mentions of two things. One brand exits and portfolio management, and the other was there were a number of impairments. And I know, anyone who acquired a business pre pandemic is pretty much taking an impairment, so that's kind of due course. But I thought it might be a good opportunity to get an idea on how some of these businesses have been faring in the sense of what they've added capability or portfolio wise or maybe where they've fallen short. Again, notwithstanding the pandemic dynamics. And then just color on what some of those brand exits and portfolio management mentions were in reference to? Thanks.\nHugh Johnston: Hey Lauren, it\u2019s Hugh. I\u2019ll handle that one. It was really a couple of things that that drove it. Number one is obviously as you mentioned pre pandemic, interest rates were awfully low and prices were pretty high for a number of these assets. And as we've sort of moved forward, we've taken a hard look at the cash flows, sort of in a post pandemic world. Combine that with the fact that interest rates are obviously materially higher, so we're discounting those cash flows at a different rate. The couple that I'd point to, during the course of the year. Mabel in Brazil was one, Pioneer a little bit as well. And then SodaStream where, SodaStream is more of a consumer discretionary type of purchase compared to our -- the balance of our portfolio. And as you would expect, behaved more like a consumer discretionary purchase. So we took the opportunity to look at the numbers going forward on that, and the investment posture we were going to have in that business. And as a result, we wrote down a piece of that business as well. So I think we put ourselves in a spot now we're in a, in a higher interest rate world, we're in a better position in terms of where we've marked those assets to.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, Lauren, strategically SodaStream continues to be a very central to the transformation of the beverage category. We've seen that there is a huge opportunity to enable consumers to personalize their drinks and have a type of consumption where there's no plastics and where there's a lot of convenience for consumers at home or in offices or even on the go. So it continues to be very central. Hugh was saying there was obviously a situation, especially in Europe, with inventories and the discretionary consumption that we took this opportunity to reassess the value of the asset.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nAndreaTeixeira: Thank you. Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. If you can talk about how to think about operating leverage, you have historically been able to use about 1 billion per year in productivity, to offset inflation. And now coming in to these year on top of like a very strong inflation, but also really healthy carryover from pricing. How should we be thinking in terms of like the ability to flex your P&L? Any particular you invested- I think we all appreciate that you invested a lot more in A&P, strong double-digit growth in the last quarter. How to think about A&P investments into 2023? Thank you.\nHugh Johnston: Yes, I'll take care of that one Andrea. I have a couple of comments on that. Number one, obviously, inflation is still out there, as a factor for us partly the fact that inflation is still high, it's not as high as it was before. But then the numbers are still relatively high. Number two, in terms of the way that we were approaching the year, we're looking to drive a lot of productivity this year. And at the same time, we're looking to continue to put investments back into the business because we think that's what's driving the top line, and consumers are clearly responding positively to it. So if you net all of that out, my expectation is that our gross and operating margins will be at least in line with where we were in 2022. And perhaps a little bit better.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nBryan Spillane: Hey, thanks, operator. Good morning, guys. Hugh, I wanted to ask you a question about cash flow and capital allocation. And I guess in terms of cash flow, just the free cash flow this year stepped down versus last year. So if you could talk a little bit about just what's happening in cash from operations, is it a timing thing? It looks like working capital has ticked up a bit? And then second, the dividend going up 10% this year? Or just what you announced today. So can you just remind us again, just how you're thinking about capital allocation as part of a total shareholder return model? And, and just how that factors into decision making in terms of capital allocation going forward?\nHugh Johnston: Yes, happy to, Bryan. Let me start broad and then I'll sort of narrow it in. Very broadly, the capital allocation principles we have are no different than what we've had in the past, the four basics of make sure we invest in the business, pay the dividend, tuck in acquisitions and share repurchase. If I zero within a little bit more for the environment that we're in right now, with some of the changes, I think our biggest priorities right now we're going to be continuing to invest in the business and growing the dividend. And that's not a just a today's statement, although obviously 10% dividend growth is a pretty, pretty healthy growth in our current environment. But I think those are our bigger priorities, relative to perhaps tucking in there and relative to perhaps share repurchase. If the 10% dividend growth is bigger than what we've done in a number of years, and I think you'll see us prioritize that a bit more over time. So I'm sorry, and then the last piece is about working capital. Yes, the time -- we basically had a timing issue one that we're doing some IT implementations. And in terms of the IT implementations, essentially we paid for it about two weeks\u2019 worth of payables, just to take some pressure off the IT systems because we had some freezes at the beginning of the year. So that's what pulled that number down. That was probably worth about 500 or so million dollars right at the end of the year. It's not a material change in cash flow. It's a two week timing issue. So I think you'll see that bounce back as we get to the end of 2023.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. The next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nBonnie Herzog: Hi, thank you. Good morning. So you\u2019ve worked out a new and improved Pepsi Zero Sugar. So just hoping for some more color behind this initiative? And really how incremental you think this can be? I mean, maybe you guys could give us a sense of how big your Zero platform is currently? And what percentage of your portfolio this could be in the next few years? And then finally, just maybe some insight in terms of how big of a push you plan to be making behind the rollout in terms of marketing spend, activation etcetera? Any color on some of these initiatives would be helpful? Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, Bonnie. Yes, listen. Yes, Zero is, is clearly a segment of the beverage category that is growing much faster than kind of full sugar all over the world. And Pepsi Zero has - or Pepsi Max as we call it in some markets has been very strategic product for us in Europe, and in other parts of the world. In the U.S., we were investing in other parts of the Pepsi brand. Now, this is going to be the center of the strategy for the Pepsi brand. We think that the non-sugar segment of Colas will continue to grow very fast in this country. We're seeing consumers pivoting. I think the R&D in our company has done a great job in giving consumers Zero sugar choices that are as good as full sugar choices or better from the taste point of view. And we're asking consumers Zero sacrifice to pivot to Zero Sugar version. So that's the principle why we've seen that the category will continue to pivot and why the brand will continue to invest in moving consumers into that space. How big it's going to be? I think eventually, it's going to be a large part of the brand, not only here in the U.S., but all over the world. We improved the formula. We moved the formula closer to the formula we have in Western Europe and some other parts of the world. It\u2019s more refreshing formula, is closer to our original flavor. And I think I mean, the initial results are very good. The consumer testing was excellent. We're going to be investing now in the Super Bowl that we continue throughout the year is going to be one of the pillars of growth of our CSD business in the US.\nHugh Johnston: And Bonnie just to give you a data point Pepsi Zero Sugar grew 26% volume in the fourth quarter so that business is really growing.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS. Your line is open.\nPeter Grom: Thanks, operator. And good morning, everyone. So I wanted to ask about the long-term organic revenue algorithm, 4% to 6%. And recognizing that a lot of the upside the past few years has been driven by pricing. But this is now the third straight year, you're excited to be at the high end or above the high end of the range. And I guess, as you take a step back and look at your performance and think about the path ahead, has anything changed in how you think about that target? You mentioned increased spending and driving the top line, do you have a higher degree of confidence that Pepsi can consistently be at the higher end of that range longer-term? So just like any perspective on whether you feel differently today about the building blocks of that algorithm versus maybe 2019, will be really helpful? Thanks.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, of course, we feel good about the return that we're getting on our investments that we've made both in our brands and you see the our A&M has gone up significantly since 2019 and the same with our CapEx, right? We've added a lot of capacity, a lot of go-to-market strength to our business. And we see the consumer reacting to that very positively. We've also invested a lot in quality and our brands, our products are better, are more consistent, are better tasting. So from that point of view, we're happy to the -- we're winning market share in many markets around the world. So yes, we're feeling good that we can be close to the top end of the -- of our long-term growth algorithm for the continuous future. Now obviously, the last two years, there's been a bit more pricing that would expect going forward long-term. But if you think about the mix of growth between developed and developing markets, I think we have tremendous opportunities for growth in developing markets. The per capita is still very, very good. And we have good playbooks to develop those per caps in a lot of those consumer bases. And we know how to grow developed markets as well. So you will see us continuing to invest in our brands, continue to invest in our go-to-market and what drives the top line, what makes consumers stay with our brands. And we'll guide every year to the particular circumstances of volume and pricing that we see for that particular year.\nHugh Johnston: And Peter, just as a reminder, both Ramon and I have said in the past that our goal is to be at the high end of that guidance. And also as a reminder, recall 5 years or so ago, our long-term guidance was 4% to 6%, but we were struggling to get to 4%. We were averaging somewhere in the low to mid-3s. So it's obviously a material acceleration where we've been as recently as 5 years ago.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nKevin Grundy: Great. Thanks, good morning everyone. And congratulations on the strong results this year. I would like an update on PBNA, please, on 2 fronts, Mountain Dew and then segment margins more broadly. So market share, nice to see Gatorade performing well, though the company's market share continues to slide here a bit in CSDs, most notably with one of your power brands in Mountain Dew. So Ramon, perhaps an update there on your investment plans behind Mountain Dew to try to turn around some of the share loss. And then just relatedly, how does the scope of your investment, not just in Dew, but broadly in PBNA, how does that impact your other key priority within that segment of restoring margins towards mid-teens? So thank you for that.\nRamon Laguarta: Thank you, Kevin. We feel good about or very good, actually, about the progress that PBNA is making in this triangle of growing the top line, improving the margins and keeping share. And that's the balance we're trying to strike every year as we go forward. Now there are things of the portfolio, we feel very good and things that we have to do work, things that we feel very good as you mentioned, all the sports nutrition category. Gatorade, obviously but Propel and some of the other brands are doing very, very well. That's a big area of investment. We're getting the returns. We feel very good about the Pepsi brand. Pepsi brand is growing well. Now we're investing behind Zero, as we discussed. We feel good about the coffee portfolio. Finally, we've gone beyond some of the supply chain challenges, and that Starbucks range is going to be very, very good for us. Already, we saw it in Q4. It's going to continue this year. We feel good about Energy. We feel good about Energy, the steps we're making to improve Rockstar, as I said, the coffee portfolio. And then the Celsius integration into our portfolio has gone very smoothly, and that brand has - keeps gaining market share behind our improved distribution, and I think the attractiveness of the product. So that is a very strong set of growth opportunities that we're going to continue to dial up in our investments and our execution and our customer plans, which are very strong for 2023. Now as you mentioned, an opportunity is Mountain Dew. Mountain Dew, we keep refining the positioning. We keep refining the product, and we're going to be investing. But this is just a small part of a very large portfolio, and there's a lot of positives in that portfolio. Now when you see the triangle, we're trying to improve the margins as well. As we said, we are not deviating from our long-term goal, actually, not so long-term goal to go to mid-teens with this business. You saw we're progressing in Q4. It was a good step forward, and that continues to be the plan for 2023 and beyond. So we're going to dial it up efficiency. We're going to dial up our investment behind the key brands. And we're improving our execution, which has been painful throughout the COVID and subsequent year, especially as labor market was very tight.\nHugh Johnston: And Kevin, just to add a few numbers to that. For the year, PBNA grew revenue 11%, which is obviously quite strong, and operating profit grew strongly as well. As Ramon mentioned, the mid-teens margin thesis is still very much intact and the drivers are still very much intact. For the year, we improved operating margins 43 basis points in the business. And in the fourth quarter, margins were up 110 basis points. So we're making good progress and good momentum on both fronts. Top line has obviously been terrific, and we're making good progress on the cost side as well, and I expect we'll continue to see improvement into 2023.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen. Your line is open.\nVivien Azer: Hi, thank you. Good morning. I was hoping that we could dive into the Frito-Lay margin expectations, please. Obviously, the top line has seriously benefited from very effective advertising, but we have seen a couple of years of margin compression there. So how should we think about that going forward, please? Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. Listen, the Frito business is the jewel of PepsiCo. And this business, we've put a lot of investments in the last couple of years and continues to respond every year better to those to those investments. Investments went into quality of product, investments wanting to increased advertising, broader portfolio of brands that we're supporting. Investments wanting to go to market, even some infrastructure bottlenecks that we had in our distribution systems. The truth is that we feel very good about this business growing very close to 18%, I think, in the -- for the full year. And the operating profit growth of Frito this year is in the double digits, which we haven't seen in like in the history almost. So we're feeling good about the balance of growth, top line, bottom line that we see in Frito. And as you can imagine, we will continue to invest in Frito-Lay in the coming years because that's the highest margin business in PepsiCo and the highest ROIC that we can have in our investment.\nHugh Johnston: Yes. And again, just to put a few numbers to the points Ramon was making. We have a Frito business with a 27% operating margin for the full year, which is a really wonderful operating margin, obviously. And when you have a margin that high, your goal should be grow that business as fast as you possibly can. We grew at 18% in the fourth quarter and 17% for the full year. This is Frito-Lay, 17% full year revenue growth. So look, obviously, you can't continue to see margins go down. But at the same time, with 11% dollar operating profit growth for Frito-Lay, that's terrific operating profit growth. That's an equation we're certainly happy with for the year. We feel like Frito had just an outstanding year. We'd love to have a couple more like this one here.\nRamon Laguarta: What we feel very strong is about the quality of our commercial execution in a broader sense from the way we're innovating to the way our brands are coming in front of consumers, both our large brands, right, Doritos, Lay's, Ruffles, Cheetos, but also the smaller brands, small portfolio there, we're building a beautiful small brands like Smart Foods or PopCorners or off the Eaten Path and some others that are completing that portfolio to compared to multiple occasions, different type of cohorts. And I think the team is doing a fantastic job.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nRobert Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. Just wanted to kind of circle back to Dara's first question and maybe if you could give us a little bit of sense. I mean the 6% sales growth, is there -- are you contemplating any volume in that? Or is it all -- you could almost be almost a rollover pricing from 2022. So just trying to get a little bit more granular on that. And then how does the -- in the U.S., how does the promotional environment look? Are you seeing any sense or any pull from retailers to do a little bit more promo? Thank you.\nHugh Johnston: Yes, Robert, it's Hugh. Let me try to take a shot at that. Look, obviously, 6% revenue growth in Consumer Products is still a very healthy growth rate, and we certainly feel good about that as the guide. Would we expect volumes to be down? Perhaps they'll be down a little bit. Let's see how the year plays out. Right now, the consumer is still quite good. But we also have to plan for multiple scenarios. And in the back half of the year, given interest rates are as high as they are, it wouldn't be shocking if there were a mild recession in the U.S. and in some of our developed markets. We've taken actions in terms of productivity to make sure in a recessionary environment, we're still well insulated to hit our numbers. But we've got to plan the business such that with interest rates as high as they are, you could certainly see some impact over time on the top line. So that's kind of the way that we're thinking about this one. And then let's see how the year plays out. If the year plays out better, then that's great. We'll invest back. And I think we'll -- everybody will be happy with that outcome.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. I think we've discussed in previous conversations. The way we do these processes, we have multiple scenarios of things that could happen actually the last few years, if we've learned something is that we should expect the unexpected. So all these scenarios, we feel good about delivering our guidance in any of those scenarios. Now the role of each one of our business unit leaders is to beat the plan. So that's how we're starting the year and how we will play the year.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC. Your line is open.\nNik Modi: Thank you. Good morning everyone. Two quick questions. First, Hugh, on China and just the re-opening. Just wanted to get your thoughts on how we should be thinking about some of the implications and if it's been kind of contemplated in your guidance. I mean, obviously, oil and gas pricing could -- is the obvious. But is there anything else we should be thinking about? And then Ramon, I wanted to ask kind of how perhaps you close things about various substrates within the Frito-Lay business. So you think about cauliflower rice, I mean, Frito-Lay dominates corn and potato. And just given long-term, consumers seem to be kind of adopting some of these new substrates. Just wanted to understand the plants PepsiCo has in terms of capacity build? Or if you don't think these substrates are actually going to be meaningful in the future? Thanks.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. I mean you mistake that. I'll cover the China consumer business well. I think, listen, China, obviously, we're seeing the consumer happy to be free kind of. And the consumer will obviously spend more. I think that's obvious. So there is an opportunity in reassessing the China demand and what it means for all the businesses in that country. So obviously, we have two meaningful businesses, snacks and beverages. And we'll -- I think we'll benefit from that increased demand. Will it change the PepsiCo growth? No, I think that it's an important market, but not to that extent. Now with regards to the Frito-Lay innovation portfolio beyond our potatoes, our corn or wheat, we have already large businesses in rice snacks, for example, you think about the Quaker snacks. We have a pretty sizable business that is in rice snacks and it's growing very fast. Within the Frito portfolio, there are also different substrates that we're playing. Off the Eaten Path is a great example. You have multigrains, then you have smaller substrates. One substrate that we like a lot is Chickpea. Chickpea has a high nutritional values, and it's I think it's a substrate that we are starting to work on agro, and we're starting to work on different layers to create advantage in that substrate. So yes, we see that strategically as an incremental opportunity to broaden our portfolio beyond the more traditional substrates where we build a lot of supply chain advantage and innovation advantage and brand advantage. But I think our brands can expand into other spaces, especially some of those smaller brands, but also we're thinking about some of our bigger brands as well.\nHugh Johnston: And Nick, just to put a finer point on Ramon's narrative around China. Well, it's strategically quite an important market for us, obviously, given the size and potential there. Currently, it's about 3% of PepsiCo's sales. So it's not going to be a major driver in the numbers for a few years.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Your line is open\nKaumil Gajrawala: Hi, guys good morning. Can you elaborate a bit more perhaps on the beverage alcohol strategy? It's been a bit of time now since you first kicked it off. And maybe the big question is you talked about Frito-Lay. You have several very large, very profitable businesses. This isn't yet one of them. But how big or how far does it have to get before it can be more relevant to the overall Pepsi story?\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. Listen, we see an opportunity in expanding our distribution capabilities to other spaces in the U.S. and maybe eventually in other parts of the world in beverages and also in snacks. So the alcohol distribution strategy that we have is one that is, I would say, embryonary in the way that both geographically and from the amount of brands that we carry in our portfolio. We are very focused in getting it right, in getting the learnings, getting the execution right, is different, right, and selling our soft drinks, our sport drinks or other brands. There are more nuances, regulatory-wise and execution-wise. So we're in that process of learning. I think strategically, you should see this becoming an important part of our business in the U.S. But we're going to learn before we scale up. And I wouldn't think about this as we're going to be an alcohol distributor. I think we're going to choose a few partners that will create brands with us and products, and we will be distributors of a small portfolio of high-potential brands rather than just a lot of brands in our distribution system, which will be too complex and probably little value for us.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nChristopher Carey: Hi, good morning. Hugh, I wanted to actually ask about just SG&A. Certainly, investment has been a key topic for the company as ever, but including this year and especially in Q4 with how the year ended. But I'm also looking at your filings this morning, which show that distribution costs have probably been the one line item where the SG&A increases have been most significant. Clearly, marketing is growing, but not as big of a contributor. And so I'm just trying to understand what's going on here specifically. Is this your being offensive with investments into your shipping and handling network? Is this natural inflation? Should this level of inflation on that line item specifically continue? Or as freight rates are starting to ease, should we start thinking about inflation here easing and perhaps you can start investing in other areas? So I'm really just trying to understand the complexion of spending here just being a little bit different than where I would have thought it'd come in. So any context would be very helpful? Thanks.\nHugh Johnston: Sure. Sure, Chris. Let me just share a couple of thoughts on that. Number one, just as a reminder, distribution is obviously highly variable with the volume and with revenue as well because we paid salesman on commissions. So that's obviously going to be a factor in the numbers. Number two, the costs that are embedded in there also include the cost of creating displays in the marketplace. And that's part of what we represent as investments. So whether it's coolers on the beverage side, either in convenience stores or front-end coolers and supermarkets or in mass merchants and the like, and also fountain equipment in the food service channels, where we're growing at a very healthy clip, is a part of all that as well. In addition to that, even on the food side, display racks and POS, all of those things that are really outsized contributors to growth that frankly, we've created a ton of win-win solutions with our customers on is part of what makes them continue to vote for us as the number one supplier in Cantor. Those investments are value-producing investments for both the customers and us. And so without getting into the granular details of how much exactly is in each of those buckets, I think a lot of what you're seeing is a reflection of the things that we're doing in the selling and distribution system to drive the kind of growth that we've been seeing.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. And to your question on Q4, yes, we decided to invest both in consumer, as you saw from our A&M growth in the quarter, and also as Hugh was saying, in making sure our installed equipment base in the market, and this is very relevant in the U.S. But also internationally, we continue to gain space, space being a key lever of for categories like ours that are input-based categories, space and it's a critical lever of performance in the marketplace, and it is a driver of share of market. So those two were there. We also invested in systems and some of the capabilities, especially digitalization capabilities that we thought we had a window of investment in Q4.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our last question comes from Gerald Pascarelli with Wedbush. Your line is open.\nGerald Pascarelli: Hi, good morning. Thanks very much for the question. Mine is actually on energy drinks. So now that the Celsius transition has been completed, I was just looking for some color around your market strategy for driving distribution for both Rockstar and Celsius in tandem. Are there any specific strategies or considerations around channel mix to be mindful of, in particular given how under-penetrated the Celsius products are at convenience? Any color you could provide on your strategy would be helpful? Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. Good question. And clearly, as we said, we have four pillars in the energy strategy. They all become an integrated portfolio as we execute in stores. So having this set of solutions with Rockstar, Celsius, Mountain Dew Energy and coffee gives us the opportunity to go to our customers and strategize with them new space opportunities that we didn't have in the past. So I think it's very positive for Celsius, and we're already seeing that. If you look at the Nielsen numbers or any distribution metrics that you want to check, distribution is improving. Displays are improving. The same with Rockstar. Rockstar was a brand that was very Western-based and some parts of the U.S., and now we're expanding to other parts of the U.S. So I think there is a lot of synergies in the point-of-sale execution as we have a portfolio that is catering to different cohorts, complements each other and gives our customers the opportunity to get better return on their space. So that's the strategy is working well. Clearly, Celsius is gaining market share. Rockstar is growing. As I said earlier, the Starbucks portfolio is growing very fast now that we have better supply chain opportunities. So I think we feel good about Energy. It's a category that is growing ahead of LRB again, and we need to play strong in that segment to be -- to gain share as we were planning to do, obviously, this year.\nRamon Laguarta: Great. I think this is the end of our conversation. So thank you very much for joining us in the conversation today. And especially thank you for the confidence that you've placed in PepsiCo with your investments. We wish you the best and hope you all stay safe and healthy. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Hugh Johnston",
            "content": "Hey Lauren, it's Hugh. I'll handle that one. It was really a couple of things that that drove it. Number one is obviously as you mentioned pre pandemic, interest rates were awfully low and prices were pretty high for a number of these assets. And as we've sort of moved forward, we've taken a hard look at the cash flows, sort of in a post pandemic world. Combine that with the fact that interest rates are obviously materially higher, so we're discounting those cash flows at a different rate. The couple that I'd point to, during the course of the year. Mabel in Brazil was one, Pioneer a little bit as well. And then SodaStream where, SodaStream is more of a consumer discretionary type of purchase compared to our -- the balance of our portfolio. And as you would expect, behaved more like a consumer discretionary purchase. So we took the opportunity to look at the numbers going forward on that, and the investment posture we were going to have in that business. And as a result, we wrote down a piece of that business as well. So I think we put ourselves in a spot now we're in a, in a higher interest rate world, we're in a better position in terms of where we've marked those assets to. Yes, I'll take care of that one Andrea. I have a couple of comments on that. Number one, obviously, inflation is still out there, as a factor for us partly the fact that inflation is still high, it's not as high as it was before. But then the numbers are still relatively high. Number two, in terms of the way that we were approaching the year, we're looking to drive a lot of productivity this year. And at the same time, we're looking to continue to put investments back into the business because we think that's what's driving the top line, and consumers are clearly responding positively to it. So if you net all of that out, my expectation is that our gross and operating margins will be at least in line with where we were in 2022. And perhaps a little bit better. Yes, happy to, Bryan. Let me start broad and then I'll sort of narrow it in. Very broadly, the capital allocation principles we have are no different than what we've had in the past, the four basics of make sure we invest in the business, pay the dividend, tuck in acquisitions and share repurchase. If I zero within a little bit more for the environment that we're in right now, with some of the changes, I think our biggest priorities right now we're going to be continuing to invest in the business and growing the dividend. And that's not a just a today's statement, although obviously 10% dividend growth is a pretty, pretty healthy growth in our current environment. But I think those are our bigger priorities, relative to perhaps tucking in there and relative to perhaps share repurchase. If the 10% dividend growth is bigger than what we've done in a number of years, and I think you'll see us prioritize that a bit more over time. So I'm sorry, and then the last piece is about working capital. Yes, the time -- we basically had a timing issue one that we're doing some IT implementations. And in terms of the IT implementations, essentially we paid for it about two weeks' worth of payables, just to take some pressure off the IT systems because we had some freezes at the beginning of the year. So that's what pulled that number down. That was probably worth about 500 or so million dollars right at the end of the year. It's not a material change in cash flow. It's a two week timing issue. So I think you'll see that bounce back as we get to the end of 2023. And Bonnie just to give you a data point Pepsi Zero Sugar grew 26% volume in the fourth quarter so that business is really growing. And Peter, just as a reminder, both Ramon and I have said in the past that our goal is to be at the high end of that guidance. And also as a reminder, recall 5 years or so ago, our long-term guidance was 4% to 6%, but we were struggling to get to 4%. We were averaging somewhere in the low to mid-3s. So it's obviously a material acceleration where we've been as recently as 5 years ago. And Kevin, just to add a few numbers to that. For the year, PBNA grew revenue 11%, which is obviously quite strong, and operating profit grew strongly as well. As Ramon mentioned, the mid-teens margin thesis is still very much intact and the drivers are still very much intact. For the year, we improved operating margins 43 basis points in the business. And in the fourth quarter, margins were up 110 basis points. So we're making good progress and good momentum on both fronts. Top line has obviously been terrific, and we're making good progress on the cost side as well, and I expect we'll continue to see improvement into 2023. Yes. And again, just to put a few numbers to the points Ramon was making. We have a Frito business with a 27% operating margin for the full year, which is a really wonderful operating margin, obviously. And when you have a margin that high, your goal should be grow that business as fast as you possibly can. We grew at 18% in the fourth quarter and 17% for the full year. This is Frito-Lay, 17% full year revenue growth. So look, obviously, you can't continue to see margins go down. But at the same time, with 11% dollar operating profit growth for Frito-Lay, that's terrific operating profit growth. That's an equation we're certainly happy with for the year. We feel like Frito had just an outstanding year. We'd love to have a couple more like this one here. Yes, Robert, it's Hugh. Let me try to take a shot at that. Look, obviously, 6% revenue growth in Consumer Products is still a very healthy growth rate, and we certainly feel good about that as the guide. Would we expect volumes to be down? Perhaps they'll be down a little bit. Let's see how the year plays out. Right now, the consumer is still quite good. But we also have to plan for multiple scenarios. And in the back half of the year, given interest rates are as high as they are, it wouldn't be shocking if there were a mild recession in the U.S. and in some of our developed markets.

But we've got to plan the business such that with interest rates as high as they are, you could certainly see some impact over time on the top line. So that's kind of the way that we're thinking about this one. And then let's see how the year plays out. If the year plays out better, then that's great. We'll invest back. And I think we'll -- everybody will be happy with that outcome. And Nick, just to put a finer point on Ramon's narrative around China. Well, it's strategically quite an important market for us, obviously, given the size and potential there. Currently, it's about 3% of PepsiCo's sales. So it's not going to be a major driver in the numbers for a few years. Sure. Sure, Chris. Let me just share a couple of thoughts on that. Number one, just as a reminder, distribution is obviously highly variable with the volume and with revenue as well because we paid salesman on commissions. So that's obviously going to be a factor in the numbers. Number two, the costs that are embedded in there also include the cost of creating displays in the marketplace.

            "name": "Ramon Laguarta",
            "content": "Good morning, Dara. Good morning, Dara, this is Ramon. Listen, the way, the way we feel about the consumer is based on employment data and wage growth around the world is positive. In our assumption for the year, we're thinking elasticities might get worse going into the second half of the year based on multiple scenarios that we have. Obviously, they are very changing. We just had some recent changes in some other in multiple parts of the world. But we're feeling that that might happen that there are worse elasticities in the second half of the year. And that's why we're guiding to a 6%. We feel comfortable with the way the business is going as you could see from Q4 a good momentum in our brands and good share momentum in many geographies around the world. But the key, the most important thing for you to think about is we're going to keep investing in the quality of our products. We're going to keep investing in the strength of our brands. We'll keep making our go-to-market systems stronger. So no matter what happens with the consumer, we're going to be I think preferred choice for a lot of the consumers and our customers. And that's how we are planning for next year. Yes, Lauren, strategically SodaStream continues to be a very central to the transformation of the beverage category. We've seen that there is a huge opportunity to enable consumers to personalize their drinks and have a type of consumption where there's no plastics and where there's a lot of convenience for consumers at home or in offices or even on the go. So it continues to be very central. Hugh was saying there was obviously a situation, especially in Europe, with inventories and the discretionary consumption that we took this opportunity to reassess the value of the asset. Yes, Bonnie. Yes, listen. Yes, Zero is, is clearly a segment of the beverage category that is growing much faster than kind of full sugar all over the world. And Pepsi Zero has - or Pepsi Max as we call it in some markets has been very strategic product for us in Europe, and in other parts of the world. In the U.S., we were investing in other parts of the Pepsi brand. Now, this is going to be the center of the strategy for the Pepsi brand. We think that the non-sugar segment of Colas will continue to grow very fast in this country. We're seeing consumers pivoting. I think the R&D in our company has done a great job in giving consumers Zero sugar choices that are as good as full sugar choices or better from the taste point of view. And we're asking consumers Zero sacrifice to pivot to Zero Sugar version. So that's the principle why we've seen that the category will continue to pivot and why the brand will continue to invest in moving consumers into that space. How big it's going to be? I think eventually, it's going to be a large part of the brand, not only here in the U.S., but all over the world. We improved the formula. We moved the formula closer to the formula we have in Western Europe and some other parts of the world. It's more refreshing formula, is closer to our original flavor. And I think I mean, the initial results are very good. The consumer testing was excellent. We're going to be investing now in the Super Bowl that we continue throughout the year is going to be one of the pillars of growth of our CSD business in the US. Yes, of course, we feel good about the return that we're getting on our investments that we've made both in our brands and you see the our A&M has gone up significantly since 2019 and the same with our CapEx, right? We've added a lot of capacity, a lot of go-to-market strength to our business. And we see the consumer reacting to that very positively. We've also invested a lot in quality and our brands, our products are better, are more consistent, are better tasting. So from that point of view, we're happy to the -- we're winning market share in many markets around the world. So yes, we're feeling good that we can be close to the top end of the -- of our long-term growth algorithm for the continuous future. Now obviously, the last two years, there's been a bit more pricing that would expect going forward long-term. But if you think about the mix of growth between developed and developing markets, I think we have tremendous opportunities for growth in developing markets. The per capita is still very, very good. And we have good playbooks to develop those per caps in a lot of those consumer bases. And we know how to grow developed markets as well. So you will see us continuing to invest in our brands, continue to invest in our go-to-market and what drives the top line, what makes consumers stay with our brands. And we'll guide every year to the particular circumstances of volume and pricing that we see for that particular year. Thank you, Kevin. We feel good about or very good, actually, about the progress that PBNA is making in this triangle of growing the top line, improving the margins and keeping share. And that's the balance we're trying to strike every year as we go forward. Now there are things of the portfolio, we feel very good and things that we have to do work, things that we feel very good as you mentioned, all the sports nutrition category. Gatorade, obviously but Propel and some of the other brands are doing very, very well. That's a big area of investment. We're getting the returns. We feel very good about the Pepsi brand. Pepsi brand is growing well. Now we're investing behind Zero, as we discussed. We feel good about the coffee portfolio. Finally, we've gone beyond some of the supply chain challenges, and that Starbucks range is going to be very, very good for us. Already, we saw it in Q4. It's going to continue this year. We feel good about Energy. We feel good about Energy, the steps we're making to improve Rockstar, as I said, the coffee portfolio. And then the Celsius integration into our portfolio has gone very smoothly, and that brand has - keeps gaining market share behind our improved distribution, and I think the attractiveness of the product. So that is a very strong set of growth opportunities that we're going to continue to dial up in our investments and our execution and our customer plans, which are very strong for 2023. Now as you mentioned, an opportunity is Mountain Dew. Mountain Dew, we keep refining the positioning. We keep refining the product, and we're going to be investing. But this is just a small part of a very large portfolio, and there's a lot of positives in that portfolio. Now when you see the triangle, we're trying to improve the margins as well. As we said, we are not deviating from our long-term goal, actually, not so long-term goal to go to mid-teens with this business. You saw we're progressing in Q4. It was a good step forward, and that continues to be the plan for 2023 and beyond. So we're going to dial it up efficiency. We're going to dial up our investment behind the key brands. And we're improving our execution, which has been painful throughout the COVID and subsequent year, especially as labor market was very tight. Yes. Listen, the Frito business is the jewel of PepsiCo. And this business, we've put a lot of investments in the last couple of years and continues to respond every year better to those to those investments. Investments went into quality of product, investments wanting to increased advertising, broader portfolio of brands that we're supporting. Investments wanting to go to market, even some infrastructure bottlenecks that we had in our distribution systems. The truth is that we feel very good about this business growing very close to 18%, I think, in the -- for the full year. And the operating profit growth of Frito this year is in the double digits, which we haven't seen in like in the history almost. So we're feeling good about the balance of growth, top line, bottom line that we see in Frito. And as you can imagine, we will continue to invest in Frito-Lay in the coming years because that's the highest margin business in PepsiCo and the highest ROIC that we can have in our investment. What we feel very strong is about the quality of our commercial execution in a broader sense from the way we're innovating to the way our brands are coming in front of consumers, both our large brands, right, Doritos, Lay's, Ruffles, Cheetos, but also the smaller brands, small portfolio there, we're building a beautiful small brands like Smart Foods or PopCorners or off the Eaten Path and some others that are completing that portfolio to compared to multiple occasions, different type of cohorts. And I think the team is doing a fantastic job. Yes. I think we've discussed in previous conversations. The way we do these processes, we have multiple scenarios of things that could happen actually the last few years, if we've learned something is that we should expect the unexpected. So all these scenarios, we feel good about delivering our guidance in any of those scenarios. Now the role of each one of our business unit leaders is to beat the plan. So that's how we're starting the year and how we will play the year. Yes. I mean you mistake that. I'll cover the China consumer business well. I think, listen, China, obviously, we're seeing the consumer happy to be free kind of. And the consumer will obviously spend more. I think that's obvious. So there is an opportunity in reassessing the China demand and what it means for all the businesses in that country. So obviously, we have two meaningful businesses, snacks and beverages. And we'll -- I think we'll benefit from that increased demand. Will it change the PepsiCo growth? No, I think that it's an important market, but not to that extent. Now with regards to the Frito-Lay innovation portfolio beyond our potatoes, our corn or wheat, we have already large businesses in rice snacks, for example, you think about the Quaker snacks. We have a pretty sizable business that is in rice snacks and it's growing very fast. Within the Frito portfolio, there are also different substrates that we're playing.

Chickpea has a high nutritional values, and it's I think it's a substrate that we are starting to work on agro, and we're starting to work on different layers to create advantage in that substrate. So yes, we see that strategically as an incremental opportunity to broaden our portfolio beyond the more traditional substrates where we build a lot of supply chain advantage and innovation advantage and brand advantage. But I think our brands can expand into other spaces, especially some of those smaller brands, but also we're thinking about some of our bigger brands as well. Yes. Listen, we see an opportunity in expanding our distribution capabilities to other spaces in the U.S. and maybe eventually in other parts of the world in beverages and also in snacks. So the alcohol distribution strategy that we have is one that is, I would say, embryonary in the way that both geographically and from the amount of brands that we carry in our portfolio. We are very focused in getting it right, in getting the learnings, getting the execution right, is different, right, and selling our soft drinks, our sport drinks or other brands. There are more nuances, regulatory-wise and execution-wise. So we're in that process of learning. I think strategically, you should see this becoming an important part of our business in the U.S. But we're going to learn before we scale up. And I wouldn't think about this as we're going to be an alcohol distributor. I think we're going to choose a few partners that will create brands with us and products, and we will be distributors of a small portfolio of high-potential brands rather than just a lot of brands in our distribution system, which will be too complex and probably little value for us. Yes. And to your question on Q4, yes, we decided to invest both in consumer, as you saw from our A&M growth in the quarter, and also as Hugh was saying, in making sure our installed equipment base in the market, and this is very relevant in the U.S. But also internationally, we continue to gain space, space being a key lever of for categories like ours that are input-based categories, space and it's a critical lever of performance in the marketplace, and it is a driver of share of market. So those two were there. We also invested in systems and some of the capabilities, especially digitalization capabilities that we thought we had a window of investment in Q4. Yes. Good question. And clearly, as we said, we have four pillars in the energy strategy. They all become an integrated portfolio as we execute in stores. So having this set of solutions with Rockstar, Celsius, Mountain Dew Energy and coffee gives us the opportunity to go to our customers and strategize with them new space opportunities that we didn't have in the past.

Rockstar was a brand that was very Western-based and some parts of the U.S., and now we're expanding to other parts of the U.S. So I think there is a lot of synergies in the point-of-sale execution as we have a portfolio that is catering to different cohorts, complements each other and gives our customers the opportunity to get better return on their space. So that's the strategy is working well. Clearly, Celsius is gaining market share. Rockstar is growing. As I said earlier, the Starbucks portfolio is growing very fast now that we have better supply chain opportunities. So I think we feel good about Energy. It's a category that is growing ahead of LRB again, and we need to play strong in that segment to be -- to gain share as we were planning to do, obviously, this year. Great. I think this is the end of our conversation. So thank you very much for joining us in the conversation today. And especially thank you for the confidence that you've placed in PepsiCo with your investments. We wish you the best and hope you all stay safe and healthy. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to PepsiCo's 2022 Third Quarter Earnings Question-and-Answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Ravi Pamnani, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Pamnani, you may begin.\nRavi Pamnani: Thank you, operator. I hope everyone has had a chance this morning to review our press release and prepared remarks both of which are available on our website. Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. We may make forward-looking statements on today's call, including about our business plans and our updated 2022 guidance. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties and only reflect our view as of today, October 12, 2022, and we are under no obligation to update. When discussing our results, we refer to non-GAAP measures, which exclude certain items from reported results. Please refer to our third quarter 2022 earnings release and our third quarter 2022 Form 10-Q available on pepsico.com for definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures and additional information regarding our results, including a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from forward-looking statements. Joining me today are PepsiCo's Chairman and CEO, Ramon Laguarta; and PepsiCo's Vice Chairman and CFO, Hugh Johnston. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question. And with that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your lines is open.\nAndrea Teixeira: Good morning and congrats on the results. I was hoping to get more clarity on both the price elasticity and the reinvestments you called out. We all appreciate that you're conservative but it seems that you're embedding a 7% organic growth for the fourth quarter. And given the high single-digit pricing, are you expecting volumes to be negative in the range of 2% or 3% against the 1% negative that you got in the Q3? And then if I may, I can, I want to ask a cash flow question.\nHugh Johnston: Yes. Andrea, it's Hugh. Obviously, we've seen elasticity continue to be strong and stronger than expected through three quarters of the year. So in terms of the math that you've done, the math is certainly accurate. And obviously, we are carefully watching what happens with the consumer. We obviously exited the third quarter with the consumer still very healthy in terms of our particular categories. I'm not sure that's true broadly with housing and other big ticket purchases. So, we'll see what elasticities look like in the fourth quarter, but I don't disagree with your math, what you said is accurate.\nAndrea Teixeira: If I can squeeze the -- sorry.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, this is Ramon. With regards to investments, the philosophy, we've been using in the last few years to continue to balance the short term and long term. I think it's realizing in good performance. We continue to invest in our brands. We're investing a lot in digitalizing the Company and some of the long-term sustainability bets that we're making as well. So, we continue with that, and next quarter will not be different than any of the other quarters that in the year. So, you should assume that we're looking at reinvesting in the next quarter and entering '23 with strength on the commercial side and on the investment side.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is open.\nLauren Lieberman: I was just struck again by the strength in the pricing particularly - everywhere, but particularly in Europe and how even though volumes are off holding on really well. So just curious knowing how much of that business is skewed towards Western Europe and if you could talk a little bit about revenue management versus straight list pricing. What you can tell us just to put a little bit more context and color around how that magnitude of pricing is being realized? Thanks.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. Europe, as you well say, has been impacted more than other parts of the world on the cost. And therefore, we've had to lean into revenue management, probably stronger than other regions in the business. The team has been investing in those capabilities for some time already. And it's been a combination of mix management and pure pricing across most of the geographies, East and West. We've had a good summer, which tends to drive more impulse sales and those channels have higher price per liter or price per kilo. So that is reflected in the pricing in Q3. And then also the teams have been courageous in some of the large banks and in home formats as well across what you call Western Europe. So a combination of visual pricing and some channel management. The truth is that our brands have the investment we've made in the brands in the last few years are paying off in the sense that our brands are being stretched to higher price points and consumers are following us in Europe and in other parts of the world as you saw with the volume to pricing realization in the U.S. or even other emerging markets.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nDara Mohsenian: So I was just hoping to get a bit of perspective on the sustainability of the organic sales growth we're seeing as you look out longer term, obviously, the second straight year of double-digit organic sales growth, so very robust levels, but there is some COVID recovery in beverages. There's excess pricing with limited demand elasticity. So just looking for some long-term perspective on, if you're incrementally positive to the mid-single-digit long-term trajectory after the last couple of years, and as you look at some of those key drivers of growth, which ones are more sustainable longer term? And then if I can slip the second part in, just a follow-up on Andrea's question. Have you seen anything in the business in September or October so far in Q4 that's different than generally the underlying momentum you saw in Q3 just given some worries about macros here, et cetera, and some short-term volatility? Thanks.\nHugh Johnston: Yes. Dara, it's Hugh. A couple of things, number one, you know our long-term guidance on revenue is four to six. And as Ramon and I have talked about in the past, we've always been pushing ourselves to how do we get to the upper end of the range on that on a more consistent basis. Given the combination of high pricing right now as well as relatively low elasticity, it's difficult to figure out exactly how that might project going forward. And that's sort of a long-term comment. I'm not going to give it to '23 on today's call as is our practice. We'll talk about that in February. But our aspiration remains the same, which is, we want to go and push hard on top line. We think it's great for the organization. We think it ultimately creates more value than any other strategy, but no change in terms of long-term guidance at this point. It's just been -- the times are just so interesting. It's hard to figure out what that projects forward into.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. I mean what I would say on top of what he was saying is that our categories seem to be growing faster than food and food is growing faster than non-food. I don't think that's going to change. We've seen, I think, affordable treats and small moments of pleasure continue to be a key need state, I think, consumers today and our categories play in that space. So that I think we should assume that, that will continue in spite of all the ups and downs, potentially economically around the world. The second element, I think it's fair to assume as well is that we are gaining share in many, many markets across our geographies, both in snacks and beverages. We should assume that given the investments we're making, the quality of brands and people that we have in a lot of the markets, we should assume that in the future, we will continue to gain share, at least that's our aspiration, and we try to continue to invest and get better every quarter in that respect. So when you compare to the average of food, you should assume we'll do better and hopefully will do better than our categories. Those are the variables that we look at every month as we assess our performance. And as you are saying, our long-term 4% to 6%, I think it remains valid. Clearly, a 16% quarter is an outstanding quarter, with a lot of pricing and we don't think that's a sustainable performance for the business. But obviously, we're aspiring to beat our long term as many quarters as possible.\nOperator: Our next question is Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nBonnie Herzog: Your top line growth in the quarter, as we've all been discussing, was very impressive, but it was fully driven by strong price realization. So I guess my question is on your market share. Could you give us a sense of how your share has been trending in both maybe your beverage and Frito-Lay businesses? And then I know a priority of yours is to improve your op margins in PBNA, especially. So maybe give us a sense of how you're going to balance market share growth with profitability growth going forward?\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. Bonnie, let me start with a share and then Hugh will top it out with the margin philosophy on PBNA. On share, we're seeing -- consistent with the trends that we saw last year and earlier this year, we've seen gains in, I would say, 70%, 75% of our markets in what we call, foods, convenient foods, salty snacks, and we're seeing about 70% gains in about -- in the beverage markets internationally. So that's -- basically, we're competing well across most of our geographies, emerging markets, developing markets and developed markets across both categories. In particular, to the U.S., as you mentioned, Frito-Lay is accelerating its share gains. Q3 was very strong. It was almost a couple of points of share gains in what we measure as savory market, both in value and also there was a share gains in volume, so both volume and value. When we look at the beverage business in the U.S., we held share in total LRB in the quarter. That's a good performance with very good performance in sports. So sports has been a priority category for us, the recovery of the Gatorade brand. We have invested a lot for the last couple of years. Our innovation is working. Our brand building is working. Our commercial execution is working and we gained meaningful share in the quarter, which makes us very happy, obviously, given the efforts the team has put in that brand. We're gaining share in teas. We're getting share in coffees. So, multiple categories where the business is performing very well, and we are losing share in CSDs. I would say Pepsi is doing quite well. Mountain Dew is a brand that we're working on to continue to gain share. But overall, we measure our performance as total LRB and total LRB share in the quarter was flat to the category as you saw double-digit growth, which is a pretty good performance for PBNA.\nHugh Johnston: Right. And I'll build on that, Bonnie. One of our goals clearly is to both gain share and to grow margins. And frankly, that's something that I think we can do. I don't view it as an either/or, I view it as an and. We ought to be able to do both. Obviously, we try to price through inflation and we always set that out as a goal. We were a little bit short of that in the quarter. Gross margins were down by about 20 basis points as I'm sure you've noted. But then we also focus on the balance of the cost structure, making sure that we're as efficient as we can possibly be and try and to eliminate waste wherever we can find it. We were successful on that in the third quarter as well. So, operating margins were up about 30 basis points. So our plan is to be able to do exactly that gain share ideally price through inflation. If we're a little bit short of that, we're going to continue to focus on driving the balance of the cost structure so that if the revenue growth does start to soften up a little bit, we'll still be in a position to deliver superior financial results. Regarding PBNA specifically and the margin goal that we've set out there of getting to mid-teens, that is still very, very much intact. That is absolutely the plan. So that's where we stand.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nKevin Grundy: Congratulations on the strong results. A question for Hugh on commodity inflation from here and you may be a little bit concerned. I know you don't want to give forward guidance, but we're starting to see key inputs soften here oil, resin, aluminum, among others, as you're well aware. Hoping to get your updated thoughts on your inflation outlook, anything you'd be willing to share with respect to hedge positions, preliminary outlook looking out to next year? And then your ability to continue to offset with pricing and cost and RGM tools. Is it fair to assume that kind of going forward, it will be a little bit more reliant on cost management, revenue growth management as opposed to pricing? Do you feel like you'd be maybe a little bit more constrained given the extent of the pricing that's been taken so far? So two-part question, any thoughts there would be helpful.\nHugh Johnston: Yes. Happy to try, Kevin, although I think it might have been four parts, not two, but we'll go with it anyway. Anyway, a couple of things, number one, commodity for this year, high teens is where we're going to land. That's not a change relative to what we've talked about in the past. In terms of hedge positions and forward buy, as we've discussed before, we tend to be out about six to nine months, and that's consistent with past practice. That's the way we're operating the commodity cycle. That clearly puts us somewhat into next year, but not anywhere near all the way through next year. As you've no doubt observed, some of the commodity inputs for us, although I'll remind you, our basket is pretty dispersed. There's not a single commodity that even accounts for 10% of the basket. But you've seen some softening in commodity prices that will play its way into our commodities going forward. And then regarding specific numbers for next year, I'm sure I won't surprise you by telling you, we'll talk about that in February for a couple of reasons. The biggest of which is we'll have more line of sight to be able to give you a better number and frankly, to give you something that you really can model and rely on. At this point, I think it's just a little bit too early for that. And in addition, it just takes us to a place where, frankly, we just wind up doing a lot of partial analysis, which I don't think is productive for you or for the Company. Regarding pricing, we increased prices at the beginning of the fourth quarter based on what we knew at that point. And going forward, with the investments that we've made in brands, I still think we're capable of taking whatever pricing we need.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nStephen Powers: Ramon, I wanted to ask on Gatorade and Fast Twitch. First, I'd love some -- just more detail around your expectations for that particular innovation in the role you see it playing in the Gatorade portfolio generally. But I guess, more broadly, I'm wondering, how you're thinking about the intersection of sports nutrition and the energy drink categories on a broad basis? How far you think Gatorade may be able to expand into what we've traditionally thought of as the energy drink end market? And where that ranks in terms of the priorities for future Gatorade investment?\nRamon Laguarta: Thank you, Steve. It's a very good question. And one that we're obviously spending a lot of time thinking about how far can we take at Gatorade, which is obviously a very strong franchise long with, I would say, high performance athletes much broader than that. What we're seeing is a lot of the innovation that we put under the brand in the last 1.5 years or so, 2 years is working very well, starting with Zero. Zero has been a great success for Gatorade. It's brought into the franchise a lot of labs consumers that have left the brand because of the sugar content, especially, I would say, people that just exercise regularly, but not at high performance level. That's one. Then we -- the two recent innovations, Gatorlyte and GFit also are working well for the brand, bringing incremental consumers or incremental occasions to the category. So, we're happy with the obviously core Gatorade but the three other new innovations. With regards to Fast Twitch, what we're seeing is that more and more athletes are drinking caffeine and then also hydration during the game or before the game or at the end of the game, so different parts of their exercise. So, we think there is a role for Gatorade to play in that space, providing some additional stimulant to the performance, but also providing the hydration in one single consumption. We've been told by the trainers and by other people that work with the athletes to go and help them. So this ring has been developed with the athletes, developed with the trainers with that occasion in mind. And we think that Gatorade plays very well. It has a lot of, I think, credibility to play in that space of hydration and caffeine for better performance. So we're launching it, as you know, with the NFL and we'll go full blast as of early next year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nRobert Ottenstein: Great. First question, just a follow-up on the pricing on Frito-Lay North America. If you could kind of give us a breakout between headline pricing, product mix and channel. And then my real question is, you're introducing a lot of additional complexity into the portfolio with different flavors and package sizes. Can you just talk a little bit about how you're looking at that from a supply chain side? Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, listen, as with any one of our businesses, we're looking at multiple ways to increase our revenue per kilo in this case with continuing to maintain the consumer in our brands and obviously gain share as we do that. So that's the strategy. We'll use multiple levers. So visual pricing, lower promotions, pushing for the formats where we have higher revenue per liter or per kilo, moving into channels, obviously, where we can price more because the consumer has different price expectations. All those tools are well integrated into our full commercial program. And that's the way Frito's doing it, but the same is being done in beverages North America or any of our international markets emerging or developing or developed. So that's a consistent capability we've been investing. We're becoming much more digital, becoming much more insightful and precise as a company. And that applies -- linking to your second question, that applies also to our supply chain. I think we're becoming much more integrated in our forecasting to demand forecast into supply and we're able to execute a certain level of higher complexity in our business. We're automating -- we're becoming better at execution in that respect. I would say we're not running a perfect company at this point, given all the challenges there is still in supply chain of ingredients and some of the transportation bottlenecks, but I would say we're able to cope with higher levels of complexity throughout the Frito-Lay given your question or any of the other organizations that we have around the world. However, I will say that we have very strict processes of portfolio optimization that are being run quarterly in each one of our businesses, so each one of the business goes through a pretty strict process of rationalization and elimination of unnecessary complexity regularly. So on the one side, we want to have more complexity because we know that consumers appreciate personalization and a lot of varieties is a key, I think, advantage for us in our categories. But at the same time, we go through rigid processes that eliminate unnecessary complexity and keep our cost down given supply chain but in any respect, given what it is to run a good business.\nOperator: Our next question is Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Can we talk just a bit more about cash flow? And with the year coming in better than expected, is there excess cash on the balance sheet or any thoughts around that? And then maybe in the same context, just maybe an update on what the M&A environment looks like at the moment, given we're going through a kind of a difficult period? I wonder if assets are more perhaps more interesting than they would have been before.\nHugh Johnston: Yes, I'm happy to jump in on that well, Kaumil. In terms of cash flow, you're right. We are performing well this year on cash flow and obviously, feel terrific about that. I wouldn't necessarily characterize it as excess cash. But certainly, we're coming from a relatively strong cash position. In addition to that, and you know our philosophy on how we manage the balance sheet. Well, we actually are very much fixed in terms of our debt rates and our average maturity now, I think, is about 12 years at this point. So the refinancing elements of what we need to do are relatively small. Our towers going forward are about $2.5 billion to $3 billion a year going forward. So we've got a lot of flexibility in terms of managing rising interest rates. In terms of where that might take us in the future, again, we'll talk about that in '23. Regarding M&A, no real change in our capital allocation policies broadly, M&A has obviously played something of a role in our past. We're still largely focus on tuck-ins where, frankly, we can value. But beyond that, it's really difficult to speculate on what might or might not happen certainly not setting any indications at all, but we've got anything on the horizon whatsoever. But we'll always be looking at things. We don't really pass in terms of taking a look at anything. But as you know, we rarely transact. So I don't expect any change at all in that regard.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nChris Carey: Can you just comment on the stickiness of pricing across CPG, there's been a growing debate about whether some of these price increases would need to be dealt back with either list price reversal of accelerated promotion? I suppose a lot it goes that it's such a typical commodity environment. And if the environment changes, they typically the other way during a recession or perhaps demand flows that price rollbacks are not entirely out of the question, even if they're not historically consistent practice. What are your thoughts on how the business might confront pricing versus promotion, especially in an environment of commodity deflation especially if demand starts to slow?\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, listen, I think this is a difficult question to answer. The environment clearly is still very inflationary with a lot of supply chain challenges across the industry and everybody trying to have responsible behaviors to maximize the value of its brands. So our philosophy is the same. We continue to invest in advertising and marketing, make sure that we have very strong innovation, very strong commercial plans. That's where we put the focus of our organization. We're trying to be growth drivers to our customers. I mean if you look at the majority of our conversation with our customers, center around growth and how do we develop our categories, continue to bring consumers into the category, continue to bring new occasions into the category, and that's the role I think we play to our customers and to the -- how we create value for the Company long term. So we'll continue with that focus, trying to create brands that can stand for higher value to consumers and consumers are willing to pay more for our brands. We'll continue with that philosophy. And we'll see where the cost environment goes in the coming years. Obviously, we're -- if anything that these last two years have taught us is that we want to become more agile and more nimble and more flexible, and that's what we're doing across the Company.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Peter Grom with UBS. Your line is open.\nPeter Grom: I hope you're doing well. So I wanted to ask about the Celsius distribution agreement. Maybe just to start, why was the structure of this partnership the right one for PepsiCo? And then I guess maybe any initial views on kind of how the transition to your distribution network is going? And maybe just last, if I can squeeze it in here, just bigger picture, I guess, like what have you learned from either your own brands? What happened with Bang that really gives you greater confidence in the success of this partnership looking ahead? Thanks.\nHugh Johnston: Sure. Happy to talk past that, Peter. First, the transition is going very well. We're, at this point, over 80% integrated Celsius into the PepsiCo system, and we think it's off to a terrific start, and I think you'd probably hear the same thing from the folks down at Celsius. We're excited about the business. We think it got a nicely differentiated proposition, and we're proud and happy to have it on our trucks and think it's going to be a great business for us. In terms of the structure, frankly, we looked at it and said, look, we'd like to do a distribution agreement, but we knew we were going to create some additional value for the Company and we felt like we should participate in that value. And we set up a structure that enabled us to do that. It doesn't take us any further than what you see right now and it puts us in a position where it's preferred. So, we'll either get paid based on the preferred or down the road at the relatively small position we have could convert at some point. So we felt like it was a good value-creating structure for PepsiCo. I wouldn't read anything more into it than that. And then more broadly, on the energy portfolio, our approach has been one of having a portfolio of brands. We like that approach because we think as the energy category starts to segment into different types of consumers and different types of need states. Having a portfolio approach will ultimately position us best to take advantage of that. Obviously, we're in a building position here, whether it's Rockstar or Mountain Dew Energy or what we're doing with Celsius or for that matter, even the Starbucks Coffee Energy business. But we now think we have three or four different ways to compete, to capture that consumer's business. So we like where we sit in that growth.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. I would -- Peter, I would endorse what he was saying. I think from the portfolio point of view, Celsius probably brings -- it's a better complement to the rest of brands or vectors of growth that we had in this category earlier. We feel good. I think it appeals to consumers that are different than what Rockstar would appeal to or what some of the Starbucks or obviously, some of the Gatorade consumers would appeal to. So I think we're in a better place to play in the broader category to continue to bring consumers to our franchise. And as Hugh said, the partnership is strong. We've learned also on the -- how to build stronger and more statistically aligned partnerships. And hopefully, this one, I'm sure it is going to be a much more durable and much more value creative for both companies. So, it's still too early, obviously. We only started October 1st, and it's 80% of the territories, but early signs are very positive, and the alignment and the commercial collaboration between the two companies is very strong. Okay. So I think the Q&A is over. So I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today and for, obviously, the confidence that you've placed in us with your investments. We hope that you guys all stay safe and healthy. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.",

So we've got a lot of flexibility in terms of managing rising interest rates. In terms of where that might take us in the future, again, we'll talk about that in '23. Regarding M&A, no real change in our capital allocation policies broadly, M&A has obviously played something of a role in our past. We're still largely focus on tuck-ins where, frankly, we can value. But beyond that, it's really difficult to speculate on what might or might not happen certainly not setting any indications at all, but we've got anything on the horizon whatsoever. But we'll always be looking at things. We don't really pass in terms of taking a look at anything. But as you know, we rarely transact. So I don't expect any change at all in that regard. Sure. Happy to talk past that, Peter. First, the transition is going very well. We're, at this point, over 80% integrated Celsius into the PepsiCo system, and we think it's off to a terrific start, and I think you'd probably hear the same thing from the folks down at Celsius. We're excited about the business. We think it got a nicely differentiated proposition, and we're proud and happy to have it on our trucks and think it's going to be a great business for us. In terms of the structure, frankly, we looked at it and said, look, we'd like to do a distribution agreement, but we knew we were going to create some additional value for the Company and we felt like we should participate in that value. And we set up a structure that enabled us to do that. It doesn't take us any further than what you see right now and it puts us in a position where it's preferred. So, we'll either get paid based on the preferred or down the road at the relatively small position we have could convert at some point. So we felt like it was a good value-creating structure for PepsiCo. I wouldn't read anything more into it than that. And then more broadly, on the energy portfolio, our approach has been one of having a portfolio of brands. We like that approach because we think as the energy category starts to segment into different types of consumers and different types of need states. Having a portfolio approach will ultimately position us best to take advantage of that. Obviously, we're in a building position here, whether it's Rockstar or Mountain Dew Energy or what we're doing with Celsius or for that matter, even the Starbucks Coffee Energy business. But we now think we have three or four different ways to compete, to capture that consumer's business. So we like where we sit in that growth."

            "name": "Ramon Laguarta",
            "content": "Yes, this is Ramon. With regards to investments, the philosophy, we've been using in the last few years to continue to balance the short term and long term. I think it's realizing in good performance. We continue to invest in our brands. We're investing a lot in digitalizing the Company and some of the long-term sustainability bets that we're making as well. So, we continue with that, and next quarter will not be different than any of the other quarters that in the year. So, you should assume that we're looking at reinvesting in the next quarter and entering '23 with strength on the commercial side and on the investment side. Yes. Europe, as you well say, has been impacted more than other parts of the world on the cost. And therefore, we've had to lean into revenue management, probably stronger than other regions in the business. The team has been investing in those capabilities for some time already. And it's been a combination of mix management and pure pricing across most of the geographies, East and West. We've had a good summer, which tends to drive more impulse sales and those channels have higher price per liter or price per kilo. So that is reflected in the pricing in Q3. And then also the teams have been courageous in some of the large banks and in home formats as well across what you call Western Europe. So a combination of visual pricing and some channel management. The truth is that our brands have the investment we've made in the brands in the last few years are paying off in the sense that our brands are being stretched to higher price points and consumers are following us in Europe and in other parts of the world as you saw with the volume to pricing realization in the U.S. or even other emerging markets. Yes. I mean what I would say on top of what he was saying is that our categories seem to be growing faster than food and food is growing faster than non-food. I don't think that's going to change. We've seen, I think, affordable treats and small moments of pleasure continue to be a key need state, I think, consumers today and our categories play in that space. So that I think we should assume that, that will continue in spite of all the ups and downs, potentially economically around the world. The second element, I think it's fair to assume as well is that we are gaining share in many, many markets across our geographies, both in snacks and beverages. We should assume that given the investments we're making, the quality of brands and people that we have in a lot of the markets, we should assume that in the future, we will continue to gain share, at least that's our aspiration, and we try to continue to invest and get better every quarter in that respect. So when you compare to the average of food, you should assume we'll do better and hopefully will do better than our categories. Those are the variables that we look at every month as we assess our performance. And as you are saying, our long-term 4% to 6%, I think it remains valid. Clearly, a 16% quarter is an outstanding quarter, with a lot of pricing and we don't think that's a sustainable performance for the business. But obviously, we're aspiring to beat our long term as many quarters as possible. Yes. Bonnie, let me start with a share and then Hugh will top it out with the margin philosophy on PBNA. On share, we're seeing -- consistent with the trends that we saw last year and earlier this year, we've seen gains in, I would say, 70%, 75% of our markets in what we call, foods, convenient foods, salty snacks, and we're seeing about 70% gains in about -- in the beverage markets internationally. So that's -- basically, we're competing well across most of our geographies, emerging markets, developing markets and developed markets across both categories. In particular, to the U.S., as you mentioned, Frito-Lay is accelerating its share gains. Q3 was very strong. It was almost a couple of points of share gains in what we measure as savory market, both in value and also there was a share gains in volume, so both volume and value. When we look at the beverage business in the U.S., we held share in total LRB in the quarter. That's a good performance with very good performance in sports. So sports has been a priority category for us, the recovery of the Gatorade brand. We have invested a lot for the last couple of years. Our innovation is working. Our brand building is working. Our commercial execution is working and we gained meaningful share in the quarter, which makes us very happy, obviously, given the efforts the team has put in that brand. We're gaining share in teas. We're getting share in coffees. So, multiple categories where the business is performing very well, and we are losing share in CSDs. I would say Pepsi is doing quite well. Mountain Dew is a brand that we're working on to continue to gain share. But overall, we measure our performance as total LRB and total LRB share in the quarter was flat to the category as you saw double-digit growth, which is a pretty good performance for PBNA. Thank you, Steve. It's a very good question. And one that we're obviously spending a lot of time thinking about how far can we take at Gatorade, which is obviously a very strong franchise long with, I would say, high performance athletes much broader than that. What we're seeing is a lot of the innovation that we put under the brand in the last 1.5 years or so, 2 years is working very well, starting with Zero. Zero has been a great success for Gatorade. It's brought into the franchise a lot of labs consumers that have left the brand because of the sugar content, especially, I would say, people that just exercise regularly, but not at high performance level. That's one. Then we -- the two recent innovations, Gatorlyte and GFit also are working well for the brand, bringing incremental consumers or incremental occasions to the category. So, we're happy with the obviously core Gatorade but the three other new innovations. With regards to Fast Twitch, what we're seeing is that more and more athletes are drinking caffeine and then also hydration during the game or before the game or at the end of the game, so different parts of their exercise. So, we think there is a role for Gatorade to play in that space, providing some additional stimulant to the performance, but also providing the hydration in one single consumption. We've been told by the trainers and by other people that work with the athletes to go and help them. So this ring has been developed with the athletes, developed with the trainers with that occasion in mind. And we think that Gatorade plays very well. It has a lot of, I think, credibility to play in that space of hydration and caffeine for better performance. So we're launching it, as you know, with the NFL and we'll go full blast as of early next year. Yes, listen, as with any one of our businesses, we're looking at multiple ways to increase our revenue per kilo in this case with continuing to maintain the consumer in our brands and obviously gain share as we do that. So that's the strategy. We'll use multiple levers. So visual pricing, lower promotions, pushing for the formats where we have higher revenue per liter or per kilo, moving into channels, obviously, where we can price more because the consumer has different price expectations. All those tools are well integrated into our full commercial program. And that's the way Frito's doing it, but the same is being done in beverages North America or any of our international markets emerging or developing or developed. So that's a consistent capability we've been investing. We're becoming much more digital, becoming much more insightful and precise as a company. And that applies -- linking to your second question, that applies also to our supply chain. I think we're becoming much more integrated in our forecasting to demand forecast into supply and we're able to execute a certain level of higher complexity in our business. We're automating -- we're becoming better at execution in that respect. I would say we're not running a perfect company at this point, given all the challenges there is still in supply chain of ingredients and some of the transportation bottlenecks, but I would say we're able to cope with higher levels of complexity throughout the Frito-Lay given your question or any of the other organizations that we have around the world. However, I will say that we have very strict processes of portfolio optimization that are being run quarterly in each one of our businesses, so each one of the business goes through a pretty strict process of rationalization and elimination of unnecessary complexity regularly. So on the one side, we want to have more complexity because we know that consumers appreciate personalization and a lot of varieties is a key, I think, advantage for us in our categories. But at the same time, we go through rigid processes that eliminate unnecessary complexity and keep our cost down given supply chain but in any respect, given what it is to run a good business. Yes, listen, I think this is a difficult question to answer. The environment clearly is still very inflationary with a lot of supply chain challenges across the industry and everybody trying to have responsible behaviors to maximize the value of its brands. So our philosophy is the same. We continue to invest in advertising and marketing, make sure that we have very strong innovation, very strong commercial plans. That's where we put the focus of our organization. We're trying to be growth drivers to our customers. I mean if you look at the majority of our conversation with our customers, center around growth and how do we develop our categories, continue to bring consumers into the category, continue to bring new occasions into the category, and that's the role I think we play to our customers and to the -- how we create value for the Company long term. So we'll continue with that focus, trying to create brands that can stand for higher value to consumers and consumers are willing to pay more for our brands. We'll continue with that philosophy. And we'll see where the cost environment goes in the coming years. Obviously, we're -- if anything that these last two years have taught us is that we want to become more agile and more nimble and more flexible, and that's what we're doing across the Company. Yes. I would -- Peter, I would endorse what he was saying. I think from the portfolio point of view, Celsius probably brings -- it's a better complement to the rest of brands or vectors of growth that we had in this category earlier. We feel good. I think it appeals to consumers that are different than what Rockstar would appeal to or what some of the Starbucks or obviously, some of the Gatorade consumers would appeal to. So I think we're in a better place to play in the broader category to continue to bring consumers to our franchise. And as Hugh said, the partnership is strong. We've learned also on the -- how to build stronger and more statistically aligned partnerships. And hopefully, this one, I'm sure it is going to be a much more durable and much more value creative for both companies. So, it's still too early, obviously. We only started October 1st, and it's 80% of the territories, but early signs are very positive, and the alignment and the commercial collaboration between the two companies is very strong. Okay. So I think the Q&A is over. So I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today and for, obviously, the confidence that you've placed in us with your investments. We hope that you guys all stay safe and healthy. Thank you very much."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to PepsiCo's 2022 Second Quarter Earnings Question-and-Answer Session. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Ravi Pamnani, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Pamnani, you may begin.\nRavi Pamnani: Thank you, operator. I hope everyone has had the chance this morning to review our press release and prepared remarks, both of which are available on our website. Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. We may make forward-looking statements on today's call, including about our business plans, updated 2022 organic revenue guidance and the potential impact of both the COVID-19 pandemic and the deadly conflict in Ukraine on our business. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties and only reflect our views as of today, July 12, 2022, and we are under no obligation to update. When discussing our results, we refer to non-GAAP measures, which exclude certain items from reported results. Please refer to our second quarter 2022 earnings release and second quarter 2022 Form 10-Q available on pepsico.com for definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures and additional information regarding our results, including a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from forward-looking statements. Joining me today are PepsiCo's Chairman and CEO, Ramon Laguarta; and PepsiCo's Vice Chairman and CFO, Hugh Johnston. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question. And with that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Such strong numbers across the board. But I was curious if we could talk a little bit about the convenience and gas channel in the U.S. I know that you've noted on one hand, consumers are making more frequent trips to get gas allows for more opportunities to go in and buy a snack or a drink. But on the other hand, they're spending a boatload of money to fill up their tank or to the degree they're filling it up, so the counter could be less extra money to spend when they go into the store. So I was just curious if you could talk about what it is that you're seeing currently? I know C&G has been an area of incremental investment for you in the last couple of months, particularly on the Frito side. And just an update on, I guess, yield from those investments and what you're seeing in terms of consumer purchasing behavior.\nRamon Laguarta: Lauren, yes, listen, these are important channels you're saying, and we've been investing in the U.S. and other parts of the world in this impulse channel. The trends are quite stable from what we've seen since Q4. And as the gasoline price went up, the consumption on beverages and snacks in that particular channel has been pretty stable. A bit less volume, a bit more price as we -- second quarter versus first quarter. But overall, sales has remained stable, high single digit, a bit of a difference between beverages and snacks. Snacks a bit higher than beverages, but stable. And that has continued into the last few weeks. So we don't see any meaningful consumer behavioral change as gas prices go up. Obviously, we're watching this channel very carefully as an indicator of potential consumer behavioral change. But so far, high incidents in our categories, yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian : I just want to talk a bit about pricing relative to costs. Obviously, another quarter of very exceptionally strong pricing in Q2. Ramon, are you hearing any pushback from the retailer trade that's different than normal? It's been a topic of discussion more in CPG in general. So just curious for your views on retailer pushback and ability to continue to take pricing going forward, including what that might mean for the fall. And then Hugh, can you just give us an update on the cost outlook for 2022? And given hedging, how much hedging do you have in place? Does that sort of create a hangover for '23? I know you won't guide for '23, but just how you think about the pricing versus cost gap for '23 based on where we stand today might be helpful at least conceptually.\nRamon Laguarta : Yes. Dara, yes, obviously, our past partners and ourselves, we're looking at consumers very carefully and the evolution of their decision when it comes to the overall basket or particular categories. So normally, we have pretty positive conversations with our partners, and we're looking at how do we continue to keep our consumers in our categories as we obviously have to pass some of these costs to the consumer, how do we do it in a way that doesn\u2019t impact volume, and it continues to generate growth for them and growth for us. And those are the type of conversations we're having. Obviously, we're all concerned in a way about the high inflation and how that's going to impact. Especially as we look at the full consumer universe, the lower part of the income pyramid, that's where we're all looking more carefully. And we're making decisions on entry point in the categories and how do we continue to have that particular consumer engaged in our categories. The conversations are always -- there's always tensions in those conversations. There will continue to be tensions. But in general, they're very positive conversations the ones we have because we play a role and that's our strategic intent to be growth drivers for our partners, and we go through these conversations very transparently and very positively to generate growth and additional margin for our customers. So that's the way the situation is and will continue the balance of the year and into -- as we start thinking about the plans for next year.\nHugh Johnston : Right. Dara, in terms of cost, as you know, our first focus whenever we're faced with inflation is to try to drive incremental productivity on our internal costs. And I think we've been doing a pretty good job of that. I mean we've seen this year some of the strongest productivity we've seen in a number of years. That puts us in a relatively better position when we're faced with commodity inflation because we're not necessarily forced to price it all through. We can take a more consumer-centric approach to dealing with the inflation and the subsequent pricing. Balance of the year inflation is higher than it is for the first half of the year. I think we've mentioned in the past, we're in the teens in terms of commodity inflation. That will continue, but a little bit higher in the back half. But we do expect stronger productivity in the back half as well. So I think from an overall cost outlook, our guidance certainly captures all of that, and I think it puts us in a position where we've got high confidence in delivering the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: So the market share gains you alluded to in PBNA and -- not PBNA, sorry, in snacks, and in general, we've been pretty positive. And I know it has been a narrative that there's some service level issues in both cases and especially in North America. I'm wondering if you can comment on that. And then separately on LatAm, and I think you mentioned Ramon and Hugh, in terms of like balancing what you just said, inflation getting worse. And of course, Latin America has been extremely resilient for a region that has obviously a lot of pressure on gas prices as well. So I wonder if you can comment on where the strength is coming from, if you're getting more space in the big box? Is it also Bodega Aurrer\u00e1 or Atacad\u00e3o or anything like that, that gives you comfort that you continue to gain share from a very organic basis and despite the pricing? And if you can comment again on the service levels in the U.S.\nRamon Laguarta : Great. Okay. Thank you, Andrea. I'll talk about share in a minute. But if you think about our role and you're referring to snacks in your questions mostly, but that you can apply these to beverages. Our #1 responsibility as a large player in both snacks and beverages is to make sure the category grows and continues to grow in any circumstance, either economic, positive economic or negative economic, high inflation, low inflation. That is our main responsibility because that's the health of the business really. So everything we're doing in our commercial plans in the U.S., outside of the U.S. is make sure that we have strong brand programs, channel programs, execution programs, innovation programs that continue to make our category preferred over other categories, and we're seeing that. And that's the main reason why when you see the growth that we're delivering and the low elasticities we're having in many countries around the world, that is the main reason. We're continuing to have very strong commercial programs that continue to attract consumers to our categories because of innovation, because of execution and great brand program. Now having said that, on the share front, we're also seeing gains across many countries around the world. That has been a consequence of the investments we've been making in the brands for now -- several years. We've strengthened our go-to-market capabilities, our digital capabilities. Our brands are looking more modern and more engaging for consumers. Our innovation is great. So I think those are the combinations. Your question on Latin America, we're seeing -- and I think it relates to the amount of transfers, money transfers that are coming from the U.S. into Latin America. We're seeing that number really high as a consequence of the high employment in the U.S. and the higher salaries. We're seeing that money being transferred to a lot of the economies in LatAm, and that's helping a lot of disposable income in those countries. And we're seeing, to our surprise really, from the beginning of the year, very low elasticity. It's actually positive elasticities even though, obviously, we're passing price to the consumer in those markets in intelligent ways and in ways that consumers will feel less pressure on. But I think disposable income in LatAm is above what it was in the past, a consequence of developed economies doing very well and money going into LatAm and the consumer is feeling good in Latin America. Also, post-COVID we're seeing behaviors of social expansion, if you want. So consumers coming out of the houses, consumers having more fun externally in LatAm and in many parts of the world. That tends to drive higher consumption of categories because people get together and have fun and we are part of fun experiences normally. So that's how we're seeing the trends in our categories.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane : All right. Maybe, Hugh, if you could just talk a little bit about maybe headwinds, tailwinds in the back half of the year. And I guess it's in the context of you raised organic sales guidance this morning, but kept the EPS basically the same. So is that a function of concerns about costs? I know you mentioned some of that in response to Dara's question, foreign exchange, just volatility in the world. Just kind of how you think about the -- maybe how some of the risks or headwinds, tailwinds might have evolved as you look into the second half?\nHugh Johnston : Yes. Bryan, obviously, the first thing that we're thinking about these days is just the level of volatility in the world. And we do what we can to insulate ourselves against that volatility. We have zero-floating rate debt. So we've insulated ourselves against that. We forward buy on commodities. We insulate ourselves against that. We try to do as much as we can to create a predictable work environment so that we have -- we can manage our labor costs well. But there's obviously macros that are out there that are more volatile than they were a few years ago. So as we sort of look at things, clearly, as I mentioned before, commodities is a bit higher in the back half than they are in the first half. That's incorporated into all of this. We're still watching elasticities closely as Ramon just mentioned. Elasticities are good right now. We don't plan for them to be as strong in the back half, and we'll see what happens with that. It's certainly hard to gauge because inflation is having so much impact on the consumer in so many ways. But as we looked at all of it, and we're making choices around -- okay, as you know, we have -- we like to give you numbers that are highly deliverable. The choice that we made was based on the things I just mentioned, that we would raise the revenue guidance because we felt highly confident in that. And for EPS guidance, we made a choice to hold right now based on some of the volatility and some of the variables that I had mentioned.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs.\nBonnie Herzog : All right. Just a quick follow-up on, Hugh, just what you were discussing. Could you talk about if you are also planning to sort of reinvest or step up reinvestments into your business despite the cost inflation that you just called out in the second half? And I'm thinking about in the context of your very strong top line. And then I did want to ask about your revenue growth management in this environment. And how strong you think your capabilities are to ensure you have the right packages in both your beverage and salty-snack business to ensure you have affordable offerings, especially as we could see increasing pressures on the consumer? And then could you touch on your beverage business and how your ownership of your bottling operations might actually be a competitive advantage or not as it relates to this.\nHugh Johnston : Okay. Thanks, Bonnie. I think that was 3 questions, but we'll take a shot at it, 3 for 1. Number one, in terms of investment in the back half, we have some investment in the back half. It was planned for. The way that we're collectively trying to run the company is to build sustainable results over a long period of time. And that means you're constantly balancing, delivering the near term while making sure that you're building capability for next year and the year after that and the year after that. So I think we have the right balance on that right now. And we'll see as the results come in whether we need to make adjustments to that. But we think we have the right balance to deliver the results this year and also make the investments to deliver the results for next year. On your second question regarding...\nRavi Pamnani: Consumer value proposition.\nHugh Johnston : Consumer value, yes, yes. Listen, I think we actually are best positioned than just about anybody in the industry to do that for a couple of reasons. One, our portfolio is so broad, anywhere from premium products like Frappuccino to value products like SANTITAS, and because our supply chain, our distribution network enables us to shape the inventory in store by store. So for stores that need more value products, we can weight the inventory in that store towards that. For stores that premium products are going to turn better, we obviously have the ability to adjust inventory. And the digital investments that we've been making in our route system actually make us even more and more capable of doing that. So I think compared to where we were 2 or 3 years ago, we're even sharper in terms of being able to deliver exactly the right inventory in store. As for ownership of the beverage business, as I've talked about many times in the past, I think it is a significant competitive advantage for us. It's obviously more capital intensive, but I think it enables us to do things that it's difficult for our competitors to do. So we think we are 100% on the right strategy by owning it. And I think this environment is going to prove that more than it ever has before. So hopefully, that answered one A, B and C in terms of your questions.\nRamon Laguarta : Yes. Especially Bonnie, I think on the second question, and the truth is that we've been investing on revenue management now for 4 or 5 years and has been in the developed markets but also in the developing markets to try to add to the to the old capabilities we had, which were more related to the ability to change product size or understand better the channels, to much more individual almost understanding of the consumer and what we can do to keep that consumer in our brand and different levels of pricing depending on obviously what that consumer prefers. That link to our precision execution, as Hugh referred to, both in developed markets, but also in developing markets as well, where we reach normally very capital distribution. That gives us, I think, a unique advantage end-to-end from consumer insights to point-of-sale execution that is quite -- it's hard to match in the industry. And we're seeing that. We're seeing that in -- across the world. So it's good investments that we're getting the return. And we're going to need more of it, obviously, as inflation keeps going up. And we're going to have to be super agile and very precise on the choices we make with the consumer.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC.\nNik Modi : Ramon, I was wondering now with the decision on the bank distribution rights out, can you just update us on the energy drink strategy here? And what kind of financial implications should we expect as we think about, I guess, questions for you in terms of the beverage business over the course of the year now that I'm not sure if the distribution stops right away. Or do you still have some time left on the contract if it expires at the end of 2022.\nRamon Laguarta : Yes, yes. Nik, listen, obviously, our commitment to the energy category remains as solid as it was earlier. We continue to see this category as one that is growing and evolving and where we can play in multiple ways to capture sub-segments that are starting to develop. The multi-approach that I've referred to in the past continues to be valid. So we're going to lead with Rockstar. And Rockstar, we're seeing several platforms in Rockstar there are starting to, again, hold, I would say, in non-sugar and some of the more functional beverages. So that's a big pillar. Second big pillar for us is our coffee business. Obviously, we're having double shot, triple shot and some additional innovation with Starbucks that it's clearly consumer preferred and continues to do very well. The third pillar is around our kind of flavor forward energy with Mountain Dew. And we're seeing Sports & Energy segment growing more and more in this category. And we have some big ideas on how some of our large brands can play in sports and energy in the future, surely the future. The distribution part has always been an additional opportunity. We have, as we were talking earlier, a very strong DSD system. And we can put brands in our business and provide unique distribution capillarity and execution. That's what we were intending with bank, relationship didn't start well from the beginning. Clearly, it was better to stop it because it has no long-term value for both of us. Now the financial implications are minor. It was never central to the energy strategy. And we continue to be open to other opportunities on distributing brands. That has always been a complementary part of the strategy. The big part of the strategy is, as I was saying, taking our brands and taking our innovation into new spaces and continue to disrupt this category, which is continuing to grow. The consumers like it. Consumers are looking for new benefits in that category. They're willing to pay reasonable prices, and that's not only the U.S. but it's internationally. And we see it as a big opportunity for PepsiCo today and into the future as well.\nHugh Johnston : Right. And Nik, as Ramon mentioned, financial impact, not material.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy : Great. Ramon, I wanted to pivot to your business venture with Boston Beer and Hard Mountain Dew. Maybe just provide an update there, how that relationship has progressed since the partnership was announced, your early learnings to date. And importantly, as you spend more time studying the alcohol space, maybe you can offer some updated thoughts on your broader ambitions to play a bigger role there, not only new product innovation, but also the potential to distribute non-PepsiCo products through your distribution.\nRamon Laguarta : Yes. Nothing has changed from the previous quarter when we talked about this topic as well. We've learned more. And we are probably more convinced of the potential of, as you were referring to, the Boston Beer partnership. I think we have great product that they have developed. We've licensed the brand to Boston Beer, and we're providing distribution in some states. Execution is very good. The product is turning very well, high share in those states. So it makes us feel positive about the potential of Hard Mountain Dew and the relationship with Boston Beer. They are great partners, and they have strong R&D capabilities and branding capabilities as they own the Hard Mountain Dew brand. Now going forward, obviously, we get encouraged by this, and we're working in multiple new innovations that will come to the market shortly. And from the distribution point of view, the same, as I said, with energy, we want to leverage our assets for distribution. We think in alcohol, we can bring new brands to the market. We don't want to be distributing a lot of brands. That's not our intention to have many, many brands and a very complex set of brands in our distribution. We'd rather focus on a few large consumer opportunities and put them through what is a very powerful DSD system. So that is the way we're thinking about our alcohol distribution, not a lot of brands, not distributing beer or anything like that, but just a few large consumer ideas that we can bring to the market our system, which we think is an advantaged execution machine. And that's what we're proving with Hard Mountain Dew.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen.\nVivien Azer : I was hoping to dive into consumer preferences, please. You guys have been consistent in calling out your aspirations to drive portfolio mix shift over the long term to reduce fat, reduce sodium, lower sugar proposition. But as I think back over the last 2.5 years, it seems like at the start of the pandemic, consumers were understandably really leaning into indulgent. So I'm curious whether you've seen any mean reversion in consumer preferences around health and wellness propositions within your portfolio?\nRamon Laguarta : Yes. Vivien, I'll give you a few data so that helps you with the diagnostic. In beverages, non-sugar is growing 3 times the speed of full sugar. So that gives you a sense of how consumers are, in the U.S., are choosing with the choices. If you go more developed markets around the world like Western Europe, the categories are pivoting very quickly to non-sugar. In the UK, for example, the non-sugar segment in beverages is already almost above 80% of the market. So clearly, in beverages, non-sugar is king. You see some of our innovations in the last couple of years with, for example, Gatorade Zero. That was -- it's a huge innovation. I think it's $1.5 billion in only 3 years and expansive to the category and recruiting new consumers into the brand. So non-sugar, I think, is unstoppable trend in the beverage category, something we're leaning in with our R&D, something we're leading in with our commercial strategy with the customers. Every brand has a non-sugar leg that is going to be the focus leg for the brand in the foreseeable future. So that is in beverages. Obviously, you see other trends like functionality, consumers looking for additional functionality and willing to pay for that. But your question was more about health, sugar clearly being a dimension. Now in snacks, I think consumers are also voting with their money. So permissible snacks, what we call permissible snacks, which are the kind of baked or popped or kind of not fried snacks, they're growing much faster than fried snacks, so that we see that as well in that category. We're seeing kind of more nutritious substrates growing faster than some of the more cereal-based substrates. But 1 trend we're seeing across is portion control. So a portion control is a huge consumer idea how we're eliminating some of the brakes, if you want, in consumers' mind to have higher frequency in our categories is portion control. We're seeing in snacks a huge growth on small format, multipacks or not only it's portion control but variety. And we're seeing that also in beverages where full sugar products are going to smaller portions, right, like mini cans or some other formats that give the consumer little pleasure for -- without a lot of calories. So I would continue to bet long term on health being one of the vectors that consumers are choosing. There's also indulgent. Obviously, there's also functionality. There's also a social moment. There's a lot of vectors in our categories, And that's the beauty of our categories. They attract a lot of consumers because of the multiple occasions. But I will continue to bet on health being one of the vectors of choice for the consumer. And that's part of our innovation strategy and how we're trying to move the categories long term. And it's part of the success, if you think about the sodium reduction, the fat transformation, the sugar reduction in our products, a lot of the R&D investments we've been putting in the company in the last many years are starting to pay back in we're giving the consumer the option to make choices with no trade-offs in taste or any of the other key category choices here.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Powers with Deutsche Bank.\nStephen Powers : Maybe going back to the higher top line that you're now seeing for the year. Could you maybe expand a bit more on that and talk about the incremental changes that have taken shape in your own expectations since last quarter? I guess would you frame the 2 points of organic growth upside more as volume or price/mix driven versus prior expectations? And maybe would you call any particular segments as more or less responsible, that would be helpful. And I know I'm only allowed 1 question. But Hugh, if I could, just going back to Brian's question on second half cost. I wasn't fully clear on the answer, whether the maintained EPS in light of the better top line was really more conservatism in the face of volatility or if there were known pockets of higher costs you're now facing? And if it's the latter, if you could just be a little bit more specific there.\nHugh Johnston : Yes. Why don't I handle that piece first? And maybe Ramon and I can tag team your first question. The latter piece, as you know, Steve, we're never conservative. We try to be accurate here. That said, we also try not to miss numbers. So I think there is nothing new that we weren't aware of, frankly, a couple of months ago. So I don't think there's any incremental information that would cause us to be concerned about the back half. Regarding your question around why is the revenue number higher, I think that the primary reason is given the unknowns around consumer elasticity, as we came out of the first quarter, we were quite pleased with where elasticity sat. But we still had 9 months left in the year, so we adopted a certain posture about the balance of the year. The second quarter is also held up from an elasticity perspective better than we thought, and we're sort of flowing that upside through. That said, the balance of the year, we still have 6 months to go. There's still plenty of unknowns in terms of what's going to happen with consumer behavior. We think we're well positioned, both from a customer perspective as well as from a consumer perspective. But we still have 6 months to go and consumers are still sort of absorbing the impact on inflation on their overall spending. So I think -- I wouldn't characterize it as conservatism. I think we go through a lot of scenario planning. And the sum of those scenarios led us to choose higher on revenue but not yet higher on EPS.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse.\nKaumil Gajrawala : You've made a business decision, I guess, some years ago to own and retain the bottlers that you purchased, I guess, maybe 10-ish years ago. But if we are indeed in a very different inflationary environment, does that change how you think about how asset-light or asset-heavy you prefer the business to be?\nRamon Laguarta : Yes. Kaumil, this is Ramon. No, listen, inflation will come and go. And the reason why we're keeping the bottling business integrated with the brand business is much more longer term than the, I don't know, the economic cycle that will leave for the next couple of years. It's a huge strategic decision that is more based on -- if you think about the consumer evolution and the shopper evolution and the way channels will evolve in the future, I think having an integrated brand to consumer value chain will give us flexibility and faster decision-making that we believe creates a lot of value for the company, right? In the short term, yes, we'll have inflation in S&D and we'll have inflation in some of the manufacturing. But if you have a bottling system, that inflation happens anyhow. So your system still has that inflation. It's not like nobody is isolated from inflationary pressures. I mean your system consumer to kind of manufacturing to consumers still has that inflation. So we think, again, this is a very strategic decision we've made, thinking about the long term where consumer is going, where the shopper is going, where the retailers are going. We're going to fulfill demand in the future and where demand will be in the future, much more complex, much more long tail. There's a lot of things that we feel that we're going to be best positioned in the future. And we're talking about 5, 10 years from now to fulfill that demand in a much more integrated way from the brand to the consumer with all the value chain under one decision-making point. Again, the economic cycles will differ. Now we'll have inflation. Maybe 3 years from now, we'll have deflation and we'll be -- so we're not thinking that short term for what is a huge business model decision.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge.\nBrett Cooper : From the data that we can see, your top line is benefiting by about 100 basis points from reductions in promotional depth and breadth. And that's not just short term. We've seen it over the last several years. And we can obviously see part of your business. So I was hoping that you could speak to the benefits from promotional optimization across your business. What's enabling that realization? And then given the enormous size of promotional spend in your business, what the potential is for promotional optimization over the medium term?\nRamon Laguarta : Yes. It's great question. And if you think about that we're looking at all the costs in the company, the cost to fulfill demand, the cost to generate demand, we're looking at higher return on investment across all the costs that we have in the business. Obviously, the one you're referring to along with our marketing investments are the 2 big demand creation budget. We're looking at optimizing those investments both on the consumer side and on the consumer customer side. And that has been a journey. It has been done through much more intelligence, through much more data, much better precision decisions in that space, along with our customers. And that is a journey that I would see as a continuous journey to optimize all the budgets that we have in the company to maximize returns. So trade budget, as you say, is a large budget. We're going to continue to optimize it and maybe move those resources to some other areas where we can get better demand generation, right? And we'll do that in partnership with our customers and to the spirit of creating growth for the category as we've had in the past, yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo.\nChristopher Carey : So just a couple of questions on some of these more topical markets. I guess just in Europe, if anywhere, this is where elasticity seems to be playing out. Are we finally seeing the consumer coming down a bit here? As pricing has built, are there other factors in play beginning to impact volumes, whether supply chain, product availability, basically anything else besides pure consumer elasticity? And then just in China, despite lockdown, still another strong number. Can you maybe just give us a sense of what's going on, on the ground in China to continue to deliver this level of growth?\nRamon Laguarta : Yes. Good. Listen, Europe, obviously, has been impacted by -- more than other parts of the world by, I would say, the war, so our business has been impacted both in Ukraine and Russia. Ukraine, because obviously, we had to stop a lot of our manufacturing and commercial activities as reflected in our performance in Europe. And also in Russia, given the commitments we made to stop our beverage, some of our beverage, large brands and also stop advertising and promotion of our more essential food brands. So clearly, that's part of the reason why the European business has been impacted. With regards to China, clearly, the lockdowns are impacting the operation of the business. So our team has been incredibly agile to make the right pivots in how we are continuing to produce our snacks or our beverages. And we've been able to more or less manage that in what is an incredibly challenged situation to get raw materials and to get products out to consumers. We're doing that probably better than other companies, and that's why we're gaining share dramatically. That's the reason why our business is growing very fast. Now if you think about the beverage business, there has been an impact to the consumption of the beverage business in away from home. So as consumers have obviously stayed more at home, there has been an impact in the last few months in that particular channel, not so much in the foods business. We're seeing both our Quaker business and our snack business continue to grow very fast. A bit less on the beverage side of the business, basically because of the away-from-home impact. In-home consumption of beverages continues to be quite strong.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Peter Grom with UBS.\nPeter Grom: So I was hoping to follow up on Nik's question around the energy portfolio. So Ramon, you mentioned the willingness to leverage your distribution assets. But I would be curious if there are any major takeaways from the relationship with them that kind of informed your view on how you think about these agreements moving forward. And then just any thoughts around timing, I guess. Is it a near-term focus to kind of find a new brand to fill that void? Or is this something you think about opportunistically over time?\nRamon Laguarta : Yes. Listen, Peter, I think, as I said, the distribution part of the energy strategy is very marginal in one way or another. It's not the core part of the strategy. We continue to lean into our brands. We have very strong brands in our portfolio that I think as we see the category evolving, we're going to be able to play in those new spaces and capture market share looking forward and where the consumer is going. So again, I'll repeat, in Rockstar and some parts of Rockstar where we're seeing a lot of consumer pool, especially non-sugar and some of the more functional Starbucks coffee forward, flavor forward with Mountain Dew. And as I said, we see sports and energy is a big space where we can capture with some of our large brands in that space and innovation will be coming into the market soon. Those are the main -- you think about our strategy and we might evolve that strategy with new spaces and how our brands can go there, that's our core of the strategy. Then leveraging our assets for distribution is marginal. To your question on bank, you need to have good long-term partnership for the relationship to work. That didn't exist, so we're turning the page.\nRamon Laguarta : Last question, right? So thank you, everyone, for joining us today. And I know it's summer and everybody has a lot of things to do. And then obviously, for the confidence that you're all placing with your investment in PepsiCo. We hope that you guys are safe and healthy and enjoy the summer.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Hugh Johnston",
            "content": "Right. Dara, in terms of cost, as you know, our first focus whenever we're faced with inflation is to try to drive incremental productivity on our internal costs. And I think we've been doing a pretty good job of that. I mean we've seen this year some of the strongest productivity we've seen in a number of years. That puts us in a relatively better position when we're faced with commodity inflation because we're not necessarily forced to price it all through. We can take a more consumer-centric approach to dealing with the inflation and the subsequent pricing. Balance of the year inflation is higher than it is for the first half of the year. I think we've mentioned in the past, we're in the teens in terms of commodity inflation. That will continue, but a little bit higher in the back half. But we do expect stronger productivity in the back half as well. So I think from an overall cost outlook, our guidance certainly captures all of that, and I think it puts us in a position where we've got high confidence in delivering the year. Yes. Bryan, obviously, the first thing that we're thinking about these days is just the level of volatility in the world. And we do what we can to insulate ourselves against that volatility. We have zero-floating rate debt. So we've insulated ourselves against that. We forward buy on commodities. We insulate ourselves against that. We try to do as much as we can to create a predictable work environment so that we have -- we can manage our labor costs well. But there's obviously macros that are out there that are more volatile than they were a few years ago. So as we sort of look at things, clearly, as I mentioned before, commodities is a bit higher in the back half than they are in the first half. That's incorporated into all of this. We're still watching elasticities closely as Ramon just mentioned. Elasticities are good right now. We don't plan for them to be as strong in the back half, and we'll see what happens with that. It's certainly hard to gauge because inflation is having so much impact on the consumer in so many ways. But as we looked at all of it, and we're making choices around -- okay, as you know, we have -- we like to give you numbers that are highly deliverable. The choice that we made was based on the things I just mentioned, that we would raise the revenue guidance because we felt highly confident in that. And for EPS guidance, we made a choice to hold right now based on some of the volatility and some of the variables that I had mentioned. Okay. Thanks, Bonnie. I think that was 3 questions, but we'll take a shot at it, 3 for 1. Number one, in terms of investment in the back half, we have some investment in the back half. It was planned for. The way that we're collectively trying to run the company is to build sustainable results over a long period of time. And that means you're constantly balancing, delivering the near term while making sure that you're building capability for next year and the year after that and the year after that. So I think we have the right balance on that right now. And we'll see as the results come in whether we need to make adjustments to that. But we think we have the right balance to deliver the results this year and also make the investments to deliver the results for next year. On your second question regarding... Consumer value, yes, yes. Listen, I think we actually are best positioned than just about anybody in the industry to do that for a couple of reasons. One, our portfolio is so broad, anywhere from premium products like Frappuccino to value products like SANTITAS, and because our supply chain, our distribution network enables us to shape the inventory in store by store. So for stores that need more value products, we can weight the inventory in that store towards that. For stores that premium products are going to turn better, we obviously have the ability to adjust inventory. And the digital investments that we've been making in our route system actually make us even more and more capable of doing that. So I think compared to where we were 2 or 3 years ago, we're even sharper in terms of being able to deliver exactly the right inventory in store. As for ownership of the beverage business, as I've talked about many times in the past, I think it is a significant competitive advantage for us. It's obviously more capital intensive, but I think it enables us to do things that it's difficult for our competitors to do. So we think we are 100% on the right strategy by owning it. And I think this environment is going to prove that more than it ever has before. So hopefully, that answered one A, B and C in terms of your questions. Right. And Nik, as Ramon mentioned, financial impact, not material. Yes. Why don't I handle that piece first? And maybe Ramon and I can tag team your first question. The latter piece, as you know, Steve, we're never conservative. We try to be accurate here. That said, we also try not to miss numbers. So I think there is nothing new that we weren't aware of, frankly, a couple of months ago. So I don't think there's any incremental information that would cause us to be concerned about the back half. Regarding your question around why is the revenue number higher, I think that the primary reason is given the unknowns around consumer elasticity, as we came out of the first quarter, we were quite pleased with where elasticity sat. But we still had 9 months left in the year, so we adopted a certain posture about the balance of the year. The second quarter is also held up from an elasticity perspective better than we thought, and we're sort of flowing that upside through. That said, the balance of the year, we still have 6 months to go. There's still plenty of unknowns in terms of what's going to happen with consumer behavior. We think we're well positioned, both from a customer perspective as well as from a consumer perspective. But we still have 6 months to go and consumers are still sort of absorbing the impact on inflation on their overall spending. So I think -- I wouldn't characterize it as conservatism. I think we go through a lot of scenario planning. And the sum of those scenarios led us to choose higher on revenue but not yet higher on EPS."

            "name": "Ramon Laguarta",
            "content": "Lauren, yes, listen, these are important channels you're saying, and we've been investing in the U.S. and other parts of the world in this impulse channel. The trends are quite stable from what we've seen since Q4. And as the gasoline price went up, the consumption on beverages and snacks in that particular channel has been pretty stable. A bit less volume, a bit more price as we -- second quarter versus first quarter. But overall, sales has remained stable, high single digit, a bit of a difference between beverages and snacks. Snacks a bit higher than beverages, but stable. And that has continued into the last few weeks. So we don't see any meaningful consumer behavioral change as gas prices go up. Obviously, we're watching this channel very carefully as an indicator of potential consumer behavioral change. But so far, high incidents in our categories, yes. Yes. Dara, yes, obviously, our past partners and ourselves, we're looking at consumers very carefully and the evolution of their decision when it comes to the overall basket or particular categories. So normally, we have pretty positive conversations with our partners, and we're looking at how do we continue to keep our consumers in our categories as we obviously have to pass some of these costs to the consumer, how do we do it in a way that doesn't impact volume, and it continues to generate growth for them and growth for us. And those are the type of conversations we're having. Obviously, we're all concerned in a way about the high inflation and how that's going to impact. Especially as we look at the full consumer universe, the lower part of the income pyramid, that's where we're all looking more carefully. And we're making decisions on entry point in the categories and how do we continue to have that particular consumer engaged in our categories. The conversations are always -- there's always tensions in those conversations. There will continue to be tensions. But in general, they're very positive conversations the ones we have because we play a role and that's our strategic intent to be growth drivers for our partners, and we go through these conversations very transparently and very positively to generate growth and additional margin for our customers. So that's the way the situation is and will continue the balance of the year and into -- as we start thinking about the plans for next year. Great. Okay. Thank you, Andrea. I'll talk about share in a minute. But if you think about our role and you're referring to snacks in your questions mostly, but that you can apply these to beverages. Our #1 responsibility as a large player in both snacks and beverages is to make sure the category grows and continues to grow in any circumstance, either economic, positive economic or negative economic, high inflation, low inflation. That is our main responsibility because that's the health of the business really. So everything we're doing in our commercial plans in the U.S., outside of the U.S. is make sure that we have strong brand programs, channel programs, execution programs, innovation programs that continue to make our category preferred over other categories, and we're seeing that. And that's the main reason why when you see the growth that we're delivering and the low elasticities we're having in many countries around the world, that is the main reason. We're continuing to have very strong commercial programs that continue to attract consumers to our categories because of innovation, because of execution and great brand program. Now having said that, on the share front, we're also seeing gains across many countries around the world. That has been a consequence of the investments we've been making in the brands for now -- several years. We've strengthened our go-to-market capabilities, our digital capabilities. Our brands are looking more modern and more engaging for consumers. Our innovation is great. So I think those are the combinations. Your question on Latin America, we're seeing -- and I think it relates to the amount of transfers, money transfers that are coming from the U.S. into Latin America. We're seeing that number really high as a consequence of the high employment in the U.S. and the higher salaries. We're seeing that money being transferred to a lot of the economies in LatAm, and that's helping a lot of disposable income in those countries. And we're seeing, to our surprise really, from the beginning of the year, very low elasticity. It's actually positive elasticities even though, obviously, we're passing price to the consumer in those markets in intelligent ways and in ways that consumers will feel less pressure on. But I think disposable income in LatAm is above what it was in the past, a consequence of developed economies doing very well and money going into LatAm and the consumer is feeling good in Latin America. Also, post-COVID we're seeing behaviors of social expansion, if you want. So consumers coming out of the houses, consumers having more fun externally in LatAm and in many parts of the world. That tends to drive higher consumption of categories because people get together and have fun and we are part of fun experiences normally. So that's how we're seeing the trends in our categories. Yes. Especially Bonnie, I think on the second question, and the truth is that we've been investing on revenue management now for 4 or 5 years and has been in the developed markets but also in the developing markets to try to add to the to the old capabilities we had, which were more related to the ability to change product size or understand better the channels, to much more individual almost understanding of the consumer and what we can do to keep that consumer in our brand and different levels of pricing depending on obviously what that consumer prefers. That link to our precision execution, as Hugh referred to, both in developed markets, but also in developing markets as well, where we reach normally very capital distribution. That gives us, I think, a unique advantage end-to-end from consumer insights to point-of-sale execution that is quite -- it's hard to match in the industry. And we're seeing that. We're seeing that in -- across the world. So it's good investments that we're getting the return. And we're going to need more of it, obviously, as inflation keeps going up. And we're going to have to be super agile and very precise on the choices we make with the consumer. Yes, yes. Nik, listen, obviously, our commitment to the energy category remains as solid as it was earlier. We continue to see this category as one that is growing and evolving and where we can play in multiple ways to capture sub-segments that are starting to develop. The multi-approach that I've referred to in the past continues to be valid. So we're going to lead with Rockstar. And Rockstar, we're seeing several platforms in Rockstar there are starting to, again, hold, I would say, in non-sugar and some of the more functional beverages. So that's a big pillar. Second big pillar for us is our coffee business. Obviously, we're having double shot, triple shot and some additional innovation with Starbucks that it's clearly consumer preferred and continues to do very well. The third pillar is around our kind of flavor forward energy with Mountain Dew. And we're seeing Sports & Energy segment growing more and more in this category. And we have some big ideas on how some of our large brands can play in sports and energy in the future, surely the future. The distribution part has always been an additional opportunity. We have, as we were talking earlier, a very strong DSD system. And we can put brands in our business and provide unique distribution capillarity and execution. That's what we were intending with bank, relationship didn't start well from the beginning. Clearly, it was better to stop it because it has no long-term value for both of us. Now the financial implications are minor. It was never central to the energy strategy. And we continue to be open to other opportunities on distributing brands. That has always been a complementary part of the strategy. The big part of the strategy is, as I was saying, taking our brands and taking our innovation into new spaces and continue to disrupt this category, which is continuing to grow. The consumers like it. Consumers are looking for new benefits in that category. They're willing to pay reasonable prices, and that's not only the U.S. but it's internationally. And we see it as a big opportunity for PepsiCo today and into the future as well. Yes. Nothing has changed from the previous quarter when we talked about this topic as well. We've learned more. And we are probably more convinced of the potential of, as you were referring to, the Boston Beer partnership. I think we have great product that they have developed. We've licensed the brand to Boston Beer, and we're providing distribution in some states. Execution is very good. The product is turning very well, high share in those states. So it makes us feel positive about the potential of Hard Mountain Dew and the relationship with Boston Beer. They are great partners, and they have strong R&D capabilities and branding capabilities as they own the Hard Mountain Dew brand. Now going forward, obviously, we get encouraged by this, and we're working in multiple new innovations that will come to the market shortly. And from the distribution point of view, the same, as I said, with energy, we want to leverage our assets for distribution. We think in alcohol, we can bring new brands to the market. We don't want to be distributing a lot of brands. That's not our intention to have many, many brands and a very complex set of brands in our distribution. We'd rather focus on a few large consumer opportunities and put them through what is a very powerful DSD system. So that is the way we're thinking about our alcohol distribution, not a lot of brands, not distributing beer or anything like that, but just a few large consumer ideas that we can bring to the market our system, which we think is an advantaged execution machine. And that's what we're proving with Hard Mountain Dew. Yes. Vivien, I'll give you a few data so that helps you with the diagnostic. In beverages, non-sugar is growing 3 times the speed of full sugar. So that gives you a sense of how consumers are, in the U.S., are choosing with the choices. If you go more developed markets around the world like Western Europe, the categories are pivoting very quickly to non-sugar. In the UK, for example, the non-sugar segment in beverages is already almost above 80% of the market. So clearly, in beverages, non-sugar is king. You see some of our innovations in the last couple of years with, for example, Gatorade Zero. That was -- it's a huge innovation. I think it's $1.5 billion in only 3 years and expansive to the category and recruiting new consumers into the brand. So non-sugar, I think, is unstoppable trend in the beverage category, something we're leaning in with our R&D, something we're leading in with our commercial strategy with the customers. Every brand has a non-sugar leg that is going to be the focus leg for the brand in the foreseeable future. So that is in beverages. Obviously, you see other trends like functionality, consumers looking for additional functionality and willing to pay for that. But your question was more about health, sugar clearly being a dimension. Now in snacks, I think consumers are also voting with their money. So permissible snacks, what we call permissible snacks, which are the kind of baked or popped or kind of not fried snacks, they're growing much faster than fried snacks, so that we see that as well in that category. We're seeing kind of more nutritious substrates growing faster than some of the more cereal-based substrates. But 1 trend we're seeing across is portion control. So a portion control is a huge consumer idea how we're eliminating some of the brakes, if you want, in consumers' mind to have higher frequency in our categories is portion control. We're seeing in snacks a huge growth on small format, multipacks or not only it's portion control but variety. And we're seeing that also in beverages where full sugar products are going to smaller portions, right, like mini cans or some other formats that give the consumer little pleasure for -- without a lot of calories. So I would continue to bet long term on health being one of the vectors that consumers are choosing. There's also indulgent. Obviously, there's also functionality. There's also a social moment. There's a lot of vectors in our categories, And that's the beauty of our categories. They attract a lot of consumers because of the multiple occasions. But I will continue to bet on health being one of the vectors of choice for the consumer. And that's part of our innovation strategy and how we're trying to move the categories long term. And it's part of the success, if you think about the sodium reduction, the fat transformation, the sugar reduction in our products, a lot of the R&D investments we've been putting in the company in the last many years are starting to pay back in we're giving the consumer the option to make choices with no trade-offs in taste or any of the other key category choices here. Yes. Kaumil, this is Ramon. No, listen, inflation will come and go. And the reason why we're keeping the bottling business integrated with the brand business is much more longer term than the, I don't know, the economic cycle that will leave for the next couple of years. It's a huge strategic decision that is more based on -- if you think about the consumer evolution and the shopper evolution and the way channels will evolve in the future, I think having an integrated brand to consumer value chain will give us flexibility and faster decision-making that we believe creates a lot of value for the company, right? In the short term, yes, we'll have inflation in S&D and we'll have inflation in some of the manufacturing. But if you have a bottling system, that inflation happens anyhow. So your system still has that inflation. It's not like nobody is isolated from inflationary pressures. I mean your system consumer to kind of manufacturing to consumers still has that inflation. So we think, again, this is a very strategic decision we've made, thinking about the long term where consumer is going, where the shopper is going, where the retailers are going. We're going to fulfill demand in the future and where demand will be in the future, much more complex, much more long tail. There's a lot of things that we feel that we're going to be best positioned in the future. And we're talking about 5, 10 years from now to fulfill that demand in a much more integrated way from the brand to the consumer with all the value chain under one decision-making point. Again, the economic cycles will differ. Now we'll have inflation. Maybe 3 years from now, we'll have deflation and we'll be -- so we're not thinking that short term for what is a huge business model decision. Yes. It's great question. And if you think about that we're looking at all the costs in the company, the cost to fulfill demand, the cost to generate demand, we're looking at higher return on investment across all the costs that we have in the business. Obviously, the one you're referring to along with our marketing investments are the 2 big demand creation budget. We're looking at optimizing those investments both on the consumer side and on the consumer customer side. And that has been a journey. It has been done through much more intelligence, through much more data, much better precision decisions in that space, along with our customers. And that is a journey that I would see as a continuous journey to optimize all the budgets that we have in the company to maximize returns. So trade budget, as you say, is a large budget. We're going to continue to optimize it and maybe move those resources to some other areas where we can get better demand generation, right? And we'll do that in partnership with our customers and to the spirit of creating growth for the category as we've had in the past, yes. Yes. Good. Listen, Europe, obviously, has been impacted by -- more than other parts of the world by, I would say, the war, so our business has been impacted both in Ukraine and Russia. Ukraine, because obviously, we had to stop a lot of our manufacturing and commercial activities as reflected in our performance in Europe. And also in Russia, given the commitments we made to stop our beverage, some of our beverage, large brands and also stop advertising and promotion of our more essential food brands. So clearly, that's part of the reason why the European business has been impacted. With regards to China, clearly, the lockdowns are impacting the operation of the business. So our team has been incredibly agile to make the right pivots in how we are continuing to produce our snacks or our beverages. And we've been able to more or less manage that in what is an incredibly challenged situation to get raw materials and to get products out to consumers. We're doing that probably better than other companies, and that's why we're gaining share dramatically. That's the reason why our business is growing very fast. Now if you think about the beverage business, there has been an impact to the consumption of the beverage business in away from home. So as consumers have obviously stayed more at home, there has been an impact in the last few months in that particular channel, not so much in the foods business. We're seeing both our Quaker business and our snack business continue to grow very fast. A bit less on the beverage side of the business, basically because of the away-from-home impact. In-home consumption of beverages continues to be quite strong. Yes. Listen, Peter, I think, as I said, the distribution part of the energy strategy is very marginal in one way or another. It's not the core part of the strategy. We continue to lean into our brands. We have very strong brands in our portfolio that I think as we see the category evolving, we're going to be able to play in those new spaces and capture market share looking forward and where the consumer is going. So again, I'll repeat, in Rockstar and some parts of Rockstar where we're seeing a lot of consumer pool, especially non-sugar and some of the more functional Starbucks coffee forward, flavor forward with Mountain Dew. And as I said, we see sports and energy is a big space where we can capture with some of our large brands in that space and innovation will be coming into the market soon. Those are the main -- you think about our strategy and we might evolve that strategy with new spaces and how our brands can go there, that's our core of the strategy. Then leveraging our assets for distribution is marginal. To your question on bank, you need to have good long-term partnership for the relationship to work. That didn't exist, so we're turning the page. Last question, right? So thank you, everyone, for joining us today. And I know it's summer and everybody has a lot of things to do. And then obviously, for the confidence that you're all placing with your investment in PepsiCo. We hope that you guys are safe and healthy and enjoy the summer."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to PepsiCo's 2022 First Quarter Earnings Question-and-Answer Session. [Operator Instructions]. Today's call is being recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com.  It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Ravi Pamnani, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Pamnani, you may begin.\nRavi Pamnani: Thank you, operator. I hope everyone has had a chance this morning to review our press release and prepared remarks, both of which are available on our website.  Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. We may make forward-looking statements on today's call, including about our business plans and 2022 guidance. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties and only reflect our view as of today, April 26, 2022, and we are under no obligation to update.  When discussing our results, we refer to non-GAAP measures, which exclude certain items from reported results. Please refer to our first quarter 2022 earnings release and first quarter 2022 Form 10-Q available on pepsico.com for definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures and additional information regarding our results, including a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from forward-looking statements.  Joining me today are PepsiCo's Chairman and CEO, Ramon Laguarta; and PepsiCo's Vice Chairman and CFO, Hugh Johnston. [Operator Instructions]. And with that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane: I wanted to ask about margins. And I guess on the last earnings call, I think the expectation was that margins would be intact. And I guess now with today's guidance, it implies maybe a step back in margins. So maybe, Hugh, could you talk a little bit about maybe how that's changed, where we stand now in terms of like net inflation as we exit the first quarter? And then what are some of the actions that you're taking, maybe besides pricing, to try to protect margins?\nHugh Johnston: Yes, Bryan. A couple of things. One, inflation has clearly gotten a bit more challenging for the year. No question about that. We had previously indicated it was low teens. It's several points higher than that now. Number two, and we've always talked about this in the past, when we have inflation, the first thing we do is look internally to try to find opportunities to drive productivity. And we've been pretty good at driving productivity, but we're really stepping it up even a bit further this year, whether it's identifying areas of waste or whether it's looking for -- to leverage digital in a faster and more effective way or whether it's looking to leverage shared services more and more. We're obviously doing all of those things. After that, then we obviously look for revenue management opportunities, whether it's the way that we're merchandising product in-store or packaging mix or shallowing our promotions. And then obviously, price ultimately becomes a factor as well. So in terms of the overall impact, I mentioned that I thought margins would be pretty level on the last call. I think, by and large, that's going to be about the same as we go forward. So clearly, we'll decide what we need to do in the balance of the year in terms of further revenue management actions. Typically, we do that in Q4. But by and large, I think the margins will be relatively level year-over-year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: So on that topic, maybe we can touch specifically a bit more on pricing. Obviously, very strong delivery in the quarter. Can you talk about consumer demand elasticity so far and what you're seeing? But more importantly, with the cost pressures we're seeing out there, can you talk about strategically how you think about pricing going forward? Is there room to take additional increases, if needed? And how you think about that in light of potential consumer sensitivity with inflation being at unprecedented type of levels?\nRamon Laguarta: Dara, let me take a go, and then maybe Hugh can add some comments. Clearly, obviously, if you look at Q4 and Q1, the elasticities that we're having in the business are better than historical and better than what we had planned. So that's why we're raising our guidance for the year. This is valid both for developed markets and for developing markets. We were very concerned about developing markets that we're seeing -- if you see the numbers in LatAm, in Africa, Middle East and APAC, we're seeing good elasticities there as well, so positive.  However, we think the consumer is very early in this process of adjusting to the new inflationary environment. I think there's going to be more consumer new behaviors adapting to the new realities. There are going to be channel mixes changes. There's going to be probably packaging mixes changes and some of the decisions consumers will stop doing certain things that we're doing, going out more, maybe traveling and so on. So we think we're early in the process. I think our categories do normally quite well in inflationary. And what makes us feel confident is that the -- in the last few years, we've invested a lot in the brands. And we've invested a lot in some new capabilities around revenue management, also understanding better opportunities for waste reduction in the company. And we've improved a lot of our execution capabilities in the store with more information and better executional tools.  So I think we feel that we're early in the process. At the same time, we feel rather confident that we can manage through this with a good balance between revenue management, holistic cost management. And our #1 objective is to keep the consumers with our brands. And obviously, if we can get new consumers to our brands, even better, during this process. So that's how we're approaching this in the short term.  And then you were asking about long term. We -- these are the goals that we're setting for our teams. We have -- I've always said that we have very experienced leaders in the market. And this is clearly a battle that you fight market by market. And that gives us, again, I think, a better position to win versus other companies that are facing the same kind of inflation.\nHugh Johnston: Yes. The only thing I'd add to that, Dara, is if you look over time, our categories have always performed pretty well during inflationary times. And as a result of that, I think as a company, our performance has been pretty inflation-resistant as well as recession-resistant, which obviously makes us a pretty good defensive stock.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Was curious if you could talk a little bit about impacts from Russia-Ukraine that are embedded in the outlook. Of course, saw the impairment charges on brands that you talked about before the conflict began and then also the charges on PP&E and so on. But I was curious about how Russia-Ukraine is impacting the revenue outlook and also the EPS outlook for the year in terms of operational elements.\nHugh Johnston: Yes, Lauren. Russia, as I think we've shared in the past, is low single digits in terms of its overall size to us. Obviously, it's a bit of a drag in terms of our overall outlook. But elsewhere in the company, we're doing quite well. So I think we have a pretty conservative Russia outlook embedded in our guidance, which, I think, will put us in good stead for most of the outcomes that could occur as we go forward.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. And then with regards to Ukraine, obviously, we had to stop our operations there -- our manufacturing operations. We're still doing some sales. That's also impacting. It's also embedded in the -- in our guidance for the year where we reopened now our factory in Kyiv. Hopefully, we'll try to get back to operations in Ukraine as a safety situation allows us, but that's also embedded into our guidance.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs.\nBonnie Herzog: I just wanted to get a quick clarification on your top line guide based on your comments. So are you now expecting a greater impact from volume growth this year? As you mentioned, you're maybe feeling better about elasticities going forward. And then I'd be curious to hear specifically how your immediate consumption business is performing in key regions for both your beverage and snack business. I'm asking in light of rising fuel prices. For instance, curious to hear if you guys are seeing any signs of pressure in this channel despite broad reopening in so many markets. And then looking forward, what strategy do you have in place to mitigate some of these pressures if they continue to intensify?\nHugh Johnston: Sure. So Bonnie, why don't I start? Number one, obviously, the revenue guidance is up. That's a combination of a bit more volume and a bit more price, so balanced between the 2 in terms of the change from prior. And previously, we had indicated we don't expect much volume growth. So I think, obviously, that takes us to we expect a little bit of volume growth as the year progresses.  In terms of immediate consumption channels, relatively small impact thus far. Obviously, we'll see how it plays out. Historically, it has impacted the beverage business a bit more than it's impacted the snack food business. I think that's because beverage incidence is just higher than snack food incidence. But so far, relatively muted impact on that, and the other channels are doing quite well. Take-home is still up big gross and foodservices growing at a nice healthy clip at this point.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. If you think about immediate consumption, the away-from-home channel is growing very fast across the world. And also, in the U.S., it's recovering. So that is a positive to immediate consumption. There's a little bit of traffic decline in convenience stores but not meaningful at this point. And obviously, there, the strategy will be to gain space and gain share in that channel to compensate for whatever traffic dilution might be, also trying to be conscious of price points and entry points to the category in those channels. Internationally, we're not seeing mobility being impacted. And we're seeing immediate consumption very strong internationally as well. As I was saying earlier, we're seeing elasticity quite positive in emerging markets. So overall, I don't think that this is going to impact us in the coming period.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: I was just trying to check something in between the lines marketing, and I know you had SG&A was up last year, or actually, you're lapping $180 million in equity investment gain from the same period last 2 years. But just thinking, as you're mentioning, elasticities come in better. Obviously, that may change. But what are you embedding through the end of the year in terms of marketing from a dollar and rate perspective? And then for the places where you count on bottlers, was there any impact of stocking this quarter or ahead of price increases?\nHugh Johnston: Yes, Andrea. Aiming and hoping we're up roughly in line with revenue for the year. So that's where that will likely land. Yes.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. And then your question, Andrea, on the bottlers, no, there is -- there hasn't been any loading of bottlers for price increase. We don't follow these practices, neither with our retail partners. So whatever you see as sales is basically sell-in and sellout that we've had for the business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim.\nLaurent Grandet: Ramon and Hugh, question on PBNA margin. I mean been progressing about 100 basis points in the quarter, almost back to the level of pre-COVID for the first quarter despite higher inflation. Could you please help share the impact of the high-cost inflation for PBNA specifically in the quarter? And also, could you give us maybe more color as to where the gains are coming from maybe dissecting between Tropicana divestiture, product mix? And where do we go from here?\nHugh Johnston: Yes. Thanks, Laurent. A couple of things, obviously, on that front. Number one, we continue to make progress in terms of cost management inside the business. And I've laid out for you all in the past sort of our pathway to mid-teens margins for the PBNA business. That thesis is still very much intact, and that's the plan we're executing against.  Obviously, inflation has put a bit more pressure on that. But the combination of the additional cost management actions that we've taken as well as, obviously, shallowing our promotions, and price increases and revenue management have allowed us to continue on that journey.  We still very much expect to do exactly what we've said in the past, which is we'll progress along towards getting that business back to the margin levels that I mentioned earlier, something in the mid-teens over the course of the next several years. So I think we're making good progress, and it's going as we expected. Inflation, obviously, is higher than we expected, but we're taking actions to manage that.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. The key levers, Laurent, of that margin improvement stay intact, right? If you think about the portfolio, pivots that we're trying to do, those are really good work in progress. If you see the Gatorade performance, that's a high-margin business for us, clearly growing, again, at very fast pace. We're making good progress in energy. So that part of the transformation is good.  We're also making good progress on efficiency and operating excellence. So there's -- the critical levers of that transformation continue intact. Clearly, inflation is a factor. But as Hugh was saying, we're doubling down on productivity and trying to sharpen the pencil a bit more on revenue management as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen.\nVivien Azer: I was hoping to dive into your European EBIT margins. While I recognize that 1Q is a seasonally low quarter, Hugh, I was wondering if you could offer any incremental color on the margin compression that you saw in that segment this quarter.\nHugh Johnston: Sure, happy to. A couple of things. Number one, and you hit on the key point. It's a very small quarter for Europe. It's a very short quarter, and it's seasonally low in terms of the revenue as well. In terms of some of the factors in there, obviously, Eastern Europe sort of plays something of a role in terms of that number.  Second one, we made a U.K. pension contribution, I think, of about $25 million. That's a relatively small number in the overall year. But in a 2-month quarter, it obviously has a disproportionate impact.  And then in addition to that, the SodaStream business was a little bit soft. That was a bit of a factor. And recall, we report SodaStream through Europe because that's the biggest market for the SodaStream business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nKaumil Gajrawala: If I could dig into the guidance increase a little bit, better volume and price this quarter, of course. Are your expectations of volume price dynamic as we go through the rest of the year? Or is it you just kind of push just including the volume upside for this quarter as part of your full year?\nRamon Laguarta: Kaumil, there was a lot of echo there. And if I understand, your question was around our volume pricing guidance. We've raised the guidance on top line because we've seen better elasticities in the first part of the year. We -- our assumptions for the balance of the year are a bit more conservative on elasticities because, as I said earlier, within the context for the consumer might change, might not change. We're going to obviously try to do our best with our commercial plans and our people on the ground, with execution and better insights to minimize elasticities. Obviously, that's our role here.  But our assumptions going forward are a little bit more conservative because we think that the consumer will be feeling the overall inflation in their disposable income, and that might have an impact on the elasticities of our categories as well, although we think that our categories are -- normally fare quite well in inflationary and recessionary moments. And that's why we feel optimistic about raising the guidance to 8% on top of a very high, fast growth 9.5% last year. So clearly, we're growing very fast as a company.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: Great. I had a question on pricing as well, but from a different angle, really from a retailer's perspective. So the context, of course, your portfolio is in very large, essential and high-velocity categories that drive foot traffic for retailers. But looking at results in the syndicated data, your price/mix is up anywhere from low double digits to mid-teens in your larger categories. I know that's not all frontline pricing. Some of it's mix, but nevertheless, certainly not inconsequential for the consumer to cope with.  So my question is, have the pricing discussions started to become more difficult with retailers, particularly your large customers to a point where maybe we're closer to a tipping point where it's going to be more difficult to put the pricing through? Or is the pricing window still very much open in your view? So your thoughts there would be helpful.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. Listen, we're always make full commercial plan discussions with our customers, and we try to create value for both. And those joint business planning are the essence of our growth strategy. So we do that in full coordination with our partners, trying to make sure that we keep the consumer with us, we keep the shopper coming to the store, and it's a win-win proposition. So we'll do it. We've been doing it the same this year, of course, even with more intensity than in the past and more insights and more value discussions. And we plan to continue to do that as we go into the second half of the year and into the coming years.  Obviously, we're all concerned about elasticities and consumer reaction. So it is to our both interest to take this into consideration as we build the commercial plan. There are some geographies in the world where these discussions are a bit more tactical. I would say some of the European markets, there is a bit more friction when it comes to pricing. And actually, some of our net revenue in Q1 reflects some of these conversations and difficult realities. I would say, in the majority of the markets, these are done in collaboration with our customers and a very good value-creation, win-win discussions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bob Ottenstein with Evercore.\nRobert Ottenstein: Great. I was wondering if you could please remind us what your exposure is to China, what you're seeing there now and your long-term plans.\nHugh Johnston: Sure. Robert, it's Hugh. Low single digits on revenue and very low single digits on [indiscernible] is the number. In terms of our plans, I think we continue to execute in the marketplace. We -- on the snack business, we have a bottler in China who we've had a very successful relationship with. And obviously, in what's a challenging environment, we'll continue to do what we can to continue to operate well. So -- but low single digits and very low singles on the number.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. I would say, obviously, we're seeing the impact of the lockdowns in Shanghai and some other cities impacting somehow the consumer behavior. In general, I would say the in-home consumption is going up. There's been some stocking of our food business in the last few weeks. A little bit of lower mobility in the away-from-home channel, which impacted mostly the beverage business. Overall, this is performing as planned. And obviously, we're doing business contingency planning to make sure that we're ready in case some of the lockdowns impact our operating plans. But in general, I would say, the team is responding very well. And so far, we haven't seen an impact in our business, which, as Hugh said, is relatively small compared to the full size of the company.\nHugh Johnston: And just to build on Ramon's point, I should have mentioned as well, our guide doesn't include a level of conservatism and an expectation that performance will be somewhat challenged based on the situation there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: Ramon and Hugh, just a quick follow-up for me, actually, going back to Laurent's question on Russia-Ukraine. Hugh, you mentioned the contribution there at low single digits, which I think is a profit perspective. On revenue, I thought it was more like mid-single digits, I think, around 4.5% last year. So I guess in that context, just can you talk about how Russia-Ukraine factors into that 8% organic outlook because intuition would say that the business reductions there create a drag on organic growth that you're absorbing in that 8%? But then again, there's just likely so much nominal inflation in those markets. I'm not exactly sure how or whether Russia-Ukraine net out as a positive or a negative driver of organic growth as you calculated into what magnitude. So just some clarity there would be helpful.\nHugh Johnston: Sure, happy to. Your thoughts are right. Last year, Russia was about 4%. Obviously, with the current environment, we expect it to be less than that. That's my low single-digit comment. And yes, we -- it's incorporated into our guidance. We don't expect the business to deliver a lot of growth this year given all of the challenges and the decisions we've made. And it is, in fact, incorporated so that we capture that as a part of the 8%. So again, we're not getting into a ridiculous level of detail. Clearly, the business is going to be lower than it was in 2021 by a meaningful amount.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.\nFilippo Falorni: This is Filippo Falorni on for Nick. A question on your beverage alcohol strategy. Maybe if you can comment on how the HARD MTN DEW launch is performing in the States, where you've launched a product. And then more longer term and bigger picture, like give us an update on kind of your expectations for the beverage alcohol category and any potential new launches or initiatives there?\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. This is Ramon. Yes, listen, I think we're testing and learning at a fast speed, right, both Boston Beer Company is learning how to market and improve the products in their responsibility in the partnership. And we're also learning about how to distribute and sell low-alcohol beverages, which obviously have a lot of restrictions at the state and even municipality level. We're having to train our people in the right way and so on. So there's a lot of test and learning, very encouraging learnings actually as we see in the consumers.  Obviously, Mountain Dew is a big brand, and it's generating a lot of excitement. There's a lot of initial trial. As always, in these circumstances, we have to wait and see repeats and see really where the business stabilizes. But I would say, good learnings for the organization. It's still very early in the process of building the infrastructure and the talent base and pretty good response from the consumer. Yes, we're going to continue to try to create new exciting products that will go through this platform in the future. And as we learn more about the consumer, together with our partners, we'll be able to, I think, innovate meaningfully in this category. But as I said, too early, too early yet to call it a huge success.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge Research.\nBrett Cooper: I was just hoping you could update us on where you are on digitizing your relationship with customers and consumers, aspirations on both levels? And then I guess if I can nest underneath the consumer, if there's any challenges you guys have in going direct, given the independent bottling contracts?\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. Brett, it's a journey that we started very quite some years ago, both on the consumer and the customer. I would say different levels of progress in different parts of the world. Probably, U.S. and Western Europe, more advanced when it comes to consumer interaction. The way we can kind of target our messaging in a much more granular way, and we make good progress how we're doing that, how we're making our media much more efficient by targeting better, so that's an important progress. The same with retailers, where obviously, we have platforms that are fully digitalized and allow our retailers to buy from us directly. And we're -- sufficiently smaller customers, fragmented trade around the world, that's a platform that we're benefiting both for better service and also some productivity, being able to target the retailer better.  So progress, good progress across. It's strategically a very important part of our journey, trying to both generate additional growth through personalization, through targeting the consumer. And that's a journey through innovation, through new digital tools, through better learning of our -- training of our people, our marketeers, our leaders in the marketplace. So it's a journey. I would say in emerging markets, we're a bit behind. But it's an investment that we're putting in place, part of our large investment in digitalization that we've been talking about for already a few years.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities.\nChristopher Carey: So just two connected questions on cost and productivity, if I could. So you noted the prior outlook was for commodities to be low teens. I believe that's impacted COGS, and the company is now tracking higher by a couple of points. I guess that would imply things get worse from here. Can you just maybe help us with perspective on the ability you have in commodity expectations? I understand your locked specifically for the next few quarters. But spot exposure increases in Q4, and how you're thinking about incremental pricing in Q4?  And then just connected, Ramon, I think you noted a couple of times on the call that you're doubling down on productivity. Would you expect to be in a position to exceed the $1 billion in productivity savings target for the year? Or is this just more conceptual?\nHugh Johnston: Yes, Chris. Yes, your math is right. We said low teens before, and it's -- it will be several points higher than that. In terms of what that means for Q4, when we typically see pricing in the business, we're still in the process of figuring out how much that will be. That's sort of our normal pricing window in the U.S., in particular. Obviously, other markets have different windows. So we'll see what that looks like when we get a little bit closer to the time.  In terms of your second question around productivity, yes, we've historically said $1 billion. And yes, we'll be several hundred million dollars higher than that this year based on the actions that we've needed to take to try to help manage a challenging inflationary environment but one that we have pretty well under control.\nRamon Laguarta: Okay. So thank you, everybody, for joining us today and for the confidence you've placed in us with your investments, and we hope that you all stay safe and healthy. Thank you very much for your time.

            "name": "Hugh Johnston",
            "content": "Yes, Bryan. A couple of things. One, inflation has clearly gotten a bit more challenging for the year. No question about that. We had previously indicated it was low teens. It's several points higher than that now. Number two, and we've always talked about this in the past, when we have inflation, the first thing we do is look internally to try to find opportunities to drive productivity. And we've been pretty good at driving productivity, but we're really stepping it up even a bit further this year, whether it's identifying areas of waste or whether it's looking for -- to leverage digital in a faster and more effective way or whether it's looking to leverage shared services more and more. We're obviously doing all of those things. After that, then we obviously look for revenue management opportunities, whether it's the way that we're merchandising product in-store or packaging mix or shallowing our promotions. And then obviously, price ultimately becomes a factor as well. So in terms of the overall impact, I mentioned that I thought margins would be pretty level on the last call. I think, by and large, that's going to be about the same as we go forward. So clearly, we'll decide what we need to do in the balance of the year in terms of further revenue management actions. Typically, we do that in Q4. But by and large, I think the margins will be relatively level year-over-year. Yes. The only thing I'd add to that, Dara, is if you look over time, our categories have always performed pretty well during inflationary times. And as a result of that, I think as a company, our performance has been pretty inflation-resistant as well as recession-resistant, which obviously makes us a pretty good defensive stock. Yes, Lauren. Russia, as I think we've shared in the past, is low single digits in terms of its overall size to us. Obviously, it's a bit of a drag in terms of our overall outlook. But elsewhere in the company, we're doing quite well. So I think we have a pretty conservative Russia outlook embedded in our guidance, which, I think, will put us in good stead for most of the outcomes that could occur as we go forward. Sure. So Bonnie, why don't I start? Number one, obviously, the revenue guidance is up. That's a combination of a bit more volume and a bit more price, so balanced between the 2 in terms of the change from prior. And previously, we had indicated we don't expect much volume growth. So I think, obviously, that takes us to we expect a little bit of volume growth as the year progresses.  In terms of immediate consumption channels, relatively small impact thus far. Obviously, we'll see how it plays out. Historically, it has impacted the beverage business a bit more than it's impacted the snack food business. I think that's because beverage incidence is just higher than snack food incidence. But so far, relatively muted impact on that, and the other channels are doing quite well. Take-home is still up big gross and foodservices growing at a nice healthy clip at this point. Yes, Andrea. Aiming and hoping we're up roughly in line with revenue for the year. So that's where that will likely land. Yes. Yes. Thanks, Laurent. A couple of things, obviously, on that front. Number one, we continue to make progress in terms of cost management inside the business. And I've laid out for you all in the past sort of our pathway to mid-teens margins for the PBNA business. That thesis is still very much intact, and that's the plan we're executing against.  Obviously, inflation has put a bit more pressure on that. But the combination of the additional cost management actions that we've taken as well as, obviously, shallowing our promotions, and price increases and revenue management have allowed us to continue on that journey.  We still very much expect to do exactly what we've said in the past, which is we'll progress along towards getting that business back to the margin levels that I mentioned earlier, something in the mid-teens over the course of the next several years. So I think we're making good progress, and it's going as we expected. Inflation, obviously, is higher than we expected, but we're taking actions to manage that. Sure, happy to. A couple of things. Number one, and you hit on the key point. It's a very small quarter for Europe. It's a very short quarter, and it's seasonally low in terms of the revenue as well. In terms of some of the factors in there, obviously, Eastern Europe sort of plays something of a role in terms of that number.  Second one, we made a U.K. pension contribution, I think, of about $25 million. That's a relatively small number in the overall year. But in a 2-month quarter, it obviously has a disproportionate impact.  And then in addition to that, the SodaStream business was a little bit soft. That was a bit of a factor. And recall, we report SodaStream through Europe because that's the biggest market for the SodaStream business. Sure. Robert, it's Hugh. Low single digits on revenue and very low single digits on [indiscernible] is the number. In terms of our plans, I think we continue to execute in the marketplace. We -- on the snack business, we have a bottler in China who we've had a very successful relationship with. And obviously, in what's a challenging environment, we'll continue to do what we can to continue to operate well. So -- but low single digits and very low singles on the number. And just to build on Ramon's point, I should have mentioned as well, our guide doesn't include a level of conservatism and an expectation that performance will be somewhat challenged based on the situation there. Sure, happy to. Your thoughts are right. Last year, Russia was about 4%. Obviously, with the current environment, we expect it to be less than that. That's my low single-digit comment. And yes, we -- it's incorporated into our guidance. We don't expect the business to deliver a lot of growth this year given all of the challenges and the decisions we've made. And it is, in fact, incorporated so that we capture that as a part of the 8%. So again, we're not getting into a ridiculous level of detail. Clearly, the business is going to be lower than it was in 2021 by a meaningful amount. Yes, Chris. Yes, your math is right. We said low teens before, and it's -- it will be several points higher than that. In terms of what that means for Q4, when we typically see pricing in the business, we're still in the process of figuring out how much that will be. That's sort of our normal pricing window in the U.S., in particular. Obviously, other markets have different windows. So we'll see what that looks like when we get a little bit closer to the time.  In terms of your second question around productivity, yes, we've historically said $1 billion. And yes, we'll be several hundred million dollars higher than that this year based on the actions that we've needed to take to try to help manage a challenging inflationary environment but one that we have pretty well under control."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Ramon Laguarta",
            "content": "Dara, let me take a go, and then maybe Hugh can add some comments. Clearly, obviously, if you look at Q4 and Q1, the elasticities that we're having in the business are better than historical and better than what we had planned. So that's why we're raising our guidance for the year. This is valid both for developed markets and for developing markets. We were very concerned about developing markets that we're seeing -- if you see the numbers in LatAm, in Africa, Middle East and APAC, we're seeing good elasticities there as well, so positive.  However, we think the consumer is very early in this process of adjusting to the new inflationary environment. I think there's going to be more consumer new behaviors adapting to the new realities. There are going to be channel mixes changes. There's going to be probably packaging mixes changes and some of the decisions consumers will stop doing certain things that we're doing, going out more, maybe traveling and so on. So we think we're early in the process. I think our categories do normally quite well in inflationary. And what makes us feel confident is that the -- in the last few years, we've invested a lot in the brands. And we've invested a lot in some new capabilities around revenue management, also understanding better opportunities for waste reduction in the company. And we've improved a lot of our execution capabilities in the store with more information and better executional tools.  So I think we feel that we're early in the process. At the same time, we feel rather confident that we can manage through this with a good balance between revenue management, holistic cost management. And our #1 objective is to keep the consumers with our brands. And obviously, if we can get new consumers to our brands, even better, during this process. So that's how we're approaching this in the short term.  And then you were asking about long term. We -- these are the goals that we're setting for our teams. We have -- I've always said that we have very experienced leaders in the market. And this is clearly a battle that you fight market by market. And that gives us, again, I think, a better position to win versus other companies that are facing the same kind of inflation. Yes. And then with regards to Ukraine, obviously, we had to stop our operations there -- our manufacturing operations. We're still doing some sales. That's also impacting. It's also embedded in the -- in our guidance for the year where we reopened now our factory in Kyiv. Hopefully, we'll try to get back to operations in Ukraine as a safety situation allows us, but that's also embedded into our guidance. Yes. If you think about immediate consumption, the away-from-home channel is growing very fast across the world. And also, in the U.S., it's recovering. So that is a positive to immediate consumption. There's a little bit of traffic decline in convenience stores but not meaningful at this point. And obviously, there, the strategy will be to gain space and gain share in that channel to compensate for whatever traffic dilution might be, also trying to be conscious of price points and entry points to the category in those channels. Internationally, we're not seeing mobility being impacted. And we're seeing immediate consumption very strong internationally as well. As I was saying earlier, we're seeing elasticity quite positive in emerging markets. So overall, I don't think that this is going to impact us in the coming period. Yes. And then your question, Andrea, on the bottlers, no, there is -- there hasn't been any loading of bottlers for price increase. We don't follow these practices, neither with our retail partners. So whatever you see as sales is basically sell-in and sellout that we've had for the business. Yes. The key levers, Laurent, of that margin improvement stay intact, right? If you think about the portfolio, pivots that we're trying to do, those are really good work in progress. If you see the Gatorade performance, that's a high-margin business for us, clearly growing, again, at very fast pace. We're making good progress in energy. So that part of the transformation is good.  We're also making good progress on efficiency and operating excellence. So there's -- the critical levers of that transformation continue intact. Clearly, inflation is a factor. But as Hugh was saying, we're doubling down on productivity and trying to sharpen the pencil a bit more on revenue management as well. Kaumil, there was a lot of echo there. And if I understand, your question was around our volume pricing guidance. We've raised the guidance on top line because we've seen better elasticities in the first part of the year. We -- our assumptions for the balance of the year are a bit more conservative on elasticities because, as I said earlier, within the context for the consumer might change, might not change. We're going to obviously try to do our best with our commercial plans and our people on the ground, with execution and better insights to minimize elasticities. Obviously, that's our role here.  But our assumptions going forward are a little bit more conservative because we think that the consumer will be feeling the overall inflation in their disposable income, and that might have an impact on the elasticities of our categories as well, although we think that our categories are -- normally fare quite well in inflationary and recessionary moments. And that's why we feel optimistic about raising the guidance to 8% on top of a very high, fast growth 9.5% last year. So clearly, we're growing very fast as a company. Yes. Listen, we're always make full commercial plan discussions with our customers, and we try to create value for both. And those joint business planning are the essence of our growth strategy. So we do that in full coordination with our partners, trying to make sure that we keep the consumer with us, we keep the shopper coming to the store, and it's a win-win proposition. So we'll do it. We've been doing it the same this year, of course, even with more intensity than in the past and more insights and more value discussions. And we plan to continue to do that as we go into the second half of the year and into the coming years.  Obviously, we're all concerned about elasticities and consumer reaction. So it is to our both interest to take this into consideration as we build the commercial plan. There are some geographies in the world where these discussions are a bit more tactical. I would say some of the European markets, there is a bit more friction when it comes to pricing. And actually, some of our net revenue in Q1 reflects some of these conversations and difficult realities. I would say, in the majority of the markets, these are done in collaboration with our customers and a very good value-creation, win-win discussions. Yes. I would say, obviously, we're seeing the impact of the lockdowns in Shanghai and some other cities impacting somehow the consumer behavior. In general, I would say the in-home consumption is going up. There's been some stocking of our food business in the last few weeks. A little bit of lower mobility in the away-from-home channel, which impacted mostly the beverage business. Overall, this is performing as planned. And obviously, we're doing business contingency planning to make sure that we're ready in case some of the lockdowns impact our operating plans. But in general, I would say, the team is responding very well. And so far, we haven't seen an impact in our business, which, as Hugh said, is relatively small compared to the full size of the company. Yes. This is Ramon. Yes, listen, I think we're testing and learning at a fast speed, right, both Boston Beer Company is learning how to market and improve the products in their responsibility in the partnership. And we're also learning about how to distribute and sell low-alcohol beverages, which obviously have a lot of restrictions at the state and even municipality level. We're having to train our people in the right way and so on. So there's a lot of test and learning, very encouraging learnings actually as we see in the consumers.  Obviously, Mountain Dew is a big brand, and it's generating a lot of excitement. There's a lot of initial trial. As always, in these circumstances, we have to wait and see repeats and see really where the business stabilizes. But I would say, good learnings for the organization. It's still very early in the process of building the infrastructure and the talent base and pretty good response from the consumer. Yes, we're going to continue to try to create new exciting products that will go through this platform in the future. And as we learn more about the consumer, together with our partners, we'll be able to, I think, innovate meaningfully in this category. But as I said, too early, too early yet to call it a huge success. Yes. Brett, it's a journey that we started very quite some years ago, both on the consumer and the customer. I would say different levels of progress in different parts of the world. Probably, U.S. and Western Europe, more advanced when it comes to consumer interaction. The way we can kind of target our messaging in a much more granular way, and we make good progress how we're doing that, how we're making our media much more efficient by targeting better, so that's an important progress. The same with retailers, where obviously, we have platforms that are fully digitalized and allow our retailers to buy from us directly. And we're -- sufficiently smaller customers, fragmented trade around the world, that's a platform that we're benefiting both for better service and also some productivity, being able to target the retailer better.  So progress, good progress across. It's strategically a very important part of our journey, trying to both generate additional growth through personalization, through targeting the consumer. And that's a journey through innovation, through new digital tools, through better learning of our -- training of our people, our marketeers, our leaders in the marketplace. So it's a journey. I would say in emerging markets, we're a bit behind. But it's an investment that we're putting in place, part of our large investment in digitalization that we've been talking about for already a few years. Okay. So thank you, everybody, for joining us today and for the confidence you've placed in us with your investments, and we hope that you all stay safe and healthy. Thank you very much for your time. Thanks."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning and welcome to PepsiCo's 2023 Fourth Quarter Earnings question-and-answer session. Your lines have been placed on listen-only until it's your turn to ask a question. Today's call is being recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Ravi Pamnani, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Pamnani, you may begin.\nRavi Pamnani: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I hope everyone has had a chance this morning to review our press release and prepared remarks, both of which are available on our website. Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. We may make forward-looking statements on today's call, including about our business plans, guidance, and outlook. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties and only reflect our view as of today, February 9, 2024, and we are under no obligation to update. When discussing our results, we refer to non-GAAP measures which exclude certain items from reported results. Please refer to our fourth quarter 2023 earnings release and 2023 Form 10-K available on pepsico.com for definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures and additional information regarding our results, including a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from forward-looking statements. As a reminder, our reported fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022 financial results included one extra reporting week for our North America businesses. Our reported fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 financial results in North America reflect the impacts associated with one less reporting week versus when compared to the prior year. Joining me today are PepsiCo's Chairman and CEO, Ramon Laguarta; and PepsiCo's Executive Vice President and CFO, Jamie Caulfield. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question. With that, operator, I'll turn it over for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nBryan Spillane: Thanks, operator. Good morning, everybody. Jamie, I'm not sure who's more surprised we're seeing each other again, me or you, but welcome back.\nJamie Caulfield: It's great to talk to you again, Brian.\nBryan Spillane: So I have a question, I guess, just in, we fielded a few questions today about the organic sales growth guidance for the year, and maybe if you can help dimensionalize, you know, not just the reduction, but how much is recall things that are sort of external, how much are things that are under your control? And maybe you can think about, as we think the balance of that, just how much of improvement are you expecting maybe in North America versus international? Just trying to understand the moving parts of how we get the organic sales guide from here?\nRamon Laguarta: Great. Good morning, Bryan. This is Ramon. Listen, let me step back for a minute and talk about the last few years and then how next year fits into that. So the last few years we've seen a double-digit growth, top line in the business consistently. So I think it's at 11 CAGR and a 14% or double-digit EPS growth consistently as well. So three very good years. Now we see a -- in \u201824 we see a normalization of the categories, a normalization of the cost, normalization of inflation. So we see everything trending back to our long-term algorithm. Now, we guide it to upper end of the -- both top line and bottom line at the previous earnings call. We maintain the top line at the upper end for the EPS and we move back to at least four for the top line and there's a few factors that I think are material. One, is the Quaker recall. We had a food safety incident in our Quaker supply chain in the U.S., which has impacted us in November, December, and it will continue to impact us, I think for the -- at least for the first-half of the year until we recover our supply chain to normality. We're also seeing some geopolitical events around the world that are impacting some of our markets, which might potentially continue in the first-half of next year. And then the third element is we're seeing a bit of a slowdown in the U.S. both the food category and the beverage category in the Q4. Part of that is slowdown due to pricing and disposable income situation. Part of that is also pivoting between in-home consumption and away-from-home consumption that we're seeing in our business in the U.S. We think that, that might continue in next year, so that's why we're lowering our guidance. We feel good about the consumer in \u201824 in the U.S. We feel good in the sense of very low unemployment, we feel good about the fact that we think wages will go higher than inflation next year. And we hope that by the summer interest rates will go down and that will create another source of oxygen for this possible incoming household. So we feel good about the consumer in the U.S., but if you think about those three elements, we decided to have at least four as the guidance for the top line.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is open.\nLauren Lieberman: Great, thanks. Good morning. Just kind of continuing on that thread perhaps a little bit focusing more on Frito. So, track channel data hasn't looked great, you know, the reported volume decline, you know, sort of bigger than what we've seen in some times of this business. But when I look at a multi-year stack, you know, things look kind of steadier sequentially when I look at the second-half. So just curious how much it may be these near-term results on Frito and looking into the beginning of the year is multi-year comps? Is it the consumer backdrop, the impact of pricing? But just thinking a little bit about your expectations for and plans, I guess, for driving greater units -- unit versus volume growth in \u201824. We're thinking about those two pieces.\nRamon Laguarta: Great, Lauren. I think it's a great question. Just to summarize, we're seeing the Frito business going back to profitable volume growth in \u201824. So that's how we're thinking about the business. If you think about the slowdown in Q4 and you link it to the elements that I was referring to, there is a units versus volume dynamic in the Frito business that is quite relevant. As you see consumption moving from in-home to away-from-home, the portion size is meaningfully different. So we're seeing growth in convenience stores, we're seeing growth in away-from-home in, you know, like 2 times to 3 times the retail growth, but obviously has an implication on volume. As we look at the \u201824, we have a very strong commercial plan for Frito. We have our core brands very well invested. You saw that in \u201823 we increased our A&M meaningfully. We're planning to do that as well in \u201824. So Lays has a big increase in A&M. Doritos has a big increase in A&M. All our permissible portfolio which -- if you think about a combination of SunChips, PopCorners, the whole Simply Line, Smart Foods, that part of the portfolio is growing almost 3 times the average of Frito. So we're putting a lot of emphasis on that particular part of the portfolio to make sure that it has -- is well executed in the store and now the supply chain is back to 100%, we're going to push that part of the portfolio even more aggressively. So we think that Frito will have a continuation of the share of market gains that it's been having for the last couple of years and we expect the category will rebound as well. Part of that because of what we'll do with our brands, which obviously have a lot of weight in the overall category, but also the fact that we think consumers will continue to feel better throughout the year, and that will recover the fleet of a topline with a more balanced, profitable volume growth and pricing versus what we've seen this year.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nBonnie Herzog: All right, thanks, [Technical Difficulty]. I guess I had a question on PBNA profitability. I believe you still have a goal to reach the mid-teen operating margin levels, but so far we really haven't seen much progress. So Ramon, I guess hoping you could touch on your plans to achieve this? And then maybe whether you're considering making bigger structural changes to your business as possible refranchising of your bottoming network. I know you've mentioned in the past that you do see some advantages with broadly owning your network, but just curious to hear if your thoughts on this have changed and I guess if not, what other initiatives do you plan to implement to improve profitability at PBNA? Thanks.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. So, yes, listen, I would say we don't contemplate at this point any of the structural changes to our business. We continue to think that operating the business has advantages for us in terms of speed of execution and some other elements that as we see where the business is growing in e-commerce, away-from-home and some other channels of the future including direct-to-consumer. Within that, that's going to create an advantage for us. Now we've been making progress at a good pace in our margin improvement. If you think about the last three years, the net revenue for PBNA has grown over $5 billion, and the operating profit has grown a billion dollars. Core operating margin has expanded more than 150 bps. So we see the last few years a good improvement in the PBNA business. We think this will continue in the coming years, actually \u201824, that's the first step. We are optimizing the portfolio. We're eliminating parts of the portfolio that were less profitable. We've referred to bottled water. We've referred to some multi-serve parts of the portfolio that were not that profitable. We continue to optimize our efficiency of our supply chain. We're digitalizing our supply chain. We continue to extract, you know, eliminate waste from that. We continue to work on global business services that reduces the G&A. We're also optimizing A&M, trying to get to higher ROI on A&M and our trade investments. So we continue to think that optimizing all those elements in the different parts of the P&L will continue to drive a sustainable margin improvement, whilst we remain very competitive in the marketplace. And that's the balance that we're trying to strike with this business. So far we feel good. The business grew with the rest of the category. If you take everything that is in our system, grew in line with the category and we increased the operating margin. So that's how we're thinking at this point about the PBNA business and with a long-term perspective obviously in how we will achieve those two elements of growing with the category and increasing the margins.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from [Indiscernible] with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, everybody. Good morning. Welcome back, Jamie. Well, I suppose you've gone nowhere, but welcome back to dealing with us, I guess. Can you maybe talk a bit more about international, particularly margins are picking up above the average now, it's scaling quite nicely, but also if there's anything we need to be aware of as it relates to hyperinflation, Argentina, anything like that?\nRamon Laguarta: No, listen, I'll start and maybe Jamie can add to this. The -- listen, the international opportunity continues to be by the most remarkable and exciting opportunity that we have as a company. As you're saying our international business is very scaled now. It's almost $40 billion between beverages and snacks. So that's, if you compare it to some of the consumer goods companies, it's much bigger than many of the consumer goods companies globally. So clearly a big opportunity, and we have just scratched the surface when you think about the per capita consumption that we have in many markets and the opportunity we have ahead of us. So here's your point you're right. As we scale it, some of those businesses are becoming more profitable and obviously you start the virtuous circle of scale, reinvestment, margin expansion, and getting to a much more profitable and advantage businesses across many markets. So this year is not going to be a different one. So \u201824, we continue to think that international will grow faster than the U.S. business. We're seeing good momentum as we start the year in many of our international businesses. Our position is of investment in those markets, so we're going aggressively with productivity and reinvestment for growth, reinvestment in the brands, reinvestments in systems, in capabilities that continue to drive the per caps and our share of market position. So you should think about our international business as a big opportunity for PepsiCo. And with regards to the Argentina situation, it's, yes, we've already taken that hyper accounting and you shouldn't expect any material impact on organic sales growth.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey, good morning, guys, and Jamie, great to hear your voice again.\nJamie Caulfield: Hey, Dara.\nDara Mohsenian: So I wanted to drill down a bit more on Bonnie's question, but looking at PBNA top line more than profit, there's clearly been some market share struggles and pieces of the portfolio there, sports strength, CSDs, et cetera. So I guess can you just talk a little bit more about strategy changes from a top line standpoint. How you sort of manage the business by product category? And your thoughts around share trends as we look going forward? Thanks.\nRamon Laguarta: Hi there. Good, listen, we feel good about the overall portfolio of PBNA. You know, we manage the business as a full LRB business, not as a CSD or any particular subcategory. We're looking at, you know, the full portfolio and how it's always everywhere for consumers from the morning to the night in all the multiple locations. We continue to believe that we have an advantage portfolio. If you think about our positions in sports and hydration, our positions in coffee, tea, now the portfolio we have in energy, and our CSD position as well. So we continue to manage as a full LRB. Now, if you think about our priorities for the year, relaunch of Pepsi brand with a new image with focus on Zero. Zero has been growing very fast and continues to be an advantage proposition for us. We are putting a lot of additional investment in Mountain Dew, and we're launching Baja Blast as a permanent SKU. Baja Blast has been a success as an LTO, a limited time offer. For many years now, we're launching it. We're using the Super Bowl as a platform this weekend to launch Baja Blast. We continue to build a position in Lemon Lime with Starry. Starry, it's been a good first year. I think we had -- we're over indexing with Gen Z. We see the brand getting some good repeat. You will see also an investment around Super Bowl and continue during the year. So that's our CSD portfolio. We feel very good about Gatorade. Gatorade is, we're moving from historically a liquid for high performing athletes to an ecosystem of solutions in hydration and fuel for every type of active person. And we've seen a lot of traction. It's not only Gatorade per se, but it's Gatorlyte, it's GFit, it's Propel, it's Muscle Milk, all under one umbrella. And it's not only liquid solutions, it's powders, it's tablets, it's equipment, personalized equipment, bottles, and others. And now we're launching around the Super Bowl Gatorade ID, which is also an ecosystem of loyalty and I would say personalization for our consumers that will bring even more attention to the brand and more loyalty with younger consumers. On energy, we're very happy with our portfolio. Obviously the Starbucks coffee energy on one side, Rockstar, and obviously our collaboration with CELSIUS, which has been a great success, and it provides scale to our go-to-market and kind of a point of entry as well with some of our customers. And then our tea business continues to very well with Pure Leaf and our Starbucks collaboration now moving more into beyond coffee, I would say more refreshers and some other innovation that Starbucks is developing for their cafes and we bring it to ready to drink. So I think we have a beautiful portfolio. We continue to grow in retail and we're putting a lot of focus in away-from-home as we're seeing that the away-from-home channel is getting much more traffic as people go back to normal mobility and that will be a focus for us going forward. This year we think we'll continue to grow above the market and continue to gain share in what is a very profitable and high growth channel. So this is how we're thinking about the business there. Hopefully it gives you a good sense of the intentionality, how we're thinking about the broad portfolio and our willingness to compete with innovation, with brand investment and with great execution.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS. Your line is open.\nPeter Grom: Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone. Ramon, I just wanted to ask a follow-up based on your response to both Bryan and Lauren\u2019s question on the organic growth. And I may have misheard or could be misinterpreting this, but you touched on some of the things that you are doing internally that will drive the improved performance. But I think you also mentioned some sort of assumption around maybe the U.S. consumer would feel better. I mean, if that doesn't happen, would that put the organic revenue guidance at risk or would an improved backdrop be more of a source of upside versus the greater than 4%? Thanks.\nRamon Laguarta: The current assumption is what I said. We think that the consumer will continue to improve in its confidence and its disposable income throughout the year. And that's the ongoing assumption. We have a very strong productivity program in the company, which gives us the fuel for investment, and it gives us also a lot of flexibility to manage a potential different consumer reality. But at this point, we think this is the ongoing assumption who will invest in our brands, who will invest in our innovation. And now that supply chain is in a very good place, compared to what it was a couple of years ago, even last year, we can rely on the tools that we're very good at, which is brand building, innovation, execution, distribution increases, strong commercial programs with our partners, and that's where we think we'll drive the growth of our top line here.\nJamie Caulfield: Yes, and I'd add just to remind you, 40% of our business is now international. So, you know, the U.S. is significant, but we've got a big business outside the U.S.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Gerald Pascarelli with Wedbush. Your line is open.\nGerald Pascarelli: Great. Thanks very much. Ramon, I have a question on energy drinks. Can you just speak about your plans to maybe drive performance in Rockstar this year? It's kind of been a relative underperformer in energy drinks for some time and now you have bang coming back into the market, which could potentially result in some incremental disruption. So maybe just some color on how you're thinking about driving an improvement in Apron and then maybe broader thoughts on the competitive dynamics within energy drinks this year? Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, I mean, it's a great question. The energy category continues to grow, as you see, above the LRB category. So continues to expand into new consumers and new consumer locations, which obviously creates growth for everyone that participates in the category. So we participate, as always said, with multiple vectors. We're proud of our Starbucks partnership and some of the products we offer, double shots, triple shots. We're proud of the Rockstar brand. Rockstar has been growing with the category. More or less, there are some parts of the country where it's well distributed and well preferred. Other parts of the country we're trying to get consumer penetration and consumer adoption. The areas where we've been successful with Rockstar, which we will double down, are the zero and are the recover parts of the portfolio. Both of them, if you think is energy with functionality and where we think our R&D can create advantage. So we're pushing those two platforms, Rockstar Zero and Rockstar Recover, and that will continue to be the focus of the brand. We've also been focusing on Hispanic consumer, and that also we've seen an increase in the penetration of the brand with Hispanic population, with Hispanic consumers will continue to drive that commercial activity. But we see this as a portfolio of solutions, including sales use and how the combined portfolio creates a very good point of execution for us, multi-brand, it gives us an entry into convenience stores and some other points of sale away-from-home and will continue to drive the portfolio as the unit of execution.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]\nRamon Laguarta: I forgot, maybe I can say. The other thing we're doing with Rockstar, which we don't talk a lot about it, it's an important part of our growth, is we're launching Rockstar internationally in many markets around the world, from Asia to Europe to parts of Latin America, and we're having good success, again, as a portfolio of solutions that complements our Sting brand that we have in Asia or some other brands that we have in Europe as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nRobert Moskow: Hi. Thank you for the question. In your prepared remarks, you said that you expect less commodity inflation, but some agricultural inputs might be higher. Can you be more specific? And I was hoping you could focus a little on Frito, because there's a very big potato crop this past year. Vegetable oil costs are coming down. Do you see any relief on the horizon for Frito in that regard?\nJamie Caulfield: Hey, Rob, it's Jamie. Yes, that is a practice we comment on the basket of inputs. We don't comment on specific commodity movement, but you're absolutely correct that we do expect commodity inflation to moderate from what we had in \u201823.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you, operator. Good morning to you all and great having you back, Jamie, on the investor facing mode. I have one question and then a clarification. First for Ramon, I was hoping to see if you can elaborate a little bit more on how you're going to be lapping and if you have a red lap, the mixed drags and the shift from away-from-home and where your market share is not probably as strong as in snacks as you have in at-home channels? And given your strong gross margin delivery in your experience negotiating with large box retailers, especially in Europe. Are retailers asking you to invest back in promo rollbacks given your gross margin delivery and productivity gains, in particular North American and Europe. And my clarification for Jamie is in terms of like your organic sales growth and EPS cadence for the year, anything we should be considering on your guide as far as cadence. Thank you.\nJamie Caulfield: Yes, so on the organic sales growth, first of all, Andrea, it's great to hear your voice again and look forward to interacting as we go forward. Organic sales growth cadence, I'd say back half, stronger than the first-half as we talked about before. We've got the impact of the Quaker recall is going to be front half loaded. The laps get easier as we get into the back half of the year. And then some of these consumer pressures that have existed with elimination of stimulus benefits, resumption of student loan payments. We'll lap those as we get into the year.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, and listen, with regards to the customer, I think we're all trying to build win-win plans in the sense that we grow the business and we create profit growth for both our customers and ourselves. We normally -- we have always the consumer at the center, so it will be a combination of we generate growth through, as I said, innovation, and we have a few big innovations and brand relaunches this year. We'll put a lot of investment there together with our customers. We'll continue to try to expand our SKUs with the customers and there will be investments there. And there will be some investments in trying to give more value to consumers in a very holistic way, right? Through back priced, through promotions, through consumer events that eventually will drive preference for our brands. But that's the way we're thinking about creating this joint business planning with our large customers that create growth for the category, growth for our customers, and growth for us. With regards to away-from-home, sorry I forgot Andrea. The away-from-home we see it as an and, not as an or, we see it as an opportunity for us to continue to be in consumers\u2019 lives always everywhere. And as consumers pivot away-from-home, we'll try to be there for them. It's been an area of investment for us, both in distribution and specific solutions for away-from-home for quite some time. And we're seeing our businesses in the large markets growing above the market in away-from-home. So clearly, this will be an opportunity for us for many years to come. And I think we're getting better at mixology. We're getting better at more food experiences, walking tacos, Doritos loaded. We're testing food trucks. We're testing many things that will make our brands available to consumers in the beyond what is a package bag or a can or a bottle. Now I think consumers are expecting from us away-from-home a much more holistic experience and that's what we're working on and I think we're making good progress.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore. Your line is open.\nRobert Ottenstein: Great, thank you very much. A little bit more of a detailed question on PBNA and just want to talk about Gatorade and CELSIUS. So in terms of Gatorade, could you just remind us in terms of the timing of the move to DSD? And how that impacted your income statement? And then in terms of CELSIUS, obviously the brand has done phenomenally well. It's getting pretty big now. Can you talk about how CELSIUS impacts the income statement in the U.S.? And then how your relationship with the company has evolved? You talked about taking Rockstar internationally. CELSIUS is going international now. Are you part of that plan as well? Thank you.\nJamie Caulfield: Yes. So, on Gatorade, we're 90% through on the transition. Obviously, that move is positive to the financial results overall. That's what we did is to enhance performance and we're happy with the margins we have on that business. On CELSIUS, the way that works is we're sharing the system revenue with CELSIUS.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, listen, we're happy with the collaboration with CELSIUS and that continues to be a part of our growth strategy. You know, there is an opportunity for us to collaborate in the international expansion as well. At this point it's not, I would say, a scaled opportunity. It's a market-by-market opportunity and very particular market. So yes, we are contemplating that as an option and we are having conversations with CELSIUS how we can leverage the PepsiCo system for a bigger expansion. Nothing short-term I would say at this point.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nChris Carey: Hi. Good morning, everyone. So I just wanted to ask about SG&A over the past four years. We've talked about this before in this forum, but with the annual disclosure is now out. I thought it would be a good time to revisit the topic. Specifically, Ramon, can you help contextualize the increase that we've seen in SG&A over the past four years, specifically in distribution costs? I'm really curious about maybe how much of this is underlying inflation as opposed to discretionary investments that PepsiCo is making and not really looking for a specific number per se, I realize that's probably difficult, but distributions up 40% over the past four years, and I'm just wondering how much of this is within your control, maybe some of the capabilities that you've been able to build over this timeframe and maybe get a sense of how this line item should be trending going forward? So thanks.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, so as you point out, selling and distribution is the biggest part of that. The A part is less so. And it's going to be a reflection of what you see is: one, you've got market mixed or sector mixed components in there. We've driven a lot of productivity in our OpEx, but at the same time, we're investing in OpEx to drive distribution and growth in the business.\nJamie Caulfield: One other thing, Chris, that you should be mindful of is, you know, we do have a big direct store delivery business, so we've had inflation in various things like labor and so forth, and that's what's gone up. A&M has gone up as well, which is also kind of all part of that SG&A bucket. We've made numerous capability investments in there as well. So it's all of the above. I wouldn't hone in just on the distribution costs, which I know you focus on from the 10-K. There's a lot of buckets that go in that are far deeper that we can't get into for competitive reasons.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Filippo Falorni with Citi. Your line is open.\nFilippo Falorni: Hey, good morning everyone. So Ramon and Jamie, you both mentioned the organic sales growth guidance is going to be more second-half weighted? And I know you don't provide breakdown and guidance on volumes, but given the importance of volume trends, can you give us a sense of how you see volumes evolving? Is there a possibility in your guidance where you see positive volumes in the second-half of the year? And then on the pricing front, maybe you can give us a sense of what are you assuming in terms of pricing? I assume in the U.S. or developed markets its limited and there's more pricing in emerging market, but any color on pricing will be also helpful. Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, I think you should be thinking about we want to grow units next year. We will see profitable volume growth next year. And you'll see a more balance between pricing and volume that you have seen in previous years, obviously we had to cover a huge commodity increase and OpEx increase. As commodities kind of normalize and OpEx inflation normalizes, that lever will be less necessary outside of what has been a normal pricing levels of our category in the 2% to 3%. So you should be thinking about profitable volume growth and more of a normalized pricing, compared to what it was in the \u201818, \u201819 timeframes.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Callum Elliott with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nCallum Elliott: Hi, good morning. I wanted to build upon Chris's question, please, and ask you about the A&M buckets and the spending behind your brands. I think the case shows advertising up around 10% year-on-year, and that's around a 20 basis points increase as a percentage of sales. But we're still quite a long way below pre-pandemic levels as a percentage of sales and comfortably below the average of the last several years. So I guess the question is, are your brands getting enough support and do we need to see upwards pressure on advertising spend as a percentage of sales over the coming years? Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: That's great, good point. Obviously in absolute terms, we have much more A&M. So I think we have increased, last year was $500 million. And if you think about a longer timeframe, a meaningful over $1 billion increase in absolute A&M. So that's absolute dollars that go against our business. We're thinking about continuing that trend, continuing to support both our large brands across multiple markets and then smaller brands where we take the portfolio into the future. So that should be a composition of our A&M. Now, when you look at the last few years, you should bear in mind we stopped advertising in Russia, which was a meaningful market for us. So that is reflected in our absolute numbers or relative numbers. So that you should contemplate that. But as a, you know, if you think about where and how we're going to create demand in the future, you should be thinking about A&M continue to increase. Obviously, we'll look at ways to optimize A&M, and we have very strong measures on ROI and best ways to invest in our brands, but you should be thinking about as a company that continues to build brands, continues to innovate, continues to create value through investment in consumer. And obviously we also create a lot of demand through our push model to some of the questions that were asked before. You should be thinking about our selling and distribution costs not only as a cost, but also as a way for us to execute very granularly across millions and millions of point of sale around the world where we reach the final point of sale and we create, I would say visibility for our brands and impulse for our brands, which are relevant if you think about the categories where we compete.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our last question comes from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nSteve Powers: Oh, great. Good morning. Thanks, everybody. Jamie, add me to the list of people excited to work with you again. Hey, actually, this question may be for you. It probably is for you. On these calls for the last several years, we've been talking about on and off, just sort of the cashflow profile of the business and the capital investments that have been made in the business in the past, eventually back towards a higher level of pre-cashflow conversion. I guess acknowledging that you've been there in the room the whole time. Now as you assume the role of CFO, do you see any opportunities to speed that process of cash flow generation and a return to higher levels of pre-cash flow conversion from where we've been trending or is it more steady state? And if you could just give us a little perspective on how you're seeing those, that cashflow profile of the business evolving from here, that'd be great. Thank you.\nJamie Caulfield: Yes, so clearly cashflow continues to be a priority. I focus on CapEx and we've been very intentional about the levels of capital we've invested in the business. Part of that was to catch up on capacity. We're currently in the midst of big investments in IT and digitalization. But over time, I think you'll see the level of CapEx as a percent of sales begin to trend down and that will help with the cash flow conversion.\nRamon Laguarta: Great. So thank you, everybody. I'm glad everybody's happy that Jamie is back and I see a lot of bonding. Great, but obviously thank you for the confidence that you've placed in our investment and we look forward to seeing many of you at Cagny in a couple of weeks and having a longer conversation there. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.",

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Ramon Laguarta",
            "content": "Great. Good morning, Bryan. This is Ramon. Listen, let me step back for a minute and talk about the last few years and then how next year fits into that. So the last few years we've seen a double-digit growth, top line in the business consistently. So I think it's at 11 CAGR and a 14% or double-digit EPS growth consistently as well. So three very good years. Now we see a -- in \u201824 we see a normalization of the categories, a normalization of the cost, normalization of inflation. So we see everything trending back to our long-term algorithm. Now, we guide it to upper end of the -- both top line and bottom line at the previous earnings call. We maintain the top line at the upper end for the EPS and we move back to at least four for the top line and there's a few factors that I think are material. One, is the Quaker recall. We had a food safety incident in our Quaker supply chain in the U.S., which has impacted us in November, December, and it will continue to impact us, I think for the -- at least for the first-half of the year until we recover our supply chain to normality. We're also seeing some geopolitical events around the world that are impacting some of our markets, which might potentially continue in the first-half of next year. And then the third element is we're seeing a bit of a slowdown in the U.S. both the food category and the beverage category in the Q4. Part of that is slowdown due to pricing and disposable income situation. Part of that is also pivoting between in-home consumption and away-from-home consumption that we're seeing in our business in the U.S. We think that, that might continue in next year, so that's why we're lowering our guidance. We feel good about the consumer in \u201824 in the U.S. We feel good in the sense of very low unemployment, we feel good about the fact that we think wages will go higher than inflation next year. And we hope that by the summer interest rates will go down and that will create another source of oxygen for this possible incoming household. So we feel good about the consumer in the U.S., but if you think about those three elements, we decided to have at least four as the guidance for the top line. Great, Lauren. I think it's a great question. Just to summarize, we're seeing the Frito business going back to profitable volume growth in \u201824. So that's how we're thinking about the business. If you think about the slowdown in Q4 and you link it to the elements that I was referring to, there is a units versus volume dynamic in the Frito business that is quite relevant. As you see consumption moving from in-home to away-from-home, the portion size is meaningfully different. So we're seeing growth in convenience stores, we're seeing growth in away-from-home in, you know, like 2 times to 3 times the retail growth, but obviously has an implication on volume. As we look at the \u201824, we have a very strong commercial plan for Frito. We have our core brands very well invested. You saw that in \u201823 we increased our A&M meaningfully. We're planning to do that as well in \u201824. So Lays has a big increase in A&M. Doritos has a big increase in A&M. All our permissible portfolio which -- if you think about a combination of SunChips, PopCorners, the whole Simply Line, Smart Foods, that part of the portfolio is growing almost 3 times the average of Frito. So we're putting a lot of emphasis on that particular part of the portfolio to make sure that it has -- is well executed in the store and now the supply chain is back to 100%, we're going to push that part of the portfolio even more aggressively. So we think that Frito will have a continuation of the share of market gains that it's been having for the last couple of years and we expect the category will rebound as well. Part of that because of what we'll do with our brands, which obviously have a lot of weight in the overall category, but also the fact that we think consumers will continue to feel better throughout the year, and that will recover the fleet of a topline with a more balanced, profitable volume growth and pricing versus what we've seen this year. Yes. So, yes, listen, I would say we don't contemplate at this point any of the structural changes to our business. We continue to think that operating the business has advantages for us in terms of speed of execution and some other elements that as we see where the business is growing in e-commerce, away-from-home and some other channels of the future including direct-to-consumer. Within that, that's going to create an advantage for us. Now we've been making progress at a good pace in our margin improvement. If you think about the last three years, the net revenue for PBNA has grown over $5 billion, and the operating profit has grown a billion dollars. Core operating margin has expanded more than 150 bps. So we see the last few years a good improvement in the PBNA business. We think this will continue in the coming years, actually \u201824, that's the first step. We are optimizing the portfolio. We're eliminating parts of the portfolio that were less profitable. We've referred to bottled water. We've referred to some multi-serve parts of the portfolio that were not that profitable. We continue to optimize our efficiency of our supply chain. We're digitalizing our supply chain. We continue to extract, you know, eliminate waste from that. We continue to work on global business services that reduces the G&A. We're also optimizing A&M, trying to get to higher ROI on A&M and our trade investments. So we continue to think that optimizing all those elements in the different parts of the P&L will continue to drive a sustainable margin improvement, whilst we remain very competitive in the marketplace. And that's the balance that we're trying to strike with this business. So far we feel good. The business grew with the rest of the category. If you take everything that is in our system, grew in line with the category and we increased the operating margin. So that's how we're thinking at this point about the PBNA business and with a long-term perspective obviously in how we will achieve those two elements of growing with the category and increasing the margins. No, listen, I'll start and maybe Jamie can add to this. The -- listen, the international opportunity continues to be by the most remarkable and exciting opportunity that we have as a company. As you're saying our international business is very scaled now. It's almost $40 billion between beverages and snacks. So that's, if you compare it to some of the consumer goods companies, it's much bigger than many of the consumer goods companies globally. So clearly a big opportunity, and we have just scratched the surface when you think about the per capita consumption that we have in many markets and the opportunity we have ahead of us. So here's your point you're right. As we scale it, some of those businesses are becoming more profitable and obviously you start the virtuous circle of scale, reinvestment, margin expansion, and getting to a much more profitable and advantage businesses across many markets. So this year is not going to be a different one. So \u201824, we continue to think that international will grow faster than the U.S. business. We're seeing good momentum as we start the year in many of our international businesses. Our position is of investment in those markets, so we're going aggressively with productivity and reinvestment for growth, reinvestment in the brands, reinvestments in systems, in capabilities that continue to drive the per caps and our share of market position. So you should think about our international business as a big opportunity for PepsiCo. And with regards to the Argentina situation, it's, yes, we've already taken that hyper accounting and you shouldn't expect any material impact on organic sales growth. Hi there. Good, listen, we feel good about the overall portfolio of PBNA. You know, we manage the business as a full LRB business, not as a CSD or any particular subcategory. We're looking at, you know, the full portfolio and how it's always everywhere for consumers from the morning to the night in all the multiple locations. We continue to believe that we have an advantage portfolio. If you think about our positions in sports and hydration, our positions in coffee, tea, now the portfolio we have in energy, and our CSD position as well. So we continue to manage as a full LRB. Now, if you think about our priorities for the year, relaunch of Pepsi brand with a new image with focus on Zero. Zero has been growing very fast and continues to be an advantage proposition for us. We are putting a lot of additional investment in Mountain Dew, and we're launching Baja Blast as a permanent SKU. Baja Blast has been a success as an LTO, a limited time offer. For many years now, we're launching it. We're using the Super Bowl as a platform this weekend to launch Baja Blast. We continue to build a position in Lemon Lime with Starry. Starry, it's been a good first year. I think we had -- we're over indexing with Gen Z. We see the brand getting some good repeat. You will see also an investment around Super Bowl and continue during the year. So that's our CSD portfolio. We feel very good about Gatorade. Gatorade is, we're moving from historically a liquid for high performing athletes to an ecosystem of solutions in hydration and fuel for every type of active person. And we've seen a lot of traction. It's not only Gatorade per se, but it's Gatorlyte, it's GFit, it's Propel, it's Muscle Milk, all under one umbrella. And it's not only liquid solutions, it's powders, it's tablets, it's equipment, personalized equipment, bottles, and others. And now we're launching around the Super Bowl Gatorade ID, which is also an ecosystem of loyalty and I would say personalization for our consumers that will bring even more attention to the brand and more loyalty with younger consumers. On energy, we're very happy with our portfolio. Obviously the Starbucks coffee energy on one side, Rockstar, and obviously our collaboration with CELSIUS, which has been a great success, and it provides scale to our go-to-market and kind of a point of entry as well with some of our customers. And then our tea business continues to very well with Pure Leaf and our Starbucks collaboration now moving more into beyond coffee, I would say more refreshers and some other innovation that Starbucks is developing for their cafes and we bring it to ready to drink. So I think we have a beautiful portfolio. We continue to grow in retail and we're putting a lot of focus in away-from-home as we're seeing that the away-from-home channel is getting much more traffic as people go back to normal mobility and that will be a focus for us going forward. This year we think we'll continue to grow above the market and continue to gain share in what is a very profitable and high growth channel. So this is how we're thinking about the business there. Hopefully it gives you a good sense of the intentionality, how we're thinking about the broad portfolio and our willingness to compete with innovation, with brand investment and with great execution. The current assumption is what I said. We think that the consumer will continue to improve in its confidence and its disposable income throughout the year. And that's the ongoing assumption. We have a very strong productivity program in the company, which gives us the fuel for investment, and it gives us also a lot of flexibility to manage a potential different consumer reality. But at this point, we think this is the ongoing assumption who will invest in our brands, who will invest in our innovation. And now that supply chain is in a very good place, compared to what it was a couple of years ago, even last year, we can rely on the tools that we're very good at, which is brand building, innovation, execution, distribution increases, strong commercial programs with our partners, and that's where we think we'll drive the growth of our top line here. Yes, I mean, it's a great question. The energy category continues to grow, as you see, above the LRB category. So continues to expand into new consumers and new consumer locations, which obviously creates growth for everyone that participates in the category. So we participate, as always said, with multiple vectors. We're proud of our Starbucks partnership and some of the products we offer, double shots, triple shots. We're proud of the Rockstar brand. Rockstar has been growing with the category. More or less, there are some parts of the country where it's well distributed and well preferred. Other parts of the country we're trying to get consumer penetration and consumer adoption. The areas where we've been successful with Rockstar, which we will double down, are the zero and are the recover parts of the portfolio. Both of them, if you think is energy with functionality and where we think our R&D can create advantage. So we're pushing those two platforms, Rockstar Zero and Rockstar Recover, and that will continue to be the focus of the brand. We've also been focusing on Hispanic consumer, and that also we've seen an increase in the penetration of the brand with Hispanic population, with Hispanic consumers will continue to drive that commercial activity. But we see this as a portfolio of solutions, including sales use and how the combined portfolio creates a very good point of execution for us, multi-brand, it gives us an entry into convenience stores and some other points of sale away-from-home and will continue to drive the portfolio as the unit of execution. I forgot, maybe I can say. The other thing we're doing with Rockstar, which we don't talk a lot about it, it's an important part of our growth, is we're launching Rockstar internationally in many markets around the world, from Asia to Europe to parts of Latin America, and we're having good success, again, as a portfolio of solutions that complements our Sting brand that we have in Asia or some other brands that we have in Europe as well. Yes, and listen, with regards to the customer, I think we're all trying to build win-win plans in the sense that we grow the business and we create profit growth for both our customers and ourselves. We normally -- we have always the consumer at the center, so it will be a combination of we generate growth through, as I said, innovation, and we have a few big innovations and brand relaunches this year. We'll put a lot of investment there together with our customers. We'll continue to try to expand our SKUs with the customers and there will be investments there. And there will be some investments in trying to give more value to consumers in a very holistic way, right? Through back priced, through promotions, through consumer events that eventually will drive preference for our brands. But that's the way we're thinking about creating this joint business planning with our large customers that create growth for the category, growth for our customers, and growth for us. With regards to away-from-home, sorry I forgot Andrea. The away-from-home we see it as an and, not as an or, we see it as an opportunity for us to continue to be in consumers' lives always everywhere. And as consumers pivot away-from-home, we'll try to be there for them. It's been an area of investment for us, both in distribution and specific solutions for away-from-home for quite some time. And we're seeing our businesses in the large markets growing above the market in away-from-home. So clearly, this will be an opportunity for us for many years to come. And I think we're getting better at mixology. We're getting better at more food experiences, walking tacos, Doritos loaded. We're testing food trucks. We're testing many things that will make our brands available to consumers in the beyond what is a package bag or a can or a bottle. Now I think consumers are expecting from us away-from-home a much more holistic experience and that's what we're working on and I think we're making good progress. Yes, listen, we're happy with the collaboration with CELSIUS and that continues to be a part of our growth strategy. You know, there is an opportunity for us to collaborate in the international expansion as well. At this point it's not, I would say, a scaled opportunity. It's a market-by-market opportunity and very particular market. So yes, we are contemplating that as an option and we are having conversations with CELSIUS how we can leverage the PepsiCo system for a bigger expansion. Nothing short-term I would say at this point. Yes, so as you point out, selling and distribution is the biggest part of that. The A part is less so. And it's going to be a reflection of what you see is: one, you've got market mixed or sector mixed components in there. We've driven a lot of productivity in our OpEx, but at the same time, we're investing in OpEx to drive distribution and growth in the business. Yes, I think you should be thinking about we want to grow units next year. We will see profitable volume growth next year. And you'll see a more balance between pricing and volume that you have seen in previous years, obviously we had to cover a huge commodity increase and OpEx increase. As commodities kind of normalize and OpEx inflation normalizes, that lever will be less necessary outside of what has been a normal pricing levels of our category in the 2% to 3%. So you should be thinking about profitable volume growth and more of a normalized pricing, compared to what it was in the \u201818, \u201819 timeframes. That's great, good point. Obviously in absolute terms, we have much more A&M. So I think we have increased, last year was $500 million. And if you think about a longer timeframe, a meaningful over $1 billion increase in absolute A&M. So that's absolute dollars that go against our business. We're thinking about continuing that trend, continuing to support both our large brands across multiple markets and then smaller brands where we take the portfolio into the future. So that should be a composition of our A&M. Now, when you look at the last few years, you should bear in mind we stopped advertising in Russia, which was a meaningful market for us. So that is reflected in our absolute numbers or relative numbers. So that you should contemplate that. But as a, you know, if you think about where and how we're going to create demand in the future, you should be thinking about A&M continue to increase. Obviously, we'll look at ways to optimize A&M, and we have very strong measures on ROI and best ways to invest in our brands, but you should be thinking about as a company that continues to build brands, continues to innovate, continues to create value through investment in consumer. And obviously we also create a lot of demand through our push model to some of the questions that were asked before. You should be thinking about our selling and distribution costs not only as a cost, but also as a way for us to execute very granularly across millions and millions of point of sale around the world where we reach the final point of sale and we create, I would say visibility for our brands and impulse for our brands, which are relevant if you think about the categories where we compete. Great. So thank you, everybody. I'm glad everybody's happy that Jamie is back and I see a lot of bonding. Great, but obviously thank you for the confidence that you've placed in our investment and we look forward to seeing many of you at Cagny in a couple of weeks and having a longer conversation there. Thank you very much."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning and welcome to PepsiCo's 2023 Third Quarter Earnings Question-and-Answer Session. Your lines have been placed on listen-only until it's your turn to ask a question. Today's call is being recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Ravi Pamnani, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Pamnani, you may begin.\nRavi Pamnani: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I hope everyone has had a chance this morning to review our press release and prepared remarks both of which are available on our website. Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. We may make forward-looking statements on today's call, including about our business plans, guidance and outlook. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties and only reflect our view as of today, October 10th, and we are under no obligation to update. When discussing our results, we refer to non-GAAP measures, which exclude certain items from reported results. Please refer to our third quarter 2023 earnings release and third quarter 2023 Form 10-Q available on pepsico.com for definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures and additional information regarding our results, including a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from forward-looking statements. Joining me today are PepsiCo's Chairman and CEO, Ramon Laguarta; and PepsiCo's Vice Chairman and CFO, Hugh Johnston. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question. And with that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nBryan Spillane: Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone.\nRamon Laguarta: Good morning, Bryan.\nBryan Spillane: So my question is just around volume. There's been a lot of focus on that topic, not just for Pepsi, but just, I think, more broadly. So I know in the prepared remarks, there's a little bit -- there's some commentary about a shift to small packs. But maybe, Ramon, if you could touch on what was happening specifically volumetrically for PBNA in the quarter? And then kind of relative to what your outlook was for volumes coming out of 2Q, just how that might have evolved as the quarter progressed?\nRamon Laguarta: Yeah, good morning, Bryan. Let me step back beyond PBNA to the broader company. We're seeing sequential volume improvement, if you take the last few quarters. So globally, we're improving our volume. But more philosophically how we're thinking about how we're managing the company. There's two big variables that we're trying to optimize. One is consumer interaction with our brands. And the proxy we're using for that is units or specific purchasing act. And then the other one is obviously margin for the overall business. And those are the two variables that we're maximizing. In both cases, units are growing much faster than volume. And we're seeing that -- you mentioned consumers moving to smaller packs. We're also in a way, facilitating that through our pricing and mix strategy. And then we're obviously optimizing margin that, as you saw it was a good improvement in our margin across the company and the particular businesses that you referred to. So that's how we're thinking about volume and margin. When it comes to PBNA, we've been a bit more aggressive than in the other businesses with regards to volume optimization. And we've made some decisions, especially around take home water that we're able to prune some promotions that were not profitable for the business, and that has almost 2.5 points of volume impact. So that's how we're managing volume. It's clearly an important variable for us, but for efficiency in the plants and some others that unit transaction and consumer interaction with the brands are the metrics that we're trying to maximize as we're making these trade-offs between volume you know net revenue and margin expansion.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is open.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Carrying on Bryan's question, but taking it a little bit further out into 2024, and it was great to get kind of some preliminary perspective on next year, so early. But I was also curious how you're thinking about that balancing volume and price mix as we go into next year because price mix has continued to outperform? And so just kind of thinking about that more forward look as well. Thanks.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, Lauren, we'll give you more details, obviously, in February when it comes to the actual composition of some of our key metrics. But what I would tell you at this point, as we've obviously seen all the commercial plans from the different markets and our innovation plans and our productivity plans and our cost trends that there will be still a higher inflation in our business. And therefore, there will be higher price mix versus not the last couple of years, but if you think about the historical price mix that we had in the past, I think '24 will have a bit more elevated price mix in the equation than in the previous years.\nHugh Johnston: Yes. So right, to add a finer point to Ramon's comments, Lauren, if you think of pre-pandemic inflation being kind of in that 2%, 3% range, inflation is going to be a little elevated relative to that. And our pricing will be roughly in line with inflation. So that should at least give you a rough sense as to how things might shake out.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you. Good morning. So going back to your comments about volumes in PBNA. Was that specific to the quarter or should we still see about this 2.5% headwind to volumes you quoted and potentially into the first half of 2024? And if you can also comment on the volumes in Latin America, so how we should be thinking towards the end of the year and potentially into 2024? Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, Andrea. So with regards to PBNA, we continue to optimize the portfolio. So we should be probably thinking about a few -- a couple more quarters where we will continue to see volume decisions that, again, we're trying to maximize units and transactions. And we're trying to continue to optimize the margin of the business. And you saw that this quarter and the balance of the year, we feel very good about the margin expansion in PBNA. Now when it comes to LatAm, there is mostly our snack business, what you see there in our numbers. And we've been making, again, decisions around affordability making sure that our brands continue to be within affordable price points to consumers that we know that this possible income is limited, and they make decisions a lot based on price points. So we've been reducing size -- portion size of our products, making sure that we're still very affordable. And that has a repercussion on -- has an impact on the actual volume. But again, the transactions are much healthier. And that's a metric that we used to assess the health of the business with regards to consumer along with brand equity and some other metrics that we use, obviously, to understand full consumer picture. So we'll continue to make optimizations, Andrea, as we need to absorb inflation and make sure that our brands remain a choice for consumers that are clearly more limited in their disposable income.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey, guys. Good morning. Could you just discuss the motivation behind the decision to provide guidance for 2024 a bit earlier than is typical? What do you think your level of visibility is at this point versus a typical year? And as you look out maybe what are some of the areas that give you confidence and what might be some of the areas where there's more uncertainty particularly given the volatile consumer environment here? Thanks.\nHugh Johnston : Hi, Dara. I can answer that one. I think in general, as we build the plans, we're focused on a couple of things. Number one is obviously the level of commodity inflation, and you know we buy forward about nine months. So that's roughly in line with the past. Number two is the balance of the PepsiCo cost structure. And as we've talked about the last couple of quarters, we've put even higher focus than we've had in the past on driving productivity and driving out unnecessary costs using the tools that we've discussed, the investments in digitalization, the investments in global business services, the investments in driving out overlaps within the organization. Because that work has been going on for a longer period of time, I think that gave us earlier line of sight into what we would expect our cost outcome to be for next year. And then number three, we're in a good spot in many of the developed markets in terms of our commercial plans. We do joint business planning with our customers. And we're probably in line to maybe even a little ahead of where we've been historically with all of that. So given the information was available to us a little bit earlier and given there was undoubtedly questions in the investment community on what '24 look like given the evolving pricing and inflationary environment, we thought it was prudent to at least give some indication of what guidance would look like in '24. So that's what drove the decision.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS. Your line is open.\nPeter Grom: Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone. I actually wanted to follow up on Dara's question there. But just more in the context of your actual performance versus your initial expectations historically because it's really been a while since organic revenue growth has actually fallen short of your initial outlook. So can you maybe just characterize your confidence in the '24 outlook at this stage and really whether or not you've embedded enough conservatism just given what remains a pretty choppy backdrop for the consumer? Thanks.\nHugh Johnston: Sure. Happy to address that. We obviously have a long history here of meeting or exceeding expectations, both our internal expectations as well as the guidance, including this quarter, where we beat revenue and we beat EPS. In fact, we've now met or beat consensus for 55 straight quarters. So we tend to be, I think, appropriately conservative in the way that we communicate to you all. So from that perspective I think you can go into 2024 with a similar expectation that we should at least achieve the numbers that we've laid out for you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nNik Modi: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hugh, I was hoping maybe you can just provide some of the macro underpinnings that kind of go into your 2024 viewpoints at this point? Just would love to kind of get your state of the union on the consumer or the economy and kind of how you guys are thinking that will shape up as you go through 2024? Thanks.\nHugh Johnston: Sure. Why don't I start and then Ramon, obviously, you're super deep on the consumer as well, but I'm happy to start on this one. Number one, I do think that we see the consumer right now being more selective, and you see it in a variety of ways, right? You see some trade down in terms of channels of trade that they're purchasing products in. You see some orientation toward value. At the same time, the things that I usually look at with the consumer to detect whether there's high stress, we see good results, Nik. Number one is the convenience store channel. Typically, when gas prices are up and consumer incomes are stressed, you see revenue in those channels under stress as well. For Q3, we saw revenue up 5% in beverages and 8% in foods in the convenience channel. Number two is food service, that's also typically a leading indicator, that's still growing double-digits. So I think we've gone into the year with an approach that says, given all that I laid out during Dara's question, we expect the consumer to continue to be cautious. And to the degree that they are worse than that, we've got cost plans in place that we would use to mitigate whatever challenges we face. But we think our revenue outlook accommodates an increasingly cautious consumer next year.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. And the other thing I would say is all the long-term structural tailwinds of our categories will continue. If you think about urbanization, demographic shifts, lifestyles, et cetera, that have been driving our snacking categories or beverage category, they move from package-to-package. All those things will continue, and they drive a lot of our confidence in our categories, then obviously, we have almost completed. By now, our innovation plans, our commercial plans are -- I think we've got better at affordability and premiumization of our portfolio. So we think our share of market will be good next year as well. So that's what's driving our kind of confidence for next year.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Again, Bonnie Herzog, your line is open, and if you have a question, go ahead and ask it. It looks like they didn't have a question, do you want me to go and move on to the next person?\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, please.\nOperator: Okay. Sure thing. One moment. Our next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nChris Carey: Hi. Good morning.\nRamon Laguarta: Good morning, Chris.\nChris Carey: The inflation got a bit worse quarter-over-quarter in the PBNA segment, specifically, whereas in the rest of the segments, the trend is for continued easing. Can you just comment on some of the puts and takes that you're seeing from a commodity inflation standpoint in this segment, particularly and how the beverage side is driving the inflation expectations going into next year relative to food? I'm really speaking to Hugh's comments on above average inflation next year. And just given what we see from commodities in general, I'm trying to parse out where exactly that outlook is coming from? So thanks so much.\nHugh Johnston: Yes. Good morning, Chris. Chris, we don't get into by commodity levels of dissecting the numbers and guidance. That's something that historically we haven't done. As you know, the beverage segment is a little more packaging exposed in foods is just by virtue of the nature of the products. But I'd rather not go any further than that to get into the specifics of individual commodities for competitive reasons.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI.\nRobert Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. I just want to shift a little bit more kind of to the long-term. And I was just wondering if you can kind of give us a sense of the vision, your vision for the business, the beverage business and the food business in the US in light of your large investment in Instacart what you're trying to accomplish there? And other kind of strategic moves you're doing on the digital side and the -- all the underlying work that you're doing in terms of automation and productivity. Just kind of what do you see the business looking like in the future? And how does Instacart play into it? Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. Good question. Obviously, as Hugh was saying, we continue to drive the transformation of the business with automation at the center of it and digitalization as well. With digitalization, we're trying to obviously give much more precision to our decision-making across everything we do from how we talk to consumers, how we invest in our pricing with our customers? How we run our end-to-end operations from agro to the consumers? How we run our routing and everything all these activities that we do to generate value for our consumers. That is an investment we've been making over time. And we continue -- that still is the priority of the company to make the company more precise on intelligence and empower our front line to make better decisions all the time with the best information possible real-time and ideally forward information. So that is a continuous investment. Now when it comes to Instacart, there is a commercial relationship trying to enhance the capabilities of our DSD system with the shoppers that they have in store, and that is a continuous focus. I think DSD continues to be a competitive advantage. And I think we can enhance that capability with supporting activities from the Instacart shoppers. And that commercial relation led to a very minor investment in Instacart. And just to reinforce the commitment to the commercial relationship, there's nothing more than that in terms of a strategic long-term intentionality with that investment.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Stephen Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nStephen Powers: Hey, thanks. Two questions, if I could. One, just following up on the 24 outlook given the visibility you have on cost and the commercial planning at this point. Should we be expecting a relatively even performance and cadence of growth, both top and bottom line throughout the year? Or is there a reason to see that growth weighted first half versus second half? And then I did want to ask on Gatorade because the improvement we saw this quarter sequentially volumetrically did occur. It just didn't occur at quite the level of improvement that we were expecting from a shipment perspective. I think we went from down high single digits in the second quarter to down mid in the third. So I just would love some perspective on how you view that business performing? Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Listen, we will not go into more details on '24. We'll cover that in February in due June time. When it comes to Gatorade, we're very pleased with the G2DSD or the movement of Gatorade to the DSD platform over the summer. We're seeing sequential improvement in the performance of the brand. Better performance in August that we saw early in the summer, et cetera, inventory on display and a number of secondary location, et cetera. So that move is working. On the velocity of the brand, we also saw that the brand is improving its velocity. It is true that the emergence of Prime in the category took some share from Gatorade less than other brands in the category or less proportionally to the size of the brand. But I would say Prime impacted Gatorade in a way some transactions during the peak of the season. We're seeing that the size of Prime in the category getting smaller as we go into the fall, which gives us very good optimism that with the new infrastructure we have with our DSD business, some of the innovation with GFit, Gatorlyte, G Zero, our powders and tablets that are being very well received by consumers that we have a very good you know we're going to have a very good '24 for Gatorade. So we have a stronger foundation to go into next year with potentially weaker competition. But obviously, I don't know what their plans are.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Filippo Falorni with Citi. Your line is open.\nFilippo Falorni: Hey, good morning, everyone. So, clearly, there's been a lot of concern in the market around adoption of GLP-1 drugs in the US and the potential impact on your business. So maybe can you comment a bit of what you've seen so far based on your consumer studies, both on the beverage and food side? And how you're thinking that can evolve over the next couple of years, change in consumer behaviors? And then from a Pepsi-specific standpoint, what changes can you make to adopt your portfolio to these new consumer preferences that could emerge if the adoption is greater than that? Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Thank you, Filippo. Good question. Listen, obviously, we're looking at this you know along with many other positive and negative potential risk for our business and our category. So far, the impact is negligible in our business. Overall, if you take global consumption, there are obviously a lot of question marks with regards to the obesity drugs when it comes to medical testing or scalability of the usage of this or what is the impact really on consumer choices. So a lot of question marks. We continue to believe that all the structural positive trends that we had to our categories remain, and I mentioned, I referred to that earlier in the conversation. So we're seeing urbanization as a big driver of adoption of our categories. We're seeing middle class development. We're seeing lifestyle and the people snacking to eat, some meals becoming more mini-meals and much more unstructured during the day, being a big driver of our categories, both beverages and snacks. So we're seeing a lot of tailwinds that will continue to drive our categories. Of course, we're observing the growth of these new drugs and its potential impact. The other thing we're looking at is our strategy sound when it comes to portfolio transformation. And everything we've been doing for the last five, six years when it comes to reducing sodium, reducing fat, reducing sugar, reducing the portions of our products, adding some new cooking methods to our snacks, those are all very positive trends that will help us pivot the portfolio if needed in the future. We'll continue to do it. Obviously, it's one of our key strategic pillars. So again, negligible impact today, a lot of these structural trends that are in our category, I think, remain very solid and even we see them accelerating. And our portfolio strategy, we think, is very solid when it comes to a potential protection against some of these future developments 5, 10 years from now.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge. One moment.\nBrett Cooper: Good morning. A question for you on the North American Beverage business. You've said in the past your goal is to hold share in that business. When you begin to add things like CELSIUS as an organic business, I'd love to hear how you assess the beverage performance and you're looking to hold share with the own portfolio or you distributed brand as a component to hold share? Thanks.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. Sorry, we missed a little bit of the question, but hopefully, we got what you're trying to ask. CELSIUS obviously is part of our energy drink strategy. We said we had multiple pillars and our ability to distribute in our system, some third-party brands is part of that strategy. Obviously, CELSIUS continues to grow. We've doubled the distribution and the presence in store of the brand in the last year or so especially in the convenience channel, which is a key channel for energy consumption. That participation of CELSIUS in our track makes our full system more efficient. It makes our salesmen more relevant in the store. It makes our cooler more a go-to cooler in the store and those are all positive that eventually have a halo effect as well in the rest of our portfolio. So I don't know if I'm answering the question because really I couldn't -- we couldn't hear it very well. But I guess you get a sense of the importance of CELSIUS in our energy strategy and the value we get from both the actual monetization of that distribution, but also the halo it has in the rest of the portfolio.\nRamon Laguarta: Okay. So thank you very much for your questions and for joining us today. And especially thank you for the confidence you've placed in us with your investment. We hope you all stay safe and healthy. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.",

Typically, when gas prices are up and consumer incomes are stressed, you see revenue in those channels under stress as well. For Q3, we saw revenue up 5% in beverages and 8% in foods in the convenience channel. Number two is food service, that's also typically a leading indicator, that's still growing double-digits. So I think we've gone into the year with an approach that says, given all that I laid out during Dara's question, we expect the consumer to continue to be cautious. And to the degree that they are worse than that, we've got cost plans in place that we would use to mitigate whatever challenges we face. But we think our revenue outlook accommodates an increasingly cautious consumer next year. Yes. Good morning, Chris. Chris, we don't get into by commodity levels of dissecting the numbers and guidance. That's something that historically we haven't done. As you know, the beverage segment is a little more packaging exposed in foods is just by virtue of the nature of the products. But I'd rather not go any further than that to get into the specifics of individual commodities for competitive reasons."

            "content": "Good morning, Bryan. Yeah, good morning, Bryan. Let me step back beyond PBNA to the broader company. We're seeing sequential volume improvement, if you take the last few quarters. So globally, we're improving our volume. But more philosophically how we're thinking about how we're managing the company. There's two big variables that we're trying to optimize. One is consumer interaction with our brands. And the proxy we're using for that is units or specific purchasing act. And then the other one is obviously margin for the overall business. And those are the two variables that we're maximizing. In both cases, units are growing much faster than volume. And we're seeing that -- you mentioned consumers moving to smaller packs. We're also in a way, facilitating that through our pricing and mix strategy. And then we're obviously optimizing margin that, as you saw it was a good improvement in our margin across the company and the particular businesses that you referred to. So that's how we're thinking about volume and margin. When it comes to PBNA, we've been a bit more aggressive than in the other businesses with regards to volume optimization. And we've made some decisions, especially around take home water that we're able to prune some promotions that were not profitable for the business, and that has almost 2.5 points of volume impact. So that's how we're managing volume. It's clearly an important variable for us, but for efficiency in the plants and some others that unit transaction and consumer interaction with the brands are the metrics that we're trying to maximize as we're making these trade-offs between volume you know net revenue and margin expansion. Yes, Lauren, we'll give you more details, obviously, in February when it comes to the actual composition of some of our key metrics. But what I would tell you at this point, as we've obviously seen all the commercial plans from the different markets and our innovation plans and our productivity plans and our cost trends that there will be still a higher inflation in our business. And therefore, there will be higher price mix versus not the last couple of years, but if you think about the historical price mix that we had in the past, I think '24 will have a bit more elevated price mix in the equation than in the previous years. Yes, Andrea. So with regards to PBNA, we continue to optimize the portfolio. So we should be probably thinking about a few -- a couple more quarters where we will continue to see volume decisions that, again, we're trying to maximize units and transactions. And we're trying to continue to optimize the margin of the business. And you saw that this quarter and the balance of the year, we feel very good about the margin expansion in PBNA. Now when it comes to LatAm, there is mostly our snack business, what you see there in our numbers. And we've been making, again, decisions around affordability making sure that our brands continue to be within affordable price points to consumers that we know that this possible income is limited, and they make decisions a lot based on price points. So we've been reducing size -- portion size of our products, making sure that we're still very affordable. And that has a repercussion on -- has an impact on the actual volume. But again, the transactions are much healthier. And that's a metric that we used to assess the health of the business with regards to consumer along with brand equity and some other metrics that we use, obviously, to understand full consumer picture. So we'll continue to make optimizations, Andrea, as we need to absorb inflation and make sure that our brands remain a choice for consumers that are clearly more limited in their disposable income. Yes. And the other thing I would say is all the long-term structural tailwinds of our categories will continue. If you think about urbanization, demographic shifts, lifestyles, et cetera, that have been driving our snacking categories or beverage category, they move from package-to-package. All those things will continue, and they drive a lot of our confidence in our categories, then obviously, we have almost completed. By now, our innovation plans, our commercial plans are -- I think we've got better at affordability and premiumization of our portfolio. So we think our share of market will be good next year as well. So that's what's driving our kind of confidence for next year. Yes, please. Good morning, Chris. Yes. Good question. Obviously, as Hugh was saying, we continue to drive the transformation of the business with automation at the center of it and digitalization as well. With digitalization, we're trying to obviously give much more precision to our decision-making across everything we do from how we talk to consumers, how we invest in our pricing with our customers? How we run our end-to-end operations from agro to the consumers? How we run our routing and everything all these activities that we do to generate value for our consumers. That is an investment we've been making over time. And we continue -- that still is the priority of the company to make the company more precise on intelligence and empower our front line to make better decisions all the time with the best information possible real-time and ideally forward information. So that is a continuous investment. Now when it comes to Instacart, there is a commercial relationship trying to enhance the capabilities of our DSD system with the shoppers that they have in store, and that is a continuous focus. I think DSD continues to be a competitive advantage. And I think we can enhance that capability with supporting activities from the Instacart shoppers. And that commercial relation led to a very minor investment in Instacart. And just to reinforce the commitment to the commercial relationship, there's nothing more than that in terms of a strategic long-term intentionality with that investment. Listen, we will not go into more details on '24. We'll cover that in February in due June time. When it comes to Gatorade, we're very pleased with the G2DSD or the movement of Gatorade to the DSD platform over the summer. We're seeing sequential improvement in the performance of the brand. Better performance in August that we saw early in the summer, et cetera, inventory on display and a number of secondary location, et cetera. So that move is working. On the velocity of the brand, we also saw that the brand is improving its velocity. It is true that the emergence of Prime in the category took some share from Gatorade less than other brands in the category or less proportionally to the size of the brand. But I would say Prime impacted Gatorade in a way some transactions during the peak of the season. We're seeing that the size of Prime in the category getting smaller as we go into the fall, which gives us very good optimism that with the new infrastructure we have with our DSD business, some of the innovation with GFit, Gatorlyte, G Zero, our powders and tablets that are being very well received by consumers that we have a very good you know we're going to have a very good '24 for Gatorade. So we have a stronger foundation to go into next year with potentially weaker competition. But obviously, I don't know what their plans are. Thank you, Filippo. Good question. Listen, obviously, we're looking at this you know along with many other positive and negative potential risk for our business and our category. So far, the impact is negligible in our business. Overall, if you take global consumption, there are obviously a lot of question marks with regards to the obesity drugs when it comes to medical testing or scalability of the usage of this or what is the impact really on consumer choices. So a lot of question marks. We continue to believe that all the structural positive trends that we had to our categories remain, and I mentioned, I referred to that earlier in the conversation. So we're seeing urbanization as a big driver of adoption of our categories. We're seeing middle class development. We're seeing lifestyle and the people snacking to eat, some meals becoming more mini-meals and much more unstructured during the day, being a big driver of our categories, both beverages and snacks. So we're seeing a lot of tailwinds that will continue to drive our categories. Of course, we're observing the growth of these new drugs and its potential impact. The other thing we're looking at is our strategy sound when it comes to portfolio transformation. And everything we've been doing for the last five, six years when it comes to reducing sodium, reducing fat, reducing sugar, reducing the portions of our products, adding some new cooking methods to our snacks, those are all very positive trends that will help us pivot the portfolio if needed in the future. We'll continue to do it. Obviously, it's one of our key strategic pillars. So again, negligible impact today, a lot of these structural trends that are in our category, I think, remain very solid and even we see them accelerating. And our portfolio strategy, we think, is very solid when it comes to a potential protection against some of these future developments 5, 10 years from now. Yes. Sorry, we missed a little bit of the question, but hopefully, we got what you're trying to ask. CELSIUS obviously is part of our energy drink strategy. We said we had multiple pillars and our ability to distribute in our system, some third-party brands is part of that strategy. Obviously, CELSIUS continues to grow. We've doubled the distribution and the presence in store of the brand in the last year or so especially in the convenience channel, which is a key channel for energy consumption. That participation of CELSIUS in our track makes our full system more efficient. It makes our salesmen more relevant in the store. It makes our cooler more a go-to cooler in the store and those are all positive that eventually have a halo effect as well in the rest of our portfolio. So I don't know if I'm answering the question because really I couldn't -- we couldn't hear it very well. But I guess you get a sense of the importance of CELSIUS in our energy strategy and the value we get from both the actual monetization of that distribution, but also the halo it has in the rest of the portfolio. Okay. So thank you very much for your questions and for joining us today. And especially thank you for the confidence you've placed in us with your investment. We hope you all stay safe and healthy. Thank you very much."

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until it\u2019s your turn to ask a question. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Ravi Pamnani, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Pamnani, you may begin.\nRavi Pamnani: Thank you, operator and good morning, everyone. I hope everyone has had a chance this morning to review our press release and prepared remarks, both of which are available on our website. Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. We may make forward-looking statements on today's call, including about our business plans and updated 2023 guidance. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties and only reflect our view as of today, July 13, 2023 and we are under no obligation to update. When discussing our results, we refer to non-GAAP measures, which exclude certain items from reported results. Please refer to our second quarter 2023 earnings release and second quarter 2023 Form 10-Q available on pepsico.com for definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures and additional information regarding our results, including a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from forward-looking statements. Joining me today are PepsiCo's Chairman and CEO, Ramon Laguarta; and PepsiCo's Vice Chairman and CFO, Hugh Johnston. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question. And with that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nBryan Spillane: Thanks, operator. Hey. Good morning, Hugh. Good morning, Ramon.\nHugh Johnston: Good morning, Brian.\nRamon Laguarta: Good morning, Brian.\nBryan Spillane: So I guess, Ramon, my question is more kind of related just how you're looking at the bigger kind of macro picture in the consumer specifically. I think as we went into this year, there was an expectation that elasticity would increase and there'd be more of a consumer response, I guess, to all the inflation we're seeing really globally. So I guess it seems like in the first half volumes effectively have been better than expected. So I guess as we're kind of looking forward in the back half of the year and even into next year. Can you just kind of give us a little bit of a some insight into how what you're seeing with the consumer? What your expectations are and just how that may have differed from what we were seeing or what you were thinking maybe going into the start of the year?\nRamon Laguarta: Yeah. Good morning, Brian. Yeah. So I'll give you two, like, -- there are two areas where which we're looking at very carefully. One is on the supply side, things like become much better. We're seeing much better flow of materials from suppliers. We're seeing in general better labor market and that has helped us to run a better company. So that's one area we're looking at very carefully. During COVID (ph), it was not perfect. It's becoming better and that's why you will see that our costs are performing better and how we're slowing (ph) some of the net revenue down into the bottom line. On the consumer front as well, we were planning the year with more of historical data on elasticities, both in developed and developing markets. And we're seeing in the majority of the markets where we operate, we're seeing better elasticities and that has continued to be during the first half of the year, even though we're seeing lower income consumers strategizing around obviously optimizing their budgets, but we're seeing the majority of consumers staying within our categories, staying within our brands. And it's remarkable what our marketing teams are, commercial teams have been doing to minimize elasticities. In some respect it is what we have been investing for the last few years. Our brands are stronger.The perceived value of our products is better than it was. And obviously, we've been able to raise prices and consumers stay within our brands. Now we're seeing consumers making some adjustments, right? We're seeing consumers shopping in more stores than before. They're looking for better deals. They're starting to look for optimization. They're going to channels that have better perceived value. They're buying more in Dollar stores or they buy more in mass or in clubs. So every segment of the consumer is making adjustment. Overall, we're seeing very positive. And I think it has to do with the levels of unemployment that we're seeing all around the world. Unemployment is very low. In most of the economies, if you think about developed markets, but also developing markets. So markets like Mexico record low unemployment, some markets in Asia as well. So we're seeing overall very, very good consumer behavior, especially when it refers to our categories and that's why we raised guidance on our top line and because of the first factor, we raised guidance on the second -- on the bottom line as well.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey, thanks. So maybe can we just extend that question a little bit? You mentioned some of the strength in Mexico. International came in very strong in general in the quarter. Obviously, you have a lot of different countries and regions within that and two distinct businesses. But just high level thoughts on what drove the international strength the state of the consumer internationally? And then I'm thinking particularly about the pricing side of things. Obviously, we're sort of cycling tougher comps going forward, globally, not just internationally, but can you also give us an update on the competitive environment you're seeing around the world heading into a period when in theory pricing drops-off as we cycle these tougher comps? Thanks.\nRamon Laguarta: Yeah. Thank you. Thank you, Dara There are obviously some markets around the world that are suffering from currency situations and there we have to adjust to the reality. And I'm talking about Turkey, Pakistan, Egypt, Argentina. So there are subsegment of markets where I would not apply the global rule and we're acting very specifically in those markets. But beyond those markets overall, we're seeing and I think it's because what I was saying earlier, unemployment levels being very low. We're seeing consumers continue to behave in a positive way. Our category penetrations in most of those markets is still relatively low, and we continue to be an affordable treat in those markets. So our products continue to be part of the repertoire that they can afford and they make trade-offs to stay within our category. So we're seeing that in a very positive way. Now competitive wise, I think there's very rational competition across the world from what I -- from what we can observe, in the first half of the year, both in our snacks and our beverage business. And that's what we're assuming in the balance of the year.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is open.\nLauren Lieberman: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I'm trying to get a little bit more specific around the [Technical Difficulty]\nRamon Laguarta: Lauren, hi. We cannot hear you very well. You come in. [Multiple Speakers] you're breaking up. I don't know, if it's our phone or it's -- now it seems to be better.\nLauren Lieberman: Is it better a little?\nRamon Laguarta: A little better.\nLauren Lieberman: I will hang up, and call back.\nRamon Laguarta: Okay. Thank you. Sorry for that.\nLauren Lieberman: Bye. No.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nBonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you. Good morning, Ramon and Hugh. I wanted to circle back on your guidance. I just had a question on it. Your new guidance implies, I guess, above algo growth in the second half, but I guess doesn't really imply much bottom line leverage. So I wanted to understand if there might be some level of conservatism baked in or if you're planning on stepping up your reinvestments in the second half or if there are any incremental headwinds we should be aware of? Thanks.\nHugh Johnston: Yeah. Great question, Bonnie. It's Hugh. You're right in that, the balance or the -- yes, the balance of the year guidance is in effect 7.5% revenue, 8.5% EPS. That's the squeeze on the balance of the year. What is implied in the margins are two things. Number one, actually continued strong productivity. And if you look at where we are year-to-date, our pricing and our commodities are right in line with each other. So the margin improvement that you saw in the quarter 132 bps on gross and 45 on net is entirely driven by productivity, which is reflective of the productivity investments that we've made over the last couple of years in things like digitalization and in automation and then leveraging Global Business Services to standardize how we operate that's actually kind of been a pivot this year. And that's a pivot that I think you'll see ongoing, not just in the back half of this year, but actually into \u201824 and beyond, where we're getting margin improvement out of these productivity initiatives. And obviously, the margins are quite good year-to-date entirely driven by productivity. In the back half, you'll continue to see that level of productivity improvement, if anything, it will accelerate, but we are continuing to invest. We're investing in advertising and marketing and A&M was up 50 bps in the second quarter. You're going to continue to see us invest in A&M. You're going to continue to see us invest in capabilities. And our investment cycles tend to be more back half oriented than they are front half oriented when we have a sense as to how the year is going to turn out. So that's what you're seeing in the implied guidance in the balance of the year. It's not that the productivity is going to diminish. It's not that anything is going on with the pricing other than the overlap effects of pricing. It's really a reflection of some of the productivity being reinvested it in the back half of the year, so that we continue that strong momentum into \u201824 and beyond.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Vivien Azer with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nVivien Azer: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. I was looking to actually follow-up\u2026\nHugh Johnston: Hi, Vivien.\nVivien Azer: Good morning. On Bonnie's question, but just to drill down on PBNA margins, down a little bit year-over-year. In your prepared remarks, you reiterated your confidence in expanding margins on a full year basis. I was hoping you could just expand on some of the headwinds that you saw in the quarter and what gives you confidence on the full year margin outlook for the segment specifically? Thank you.\nHugh Johnston: Yeah. Hi, Vivien. It's Hugh. The margins in PBNA was down in the second quarter. We had a big gain on an asset transaction in 2022. We're cycling over that transaction in '23. And for the full year on PBNA, you'll see the margins up in a healthy way, and north of 100 basis points.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is open.\nLauren Lieberman: Hi. Is this better, hopefully.\nHugh Johnston: It is. Much better.\nLauren Lieberman: Okay. Cool. I\u2019m still sitting in the same place. Okay. I was going to ask -- sorry about that, I was going to ask about Gatorade. So tons of innovation activity, you guys have talked about it. We're seeing it very much in the marketplace. And in the release, you talked about Gatorade being up double-digits in the quarter. But when we look at Nielsen, it shows something that significantly trails that. And so I was just curious, I guess, about mix of on track, how much of maybe some of the performance you're seeing has to do with incremental shelf space and distribution given the breadth of innovation and new product activity there has been?\nRamon Laguarta: Yeah, Lauren. I think the -- I think there are a couple of factors. The G2 DSD has a meaningful impact on timing on when we reflect our sales and when the consumer actually buys compared to previous years. So we're much -- the cycle has reduced substantially, given our DSD -- and that might have some implications on the readings. We feel good about the sports category even though it has been cold in some parts of the country for the month of June and so on. But in general, within the categories continues to have healthy metrics in terms of penetration and usage and everything else. Our innovation G FIT, Gatorade and most importantly for us long term, our powders and tablets is going very, very well. So we believe in those subsegments continue to develop along with G Zero, which continues to attract new consumers to the category. So we feel good. We're seeing all the execution metrics for Gatorade improving. So inventory on display, service levels to our customers, which were a little bit handicapped in the past due to supply chain issues. So we're seeing the health of the brand and the category at a pretty good level. It is true that there are some new entrants in the category like Prime that have been taken some space, especially with younger audiences. They've been affecting Gatorade, but they've been affecting more of some other brands in the category that had that kind of profile. So we feel good about the execution. We feel good about how the brand is performing. We've increased advertising substantially against Gatorade and we'll continue to do so in the back end of the summer and the year. So we feel good about Gatorade. And I think the G2 DSD is going to be a structural move that will give us better execution and capacity to respond to weather changes and opportunity in the marketplace going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nAndrea Teixeira: Hi. Good morning, everyone. So my question is more on the balance of pricing and volumes. Obviously, you're lapping some of the most strong price increases from last year. And you're expecting, I would say, are you expecting still high-single digits in the second half with volumes more flattish or it's still negative because to get to the math of 10%, perhaps you're lapping Russia, but it seems that the UK and France and Spain have lagged a bit for the top line. So I'm trying to reconcile the implied organic 7.5%-ish with better volumes. So in other words, you are seeing some improvement there as pricing kind of resolve for the consumer. How we should be thinking to Ramon's comment on some of the discounters and that happening or are you still seeing room for continued pricing, but to a lesser extent, as you mentioned, at CNBC interview? Thank you.\nHugh Johnston: Hi. Ramon, go ahead.\nRamon Laguarta: Yeah. No, we can have Hugh continue the CNBC interview.\nHugh Johnston: Hi, Andrea. So balance sheet (ph) revenue, the squeeze is 7.5%. What I think we're going to see is volumes will be sort of in the flattish range for the balance of the year. Obviously, there's still carryover pricing. And I don't think we'll do anything different than our normal cycles on pricing in the balance of the year. You tend to see pricing in the beverage business in the fourth quarter. Frito tends not to go in the balance of the year, but that's TBD. We'll see how the year plays out. But the implication that we have in the forecast right now is kind of back to our relatively more normal pricing. And obviously, that sets us up for '24. And then a lot of ways to think about it as the back half of the year is a little bit ahead of our long-term guidance, which I think is the momentum that we'll carry forward.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.\nChristopher Carey: Hi. Good morning.\nHugh Johnston: Good morning, Chris.\nChristopher Carey: Hey, Hugh. Just one quick follow-up on the gross margin. You said that the pricing tailwinds year-to-date are basically in line or offsetting inflation. I couldn't tell if you said commodity inflation. I guess what I see is about 600 basis point benefit from pricing and a 400 basis point headwind from commodity inflation. So it seems like you're actually tracking ahead. But when you made that comment? Was that a total inflation comment or is there a mix tailwind as well? So maybe price is actually below what we can see in price mix. So I just wanted to clarify that. And I guess connected is just in the context of full year gross margin, unless there's some offsets, it seems like you could see some notable expansion for the full year. Am I reading that wrong that's going to allow you to invest or are there some offsets I'm not thinking about? So thanks, so much.\nHugh Johnston: Yeah. Hey, Chris. It's Hugh. So what I had said was pricing was up exactly in line with our commodity inflation. So both are in the teens and the numbers are basically identical. So that obviously is not driving margin improvement because those two are essentially offsetting each other. In terms of the balance of the year margins, we have previously communicated, we'd be at least equal with where we were last year. We're now clearly going to be ahead of where we were last year. So margins will improve this year as opposed to the at least equal that we had previously communicated. And the driver, of course, behind that is productivity. And the things that I've been talking about and Ramon has been talking about for a while, we've made these investments in digitalization. We've made these investments in automation. We've been investing in building out a global business services operation. And I think that's the pivot that you see happening inside of our numbers right now is that the margins will improve, I think, on a sustained basis and it will be driven by productivity and that productivity will come out of those three buckets. So I don't think this is a one or two quarter thing. I think you're going to see margins continue to steadily improve this year and into the coming years.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS. Your line is open.\nPeter Grom: Thanks, operator and good morning, everyone. So I was hoping to get some updated thoughts on the Celsius agreement and kind of what you've learned over the past several months? Obviously, the growth has been tremendous, but how has that outsized growth or better-than-expected share performance shifted your view as to whether this is the right structure for PepsiCo longer term? And then just having previously distributed Bang and kind of given the Bang and Monster News, do you have any updated thoughts as to whether this could impact the growth trajectory for Celsius looking ahead? Thanks.\nRamon Laguarta: Yeah. Good morning. I think there's a couple of realizations on this. The number one is that the power of our distribution system our DSD machine in the U.S. is very powerful. And obviously, you can see by the increase in the numerical distribution and the quality of execution. So that's one element that makes us feel very strong about our capabilities in the U.S. Beverages. Second, I think Celsius is a brand that is capturing new consumers to the energy category, consumers that were not consuming energy drinks for many reasons in the past, flavor or image or some other elements. That is a positive. The category keeps expanding and we're glad that that's in our portfolio. And we're working together with Celsius to see additional international opportunities, whether we can expand the brand in some other markets, especially more developed markets where the category is a bit more developed. Those are the three conclusions that we're taking from our relationship so far.\nHugh Johnston: Right. And the only thing I'd add is, we're very happy with the investment we've made and we feel very comfortable where we are with that company right now. I think we're both benefiting from each other's capabilities.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nRobert Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much and congratulations on another terrific quarter. I'm wondering if we could focus on air, we haven't spent that much time talking about in the past, but is really doing well and that's in Europe. And maybe perhaps parse out for us, remind us the business mix in Europe between snacks and beverages. And then talk a little bit about how the business is doing so well, very significant pricing. I know you had relatively easy comps and whether you think that there are structural long-term changes in the pricing dynamics in Europe? I mean, for many years, Europe was very deflationary and extremely tough retail. I'm sure a lot of that persists, but are there clues here that maybe there are structural changes in that environment that can go forward? Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Yeah. Thank you. Yes, good -- good diagnostic. The fact that our European business clearly has had a terrific first half of the year and we're expecting that to continue in the second half. A couple of elements, I think we have a portfolio that is quite robust on the snack side. We have very good market positions in snacks. And we have good challenging positions in beverages and our zero propositions in Europe are growing very fast and they're taking market share in some of the more affluent markets in Europe. So good portfolio mix and good focus by the team on growing that portfolio. As you said, we were a little bit late to pricing last year in '22. And the team has been courageous and has been able to find win-win solutions with our customers in '23. So as you see from the numbers, good pricing levels, but what is also very remarkable in Europe is the levels of productivity that the team has been executing through simplification of the business and everything else that Hugh was saying about digitalization and automation and also moving some service to essential points that we can service the businesses more effectively, more efficiently. So good work by the European team, both on portfolio managed simplification and then in driving productivity. So we feel good about Europe. We have a very strong business in both Central Europe, Eastern Europe and parts of the economy that are growing faster. So we feel good about the portfolio composition and the business going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Stephen Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nStephen Powers: Great. Thanks and good morning. Maybe putting a final bow around Bryan's original top line question. I guess, Hugh, the volume cadence that you implied a little earlier, down 2% or so in the first half based on results reported to date, and if I heard you correctly flattish in the second half. How does that compare with your outlook coming into the year? Because I guess, just stepping back, I'm trying to get a better sense of whether the 4 points of upside you now see in organic growth versus that February forecast is more driven by better volumes or whether the upside is really driven by greater-than-expected price mix realization or whether it's some kind of combination? Thanks.\nHugh Johnston: Yeah. Hi, Steve. Good morning. It's a combination. Volumes are certainly a bit better than we expected and price realization is a little better than we had expected as well. So it's a combo. It's not dominant one or the other.\nRamon Laguarta: Yeah. And I would say the commercial teams have done a great job in minimizing elasticity. So going into the year, of course, we were assuming a level of elasticity that was more based on historical levels. I think we've been positively surprised on the strength of the brands in some markets. And obviously, as I said earlier, the consequence of the investment we've been making. But the way the teams have executed innovation, have executed range expansion, multiple displays around the store and some of the tactics we normally use to drive volume and minimize elasticities have been really well executed. I think we link it as well to as being a more intelligent company in a broader sense, having better data, having better digitalization and execution capabilities. So it is all connected. And yeah, we feel good about how the business performed in that respect versus what we had initially planned.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Filippo Falorni with Citi. Your line is open.\nFilippo Falorni: Hey. Good morning, everyone. A quick question on Frito-Lay North America. Clearly, very strong results in the quarter. But over the last couple of weeks, we have seen a bit of a slowdown in track channels. So the first question is, what do you think is driving the recent slowdown, partly is obviously cycling high price realization, but also just general sense on what you're seeing from a volume standpoint. And then, also why are you seeing untracked channels in that business? Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Yeah. The Frito-Lay is having a tremendous year again on top of a very good '22. And it's been driven by our large brands performing very well, linking to what I said earlier about very strong brand programs and commercial programs. The away-from-home business and the small store independent business where there is a lot of impulse consumption is not really reflected normally by a lot of the reports that you've probably seen. So that might be a gap there. And obviously, in the summer, this is very relevant as people move around more. But we're seeing -- the only thing we're seeing in Frito-Lay in the last few weeks is the lapping versus the P6 price increase we did last year. So that's the only element. Everything else, we're seeing a much better supply chain. So our service levels to our key customers is improving a lot. That's good news because we were a little bit handicapped in the last year and first half of this year, we're seeing much broader portfolio. So the smaller SKUs that drive -- we know they drive frequency and they drive penetration in some sub-consumers. So we're seeing a lot of positive trends, some of our innovation. If you think about minis or if you think about some of the new launches like the jerky product or a relaunch of the nuts and seeds, our permissible portfolio, they're really doing very well, along with our big brands. So we feel good about the portfolio composition and the continued executional capabilities of Frito to drive availability universally almost. So we're feeling good about the business.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our last question comes from Gerald Pascarelli with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.\nGerald Pascarelli: Hi. Thanks very much for the question. Mine is also on energy drinks, specifically regarding near-term distribution opportunities. You've obviously been a great partner for Celsius since you took over distribution of their products, which has been readily apparent in measured channels. But looking forward, how do you think about the opportunity to penetrate some of the non-measured channels that have yet to scratch the surface, specifically related to food service, like, college campuses as an example? I mean the comprehensive rollout of these products, something we should expect in the back half of this year or is that more of a 2024 opportunity? I guess any incremental color you could provide on timing and then the potential halo effect that Celsius could have on your legacy portfolio of energy products would be helpful? Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Yeah. Listen, we take our energy products along with the rest of the portfolio where it makes sense, right? So some of the channels you're mentioning like college universities, they are very large channels for our energy execution, right? So when you go to a normal campus, you will see a Rockstar, you would see Celsius, you will see our coffee business. You will see the new Gatorade energy Fast Twitch. So you will see all these execution. Wherever there are consumers that are looking for energy, we tend to be there. So we're not holding on any opportunities at this point to maximize the reach of our brands. So no, don't wait for '24. We're executing as we speak.\nHugh Johnston: Great. So I think this is the end of the conversation. Thank you very much. Thank you all of you for joining us today and especially for the confidence that you've placed in us with your investments. We hope that you all have a great summer and stay safe and healthy. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Hugh Johnston",
            "content": "Good morning, Brian. Yeah. Great question, Bonnie. It's Hugh. You're right in that, the balance or the -- yes, the balance of the year guidance is in effect 7.5% revenue, 8.5% EPS. That's the squeeze on the balance of the year. What is implied in the margins are two things. Number one, actually continued strong productivity. And if you look at where we are year-to-date, our pricing and our commodities are right in line with each other. So the margin improvement that you saw in the quarter 132 bps on gross and 45 on net is entirely driven by productivity, which is reflective of the productivity investments that we've made over the last couple of years in things like digitalization and in automation and then leveraging Global Business Services to standardize how we operate that's actually kind of been a pivot this year. And that's a pivot that I think you'll see ongoing, not just in the back half of this year, but actually into \u201824 and beyond, where we're getting margin improvement out of these productivity initiatives. And obviously, the margins are quite good year-to-date entirely driven by productivity. In the back half, you'll continue to see that level of productivity improvement, if anything, it will accelerate, but we are continuing to invest. We're investing in advertising and marketing and A&M was up 50 bps in the second quarter. You're going to continue to see us invest in A&M. You're going to continue to see us invest in capabilities. And our investment cycles tend to be more back half oriented than they are front half oriented when we have a sense as to how the year is going to turn out. So that's what you're seeing in the implied guidance in the balance of the year. It's not that the productivity is going to diminish. It's not that anything is going on with the pricing other than the overlap effects of pricing. It's really a reflection of some of the productivity being reinvested it in the back half of the year, so that we continue that strong momentum into \u201824 and beyond. Hi, Vivien. Yeah. Hi, Vivien. It's Hugh. The margins in PBNA was down in the second quarter. We had a big gain on an asset transaction in 2022. We're cycling over that transaction in '23. And for the full year on PBNA, you'll see the margins up in a healthy way, and north of 100 basis points. It is. Much better. Hi. Ramon, go ahead. Hi, Andrea. So balance sheet (ph) revenue, the squeeze is 7.5%. What I think we're going to see is volumes will be sort of in the flattish range for the balance of the year. Obviously, there's still carryover pricing. And I don't think we'll do anything different than our normal cycles on pricing in the balance of the year. You tend to see pricing in the beverage business in the fourth quarter. Frito tends not to go in the balance of the year, but that's TBD. We'll see how the year plays out. But the implication that we have in the forecast right now is kind of back to our relatively more normal pricing. And obviously, that sets us up for '24. And then a lot of ways to think about it as the back half of the year is a little bit ahead of our long-term guidance, which I think is the momentum that we'll carry forward. Good morning, Chris. Yeah. Hey, Chris. It's Hugh. So what I had said was pricing was up exactly in line with our commodity inflation. So both are in the teens and the numbers are basically identical. So that obviously is not driving margin improvement because those two are essentially offsetting each other. In terms of the balance of the year margins, we have previously communicated, we'd be at least equal with where we were last year. We're now clearly going to be ahead of where we were last year. So margins will improve this year as opposed to the at least equal that we had previously communicated. And the driver, of course, behind that is productivity. And the things that I've been talking about and Ramon has been talking about for a while, we've made these investments in digitalization. We've made these investments in automation. We've been investing in building out a global business services operation. And I think that's the pivot that you see happening inside of our numbers right now is that the margins will improve, I think, on a sustained basis and it will be driven by productivity and that productivity will come out of those three buckets. So I don't think this is a one or two quarter thing. I think you're going to see margins continue to steadily improve this year and into the coming years. Right. And the only thing I'd add is, we're very happy with the investment we've made and we feel very comfortable where we are with that company right now. I think we're both benefiting from each other's capabilities. Yeah. Hi, Steve. Good morning. It's a combination. Volumes are certainly a bit better than we expected and price realization is a little better than we had expected as well. So it's a combo. It's not dominant one or the other. Great. So I think this is the end of the conversation. Thank you very much. Thank you all of you for joining us today and especially for the confidence that you've placed in us with your investments. We hope that you all have a great summer and stay safe and healthy. Thank you."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Ramon Laguarta",
            "content": "Good morning, Brian. Yeah. Good morning, Brian. Yeah. So I'll give you two, like, -- there are two areas where which we're looking at very carefully. One is on the supply side, things like become much better. We're seeing much better flow of materials from suppliers. We're seeing in general better labor market and that has helped us to run a better company. So that's one area we're looking at very carefully. During COVID (ph), it was not perfect. It's becoming better and that's why you will see that our costs are performing better and how we're slowing (ph) some of the net revenue down into the bottom line. On the consumer front as well, we were planning the year with more of historical data on elasticities, both in developed and developing markets. And we're seeing in the majority of the markets where we operate, we're seeing better elasticities and that has continued to be during the first half of the year, even though we're seeing lower income consumers strategizing around obviously optimizing their budgets, but we're seeing the majority of consumers staying within our categories, staying within our brands. And it's remarkable what our marketing teams are, commercial teams have been doing to minimize elasticities. In some respect it is what we have been investing for the last few years. Our brands are stronger.The perceived value of our products is better than it was. And obviously, we've been able to raise prices and consumers stay within our brands. Now we're seeing consumers making some adjustments, right? We're seeing consumers shopping in more stores than before. They're looking for better deals. They're starting to look for optimization. They're going to channels that have better perceived value. They're buying more in Dollar stores or they buy more in mass or in clubs. So every segment of the consumer is making adjustment. Overall, we're seeing very positive. And I think it has to do with the levels of unemployment that we're seeing all around the world. Unemployment is very low. In most of the economies, if you think about developed markets, but also developing markets. So markets like Mexico record low unemployment, some markets in Asia as well. So we're seeing overall very, very good consumer behavior, especially when it refers to our categories and that's why we raised guidance on our top line and because of the first factor, we raised guidance on the second -- on the bottom line as well. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you, Dara There are obviously some markets around the world that are suffering from currency situations and there we have to adjust to the reality. And I'm talking about Turkey, Pakistan, Egypt, Argentina. So there are subsegment of markets where I would not apply the global rule and we're acting very specifically in those markets. But beyond those markets overall, we're seeing and I think it's because what I was saying earlier, unemployment levels being very low. We're seeing consumers continue to behave in a positive way. Our category penetrations in most of those markets is still relatively low, and we continue to be an affordable treat in those markets. So our products continue to be part of the repertoire that they can afford and they make trade-offs to stay within our category. So we're seeing that in a very positive way. Now competitive wise, I think there's very rational competition across the world from what I -- from what we can observe, in the first half of the year, both in our snacks and our beverage business. And that's what we're assuming in the balance of the year. Lauren, hi. We cannot hear you very well. You come in. [Multiple Speakers] you're breaking up. I don't know, if it's our phone or it's -- now it seems to be better. A little better. Okay. Thank you. Sorry for that. Yeah, Lauren. I think the -- I think there are a couple of factors. The G2 DSD has a meaningful impact on timing on when we reflect our sales and when the consumer actually buys compared to previous years. So we're much -- the cycle has reduced substantially, given our DSD -- and that might have some implications on the readings. We feel good about the sports category even though it has been cold in some parts of the country for the month of June and so on. But in general, within the categories continues to have healthy metrics in terms of penetration and usage and everything else. Our innovation G FIT, Gatorade and most importantly for us long term, our powders and tablets is going very, very well. So we believe in those subsegments continue to develop along with G Zero, which continues to attract new consumers to the category. So we feel good. We're seeing all the execution metrics for Gatorade improving. So inventory on display, service levels to our customers, which were a little bit handicapped in the past due to supply chain issues. So we're seeing the health of the brand and the category at a pretty good level. It is true that there are some new entrants in the category like Prime that have been taken some space, especially with younger audiences. They've been affecting Gatorade, but they've been affecting more of some other brands in the category that had that kind of profile. So we feel good about the execution. We feel good about how the brand is performing. We've increased advertising substantially against Gatorade and we'll continue to do so in the back end of the summer and the year. So we feel good about Gatorade. And I think the G2 DSD is going to be a structural move that will give us better execution and capacity to respond to weather changes and opportunity in the marketplace going forward. Yeah. No, we can have Hugh continue the CNBC interview. Yeah. Good morning. I think there's a couple of realizations on this. The number one is that the power of our distribution system our DSD machine in the U.S. is very powerful. And obviously, you can see by the increase in the numerical distribution and the quality of execution. So that's one element that makes us feel very strong about our capabilities in the U.S. Beverages. Second, I think Celsius is a brand that is capturing new consumers to the energy category, consumers that were not consuming energy drinks for many reasons in the past, flavor or image or some other elements. That is a positive. The category keeps expanding and we're glad that that's in our portfolio. And we're working together with Celsius to see additional international opportunities, whether we can expand the brand in some other markets, especially more developed markets where the category is a bit more developed. Those are the three conclusions that we're taking from our relationship so far. Yeah. Thank you. Yes, good -- good diagnostic. The fact that our European business clearly has had a terrific first half of the year and we're expecting that to continue in the second half. A couple of elements, I think we have a portfolio that is quite robust on the snack side. We have very good market positions in snacks. And we have good challenging positions in beverages and our zero propositions in Europe are growing very fast and they're taking market share in some of the more affluent markets in Europe. So good portfolio mix and good focus by the team on growing that portfolio. As you said, we were a little bit late to pricing last year in '22. And the team has been courageous and has been able to find win-win solutions with our customers in '23. So as you see from the numbers, good pricing levels, but what is also very remarkable in Europe is the levels of productivity that the team has been executing through simplification of the business and everything else that Hugh was saying about digitalization and automation and also moving some service to essential points that we can service the businesses more effectively, more efficiently. So good work by the European team, both on portfolio managed simplification and then in driving productivity. So we feel good about Europe. We have a very strong business in both Central Europe, Eastern Europe and parts of the economy that are growing faster. So we feel good about the portfolio composition and the business going forward. Yeah. And I would say the commercial teams have done a great job in minimizing elasticity. So going into the year, of course, we were assuming a level of elasticity that was more based on historical levels. I think we've been positively surprised on the strength of the brands in some markets. And obviously, as I said earlier, the consequence of the investment we've been making.

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to PepsiCo's 2023 First Quarter Earnings Question-and-Answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Today's call is being recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Ravi Pamnani, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Pamnani, you may begin.\nRavi Pamnani: Thank you, operator. I hope everyone has had a chance this morning to review our press release and prepared remarks, both of which are available on our website.  Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. We may make forward-looking statements on today's call, including about our business plans and updated 2023 guidance. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties and only reflect our view as of today, April 25, 2023, and we are under no obligation to update. When discussing our results, we refer to non-GAAP measures, which exclude certain items from reported results.  Please refer to our first quarter 2023 earnings release and Form 10-Q available on pepsico.com for definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures and additional information regarding our results, including a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from forward-looking statements.  Joining me today are PepsiCo's Chairman and CEO, Ramon Laguarta; and PepsiCo's Vice Chairman and CFO, Hugh Johnston. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question.  And with that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: So very impressive price mix result in the quarter at 16%. Can you just give us an update on the competitive environment you're seeing in your key business segments and geographies, both in terms of just price increases but also promotion and if that's picking back up to more normalized levels? And if that favorable environment is continuing. And just as you look going forward, obviously, very strong levels of pricing, how do you think about the of that back to more normalized levels going forward the next few quarters and the ability of volume to recover as that pricing dissipates on a year-over-year basis?\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. Thank you, Dara. Let me cover that and then Hugh can add some comments. We're seeing a competitive environment. We're all trying to protect the health of the categories and then make sure that our brands are participating in those categories in a competitive way. We are investing in our innovation, investing in our brands, investing obviously in value in different ways, pricing, sizing in mostly.  So we're seeing a good positive competitive environment in the U.S., in Europe, and also in our developing markets consistently across the world. When it comes to pricing, as we said earlier in February, we have mostly taken the pricing already this year that we needed to cover for our cost increases. And that is where we stand at this point. We're seeing a deceleration of inflation, not a reduction of cost, but a deceleration of inflation.  And we think that with the pricing that we've taken already most of our business around the world, that should be sufficient. Obviously, there are some markets, highly inflationary markets around the world where we might have to take additional pricing. If you think about Argentina, Turkey, Egypt though those kind of markets where the currencies are suffering, but the majority of our pricing is already done.\nHugh Johnston: Yes. And the only thing I'd add to that, Dara, as a reminder, you know we tend to buy commodities 9 to 12 months out. So to the degree that the rate of inflation decreases, and it will be a decrease in the rate of inflation, not deflation, by any stretch of imagination that's going to happen very slowly over the course of '23. I think that's more of a '24 thing to the degree it happens even then.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: I wanted to go back to a little bit of what you spoke in the prepared remarks that you were -- and you also on an earlier interview Hugh that you gave, that you're not seeing the fact that inflation is still high throughout the 6 to 9 months that you're seeing here. And it doesn't look like you're seeing the need for promotional environment, but more in the context of what has happened in LatAm, I think it's the only region that you haven't seen a reacceleration and every other region, you've seen an acceleration.  And I'm seeing -- I'm talking -- I'm asking this question more of the point of strength rather than a point of weakness. Of course, it's really hard not to like the numbers here. Just thinking of how to think of the volume decline you saw in snacks and to think about how to parse it out or it's more about the comparison getting tougher?\nHugh Johnston: Yes, Andrea. A couple of things. Just for clarity, in terms of the snack food or the community food volume, Pioneer was a big driver of that. There are challenges with the power grid down in South Africa. And obviously, Pioneer makes a lot of heavy products. Ex-Pioneer Snacks volume was basically flat for the quarter and beverages obviously was up a small amount for the quarter.  In terms more broadly of sort of the rate of growth of all of the businesses. From a revenue standpoint, I think generally speaking, you see the consumer continuing to buy our products. Elasticities are still holding up quite well across most of the globe. And then despite the fact that we're taking pricing driven by the inflation that we're facing into.  In terms of operating performance, I think what you're seeing more than anything is a reflection of the productivity initiatives that we've put into place, whether they be automation in the supply chain or digitalization across the company, we're leveraging global business services. So when we talk about sort of an acceleration in the operating income performance, I think it's a consumer that's responding to the brand advertising we're doing. And in addition to that, the productivity that we're driving.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: Great. Just picking up on some of your prior commentary there. And just the decision to raise the EPS guidance at this juncture of the year, which I think is noteworthy because the company's delivery against guidance has historically been quite good, as you're well aware, but historically, the tax has been to maintain it and then as the year moves on to edge it higher.  So I -- just some context here. Was it that the first quarter was that good relative to your expectations, just came in that much better? Because it's noteworthy within the context of all the prognostication around potential recession and market volatility for the raise at this juncture of the year, so maybe just some historical context around it and relative to the first quarter results, I think, would be helpful.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, Kevin. I think you're right. Your assessment is right. We're seeing both better elasticities than some of the worst-case scenarios we were planning for. And also, we're seeing the teams delivering better productivity. So we're seeing the -- in general, the flow of materials, the availability of labor, transportation, all those elements that were making us a suboptimal company if you just to call it somehow in terms of operating metrics, that's getting better, which is giving us the opportunity to improve some of the metrics in our operations faster than what we thought.  So it's both an improvement in productivity on the cost side and better elasticity. I think the commercial programs were strong. You saw that we've increased A&M again in the first quarter. And I think the commercial plan, the innovation plans are very strong. So we feel comfortable that even -- and we always play out a lot of scenarios before we give a -- give you guys a guidance. We feel comfortable that even at this early point in the year, we can raise our top line and bottom line estimates.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs.\nBonnie Herzog: I had a question on organic revenue growth at PBNA. Your price mix in the quarter was incredibly impressive, but your volumes were down slightly again. So could you touch on where you're primarily [Technical Difficulty] pressure. And then maybe what you're seeing from the consumer. Also, it seems that incremental pricing may be a bit harder to come by and promotional levels may need to increase in beverages this year. So could you touch on that as well as maybe your key initiatives to stabilize or turn your volume trends around that PBNA -- is your Pepsi rebranding or the new logo and visual identity for the brand, one of those key initiatives, for instance?\nRamon Laguarta: Thank you, Bonnie. We don't see -- actually, we see the momentum in the beverage category, very strong in terms of demand. We're seeing away from home, very strong. We're seeing the convenience channel, very strong, and we're seeing most of the in-home channels also quite strong. So we don't feel that there is a competitive environment that is getting worse in beverages. There's some one-off in the first quarter because we're -- as you know, we're moving Gatorade from a warehouse system to a DSD system and in that transition, there is some inventory reduction overall in the system that is impacting Q1.  But we don't think that the competitive environment in beverages in the U.S. is getting worse and that we need to do anything special. We have a very strong commercial program, both innovation, brands, commercial execution and customer programs. So that will be the way we're planning to continue to compete vigorously in the market.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. So you've already been asked about raising the guidance early in the year, and it would sort of be mechanically hard not to, given how strong the quarter was. But your prior outlook you had baked in what we thought was one of the more conservative set of assumptions around the macro environment at least for the second half of the year across our coverage anyway. And so I was just curious if you're seeing anything more recently that has you more optimistic on the macro trajectory. Anything in terms of that broader market outlook or consumer outlook that's informing your ability to raise the guidance? Or is it really more tied to just the momentum in your own business?\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, Lauren, it's mostly related to the fact that we're already 1/3 of the year is passed, and we have better information on our costs and everything else that complex operating. There are a few things we're still concerned about. One is where is the consumer going to be in second half of the year. We continue to be -- have multiple scenarios. And some of the scenarios are more optimistic, some best, and we continue to have various scenarios.  The second one, geopolitics and that might impact the business, and therefore, we want to be cautious there as well. And the third one, as I mentioned earlier, there are some currencies in some emerging and developing markets that we don't know where some of those markets will go in the second half of the year. And we also want to make sure that we have the right financial scenarios around those options.  So those are the three variables that could define where the business goes. As I said earlier, operationally, the business is better. We're seeing better labor availability, better flow of materials, suppliers are obviously getting better as well. Transportation is getting better. So operationally, the business is in a better place than it was in 2022.\nOperator: Next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane: Hugh, I wanted to ask about accounts payable. Just it was a pretty meaningful shift year-over-year. I understand there's a sequential or a seasonal piece to it. But I think it's up more than $1 billion versus the first quarter last year. So is that tied to the Gatorade DSD distribution change? Or I don't know, if there is something else going on with accounts payables that just is driving such a meaningful change?\nHugh Johnston: Yes. Bryan, it's really two things. One is a seasonal inventory build on the Gatorade thing, as you mentioned. The second is, we've got a number of significant capital projects that are in flight right now and the timing of the payables on the capital equipment is what drove that number. So I would take it as a one-off, not a change in trend by any stretch of the imagination. It's just a one-off when the quarter ended.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo.\nChristopher Carey: Can you maybe just touch on how investment and priorities will evolve in 2023. I think one of the key takeaways from 2022 was distribution costs between shipping, handling and merchandising activity was a key driver of SG&A inflation, but I'm conscious of double-digit increases with added marketing spending out of the gates into Q1. So can you maybe just frame how overall investment will be evolving over the course of this year in the context, maybe some easing on inflation and certain SG&A buckets and an ability to put more spending in others.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, Chris. Listen, I think the framework of investment is similar to what we expressed in the past. We mean #1 priority for us is to make sure that our categories remain highly visible in consumers' minds in a complex consumer choices environment. And our brands do very well in those categories. So that's priority number one, make sure that we continue to be a preferred brand with our consumers.  Second, we continue to invest in transformation of the business, digitalization and productivity at the center of the strategy systems. We've been investing on that for quite a while. That continues to be an enabler of all the data strategy that we have in the business.  And those are the two big projects, we continue to invest in capacity. There is good volume growth across many of our markets around the world, and that continues to be a priority in enabling the brands to continue to grow. So those are the principles. I don't know, Hugh, if there's anything else.\nHugh Johnston: No, I think that's the only thing -- and I think where Chris is going with the question from his perspective as well. Chris, I think you'll see more of the financial impact of those investments in SG&A significantly less selling cost of goods. So as you're modeling it out, SG&A is a place where you'll see all the items that Ramon referenced will be hitting.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS.\nPeter Grom: So I was hoping to get more color on the international performance in the quarter. But maybe specifically in China. I know it was called out in the prepared remarks is a market where you gained share, and maybe I missed this, but I don't think it was mentioned when discussing growth in the quarter. So can you maybe share a view on the current environment in China how that evolved through the quarter and kind of how you see that progressing from here?\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. Yes, we're seeing, obviously, in China, a optimism in consumers and optimism in the customers and that's driving volume for us across the -- across both our food and our beverage business. The organic share, especially in snacks. Snacks has been performing very well through the pandemic and continues to outgrow the category. And in beverages as well, we're seen competing quite well in Colas and sports hydration. So yes, obviously, this is going to be a tailwind for us as the year progresses both in away from home and in-home consumption.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI.\nRobert Ottenstein: Great. Given the strong start to the year and your confidence in the year, I thought I'd ask a longer-term question. And that is, as you look at the categories that you're in, over time in the past, you've expanded in certain countries a little bit outside of beverages and snacks either for reasons of scale or growth opportunities or maybe that's just what was available as part of an acquisition. Over the next, call it, next 5 years or so, do you believe that you're in the right categories to drive your algorithm? Or do you see potentially the need or desirability to expand and do some adjacent areas. And given the advances that you've made in IT and logistics, perhaps that's even a greater opportunity than in the past?\nRamon Laguarta: It's a great question. Listen, we believe our categories are large and growing at a very fast pace, around 5% globally. I think our main responsibility is to maintain the innovation and make sure that the portfolio evolves with consumers, the brands continue to be super relevant. And that is where we want to focus our efforts. We're making some small moves, as you saw, for example, when we're going into low alcohol here in the U.S., expanding the brands. We're making small moves like Cheetos going into Mac and Cheese. So we're expanding some of our brands organically into some new spaces that make sense from the consumer point of view that we believe our categories are large, global, healthy, and we -- our responsibility is to give them healthy and growing very fast.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen.\nVivien Azer: I wanted to ask about Pepsi Zero Sugar given the reformulation and the broad-based international distribution. Can you offer some perspective on how that's performing relative to expectations? And as well, could you possibly update us on how the organization is tracking towards your 2025 ESG target to drive 60, 70% of volumes from lower added sugar beverages?\nRamon Laguarta: Great question. And it's essential to our strategy, continue to drive low sugar and nonsugar products as kind of the portfolio transformation. In the case of Pepsi, obviously, that is very relevant for us given the size and scale of Pepsi brand for us. The relaunch in the U.S. with a new formula is very -- it's been very well received by consumers based on our early data of repeats and preferences. The brand is growing 60%, if I remember correctly, in the first quarter, and that's driven a little bit by distribution, but it's mostly velocity. So clearly, the consumers are -- they like the product and they're coming back to the product. Globally, we also see big growth of the nonsugar segment in the category 2, 3x, the average of the category in most of the markets. And we are driving that growth along with some of our key competitors. I think it's a strategy that is working and it's keeping the category very relevant for consumers. We'll continue to invest in nonsugar as a driver of growth for our brands.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gerald Pascarelli with Wedbush.\nGerald Pascarelli: In U.S. measured channels for salty snacks, we've seen private label products gained share of the overall category for the past few months now. This has obviously have seen in tandem with very strong performance and market share gains for Frito as well, which is great. But I was just curious if you've seen any near-term changes, some broad consumer purchase patterns in this category relative to maybe a few months ago? Any thoughts there would be helpful.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. In general, we're seeing private label growth in some of the categories where we participate, especially waters, juices that we used to participate in some categories in salty snacks as well as you mentioned. As you will say, Frito-Lay is -- I think it's growing share of market at the fastest pace that we've seen in the last, maybe 10 years, if I recall, as a consequence of the great work the team is doing in terms of execution, but mostly innovation and brand building.  So I think we see both private label increasing, although from a very low base in salty snacks. But most importantly for us, we're seeing our brands continue to gain loyalty, expand their consumer base and be preferred in that segment. But yes, private label is slowly increasing and in -- from a very, very low base as I said, in some subsegments of the salty snacks business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge.\nBrett Cooper: With about a year in of and Hard Mountain dew, I was hoping you could provide some color on your view of the performance of the brand and the operation to date, any learnings? And then how you think about proceeding from here?\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. Listen, we're happy with the learnings that we're taking, both in the operation of this category, which is new to us and also in how we create consumer demand and consumer loyalty, and we continue to find partners to create new solutions for consumers with our brands. We just launched a tea version, a hard tea version with Lipton and FIFCO Company. They developed a great product, which we're going to start distributing through our system in the next few weeks. So we're going to go into the summer with 2 main products, Mountain Dew -- Hard Mountain Dew and Hard Lipton.  As I said, our intention is not to build a large portfolio of products and complex portfolio, but is to focus on a few good brands developed with strategic partners and then leverage our distribution capabilities to give it to consumers all across the country. That's our journey. We're not rushing. We're going at a speed that we learn and we make this business solid with the right margins and the right consumer propositions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Filippo Falorni with Citi.\nFilippo Falorni: Question on the Pepsi Beverage North America business. It seems clearly this year, you're making a lot of investments. The Pepsi Logo change, the Starry launch, a lot of other launches, with expansion of Pepsi Zero Sugar and Hard Mountain Dew. Just bigger picture, what are your expectations from kind of a market share standpoint in the business? What would you consider a success for this year? And then secondly, how do you balance these investments that you're making with your target of getting back to a mid-teens margin for the business?\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. I mean we've expressed this in the past. We want to have a business that grows and the category pace or above and expand its margins to the mid-teens levels that we have mentioned as well in the next 2 to 3 years. So that is the strategic intent for this business. I think the team is executing very well. The way we measure our share is full LRB. So it's the full set of brands that we have in our portfolio, not just small segments within the category. And obviously, I think we're progressing well against that growth target for the year, whilst also expanding the margins for the business. We feel good about the margin expansion this year.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Charlie Higgs with Redburn.\nCharlie Higgs: I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the Frito-Lay North America division and the volume growth there. How did Lays, Doritos, Cheetos perform? Is there any color you can give on a single-serve pack versus multi-packs? And then just how you see the very strong margin growth in Q1 progressing throughout the year would be useful.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. Great. Listen, as I said earlier, Frito-Lay, I think, it's in the U.S. and -- but also the whole snack business globally is doing extremely well. But if we focus on the U.S., I think the team is doing a fantastic job growing the large brands, as you mentioned, Lays, Doritos, Ruffles, Tostitos, Cheetos. And at the same time, building peripheral brands that cover some spaces that we're not covering with the big brands. Let's call it, PopCorners or SunChips [indiscernible]. We're really building a portfolio of brands that covers different cohorts and different need stays in a unique way.  We're also innovating in new formats. You mentioned multipack, which has been a great hit for us in terms of variety and empowering consumers for personalization. But this year, a few months ago, we launched Minis, which is also an incredible innovation. If you think about the convenient -- the additional convenience it gives consumers and putting our best brands in that format opens a whole set of new occasions for the business.  So we feel very good about the innovation strategy and how we keep capturing new occasions into our brands. As I said earlier, I think the business is becoming better operationally as the supply of materials is getting better, labor availability is getting better. So we should see operational metrics improving, and that's what you're seeing in the margins, although the Q1 margin was a little bit elevated. The strategic intent with Frito-Lay is growing it very, very fast and keeping the margins at those high levels because that's super accretive for the PepsiCo overall business.  Okay. I think this is the last question. So really appreciate the conversation this morning, and thank you, everyone, for joining today and especially for the confidence that you're all placed in our company and the investments you're making in our company. Thank you very much, and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Hugh Johnston",
            "content": "Yes. And the only thing I'd add to that, Dara, as a reminder, you know we tend to buy commodities 9 to 12 months out. So to the degree that the rate of inflation decreases, and it will be a decrease in the rate of inflation, not deflation, by any stretch of imagination that's going to happen very slowly over the course of '23. I think that's more of a '24 thing to the degree it happens even then. Yes, Andrea. A couple of things. Just for clarity, in terms of the snack food or the community food volume, Pioneer was a big driver of that. There are challenges with the power grid down in South Africa. And obviously, Pioneer makes a lot of heavy products. Ex-Pioneer Snacks volume was basically flat for the quarter and beverages obviously was up a small amount for the quarter.  In terms more broadly of sort of the rate of growth of all of the businesses. From a revenue standpoint, I think generally speaking, you see the consumer continuing to buy our products. Elasticities are still holding up quite well across most of the globe. And then despite the fact that we're taking pricing driven by the inflation that we're facing into.  In terms of operating performance, I think what you're seeing more than anything is a reflection of the productivity initiatives that we've put into place, whether they be automation in the supply chain or digitalization across the company, we're leveraging global business services. So when we talk about sort of an acceleration in the operating income performance, I think it's a consumer that's responding to the brand advertising we're doing. And in addition to that, the productivity that we're driving. Yes. Bryan, it's really two things. One is a seasonal inventory build on the Gatorade thing, as you mentioned. The second is, we've got a number of significant capital projects that are in flight right now and the timing of the payables on the capital equipment is what drove that number. So I would take it as a one-off, not a change in trend by any stretch of the imagination. It's just a one-off when the quarter ended. No, I think that's the only thing -- and I think where Chris is going with the question from his perspective as well. Chris, I think you'll see more of the financial impact of those investments in SG&A significantly less selling cost of goods. So as you're modeling it out, SG&A is a place where you'll see all the items that Ramon referenced will be hitting."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Ramon Laguarta",
            "content": "Yes. Thank you, Dara. Let me cover that and then Hugh can add some comments. We're seeing a competitive environment. We're all trying to protect the health of the categories and then make sure that our brands are participating in those categories in a competitive way. We are investing in our innovation, investing in our brands, investing obviously in value in different ways, pricing, sizing in mostly.  So we're seeing a good positive competitive environment in the U.S., in Europe, and also in our developing markets consistently across the world. When it comes to pricing, as we said earlier in February, we have mostly taken the pricing already this year that we needed to cover for our cost increases. And that is where we stand at this point. We're seeing a deceleration of inflation, not a reduction of cost, but a deceleration of inflation.  And we think that with the pricing that we've taken already most of our business around the world, that should be sufficient. Obviously, there are some markets, highly inflationary markets around the world where we might have to take additional pricing. If you think about Argentina, Turkey, Egypt though those kind of markets where the currencies are suffering, but the majority of our pricing is already done. Yes, Kevin. I think you're right. Your assessment is right. We're seeing both better elasticities than some of the worst-case scenarios we were planning for. And also, we're seeing the teams delivering better productivity. So we're seeing the -- in general, the flow of materials, the availability of labor, transportation, all those elements that were making us a suboptimal company if you just to call it somehow in terms of operating metrics, that's getting better, which is giving us the opportunity to improve some of the metrics in our operations faster than what we thought.  So it's both an improvement in productivity on the cost side and better elasticity. I think the commercial programs were strong. You saw that we've increased A&M again in the first quarter. And I think the commercial plan, the innovation plans are very strong. So we feel comfortable that even -- and we always play out a lot of scenarios before we give a -- give you guys a guidance. We feel comfortable that even at this early point in the year, we can raise our top line and bottom line estimates. Thank you, Bonnie. We don't see -- actually, we see the momentum in the beverage category, very strong in terms of demand. We're seeing away from home, very strong. We're seeing the convenience channel, very strong, and we're seeing most of the in-home channels also quite strong. So we don't feel that there is a competitive environment that is getting worse in beverages. There's some one-off in the first quarter because we're -- as you know, we're moving Gatorade from a warehouse system to a DSD system and in that transition, there is some inventory reduction overall in the system that is impacting Q1.  But we don't think that the competitive environment in beverages in the U.S. is getting worse and that we need to do anything special. We have a very strong commercial program, both innovation, brands, commercial execution and customer programs. So that will be the way we're planning to continue to compete vigorously in the market. Yes, Lauren, it's mostly related to the fact that we're already 1/3 of the year is passed, and we have better information on our costs and everything else that complex operating. There are a few things we're still concerned about. One is where is the consumer going to be in second half of the year. We continue to be -- have multiple scenarios. And some of the scenarios are more optimistic, some best, and we continue to have various scenarios.  The second one, geopolitics and that might impact the business, and therefore, we want to be cautious there as well. And the third one, as I mentioned earlier, there are some currencies in some emerging and developing markets that we don't know where some of those markets will go in the second half of the year. And we also want to make sure that we have the right financial scenarios around those options.  So those are the three variables that could define where the business goes. As I said earlier, operationally, the business is better. We're seeing better labor availability, better flow of materials, suppliers are obviously getting better as well. Transportation is getting better. So operationally, the business is in a better place than it was in 2022. Yes, Chris. Listen, I think the framework of investment is similar to what we expressed in the past. We mean #1 priority for us is to make sure that our categories remain highly visible in consumers' minds in a complex consumer choices environment. And our brands do very well in those categories.

The organic share, especially in snacks. Snacks has been performing very well through the pandemic and continues to outgrow the category. And in beverages as well, we're seen competing quite well in Colas and sports hydration. So yes, obviously, this is going to be a tailwind for us as the year progresses both in away from home and in-home consumption. It's a great question.

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to PepsiCo's 2024 Third Quarter Earnings Question-and-Answer Session. Your lines have been placed on listen-only until it is your turn to ask the question. Today's call is being recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Ravi Pamnani, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Pamnani may begin.\nRavi Pamnani: Thank you, Kevin. And good morning, everyone. I hope everyone has had a chance this morning to review our press release and prepared remarks, both of which are available on our website. Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. We may make forward-looking statements on today's call, including about our business plans and updated 2024 guidance. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties and only reflect our view as of today, October 8, 2024, and we are under no obligation to update. When discussing our results, we refer to non-GAAP measures, which exclude certain items from reported results. Please refer to our third quarter 2024 earnings release and third quarter 2024 form 10-Q available on pepsico.com for definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures and additional information regarding our results, including a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from forward-looking statements. Joining me today are PepsiCo's Chairman and CEO, Ramon Laguarta, and PepsiCo's Executive Vice President and CFO, Jamie Caulfield. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question. And with that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is open.\nLauren Lieberman: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So in the release clear that Frito volumes trended in the right direction in the third quarter, category backdrop is still tough, and you offered a lot of detail in the prepared remarks and kind of the strategy from here. I wanted to maybe think about the building blocks to a return to volume growth for that business? And if we isolate it between, let's say, core Lays and some of the promotional work that you started this summer, the expansion efforts where you focus on kind of multicultural offerings and value offerings, and then the positive choice, more premium end of the spectrum. As we think about the path forward, what do you think about the growth rates for those three, if you will, segments or initiatives? Do we think that long-term Lays get back to, and that kind of core part of the business to be a positive volume contributor or is it more of a kind of hold the line and avoid losses there, but the other two are really what drives the turnaround as we move forward? Thanks.\nRamon Laguarta: Good morning, Lauren. Thank you. Let me step back for a minute. If we think about the long-term growth potential of the food business in the U.S., we are very positive about the long-term trends. We've seen Gen Z snacking patterns and food patterns being in a way that favors the growth of our category. They are snacking more. They are eating mini meals versus large meals. And that favors our brands and the number of occasions that they carrier will grow. So long term, we feel very good about it. After three years of outsized growth for Frito, if you think about the double digit growth, we knew this year was going to be a year of normalization and that's what's happening. The consumer is reassessing patterns and with mobility and some of the financial situation. Now going forward, we think that the category will continue to grow at the pace of the past because of the long-term trends that I referred to. Now the way we're thinking about our brands playing in that space, potato chips will continue to be a big driver of the growth. And we're looking at potato chips, to your question on Lays, as a multi-tier opportunity. And the same with theme for all the other segments. So we have Lays clearly as the main part of the category. And within Lays, We will have unsalted and we'll have flavors where we know we can create a lot of loyalty and higher value for consumers. We'll have subsegments like lightly salted or baked that provide even more permissible options for consumer sustained potatoes. And then we'll have, at the upper end of the category brands like Miss Vickie's that provide a more premium experience. So we're thinking about each one of those categories as multi-tier where we offer value to some consumers, more specific choices for other consumers that want to stay within our brands. But the overarching -- the way we're thinking about the category is to continue to create growth, continue to ensure that the long-term, the category creates occasions and brings consumers into the -- will bring consumers into the category with our brand programs, our innovation, to keep the category growing very healthy in the future for us and for our customers. And that's how you should think about the long-term value that we can create with the Frito-Lay business.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with BofA. Your line is open.\nBryan Spillane: Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. So, my question is just how we're approaching planning for, I guess, 2025 and maybe just the medium term. And Ramon, I guess underneath my question is, given that this is sort of in some ways uncharted water in terms of what we're dealing with the consumer and finding ways to get them to respond, how is it affecting the way you're thinking about the balance, right, between investment, spending to stimulate demand, returns, and how it affects the bottom line? And I guess, really what I'm asking is, how do you gauge or guard against cutting too much cost in order to preserve the bottom line while trying to re-accelerate top-line growth?\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, great question, Bryan. Listen, we've been thinking about productivity and cost transformation now for some time. We knew it was going to be a year of normalization after, as I said, three years of outsized growth. So we've been thinking about productivity in a very programmatic way and systemic way across the company. And there are some big platforms that we have started to deploy and will continue to deploy over the next few years. And these platforms are automation of our supply chain, both warehouses, manufacturing, distribution centers. We have invested a lot in data and organizing our data in a way that now we can deploy digitalization at scale throughout the value chain. So from the way we procure to the way we run our factories, to our transportation, to our go-to markets, we're really digitalizing the company. And that will generate growth and productivity as well. We invested -- we started to create our global business services, share services, now we call them Global Capability Centers, about a couple of years ago. Now we have them at a maturity level that we can use them much more in how we do labor across the company, how we service our organization. A&M optimization, or in general demand generation budgets optimization. We are much better at understanding otherwise. So there's multiple platforms of productivity that we'll keep deploying in the next few years in the U.S. and internationally. That will give us the optionality to invest in the business as we see best to continue to grow our categories in a responsible way, and continue to deliver the financial returns that our investors expect and that we are delivering. One good -- we feel good about this year in the sense that even with a very challenging consumer background, we're able to deliver at the high end of our EPS long-term target. That is very positive, and it makes us feel very confident that the productivity, the cost transformation programs that we started with the right levels of investment will deliver for us. Again, we're always managing the company for the long term. Even in a year like this in which we're challenged, on the top line we keep investing in A&M, we keep investing in the long-term transformation of the company, we keep investing in sustainability, making sure that long-term we are using less resources. So we're not taking our eyes off the ball on the long-term, whilst we deliver on the short-term for our investors. Thanks to what I think is best-in-class productivity multi-prone program that we'll continue to deploy in the coming years.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Hey, guys. Good morning. If I could just follow-up on that with -- other than the details, if organic revenue growth does indeed stay in this sort of low single digit or 1% range, can you still deliver 8% on EPS, kind of putting all of that together? Do you have the flexibility to do that for the forward year?\nRamon Laguarta: Kaumil, as I said earlier, I think we have a very large productivity set of tools that we will keep deploying systematically. At the same time, we don't think our category will grow at 1% long term. We think our category with investments that we are putting back into the business and the health of our brands and the innovation that we have in place for this year and next year will deliver much more than 1%. So we're not considering that scenario in our kind of planning. But I would say, what we want to do is control what we can control, which is clearly focus on productivity, focusing on the long-term health of our category, continue to keep our consumers in our brand, continue to keep our consumers in our categories, building winning plans with our partners that generate profitable growth for both of us. That's where we're putting the focus. Long-term, as I said earlier, we believe in the long-term growth of both our snacks category and our beverage category. Both of them are trillion-dollar type of categories with global relevance, growing very healthy in many markets around the world and with long-term trends that give us a lot of confidence that these will be sizable growth categories for the long term.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey, good morning.\nRamon Laguarta: Hey, Dara. Good morning.\nDara Mohsenian: So, Ramon, you touched on earlier in the prepared remarks some of the actions you've taken so far in Frito-Lay. Just can you take a step back and give us your view in terms of the initial payback you're seeing? But the thrust of the question is really more about going forward is it sort of tweaking those actions in place already to drive greater payoff going forward? Are there additional actions you're going to lean heavier on? And just how do you think about sort of changing the magnitude of investment behind some of those? And maybe specifically you can dial down on providing value to consumers that you mentioned. What does that sort of mean? Is that more of a promotional focus? Is it taking less pricing? Give us a little more tangible detail on that front. Thanks.\nRamon Laguarta: Great, Dara. Thank you. Listen, I think it's a multi-pronged strategy and that we'll continue with that. So giving more value on the core is super relevant. We feel good about the investments that we put this summer, mostly behind the potato chips category and Lays. That drove growth in the potato chips business. Lays gained 3 points of household penetration, and we feel good about that return. Now we're going to apply that sequentially to other categories. We will use the fall, the winter season to put more investments behind Doritos and Tostitos. It\u2019s the football season, there's a lot of gatherings, and those brands belong very well in those gatherings. And it will be a combination of value in the form of bonus packs and more product too. Obviously these are large -- normally large group gatherings, so bonus packs make a lot of sense. We're giving 20% more product in Tostitos and Ruffles, some of the brands that belong in those locations. We're also investing in brand events. So, you will see Tostitos and Doritos, big brand events around NFL. We'll see Lays playing some of the classic Do Us a Flavor event. So the brands will have a combination of value and big brand events. At the same time, we're working on the long-term evolution of the portfolio. That is something that we've been working for many, many years. We'll continue. I think the success of our business long-term is based on evolving the portfolio at the speed that the consumer wants to go. So we'll continue to invest on our permissible portfolio. This is growing very fast, and we continue to put more legs to that business. Now we have SunChip, Simply, PopCorners, we have SmartFood, we have multiple brands. You guys saw the announcement of [CSA] (ph), hopefully that will go through legal approval and we will have another leg to that portfolio of solutions to keep growing the permissible portfolio. The same with multicultural. We see that with the Hispanic population growing in the United States, we have brands like Sabritas, Santitas, Gamesa that can work very well to that group of consumers. We have those brands in Mexico, we're making them -- we're scaling them up in the U.S. And the other lever we're playing there is, we're entering new channels. We're trying to expand beyond retail, in a way from home, in other channels where we can create occasions for our brands that right now are under-penetrated. So that's the multi-prone approach. We're probably going to lean a bit more on value in the first quarters without taking the ball off the long-term investments that we're making consistently in building the portfolio for the future. So, you will see us making those options. But again, I refer back to what I was saying earlier, the optionality that we can create for ourselves with our productivity programs gives us a lot of flexibility. And we will be making those adjustments as we see the returns of the different actions and the tactics taking place over the next few months.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Filippo Falorni with Citi. Your line is open.\nFilippo Falorni: Hey, good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask about the international business. So Ramon, you mentioned in the prepared remarks geopolitical tensions and some weaker consumer across certain markets. So maybe you can talk about those markets that had a negative impact and quantify any impact in the quarter. And then kind of like looking at the two pieces of the international business, it seems like the deceleration has been more in the convenience food side versus the beverage business continues to do well. So what are the drivers in international slowdown in snacks and convenient foods? Is it similar to the US or are there other drivers? Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. Thank you, Filippo. I'll give you a bit of a sense of -- there are pockets of strength in international. There are markets like in Southeast Asia, India. Those are markets that are growing nicely. We see parts of Eastern Europe growing nicely. We see Brazil growing at a good pace. So there is pockets of growth. There are other markets where we're seeing a bit of a deceleration. So China is a market where consumers are feeling a bit more constrained, and we're seeing that in our food business, although we're getting share, we're seeing a deceleration from double digit to single digit growth. We're seeing a bit of a deceleration in Mexico. We think this has to be related with elections and some of the noise around the flows of social money into the economy. Hopefully that will now stabilize. And we're seeing parts of Western Europe also challenge weather and other dynamics there. Now the Middle East is a different reality. The fact that we have a big business in the Middle East and yet it's being impacted by geopolitical situation and I don't think that's going to change in the coming months. But our teams locally are doing a great job navigating the situation and trying to continue to stay relevant for consumers and drive that business forward. So yes, your comment on foods versus beverages, yes, the beverage business is growing a little bit faster than the food business globally.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS. Your line is open.\nPeter Grom: Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. Maybe just a bit more of a housekeeping question, but the full year organic revenue guidance still implies a relatively wide range for the fourth quarter. So just any thoughts on where you would expect to fall within that range? And then, within that, any comments on the underlying assumptions embedded, clearly things have been more challenged from an external perspective. So just would be curious if you were assuming kind of the current environment holds, or would you anticipate category trying to show some improvement here as we exit 2024? Thanks.\nJamie Caulfield: Hey, it's Jamie. I'd say that we really don't expect a huge inflection up or down from the conditions that existed in Q3.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nRobert Moskow: Hi. Thank you. Ramon, you have a very thoughtful strategic approach to investing in Frito-Lay. In some areas you're investing in some -- in different ways in different areas. Two questions. I thought that the plan was to also invest behind Tostitos and promote more. I thought it was like similar to the process for Lays. Did you put that into market or not? Because we didn't see much yet for Tostitos. And then secondly, regarding the positive choice brands, I would have thought that they would be less exposed to value-seeking consumer behavior, because I think they tend to skew more towards higher income, but they've been weak. Can you give us a little bit of what progress you've made to improve their distribution and where you are in terms of turning them around? Thanks.\nRamon Laguarta: That's great. Great two questions. On Tostitos, we've made some investments in the summer, but the Tostitos brand has a lot of relevance in this fall season with all the gatherings around TV watching and tailgating and everything else that happens in the US. So, as we will be putting incremental investment behind Tostitos and as I mentioned, it's going to be around brand investment, so programs on consumer investment, brand investment, and also value in the sense of 20% more bonus packs and some other additional value for consumers that will sure will create additional penetration for the brand and hopefully growth. And we're doing the same with Doritos. Doritos, we\u2019re investing a bit more sequentially. We started with Lays, now we're moving to Doritos. Doritos being a brand that responds very well to any sort of activity and we're seeing already in the month of September, October, how the brand is responding. And will sequentially improve. The other part of the business that --with the pandemic mobility and returning to different patterns by consumers that is being impacted is multi-packs. And variety packs was a huge driver of business. We're seeing that part of the business kind of slowing down a little bit, part is affordability. So some of the larger packs have been impacted. Now we offer 10-count multi-packs to -- before it was more 18 and 24. Now 10-count, that's growing very fast. Parts of the month, the consumers are gravitating toward lower purchase. That's growing very well. We're also giving bonus packs to our multi-packs, plus two units, plus three units. So this will be all additional value that I think will have a positive impact in the business in the coming months. Now when it comes to permissible, we've been working on permissible now for many, many years, both on making our core products more permissible. You see our levels of sodium, our levels of fat are being reduced, and that's creating a positive halo for all our brands, but also creating a portfolio of brands that are, as you say, not necessarily premium. I think the penetration is still limited around between 10% and 20% in some of those platforms, but already beyond what is the premium consumer. It's really democratizing positive choices to consumers. It's SunChips, it's the Simply range, which covers most of our large brands. It is SmartFoods, it is PopCorners, and as I said, some new addition to the family hopefully with Siete. So we keep investing in those. We're seeing penetration increasing. We're seeing positive development of those brands. And everything is impacted by affordability even for medium-income consumers or medium-high income consumers. We don't see this as a long-term derailer. We see something that will continue to provide the right portfolio, add distribution, make sure visibility is at the levels that it needs to be to generate trial. Be very intentional with where we invest money behind these brands to generate additional trial. And the fact of the matter is that, today with digital advertising and all the information and insights that we have, we can be much more precise and thoughtful and have much higher returns on how we build these platforms, which as I said earlier, they are meaningful. They are already $2 billion and this is a large business that is growing and will continue to grow for us in the long term.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nSteve Powers: Good morning, everybody. Thank you. So, I just -- maybe to clarify, Ramon, if you could talk a little bit more about what drove the step down between 4% organic sales growth for the year and now low single digits, the balance between how much was driven by some of the changes in international markets that you talked about versus less improvement than expected in some of the domestic businesses. I'm not 100% clear where the incrementality was. And then within that, within Frito-Lay specifically, you talked a lot about investments both in incremental brand building and in sort of sharpening price points and the value equation. I guess, I'm gleaning from that, that we should potentially expect segment pricing to flip negative as we go forward as you realize those investments. I just wanted to play that back and see if that was an appropriate assumption.\nJamie Caulfield: Hey, Steve. It's Jamie. On the revision from the 4% to low single digits, the combination of recovery of the consumer in the U.S., frankly, has been slower than we had anticipated. And then to a lesser degree, the geopolitics have impacted international. That's probably a half point drag on total PepsiCo revenue growth in the quarter. As far as pricing goes, it's a bit complex. We're investing in affordability where it makes sense, but we're investing in a number of levers to stimulate demand, and I think too soon to call on what the pricing outlook is going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to start back and think about international convenience food [indiscernible] also needs to see an increased level of reinvestment in marketing to reflect volume in key regions like in LatAm, while also keeping momentum in Europe. That has been a very nice place where I know Ramon, you have a lot of experience in there in negotiating with retailers. And should we see -- I mean my question is rooted on the affordability that we saw also in the US. Is that something that we should be basing for in places like LatAm, specifically Mexico? I understand the tough comps, but going forward, looking at ways to kind of dialing in [indiscernible] in LATAM. And on the Frito-Lay North America, just a bit of a check-in and a follow-up. In the reinvestment you mentioned, should we prepare for margins to remain pressured, it seems, until we lack summer next year? And therefore, I mean, we saw a sizable 200 basis points decline in operating margin for Frito-Lay. I would appreciate that. Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Thank you, Andrea. Listen, I think your question on international is very valid. I think we've always been very good at the affordability and the revenue management in LatAm for our food business. And I think we manage well the price ladder and the entry points and the price packs and how we execute that in the point of sale in our racks and in our front facing to the consumer. So we'll continue to dial that up. The truth is that in LatAm as well, we have great brands and we continue to invest in those brands, make sure that we carry to the consumer and to our brands versus strong competitors that we have in the area. So you'll see a balance between both, but it's not a new capability. It's something that we've been executing for a long time. We're perfecting that as we use leverage, the data and the information that we have. And we have more precise executional tools versus more broad based execution that we might have had in the past. So I think it's a capability that we keep optimizing, but it will be critical in us driving the business performance in the coming years. Now when it comes to the margin, maybe Jamie, you want to cover that one? We put Frito margin in the context of overall PepsiCo, so maybe Jamie, you want to talk about how we approach margin.\nJamie Caulfield: Yes. So Andrea, we're managing the margin at a total portfolio level at this point. And with Frito, our focus right now is on stimulating consumer demand, doing it in a responsible, disciplined way. And -- but overall, we're focused on the total PepsiCo margin. Over time, I think when the consumer gets a little more healthy and the business accelerates, we can put a little more emphasis on managing the margin. But for right now, we're really focused on the consumer and stimulating demand.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, this year is a good example of how we're able to invest in Frito, whilst expanding PepsiCo margin, meaningfully and substantially. And I think that's the way you should think about the way we will run the business in the near future.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nChris Carey: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for the question. I just wanted to ask a higher level question, then a follow-up on the line of questioning that Andrea was approaching. The higher level question, Ramon, as you begin to make pricing investments into this portfolio and other strategic investments as you had outlined for Frito-Lay, you'll be getting to see the sort of traction that you're getting or not. And I just wonder if your assessment of the slowdown that we're seeing is entirely cyclical, said another way. This is purely about value equations or are you seeing any consumption habits which may feel more structural or secular that are moving away from the business? I wonder if the Siete acquisition is a nod to how you see the direction of travel in this business over time. And if I could just one follow up on the line of questioning about total company margins, just from a productivity standpoint, are there any divisions where you feel better about your productivity initiatives? Clearly, Frito profit was under pressure this quarter despite you're going to be expanding programs. So, are the international and PBNA productivity programs -- is visibility there just quite good? And so anyway, just an expansion on your visibility on cost offsets for the investments that are coming in Frito. Thanks for entertaining both of those.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. Great questions both. Let me start with the margins and then I'll get back to the long-term growth of the food business. On the margins, we've declared very clearly that one of the strategic goals that we have is to keep improving the margins of our beverage business in the U.S. I think we're on track. Great performance by Ram and the team in improving the efficiency of the business, managing the portfolio towards high margin segments. And the business grew margin last year meaningfully and it will grow margin this year meaningfully and we see a good line of sight to our intentions of the mid-teens margins in a couple of years in PBNA. So that is working. The same internationally, you've seen the margin improvement international. That's driven by scale, but also by efficiency and productivity efforts by all our teams across our key markets, and that will continue. So those two are meaningful margin expansion opportunities for PepsiCo that we will continue to put our focus and deliver as we have a more balanced approach to the margins of the company. And we should be able to expand our margins, we're investing in the future of the company and providing value to consumers. So those three levers, we feel good about that. I didn't think about PBNA and international as the two contributors to how PepsiCo continues to expand its margins in a responsible way in the coming years. Now when it comes to the food business, your question on strategic transformation of the portfolio, we have been working for many, many years on evolving our portfolio with the trends of the markets. And these trends are different in different parts of the world, but clearly the consumer has been moving in some parts of the world towards looking for more permissible snacks or going into more unstructured meals. Those two are big levers of growth for us long term. One is, yes, we are providing consumers with better options to fulfill their needs for either a treat or any other occasion, a social gathering or whatever the occasion is on the snacks, and we feel good about the way our R&D has improved, the way our portfolio offerings have improved in providing permissibility in the category. And we see that in the penetration of the category. We see it in the frequency. And we don't think that's going to be changing for the long term. The big opportunity we see, and that is very visible in developed markets, but also in some of the developing markets, is consumers are changing their eating habits and they're eating more calories in small portions throughout the day. The concept of mini meals, the concept of replacing a big meal with a smaller meal, you can think about a sabra hummus with a Tostitos and a banana. These kind of meals are becoming more and more popular. Especially if you think about Gen Z, they are using these mini meals much more than we used to have -- we used to use it in our equivalent age. So we see the positive trends for the category. We're leaning in with innovation there. We're going to be moving our brands more into those spaces because there are a lot of occasions that our brands belong in and that we'll be able to satisfy consumers in that space. So, yes, health and wellness and we're ready and we've been moving the portfolio in that direction. Yes, unstructured meals, mini meals, and we're moving the portfolio in that direction. Your assessment is right. The acquisition of Siete hopefully will give us another tool to capture both permissible occasions and entering to meals in a way that is sustainable long term. But there are many other brands in the portfolio that can play in both of those spaces.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nRobert Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. First off, I was wondering if you can give us a report card on the Gatorade transition? And then related to that, perhaps if you could discuss the DSD system in general in PBNA, and whether through all the great work that you guys have been doing for the last couple of years, have you been able to re-engineer the system so that perhaps it's less volume dependent than it was in the past, and that is part of your path to the mid-teen margins in a few years. Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Great question. So on Gatorade, we feel good about Gatorade. Clearly, we learned last year and we've executed better this year. I'm sure that if you ask our customers, they would still think that we have way to improve, and I would agree. So our service levels have improved meaningfully, but still opportunities will get better as we go. The output of that improvement, we've seen shares of -- share of market of Gatorade in the sport category going up and within is a sustainable share performance. So that on one side. Along with Gatorade, the one brand that is performing beautifully for us is Propel, and Propel is part of also this transformation. Propel is growing double digit, it's fulfilling some great spaces for consumers complementary to Gatorade and it is benefiting as well by the execution that we are putting in place. So we feel good about that. It is improving somehow the economics of our DSD system in some states where we had lower scale with our soft drinks and other parts of the portfolio. That's a good move overall. With regards to the productivity journey on PBNA, go-to-market is clearly an opportunity and we're optimizing a lot of variables both in our warehousing, our transportation, our delivery models that will be sources of productivity going forward. But not only, right? We're seeing that we can also be more efficient in many other parts in how we procure. We can be more efficient in how we invest in demand. We can be more efficient in many areas in the PB&A business. And that's why I said earlier, we feel good about the trajectory of the business. We feel good about profitable growth. We feel good about how this business can get to this platform of mid-teens operating margin that would be great for PepsiCo and it would be great for obviously our beverage business in North America as well.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our last question comes from Kevin Grundy with BNP Paribas. Your line is open.\nKevin Grundy: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the question. So Ramon, just sticking with North America beverages, maybe we can pivot and get an update on the energy drink category, where you brought in the portfolio strategy here in recent years, not lost on your course, like salty snacks in the US, the category remains surprisingly weak. So a couple questions please. One, maybe just some updated thoughts on the energy drinks category and what the recovery there may look like? And then two, perhaps just comment on the sharp slowdowns that we've seen with Celsius market share and your ability for that brand to regain its lost momentum in the Pepsi system? Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Thank you, Kevin. Listen, I think the energy needs stayed by consumers in the US and everyone in the world will continue for the foreseeable future. I think everybody needs a bit of an energy boost throughout the day, and so that needs stayed will remain and I think it's going to be up to manufacturers or brand owners like us to satisfy those needs, whether it's through soft drinks, through coffee, through tea, through energy drinks. I think that opportunity remains and that opportunity will continue to be an opportunity for innovation and from brand investment. So on the short term and how different segments of the category play out, I think the energy category in the U.S. is clearly being impacted by the traffic inconvenience stores, and traffic inconvenience stores has gone down. It's been going down. I think it's part of the economic cycle that we're in. And that will reverse itself in the future once consumers feel better. So I wouldn't overplay the long-term of the energy category. With regards to Celsius, I'll say the same as I said in the past. We like the partnership. We are delivering on our part of the partnership, our distribution points are going up, our service levels keep going up, so we're executing our part of the partnership with discipline and high standards, and we remain optimistic on the partnership. So thank you very much everybody for the questions and the dialogue. And obviously, thank you for the confidence that you've placed with PepsiCo with your investment. We hope that you all stay safe and healthy and look forward to seeing you around. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's presentation.

            "name": "Ramon Laguarta",
            "content": "Good morning, Lauren. Thank you. Let me step back for a minute. If we think about the long-term growth potential of the food business in the U.S., we are very positive about the long-term trends. We've seen Gen Z snacking patterns and food patterns being in a way that favors the growth of our category. They are snacking more. They are eating mini meals versus large meals. And that favors our brands and the number of occasions that they carrier will grow. So long term, we feel very good about it. After three years of outsized growth for Frito, if you think about the double digit growth, we knew this year was going to be a year of normalization and that's what's happening. The consumer is reassessing patterns and with mobility and some of the financial situation. Now going forward, we think that the category will continue to grow at the pace of the past because of the long-term trends that I referred to. Now the way we're thinking about our brands playing in that space, potato chips will continue to be a big driver of the growth. And we're looking at potato chips, to your question on Lays, as a multi-tier opportunity. And the same with theme for all the other segments. So we have Lays clearly as the main part of the category. And within Lays, We will have unsalted and we'll have flavors where we know we can create a lot of loyalty and higher value for consumers. We'll have subsegments like lightly salted or baked that provide even more permissible options for consumer sustained potatoes. And then we'll have, at the upper end of the category brands like Miss Vickie's that provide a more premium experience. So we're thinking about each one of those categories as multi-tier where we offer value to some consumers, more specific choices for other consumers that want to stay within our brands. But the overarching -- the way we're thinking about the category is to continue to create growth, continue to ensure that the long-term, the category creates occasions and brings consumers into the -- will bring consumers into the category with our brand programs, our innovation, to keep the category growing very healthy in the future for us and for our customers. And that's how you should think about the long-term value that we can create with the Frito-Lay business. Yes, great question, Bryan. Listen, we've been thinking about productivity and cost transformation now for some time. We knew it was going to be a year of normalization after, as I said, three years of outsized growth. So we've been thinking about productivity in a very programmatic way and systemic way across the company. And there are some big platforms that we have started to deploy and will continue to deploy over the next few years. And these platforms are automation of our supply chain, both warehouses, manufacturing, distribution centers. We have invested a lot in data and organizing our data in a way that now we can deploy digitalization at scale throughout the value chain. So from the way we procure to the way we run our factories, to our transportation, to our go-to markets, we're really digitalizing the company. And that will generate growth and productivity as well. We invested -- we started to create our global business services, share services, now we call them Global Capability Centers, about a couple of years ago. Now we have them at a maturity level that we can use them much more in how we do labor across the company, how we service our organization. A&M optimization, or in general demand generation budgets optimization. We are much better at understanding otherwise. So there's multiple platforms of productivity that we'll keep deploying in the next few years in the U.S. and internationally. That will give us the optionality to invest in the business as we see best to continue to grow our categories in a responsible way, and continue to deliver the financial returns that our investors expect and that we are delivering. One good -- we feel good about this year in the sense that even with a very challenging consumer background, we're able to deliver at the high end of our EPS long-term target. That is very positive, and it makes us feel very confident that the productivity, the cost transformation programs that we started with the right levels of investment will deliver for us. Again, we're always managing the company for the long term. Even in a year like this in which we're challenged, on the top line we keep investing in A&M, we keep investing in the long-term transformation of the company, we keep investing in sustainability, making sure that long-term we are using less resources. So we're not taking our eyes off the ball on the long-term, whilst we deliver on the short-term for our investors. Thanks to what I think is best-in-class productivity multi-prone program that we'll continue to deploy in the coming years. Kaumil, as I said earlier, I think we have a very large productivity set of tools that we will keep deploying systematically. At the same time, we don't think our category will grow at 1% long term. We think our category with investments that we are putting back into the business and the health of our brands and the innovation that we have in place for this year and next year will deliver much more than 1%. So we're not considering that scenario in our kind of planning. But I would say, what we want to do is control what we can control, which is clearly focus on productivity, focusing on the long-term health of our category, continue to keep our consumers in our brand, continue to keep our consumers in our categories, building winning plans with our partners that generate profitable growth for both of us. That's where we're putting the focus. Long-term, as I said earlier, we believe in the long-term growth of both our snacks category and our beverage category. Both of them are trillion-dollar type of categories with global relevance, growing very healthy in many markets around the world and with long-term trends that give us a lot of confidence that these will be sizable growth categories for the long term. Hey, Dara. Good morning. Great, Dara. Thank you. Listen, I think it's a multi-pronged strategy and that we'll continue with that. So giving more value on the core is super relevant. We feel good about the investments that we put this summer, mostly behind the potato chips category and Lays. That drove growth in the potato chips business. Lays gained 3 points of household penetration, and we feel good about that return. Now we're going to apply that sequentially to other categories. We will use the fall, the winter season to put more investments behind Doritos and Tostitos. It's the football season, there's a lot of gatherings, and those brands belong very well in those gatherings. And it will be a combination of value in the form of bonus packs and more product too. Obviously these are large -- normally large group gatherings, so bonus packs make a lot of sense. We're giving 20% more product in Tostitos and Ruffles, some of the brands that belong in those locations. We're also investing in brand events. So, you will see Tostitos and Doritos, big brand events around NFL. We'll see Lays playing some of the classic Do Us a Flavor event. So the brands will have a combination of value and big brand events. At the same time, we're working on the long-term evolution of the portfolio. That is something that we've been working for many, many years. We'll continue. I think the success of our business long-term is based on evolving the portfolio at the speed that the consumer wants to go. So we'll continue to invest on our permissible portfolio. This is growing very fast, and we continue to put more legs to that business. Now we have SunChip, Simply, PopCorners, we have SmartFood, we have multiple brands. You guys saw the announcement of [CSA] (ph), hopefully that will go through legal approval and we will have another leg to that portfolio of solutions to keep growing the permissible portfolio. The same with multicultural. We see that with the Hispanic population growing in the United States, we have brands like Sabritas, Santitas, Gamesa that can work very well to that group of consumers. We have those brands in Mexico, we're making them -- we're scaling them up in the U.S. And the other lever we're playing there is, we're entering new channels. We're trying to expand beyond retail, in a way from home, in other channels where we can create occasions for our brands that right now are under-penetrated. So that's the multi-prone approach. We're probably going to lean a bit more on value in the first quarters without taking the ball off the long-term investments that we're making consistently in building the portfolio for the future. So, you will see us making those options. But again, I refer back to what I was saying earlier, the optionality that we can create for ourselves with our productivity programs gives us a lot of flexibility. And we will be making those adjustments as we see the returns of the different actions and the tactics taking place over the next few months. Yes. Thank you, Filippo. I'll give you a bit of a sense of -- there are pockets of strength in international. There are markets like in Southeast Asia, India. Those are markets that are growing nicely. We see parts of Eastern Europe growing nicely. We see Brazil growing at a good pace. So there is pockets of growth. There are other markets where we're seeing a bit of a deceleration. So China is a market where consumers are feeling a bit more constrained, and we're seeing that in our food business, although we're getting share, we're seeing a deceleration from double digit to single digit growth. We're seeing a bit of a deceleration in Mexico. We think this has to be related with elections and some of the noise around the flows of social money into the economy. Hopefully that will now stabilize. And we're seeing parts of Western Europe also challenge weather and other dynamics there. Now the Middle East is a different reality. The fact that we have a big business in the Middle East and yet it's being impacted by geopolitical situation and I don't think that's going to change in the coming months. But our teams locally are doing a great job navigating the situation and trying to continue to stay relevant for consumers and drive that business forward. So yes, your comment on foods versus beverages, yes, the beverage business is growing a little bit faster than the food business globally. That's great. Great two questions. On Tostitos, we've made some investments in the summer, but the Tostitos brand has a lot of relevance in this fall season with all the gatherings around TV watching and tailgating and everything else that happens in the US. So, as we will be putting incremental investment behind Tostitos and as I mentioned, it's going to be around brand investment, so programs on consumer investment, brand investment, and also value in the sense of 20% more bonus packs and some other additional value for consumers that will sure will create additional penetration for the brand and hopefully growth. And we're doing the same with Doritos. Doritos, we're investing a bit more sequentially. We started with Lays, now we're moving to Doritos. Doritos being a brand that responds very well to any sort of activity and we're seeing already in the month of September, October, how the brand is responding. And will sequentially improve. The other part of the business that --with the pandemic mobility and returning to different patterns by consumers that is being impacted is multi-packs. And variety packs was a huge driver of business. We're seeing that part of the business kind of slowing down a little bit, part is affordability. So some of the larger packs have been impacted. Now we offer 10-count multi-packs to -- before it was more 18 and 24. Now 10-count, that's growing very fast. Parts of the month, the consumers are gravitating toward lower purchase. That's growing very well. We're also giving bonus packs to our multi-packs, plus two units, plus three units. So this will be all additional value that I think will have a positive impact in the business in the coming months. Now when it comes to permissible, we've been working on permissible now for many, many years, both on making our core products more permissible. You see our levels of sodium, our levels of fat are being reduced, and that's creating a positive halo for all our brands, but also creating a portfolio of brands that are, as you say, not necessarily premium. I think the penetration is still limited around between 10% and 20% in some of those platforms, but already beyond what is the premium consumer. It's really democratizing positive choices to consumers. It's SunChips, it's the Simply range, which covers most of our large brands. It is SmartFoods, it is PopCorners, and as I said, some new addition to the family hopefully with Siete. So we keep investing in those. We're seeing penetration increasing. We're seeing positive development of those brands. And everything is impacted by affordability even for medium-income consumers or medium-high income consumers. We don't see this as a long-term derailer. We see something that will continue to provide the right portfolio, add distribution, make sure visibility is at the levels that it needs to be to generate trial. Be very intentional with where we invest money behind these brands to generate additional trial. And the fact of the matter is that, today with digital advertising and all the information and insights that we have, we can be much more precise and thoughtful and have much higher returns on how we build these platforms, which as I said earlier, they are meaningful. They are already $2 billion and this is a large business that is growing and will continue to grow for us in the long term. Thank you, Andrea. Listen, I think your question on international is very valid. I think we've always been very good at the affordability and the revenue management in LatAm for our food business. And I think we manage well the price ladder and the entry points and the price packs and how we execute that in the point of sale in our racks and in our front facing to the consumer. So we'll continue to dial that up. The truth is that in LatAm as well, we have great brands and we continue to invest in those brands, make sure that we carry to the consumer and to our brands versus strong competitors that we have in the area. So you'll see a balance between both, but it's not a new capability. It's something that we've been executing for a long time. We're perfecting that as we use leverage, the data and the information that we have. And we have more precise executional tools versus more broad based execution that we might have had in the past. So I think it's a capability that we keep optimizing, but it will be critical in us driving the business performance in the coming years. Now when it comes to the margin, maybe Jamie, you want to cover that one? We put Frito margin in the context of overall PepsiCo, so maybe Jamie, you want to talk about how we approach margin. Yes, this year is a good example of how we're able to invest in Frito, whilst expanding PepsiCo margin, meaningfully and substantially. And I think that's the way you should think about the way we will run the business in the near future. Yes. Great questions both. Let me start with the margins and then I'll get back to the long-term growth of the food business. On the margins, we've declared very clearly that one of the strategic goals that we have is to keep improving the margins of our beverage business in the U.S. I think we're on track. Great performance by Ram and the team in improving the efficiency of the business, managing the portfolio towards high margin segments. And the business grew margin last year meaningfully and it will grow margin this year meaningfully and we see a good line of sight to our intentions of the mid-teens margins in a couple of years in PBNA. So that is working. The same internationally, you've seen the margin improvement international. That's driven by scale, but also by efficiency and productivity efforts by all our teams across our key markets, and that will continue. So those two are meaningful margin expansion opportunities for PepsiCo that we will continue to put our focus and deliver as we have a more balanced approach to the margins of the company. And we should be able to expand our margins, we're investing in the future of the company and providing value to consumers. So those three levers, we feel good about that. I didn't think about PBNA and international as the two contributors to how PepsiCo continues to expand its margins in a responsible way in the coming years. Now when it comes to the food business, your question on strategic transformation of the portfolio, we have been working for many, many years on evolving our portfolio with the trends of the markets. And these trends are different in different parts of the world, but clearly the consumer has been moving in some parts of the world towards looking for more permissible snacks or going into more unstructured meals. Those two are big levers of growth for us long term. One is, yes, we are providing consumers with better options to fulfill their needs for either a treat or any other occasion, a social gathering or whatever the occasion is on the snacks, and we feel good about the way our R&D has improved, the way our portfolio offerings have improved in providing permissibility in the category. And we see that in the penetration of the category. We see it in the frequency. And we don't think that's going to be changing for the long term. The big opportunity we see, and that is very visible in developed markets, but also in some of the developing markets, is consumers are changing their eating habits and they're eating more calories in small portions throughout the day. The concept of mini meals, the concept of replacing a big meal with a smaller meal, you can think about a sabra hummus with a Tostitos and a banana. These kind of meals are becoming more and more popular. Especially if you think about Gen Z, they are using these mini meals much more than we used to have -- we used to use it in our equivalent age. So we see the positive trends for the category. We're leaning in with innovation there. We're going to be moving our brands more into those spaces because there are a lot of occasions that our brands belong in and that we'll be able to satisfy consumers in that space. So, yes, health and wellness and we're ready and we've been moving the portfolio in that direction. Yes, unstructured meals, mini meals, and we're moving the portfolio in that direction. Your assessment is right. The acquisition of Siete hopefully will give us another tool to capture both permissible occasions and entering to meals in a way that is sustainable long term. But there are many other brands in the portfolio that can play in both of those spaces. Great question. So on Gatorade, we feel good about Gatorade. Clearly, we learned last year and we've executed better this year. I'm sure that if you ask our customers, they would still think that we have way to improve, and I would agree. So our service levels have improved meaningfully, but still opportunities will get better as we go. The output of that improvement, we've seen shares of -- share of market of Gatorade in the sport category going up and within is a sustainable share performance. So that on one side. Along with Gatorade, the one brand that is performing beautifully for us is Propel, and Propel is part of also this transformation. Propel is growing double digit, it's fulfilling some great spaces for consumers complementary to Gatorade and it is benefiting as well by the execution that we are putting in place. So we feel good about that. It is improving somehow the economics of our DSD system in some states where we had lower scale with our soft drinks and other parts of the portfolio. That's a good move overall. With regards to the productivity journey on PBNA, go-to-market is clearly an opportunity and we're optimizing a lot of variables both in our warehousing, our transportation, our delivery models that will be sources of productivity going forward. But not only, right? We're seeing that we can also be more efficient in many other parts in how we procure. We can be more efficient in how we invest in demand. We can be more efficient in many areas in the PB&A business. And that's why I said earlier, we feel good about the trajectory of the business. We feel good about profitable growth. We feel good about how this business can get to this platform of mid-teens operating margin that would be great for PepsiCo and it would be great for obviously our beverage business in North America as well. Thank you, Kevin. Listen, I think the energy needs stayed by consumers in the US and everyone in the world will continue for the foreseeable future. I think everybody needs a bit of an energy boost throughout the day, and so that needs stayed will remain and I think it's going to be up to manufacturers or brand owners like us to satisfy those needs, whether it's through soft drinks, through coffee, through tea, through energy drinks. I think that opportunity remains and that opportunity will continue to be an opportunity for innovation and from brand investment. So on the short term and how different segments of the category play out, I think the energy category in the U.S. is clearly being impacted by the traffic inconvenience stores, and traffic inconvenience stores has gone down. It's been going down. I think it's part of the economic cycle that we're in. And that will reverse itself in the future once consumers feel better. So I wouldn't overplay the long-term of the energy category. With regards to Celsius, I'll say the same as I said in the past. We like the partnership. We are delivering on our part of the partnership, our distribution points are going up, our service levels keep going up, so we're executing our part of the partnership with discipline and high standards, and we remain optimistic on the partnership. So thank you very much everybody for the questions and the dialogue. And obviously, thank you for the confidence that you've placed with PepsiCo with your investment. We hope that you all stay safe and healthy and look forward to seeing you around. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to PepsiCo\u2019s 2024 Second Quarter Earnings question-and answer-session. Your lines have been placed on listen-only until it\u2019s your turn to ask a question. Today's call is being recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Ravi Pamnani, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Pamnani, you may begin.\nRavi Pamnani: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I hope everyone has had a chance this morning to review our press release and prepared remarks, both of which are available on our website. Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. We may make forward-looking statements on today's call, including about our business plans and updated 2024 guidance. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties and only reflect our view as of today, July 11, 2024, and we are under no obligation to update. When discussing our results, we refer to non-GAAP measures, which exclude certain items from reported results. Please refer to our second quarter 2024 earnings release and second quarter 2024 Form 10-Q available on pepsico.com for definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures and additional information regarding our results, including a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from forward-looking statements. Joining me today are PepsiCo's Chairman and CEO, Ramon Laguarta; and PepsiCo's Executive Vice President and CFO, Jamie Caulfield. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question. And with that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey, good morning, guys.\nRamon Laguarta: Good morning, Dara.\nDara Mohsenian: So, I just wanted to focus on the implied organic sales growth guidance in the back half of the year of mid-single digits to get to the approximate 4% guidance. You've obviously had a great longer term track record, Ramon, under your tenure, but in this softer U.S. consumer environment we've seen low single-digit growth in the last couple of quarters. So what gives you confidence at the corporate level you can get back there? And specifically. I wanted to dial down into Frito-Lay North America, which is presumably a piece of that. Obviously, a pretty soft volume result in Q2, you had taken some initial actions. So, help us understand the incremental actions from here. What gives you confidence you get a volume payback and a top line payback from that? And how sort of Frito-Lay North America fits into that -- that implied top line recovery also.\nRamon Laguarta: That's great, Dara. So I think it's an important area to focus. When we're saying at least four, we were talking more about around five in our minds. Now we're talking around four, so that's the pivot we're making. There is an adjustment and it is related to specifically the consumer in the U.S., and we can talk a little more. Now, why do we feel good about our guidance? And it cannot be disconnected from our earnings performance, because I think the work we've been doing on our productivity and our cost reduction gives us the optionality to reinvest back in half two in a way that we feel much more comfortable about the performance. So, a couple of, I would say, elements that give us confidence. Now, one is Quaker. Quaker, you're all familiar with the situation. We're recovering the supply chain by Q4, will be in almost 100% supply and obviously the business at that point will be growing materially, because we're just refilling the shelves and pipeline. So that should be out of the picture and it will be a positive impact for us. The second is mathematical, but it's lapping, and we think it -- obviously, the laps are much better in second half, and that has a -- gives us confidence that we can get back to a mid-single digit type of growth in the second half. The third element is international. International is an area we've been investing for the last few years materially, and is delivering for us. So first half of the year 7%, within that -- we will continue that same level of growth in the second half of the year, pluses on minuses around the world. But the portfolio is diverse enough, scale enough, profitable enough around multiple parts of the world that we believe that we can deliver. And then now in the U.S. there is clearly a consumer that is more challenged, and is a consumer that is telling us that in particular parts of the portfolio -- of our portfolio, they want more value to stay with our brands. That is not for all the consumers, it is some consumers, that is not for not all portfolio, it is some parts of the portfolio, and we have been working different tactics to give the consumer what they want, and we see that is working, and that's why we feel comfortable about -- given the oxygen that we have in the P&L that we'll be able to deploy in a very targeted way, thinking long-term about the category, making sure that has -- it has good ROI, that we'll be able to turn around the -- especially, what you were referring, the food business to positive volume, and with that, a higher level of net revenue. So that's how we're thinking about the second half. Again, we have green charts with some of the activities we've been executing. And July 4th has been very strong for us, and we feel good about the business. Now, the North America beverage business is also to be highlighted. It's a business that we said over time we want to stay with -- deliver profitable growth, make sure we compete well in the category, but at the same time improve our margins. We think we're executing the playbook well. Actually, we've been accelerating the profitable growth delivery of the business, and that it should continue in the second half. We're investing in advertising and marketing even more, in the platforms that are growing, and that's what, overall, if we put it all together, we feel good about the second half of the year and the momentum that we will start 2025 with that.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nBonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I actually had a question on PBNA. Ramon, I know you just touched on a bit, but I'd be curious to hear. If you're satisfied with some of the progress you might be making to reinvigorate the business, and maybe what green shoots you are seeing within PBNA? And then, I guess, I'm hoping for some color on the initiatives you highlighted in terms of the disciplined commercial investments, should we assume this will also mean a potential step up in promos for PBNA? And do you maybe see a need for some brand repositioning? Are there structural opportunities? Essentially, what will be the drivers to reaccelerate growth at PBNA? Thanks.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, it's good. Bonnie, I'll give you a couple of data points that I think are relevant. Gatorade, for example, has been gaining share. This year, year-to-date meaningfully is accelerating. That's a core part of our portfolio and a very profitable part of our portfolio. So that's one data point. We've been investing in Gatorade. Not so much on, as you were saying, promos and discount, but more on innovation, execution and branding. And that's paying back. The same with Propel. So all that functional hydration space, I think it's a focus for us. It's always been a focus, but now I think that part of the portfolio is working well. I think some of the G2DSD challenges that we had last year are behind us. I don't think we're all the way to perfection there, but much better service levels in this early part of the summer, which obviously -- that's when the category peaks and where we have to be ready for perfection. So that part is clear. If you think about the other brand, we've been talking for some time, Mountain Dew. Mountain Dew is on growth. Now it's back to growth. I think we made this strategic decision to have multiple flavors driving the brand and made Baja a structural part of the portfolio versus yes, an LTO, that's driving consumers into the brand, incremental consumers. And again, better levels of execution. So just some example. All the Zero part of the portfolio is booming, right? If you think about consumer trends, clearly we know where they're going, we know that internationally, and we know that's going to eventually happen here in the U.S. So Zero not only on colas, not only on soft drinks, but also on Gatorade, on cheese, on coffees, we're seeing that consumers are growing. And then the last part is our food service business is becoming stronger and we're being better at where the profitability is, which is on the fragmented restaurant, local restaurant, and where consumers have a lot of interaction every day. And that part of the portfolio, we've been investing. We're getting additional distribution. We know we're becoming a better execution company in that particular channel, and we're feeling good about that.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is open.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks so much. Ramon, I wanted to go back to Frito, if I may. Because you commented on some consumers, and being more value to stay with our brands. But one thing we've been doing a lot in trying to parse through the data that's available to us, and it looks like it\u2019s the category -- the salty snack category as a whole is really pressured. It's not just your brands, and I know given your share, there's sort of one in the same, but it looks like there's a broader category issue. Again, some of the data we've looked at, it feels like the category is not proving terribly responsive to promotion. So I just was hoping you could comment on that, if that is or isn't consistent with what you're seeing? And how what you're going to be doing will be different? Because, again, what we've seen so far, it doesn't look like there's a lot of response and it feels like the category is proving more discretionary. So just love your thoughts on that? Thanks.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. I think -- we feel that the issue is an issue of value, is not an issue of anything else. And we have a lot of data, obviously now how do you address that value gap versus what consumers want to do. I think it's the -- it's where the know-how will come. And the sweet spot for us is not to promote, but is to promote to who needs it, in the products that need it versus a blanket approach to promotion. So that's where we're investing a lot of time. I think we're much more capable from the insights and diagnostic point of view and also from our ability to execute more granularly all these interventions, be it digital, be it with particular channels or customers. To give you an example. We feel that the unsalted part of our portfolio, right? If you think about potato chips or tortilla chips, that needs some value reset and value intervention for some consumers. When we think about flavor potato chips or other parts of our portfolio. No, I mean consumers are staying in the category, are staying in our brands, and they're buying with pretty high frequency as in the past. There are other parts of the portfolio that are growing, growing very fast, especially the permissible part of what we call permissible portfolio positive choices, this is a -- when you think about brands like SunChips, PopCorners, Smartfood, or the Simply range of the Eaten Path, those brands are growing. And there it\u2019s not about value, there I think it's more about and the way we're going to approach it\u2019s more marketing, investment, awareness, execution, availability. So there's different tools that we'll be using to drive the category growth. To your point on, is it the category? Is it PepsiCo brands? I think given our massive participation in the category through many multiple brands, I think it's our responsibility to manage this category for the long-term, providing value to consumers in different ways and continue to have the savory snacks category growing above food structurally as we have done in the past. Now, there is nothing in terms of consumer -- long-term trends that tells us that that's not possible. I think it's a small adjustments in value and in execution and in investment in new innovation areas that will drive it, and we feel very strong about our ability to do that, not in the long-term, but actually in the short-term, in Q3 and Q4. And that's why our guidance reflects a little bit that inflection because we're already testing and executing some of these levers and we see the returns it has in volume and net revenue.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with BofA. Your line is open.\nBryan Spillane: Hey. Thanks, operator. Good morning, Ramon. Good morning, Jamie.\nRamon Laguarta: Hey, Bryan.\nBryan Spillane: Just wanted to circle back on Frito. And I guess stepping back, you're able to sort of reset the margins and fund it with just drilling deeper into some of the reservoirs of productivity other places in the organization. So I guess just if you can comment on two things related to that. One, given that you're tapping more productivity this year, does it -- how does that affect next year? Does that affect maybe not having as much productivity to flow through, or is that reservoir very deep. And then the second is, as we are thinking about Frito margins stepping back in the back half of the year, should we be thinking about that now as the new base to maybe grow off of gradually, or is that a major step down, and then you'd expect Frito to have another maybe step change up in the future?\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. So, Bryan, let me tell you, I think we've talked about this in the past. We're managing total PepsiCo operating margin and as you've seen, we keep improving the margin. This quarter was almost 100 bps of operating margin improvement, and it's been consistent for the last few years. We feel good about our productivity pipeline, it\u2019s not tactical, it's super strategic and it's multiyear and it's based on automation, it's based on digitalization, simplification of the company, standardization, different service models to the business. So there is a whole portfolio of productivity ideas that are multiyear in nature and we don't think that we will slow down our productivity in the coming years. Now, as you think about our overall margin, international has continued to grow its margin. PBNA has been very vocal from our side that we want to have that business going -- moving into mid-teens, and we're delivered on that. And we've always said that the big value of Frito for us is not so much whether it's a 26 or 26.5 or 27.5, that is very relevant, I would say. It's always tremendous acquitted for us long-term, and the biggest value creation for Frito is to make sure that it grows at a 4% or 5% levels, and that is going to be our -- continues to be our strategic focus. How do we get Frito to continue to grow above the category, make the category very healthy in terms of growth, keep bringing consumers occasions and channel -- new opportunities for channel expansion to Frito, and that will continue to be our focus. We'll keep investing until we get it right. We're going to -- we feel good about getting it right rather soon. And that's the way we'll keep managing the overall profitability of the company. And Frito, PBNA, and international, in particular, with different sub-strategies, and obviously that triggers down to every market around the world when you talk about international, but we have very good playbook for every country and every line of business in every country, expectations on profitability and roadmaps to deliver that kind of growth.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Hi. Good morning, everybody. Do you believe that the prices at Frito are too high, given the increases over recent years?\nRamon Laguarta: Do you think Kaumil? I think I kind of touched on the point earlier, but some parts of the portfolio need value adjustments, some parts of the portfolio don't. Some parts of the portfolio need to be -- for particular consumers we need some new entry price points and probably some new promotional kind of mechanics that don't spec for the consumer to invest so much cash in a purchase of salty, so there's adjustments that we have to make to -- for certain consumers some parts of the portfolio. I don't think the overall portfolio is -- needs a reset. I think this is going to be about granularity, it's going to be about good execution of that granularity, and that's what I think we're well prepared to do throughout the full value chain. So, yes, there is some value to be given back to consumers after three or four years of a lot of inflation. Our cost allows us to do that wherever we choose to do. And that will be one of the interventions that we'll be making in the second half, but not the only one. I mean, there's going to be investments in marketing. There's going to be investments in better execution. That overall will drive the business -- the business growth to where we think it will be structurally in the coming years.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS. Your line is open.\nPeter Grom: Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. So I was hoping to get some color on Latin America. Organic revenue was the weakest we've seen in some time here, and I think in the prepared remarks Brazil and Mexico seems solid. So just curious, kind of what drove the weakness in the quarter? And then, Ramon, just as we look ahead, you mentioned you still expect strong growth from international in the back half of the year. How does Latin America fit into that equation? Would you anticipate improvement, or should we expect more muted performance to continue? Thanks.\nRamon Laguarta: No, I think -- again, I would look at LatAm and all the international business in like six months rather than a three months and three months. There's a lot of moving pieces between first quarter, second quarter, Chinese New Year. In particular, the LatAm situation in our case is related to Mexico. And Mexico because of the elections there have been some changes in disposable income given to the families by the government that created some, I would say some abnormalities in the way those funds were distributed, and that's impacted demand in Mexico in the last -- what we're seeing in the last three weeks in Mexico that as those funds have been given back to consumers again, that the demand has come back to our categories. So we don't foresee any issue in LatAm. LatAm, again, I mean, value continues to be a factor as it's always been in LatAm. We'll see plus and minuses between the different countries. But as a region, LatAm continues to be a high performing region for us, where we keep developing the categories and we keep expanding our margins and building scale businesses not only in Mexico and Brazil, but across multiple markets.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Filippo Falorni with Citi. Your line is open.\nFilippo Falorni: Hey. Good morning, everyone. So just staying on the international business. Ramon, you sounded pretty confident on the growth in international. Maybe you can talk more about, like what regions do you see the greater growth potential in that business? And going back to the question on guidance on top line for the second half, is the improvement in organic sales mainly driven by an improvement in North America or an acceleration in international? If you can give some color there would be helpful.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, Filippo. Hi. You should assume that most of the incremental acceleration of the business comes from mostly North America, right? And the two factors I mentioned, Quaker will get back to growth, the laps get better for North America, and then some of the interventions we're making both in value and in additional A&M should drive additional volume. Those are the three factors. Internationally, we're assuming that the rate of growth for the first half will continue in the second half. And again, we're seeing parts of the portfolio -- accelerating parts of the portfolio kind of stabilizing, some of them being a little bit softer. But overall the portfolio at this point is broad enough. We have enough scale across multiple markets that we're kind of hedged geographically. So that's what we're assuming and what we're seeing that per caps growth of the category will continue. We continue to invest meaningfully incremental funds to both execution and brand development, and we don't see any reason why not. Of course, it could be big geopolitical reasons why we change our mind later in the year. But with the information we have today about geopolitics and stability of countries, that's our best guess today.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nRobert Moskow: Hi, thanks. A couple of questions. One is, I was hoping you'd give a little more color on the energy drinks category, growth has slowed dramatically in the U.S. And just wanted to get your perspective and ask like, do you think that the consumer there are making a value decision as well? There's a lot of premium price drinks there. Do you see any evidence of trading down to maybe higher caffeine carbonated drinks? Thanks.\nRamon Laguarta: Listen, I think fundamentally the energy category continues to provide long-term good prospects for our industry. I think it's a consumer need that will continue to be there and whether we are able to satisfy that through multiple options, that will continue to grow. There's always small ups and downs of subcategories within LRB that you could argue. Is it because of channel dynamics? Is it because it's very hard and people are moving to other parts of the portfolio? Like we're seeing, for example, in our case in the recent six weeks a massive growth in our hydration portfolio because, obviously, it's been very hot in the U.S. So I guess there is some cannibalization between energy and hydration for some consumers, and they prefer to do that. So, I wouldn't overread into the short-term of the category. I would try to think about this as a consumer needs energy, if we're able to provide energy in a consumer friendly way, including price, probably as you mentioned, but I would say functionality, clean labels, I mean like a lot of the things that I think the categories been working on, there should be a good runway for that segment of the category, and it's been value creating for a lot of us that participate in it, including the retailer partners and the brand owners.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, Ramon, Jamie. My question is on the bridge to the mid-single digit organic sales growth in the second half. Assuming international, Ramon you just mentioned it grows the same kind of mid-single digits into the second half. And, of course, understanding the easy comps for Quaker. It still implies a good inflection into Frito and PBNA. How do you think, like we should be thinking about the progress? And perhaps related to that, from a channel perspective the away from home for you growing from what it seems to be like a distribution, what is the like-for-like in sales, basically by channel, if you would think about away from home and at home?\nJamie Caulfield: Andrea, it's Jamie. On the acceleration in the back half, as Ramon mentioned, that's going to come mostly from North America for the reasons we cited and we're making the investment, primarily focused North America, we've got the easier lapse. And Quaker, so that gives us a lot of confidence. On channels, look, away from home has been a focus area for us. We put investment behind that and it's outgrowing the balance of our portfolio, so we'd expect that to continue.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.\nChris Carey: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Ramon, I know you mentioned international to be looked at on six-month cadence. I was wondering, however, if you could comment on some specific regions just in Europe. Why to your mind have trends been so resilient? I don't think it's just your portfolio, I think the region in general has been more resilient for longer than many expected. And then in Asia, I think you were clear last quarter that there were some timing benefit. Clearly we saw that normalize this quarter. What's the right run rate for this division? And do you have any comments on the progress in China? Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. So listen, again, we're looking at international as a portfolio of geographies and markets, and we see the portfolio kind of when it's not growing so much here -- so at the end historically, we've learned that the portfolio is quite diversified and that gives us the opportunity to talk about an international business as a total. Obviously, we run the business locally. Now, when you go down to different parts of the world. Europe is resilient and is resilient in -- our business has been performing very well, both on top line and share and very importantly, in margin improvement, and that has been a focus of the management team for quite some time. We're getting a lot of traction. That's also giving the business the opportunity to reinvest, which also, obviously, drives the top line. And I think Europe in our case, is in a very positive cycle, which we expect to continue in the coming years. Now, I talked about Latin America, so I will not mention much. We continue to see a lot of growth in many parts of AMESA region, in particular, India is a big growth space for us, and is an investment area for sure. The opportunity is massive. If you think, it will take a decade perspective, and we're putting infrastructure on the ground and we're putting a lot of -- we are investing in the brands, make sure that we build the scale to capture what is going to be, I think a high demand market for many, many years. Then when it comes to Asia, we're seeing a very cautious consumer in China. The consumer is clearly saving more than spending, and that has an implication for many categories. Our categories is a low ticket item, so we continue to see good performance of our categories, and we're gaining share. It's quite an advantage business what we have in China, especially on the food sides. And we continue to invest in different regions of the country. We continue to get more penetration, additional distribution, that has been a big driver. So additional penetration, additional consumers coming to our brands, coming to the habit of snacking, and that has been very positive. So in spite of a cautious consumer, we have levers to continue to grow the business. Some of that physical availability, some of that is share of market and better penetration of our brands. I think we have advantage products there. We have a very strong R&D center in China that develops is for east products, and that is giving us an advantage versus other companies. So that's how we're seeing the different parts of the world. And again, we'll continue to invest. For us, this is a business that, if you think about our international business, it's almost $40 billion already, right? So it's been growing very fast over time. It's almost $40 billion, it's accretive to PepsiCo. It's higher margin than the average of PepsiCo, and it's clearly the largest growth opportunity for our company if you think about the next decade, and that's where we are putting so much focus, so much investment. We believe that we -- both on the beverage side and on the food side we have a many years of growth in that particular part of the business.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nRobert Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. I want to look at a more structural, strategic type question. And that is to get your thoughts around the Carlsberg Britvic transaction. And maybe talk a little bit why perhaps it made more sense for Carlsberg to buy Britvic rather than you, given the fact that you generally own your bottlers in the U.S., why not Britvic? Does that have any implications in terms of how you're thinking about the U.S. bottlers. And does the fact that maybe combining beer and CSDs makes more sense outside of the U.S., obviously for regulatory reasons. How should we think about that component? Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. I wouldn't extrapolate too much. This is a decision by Carlsberg to make an investment in the UK business. It makes a lot of sense for Carlsberg for multiple reasons. And we partner with Carlsberg in other geographies. We are very happy with the partnership. We trust them as a partner to grow our business. And, of course, we supported the transaction. So I wouldn't over extrapolate it. Let's make it a UK decision by Carlsberg, and we decided to endorse the transaction because we have a great relationship with Carlsberg, and we trust them.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Carlos Laboy with HSBC. Your line is open.\nCarlos Laboy: Yes. Good morning, everyone. Ramon, in keeping with the last two comments you've made in the Britvic deal, can you discuss the international franchise doctrine of PepsiCo? In other words, how are you thinking in terms of clarity of what each side is supposed to do and allowed to keep, right? I'm trying to get a sense of how you're compelling independent bottlers in these great growth territories that you see to step up investments for the purpose of accelerated system revenue growth and bottling returns?\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, Carlos. Listen, we're very pleased with the relationship we have with most of the bottlers and the strategic alignment. Actually, our international beverage business has been one of the growth engines of the company for the last few years. So we keep innovating and building great products that have consumer appeal, and specifically we've been very successful with our non-sugar business internationally. Our non-sugar Pepsi has been a great driver of growth for many years. Gatorade is also another great platform that we are moving around. So the last is growing 10% historically, and we will continue to invest. Now are there other opportunities to scale up some of our bottlers. Of course, there's always opportunities to improve the infrastructure, and we're working on that for the long-term, but I think this is a part of our business that is going well. It's a part of our business that we are prepared to invest even more. The bottlers know we obviously are very aligned statistically on which markets and which platforms we're going to put our focus and our investments. And I think, as I said, is part of our international story that I was referring to earlier. There's a food story and there's a beverage story, and there's a combination of the two story in some markets that we're playing long-term. So hopefully I'm answering your question. I don't know if you had some other kind of implications there.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC. Your line is open.\nNik Modi: Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Ramon, I was hoping you can just kind of share some perspective around overall food volume, right? Because a lot of questions have been asked about where's the volume going? It's not just salty snacks that's been under pressure, it's pretty much across the board in terms of volumes. And so I was just curious on your thoughts. I don't think it's GLP-1, I know that's what some might suggest, but love your views on kind of where you think the volume is actually migrating?\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, listen. Nik, I don't know about all the categories. I know that for many categories the multiple year inflation that we had to take because our input cost went up, has created some perception and some reality in a lot of households that food is expensive and consumers are making choices. And they can make choices to cook versus buy finished goods or finished products, or they can make a lot of decisions around how they spend their money and how do they feed themselves every day with the lowest budget. And I think that's the fundamental question to address for the food companies. Now that our cost are kind of normalizing, our input cost, and we've all been going at productivity in our case, this has been a very, very strategic focus for us. Now, how do we deploy those resources against what are the best levers to reignite growth? And again, it will not be a blanket approach, it will be a segmented approach. In our case, it will be very rational, it will based on data. I think we have a lot of data, and we have great segmentation. And I think we can execute with again, with precision so that we don't destroy value where we create value for the category as we increase the net revenue of the category. So that's how we're thinking about it. I don't think GLP at this point, Nik, as material impact in our category for sure, and we have a lot of panels and we have a lot of conversation with consumers, it's not impacting us. At this point is an economic value relationship for our categories, and we will address them in the second half of the year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from -- one moment -- comes from Kevin Grundy with BNP Paribas. Your line is open.\nKevin Grundy: Great, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Covered a lot of ground, and not to beat a dead horse, but just to drill down a couple of areas, Ramon, if we could on the demand weakness in snack. So you mentioned some parts of the portfolio, but not all consumers. I apologize if I missed this. What are you seeing beyond the low income consumer? It's a lot of focus on where's the consumer and depends on which management call you're listening to or what industry frankly. What are you seeing specifically with the middle and high-end consumer? Is the weakness also being seen among that cohort as well? And then I think an important question as well, is there anything you're seeing in your market research? I know you're staying close to the consumer that gives you any pause with the longer term outlook for the Frito business, which has been so strong for so long. Is there anything there that kind of gives you pause or you do this to be entirely transitory? So thanks for that.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes, thanks Kevin. Listen, I think the -- this need for value or more value consciousness I think is impacting every household in the U.S. So it is different levels of income, I think it's impacting everybody. And we're seeing behaviors in different income levels. I would aggregate all that -- the consumer is much more price conscious, is looking for more value across. So maybe you see the higher income consumers that they're not going to expensive restaurants, they're adjusting their behavior to more affordable restaurants, or they stay at home and then they create their own entertainment moments or fun moments at home. So do you see different behaviors happening everywhere, I think the connecting line it would be, the consumer is more cautious, the consumer is more choiceful, but the consumer is willing to spend in areas where they see value and we see it in our category, right, the more -- the parts of the category there I was referring to. But also for other parts of the category, they're asking for more value and they're willing to compromise in some of their decisions. So that's the problem to address. So I would stay there and I think once we address that situation, we will be back in growth, and we feel pretty good about the tools and the resources we have and the actions that we're taking and we're quite encouraged by recent performance of the business. Okay. So I think we -- this is the last question. So thank you, everyone, for joining us today and your thoughtful questions. And also, obviously, for the confidence that you've placed in us with your investments, and we hope everybody has a great summer, and do buy a lot of PepsiCo products, so thank you.\nJamie Caulfield: Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.",

On the acceleration in the back half, as Ramon mentioned, that's going to come mostly from North America for the reasons we cited and we're making the investment, primarily focused North America, we've got the easier lapse.

We put investment behind that and it's outgrowing the balance of our portfolio, so we'd expect that to continue. Thank you."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Ramon Laguarta",
            "content": "Good morning, Dara. That's great, Dara. So I think it's an important area to focus. When we're saying at least four, we were talking more about around five in our minds. Now we're talking around four, so that's the pivot we're making. There is an adjustment and it is related to specifically the consumer in the U.S., and we can talk a little more. Now, why do we feel good about our guidance? And it cannot be disconnected from our earnings performance, because I think the work we've been doing on our productivity and our cost reduction gives us the optionality to reinvest back in half two in a way that we feel much more comfortable about the performance. So, a couple of, I would say, elements that give us confidence. Now, one is Quaker. Quaker, you're all familiar with the situation. We're recovering the supply chain by Q4, will be in almost 100% supply and obviously the business at that point will be growing materially, because we're just refilling the shelves and pipeline. So that should be out of the picture and it will be a positive impact for us. The second is mathematical, but it's lapping, and we think it -- obviously, the laps are much better in second half, and that has a -- gives us confidence that we can get back to a mid-single digit type of growth in the second half. The third element is international. International is an area we've been investing for the last few years materially, and is delivering for us. So first half of the year 7%, within that -- we will continue that same level of growth in the second half of the year, pluses on minuses around the world. But the portfolio is diverse enough, scale enough, profitable enough around multiple parts of the world that we believe that we can deliver. And then now in the U.S. there is clearly a consumer that is more challenged, and is a consumer that is telling us that in particular parts of the portfolio -- of our portfolio, they want more value to stay with our brands. That is not for all the consumers, it is some consumers, that is not for not all portfolio, it is some parts of the portfolio, and we have been working different tactics to give the consumer what they want, and we see that is working, and that's why we feel comfortable about -- given the oxygen that we have in the P&L that we'll be able to deploy in a very targeted way, thinking long-term about the category, making sure that has -- it has good ROI, that we'll be able to turn around the -- especially, what you were referring, the food business to positive volume, and with that, a higher level of net revenue. So that's how we're thinking about the second half. Again, we have green charts with some of the activities we've been executing. And July 4th has been very strong for us, and we feel good about the business. Now, the North America beverage business is also to be highlighted. It's a business that we said over time we want to stay with -- deliver profitable growth, make sure we compete well in the category, but at the same time improve our margins. We think we're executing the playbook well. Actually, we've been accelerating the profitable growth delivery of the business, and that it should continue in the second half. We're investing in advertising and marketing even more, in the platforms that are growing, and that's what, overall, if we put it all together, we feel good about the second half of the year and the momentum that we will start 2025 with that. Yes, it's good. Bonnie, I'll give you a couple of data points that I think are relevant. Gatorade, for example, has been gaining share. This year, year-to-date meaningfully is accelerating. That's a core part of our portfolio and a very profitable part of our portfolio. So that's one data point. We've been investing in Gatorade. Not so much on, as you were saying, promos and discount, but more on innovation, execution and branding. And that's paying back. The same with Propel. So all that functional hydration space, I think it's a focus for us. It's always been a focus, but now I think that part of the portfolio is working well. I think some of the G2DSD challenges that we had last year are behind us. I don't think we're all the way to perfection there, but much better service levels in this early part of the summer, which obviously -- that's when the category peaks and where we have to be ready for perfection. So that part is clear. If you think about the other brand, we've been talking for some time, Mountain Dew. Mountain Dew is on growth. Now it's back to growth. I think we made this strategic decision to have multiple flavors driving the brand and made Baja a structural part of the portfolio versus yes, an LTO, that's driving consumers into the brand, incremental consumers. And again, better levels of execution. So just some example. All the Zero part of the portfolio is booming, right? If you think about consumer trends, clearly we know where they're going, we know that internationally, and we know that's going to eventually happen here in the U.S. So Zero not only on colas, not only on soft drinks, but also on Gatorade, on cheese, on coffees, we're seeing that consumers are growing. And then the last part is our food service business is becoming stronger and we're being better at where the profitability is, which is on the fragmented restaurant, local restaurant, and where consumers have a lot of interaction every day. And that part of the portfolio, we've been investing. We're getting additional distribution. We know we're becoming a better execution company in that particular channel, and we're feeling good about that. Yes. I think -- we feel that the issue is an issue of value, is not an issue of anything else. And we have a lot of data, obviously now how do you address that value gap versus what consumers want to do. I think it's the -- it's where the know-how will come. And the sweet spot for us is not to promote, but is to promote to who needs it, in the products that need it versus a blanket approach to promotion. So that's where we're investing a lot of time. I think we're much more capable from the insights and diagnostic point of view and also from our ability to execute more granularly all these interventions, be it digital, be it with particular channels or customers. To give you an example. We feel that the unsalted part of our portfolio, right? If you think about potato chips or tortilla chips, that needs some value reset and value intervention for some consumers. When we think about flavor potato chips or other parts of our portfolio. No, I mean consumers are staying in the category, are staying in our brands, and they're buying with pretty high frequency as in the past. There are other parts of the portfolio that are growing, growing very fast, especially the permissible part of what we call permissible portfolio positive choices, this is a -- when you think about brands like SunChips, PopCorners, Smartfood, or the Simply range of the Eaten Path, those brands are growing. And there it's not about value, there I think it's more about and the way we're going to approach it's more marketing, investment, awareness, execution, availability. So there's different tools that we'll be using to drive the category growth. To your point on, is it the category? Is it PepsiCo brands? I think given our massive participation in the category through many multiple brands, I think it's our responsibility to manage this category for the long-term, providing value to consumers in different ways and continue to have the savory snacks category growing above food structurally as we have done in the past. Now, there is nothing in terms of consumer -- long-term trends that tells us that that's not possible. I think it's a small adjustments in value and in execution and in investment in new innovation areas that will drive it, and we feel very strong about our ability to do that, not in the long-term, but actually in the short-term, in Q3 and Q4. And that's why our guidance reflects a little bit that inflection because we're already testing and executing some of these levers and we see the returns it has in volume and net revenue. Hey, Bryan. Yes. So, Bryan, let me tell you, I think we've talked about this in the past. We're managing total PepsiCo operating margin and as you've seen, we keep improving the margin. This quarter was almost 100 bps of operating margin improvement, and it's been consistent for the last few years. We feel good about our productivity pipeline, it's not tactical, it's super strategic and it's multiyear and it's based on automation, it's based on digitalization, simplification of the company, standardization, different service models to the business. So there is a whole portfolio of productivity ideas that are multiyear in nature and we don't think that we will slow down our productivity in the coming years. Now, as you think about our overall margin, international has continued to grow its margin. PBNA has been very vocal from our side that we want to have that business going -- moving into mid-teens, and we're delivered on that. And we've always said that the big value of Frito for us is not so much whether it's a 26 or 26.5 or 27.5, that is very relevant, I would say. It's always tremendous acquitted for us long-term, and the biggest value creation for Frito is to make sure that it grows at a 4% or 5% levels, and that is going to be our -- continues to be our strategic focus. How do we get Frito to continue to grow above the category, make the category very healthy in terms of growth, keep bringing consumers occasions and channel -- new opportunities for channel expansion to Frito, and that will continue to be our focus. We'll keep investing until we get it right. We're going to -- we feel good about getting it right rather soon. And that's the way we'll keep managing the overall profitability of the company. And Frito, PBNA, and international, in particular, with different sub-strategies, and obviously that triggers down to every market around the world when you talk about international, but we have very good playbook for every country and every line of business in every country, expectations on profitability and roadmaps to deliver that kind of growth. Do you think Kaumil? I think I kind of touched on the point earlier, but some parts of the portfolio need value adjustments, some parts of the portfolio don't. Some parts of the portfolio need to be -- for particular consumers we need some new entry price points and probably some new promotional kind of mechanics that don't spec for the consumer to invest so much cash in a purchase of salty, so there's adjustments that we have to make to -- for certain consumers some parts of the portfolio. I don't think the overall portfolio is -- needs a reset. I think this is going to be about granularity, it's going to be about good execution of that granularity, and that's what I think we're well prepared to do throughout the full value chain. So, yes, there is some value to be given back to consumers after three or four years of a lot of inflation. Our cost allows us to do that wherever we choose to do. And that will be one of the interventions that we'll be making in the second half, but not the only one. I mean, there's going to be investments in marketing. There's going to be investments in better execution. That overall will drive the business -- the business growth to where we think it will be structurally in the coming years. No, I think -- again, I would look at LatAm and all the international business in like six months rather than a three months and three months. There's a lot of moving pieces between first quarter, second quarter, Chinese New Year. In particular, the LatAm situation in our case is related to Mexico. And Mexico because of the elections there have been some changes in disposable income given to the families by the government that created some, I would say some abnormalities in the way those funds were distributed, and that's impacted demand in Mexico in the last -- what we're seeing in the last three weeks in Mexico that as those funds have been given back to consumers again, that the demand has come back to our categories. So we don't foresee any issue in LatAm. LatAm, again, I mean, value continues to be a factor as it's always been in LatAm. We'll see plus and minuses between the different countries. But as a region, LatAm continues to be a high performing region for us, where we keep developing the categories and we keep expanding our margins and building scale businesses not only in Mexico and Brazil, but across multiple markets. Yes, Filippo. Hi. You should assume that most of the incremental acceleration of the business comes from mostly North America, right? And the two factors I mentioned, Quaker will get back to growth, the laps get better for North America, and then some of the interventions we're making both in value and in additional A&M should drive additional volume. Those are the three factors. Internationally, we're assuming that the rate of growth for the first half will continue in the second half. And again, we're seeing parts of the portfolio -- accelerating parts of the portfolio kind of stabilizing, some of them being a little bit softer. But overall the portfolio at this point is broad enough. We have enough scale across multiple markets that we're kind of hedged geographically. So that's what we're assuming and what we're seeing that per caps growth of the category will continue. We continue to invest meaningfully incremental funds to both execution and brand development, and we don't see any reason why not. Of course, it could be big geopolitical reasons why we change our mind later in the year. But with the information we have today about geopolitics and stability of countries, that's our best guess today. Listen, I think fundamentally the energy category continues to provide long-term good prospects for our industry. I think it's a consumer need that will continue to be there and whether we are able to satisfy that through multiple options, that will continue to grow. There's always small ups and downs of subcategories within LRB that you could argue. Is it because of channel dynamics? Is it because it's very hard and people are moving to other parts of the portfolio? Like we're seeing, for example, in our case in the recent six weeks a massive growth in our hydration portfolio because, obviously, it's been very hot in the U.S. So I guess there is some cannibalization between energy and hydration for some consumers, and they prefer to do that. So, I wouldn't overread into the short-term of the category. I would try to think about this as a consumer needs energy, if we're able to provide energy in a consumer friendly way, including price, probably as you mentioned, but I would say functionality, clean labels, I mean like a lot of the things that I think the categories been working on, there should be a good runway for that segment of the category, and it's been value creating for a lot of us that participate in it, including the retailer partners and the brand owners. Yes. So listen, again, we're looking at international as a portfolio of geographies and markets, and we see the portfolio kind of when it's not growing so much here -- so at the end historically, we've learned that the portfolio is quite diversified and that gives us the opportunity to talk about an international business as a total. Obviously, we run the business locally. Now, when you go down to different parts of the world. Europe is resilient and is resilient in -- our business has been performing very well, both on top line and share and very importantly, in margin improvement, and that has been a focus of the management team for quite some time. We're getting a lot of traction. That's also giving the business the opportunity to reinvest, which also, obviously, drives the top line. And I think Europe in our case, is in a very positive cycle, which we expect to continue in the coming years. Now, I talked about Latin America, so I will not mention much. We continue to see a lot of growth in many parts of AMESA region, in particular, India is a big growth space for us, and is an investment area for sure. The opportunity is massive. If you think, it will take a decade perspective, and we're putting infrastructure on the ground and we're putting a lot of -- we are investing in the brands, make sure that we build the scale to capture what is going to be, I think a high demand market for many, many years. Then when it comes to Asia, we're seeing a very cautious consumer in China. The consumer is clearly saving more than spending, and that has an implication for many categories. Our categories is a low ticket item, so we continue to see good performance of our categories, and we're gaining share. It's quite an advantage business what we have in China, especially on the food sides. And we continue to invest in different regions of the country. We continue to get more penetration, additional distribution, that has been a big driver. So additional penetration, additional consumers coming to our brands, coming to the habit of snacking, and that has been very positive. So in spite of a cautious consumer, we have levers to continue to grow the business. Some of that physical availability, some of that is share of market and better penetration of our brands. I think we have advantage products there. We have a very strong R&D center in China that develops is for east products, and that is giving us an advantage versus other companies. So that's how we're seeing the different parts of the world. And again, we'll continue to invest. For us, this is a business that, if you think about our international business, it's almost $40 billion already, right? So it's been growing very fast over time. It's almost $40 billion, it's accretive to PepsiCo. It's higher margin than the average of PepsiCo, and it's clearly the largest growth opportunity for our company if you think about the next decade, and that's where we are putting so much focus, so much investment. We believe that we -- both on the beverage side and on the food side we have a many years of growth in that particular part of the business. Yes. I wouldn't extrapolate too much. This is a decision by Carlsberg to make an investment in the UK business. It makes a lot of sense for Carlsberg for multiple reasons. And we partner with Carlsberg in other geographies. We are very happy with the partnership. We trust them as a partner to grow our business. And, of course, we supported the transaction. So I wouldn't over extrapolate it. Let's make it a UK decision by Carlsberg, and we decided to endorse the transaction because we have a great relationship with Carlsberg, and we trust them. Yes, Carlos. Listen, we're very pleased with the relationship we have with most of the bottlers and the strategic alignment. Actually, our international beverage business has been one of the growth engines of the company for the last few years. So we keep innovating and building great products that have consumer appeal, and specifically we've been very successful with our non-sugar business internationally. Our non-sugar Pepsi has been a great driver of growth for many years. Gatorade is also another great platform that we are moving around. So the last is growing 10% historically, and we will continue to invest. Now are there other opportunities to scale up some of our bottlers. Of course, there's always opportunities to improve the infrastructure, and we're working on that for the long-term, but I think this is a part of our business that is going well. It's a part of our business that we are prepared to invest even more. The bottlers know we obviously are very aligned statistically on which markets and which platforms we're going to put our focus and our investments. And I think, as I said, is part of our international story that I was referring to earlier. There's a food story and there's a beverage story, and there's a combination of the two story in some markets that we're playing long-term. So hopefully I'm answering your question. I don't know if you had some other kind of implications there. Yes, listen. Nik, I don't know about all the categories. I know that for many categories the multiple year inflation that we had to take because our input cost went up, has created some perception and some reality in a lot of households that food is expensive and consumers are making choices. And they can make choices to cook versus buy finished goods or finished products, or they can make a lot of decisions around how they spend their money and how do they feed themselves every day with the lowest budget. And I think that's the fundamental question to address for the food companies. Now that our cost are kind of normalizing, our input cost, and we've all been going at productivity in our case, this has been a very, very strategic focus for us. Now, how do we deploy those resources against what are the best levers to reignite growth? And again, it will not be a blanket approach, it will be a segmented approach. In our case, it will be very rational, it will based on data. I think we have a lot of data, and we have great segmentation. And I think we can execute with again, with precision so that we don't destroy value where we create value for the category as we increase the net revenue of the category. So that's how we're thinking about it. I don't think GLP at this point, Nik, as material impact in our category for sure, and we have a lot of panels and we have a lot of conversation with consumers, it's not impacting us. At this point is an economic value relationship for our categories, and we will address them in the second half of the year. Yes, thanks Kevin. Listen, I think the -- this need for value or more value consciousness I think is impacting every household in the U.S. So it is different levels of income, I think it's impacting everybody. And we're seeing behaviors in different income levels. I would aggregate all that -- the consumer is much more price conscious, is looking for more value across. So maybe you see the higher income consumers that they're not going to expensive restaurants, they're adjusting their behavior to more affordable restaurants, or they stay at home and then they create their own entertainment moments or fun moments at home. So do you see different behaviors happening everywhere, I think the connecting line it would be, the consumer is more cautious, the consumer is more choiceful, but the consumer is willing to spend in areas where they see value and we see it in our category, right, the more -- the parts of the category there I was referring to. But also for other parts of the category, they're asking for more value and they're willing to compromise in some of their decisions. So that's the problem to address. So I would stay there and I think once we address that situation, we will be back in growth, and we feel pretty good about the tools and the resources we have and the actions that we're taking and we're quite encouraged by recent performance of the business. Okay. So I think we -- this is the last question. So thank you, everyone, for joining us today and your thoughtful questions. And also, obviously, for the confidence that you've placed in us with your investments, and we hope everybody has a great summer, and do buy a lot of PepsiCo products, so thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning and welcome to PepsiCo's 2024 First Quarter Earnings question-and-answer session. Your lines are being placed on listen-only until it's your turn to ask the question. Today's call is being recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Ravi Pamnani, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Pamnani, you may begin.\nRavi Pamnani: Thank you, operator and good morning everyone. I hope everyone has had a chance this morning to review our press release and prepared remarks, both of which are available on our website. Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. We may make forward-looking statements on today's call, including about our business plans and 2024 guidance. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties and only reflect our view as of today, April 23rd, 2024, and we are under no obligation to update them. When discussing our results, we refer to non-GAAP measures, which exclude certain items from reported results. Please refer to our first quarter 2024 earnings release and first quarter 2024 Form 10-Q available on pepsico.com for definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures and additional information regarding our results, including a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from forward-looking statements. Joining me today are PepsiCo's Chairman and CEO, Ramon Laguarta; and PepsiCo's Executive Vice President and CFO, Jamie Caulfield. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question. And with that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey guys, good morning.\nRavi Pamnani: Goof morning Dara.\nDara Mohsenian: So, really strong international profit results for the third quarter in a row here. Can you just take a step back, Ramon, and maybe give us some perspective on that international performance over the last few quarters? And, A, just looking forward, short-term, how confident are you in the sustainability of that in the balance of the year? But, B, also just long-term as you think about international development over the last few quarters give us some perspective looking out over the next few years, both from a top line perspective and then the margin flow through? Thanks.\nRamon Laguarta: Great. Thank you, Dara. And yes we're very pleased with the performance of international businesses in Q1, but also in the last few quarters, as you mentioned. And this has been an area of investment for us now for a few years, both in snacks and in beverages and trying to build scaled businesses in most of the markets where the scale in terms of population and profitable growth. So, I feel very good about our ability to continue to outperform our categories in international and to keep our categories growing both food and beverages in the future. Our innovation is strong. Our ability to understand local rituals and local food and beverage occasions is better than ever. We are adapting our portfolio to that. Our ability to attract the best talent in the markets where we participate and build really capable teams is better than ever. We've been investing in capacity. We're -- right now, we're in the process of opening factories in Vietnam and in China and in India and in Mexico, and we just opened one in Poland. So we keep expanding our manufacturing and our go-to-market capabilities in those markets. So we feel good, and I think that it's going to continue to be a big source of growth for us. As we mentioned in CAGNY, I think our international business is already $36 billion and it's growing at a very high single-digit level and with very good profitability. So it is part of the future growth story for PepsiCo for sure.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nBonnieHerzog: Hi. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I had a question on Frito-Lay op margins, which were a little soft in the quarter. So hoping you could talk through some of the key puts and takes on your margins in the quarter and then moving forward? And then is it realistic to assume Frito-Lay's op margins will expand in 2024? And I'm thinking about that in the context of commodity cost pressures easing a bit, or how do we think about your level of reinvestment as these cost savings maybe in an effort to drive faster top line growth? And then ultimately, curious to hear if Frito-Lay margins can ultimately return to the low 30% range? And if so, by when, how do we think about that? Thank you.\nJamieCaulfield: Hey, Bonnie, it's Jamie here. How are you? Yeah on Frito, when you look at the Q1 profit, the thing to keep in mind is last year, we're lapping 24% growth in the first quarter of last year. I think we had 180 basis points of margin improvement last year. And we don't want to push the P&L that hard. The growth last year, growth this year, part of that has to do with investment timing, the flow of productivity. But I think you'll see margin improvement over time at Frito, but this is a business that has very healthy margins already, and we want to make sure that we're investing back in the business to sustain growth.\nRamon Laguarta: Yeah, Bonnie. I think on top of what Jamie said, for the long term, the key goal for Frito in the US is to continue to grow the salty, savory category at a very high rate and continue to get occasions from other parts of macro snacks into the savory and from meals into savory, and continue to gain share of that category as it has been doing and including Q1. So that's the ultimate goal. Because that, if you think about the high margin that we have in that business and the impact it would have in the overall PepsiCo margins, that's the role that Frito-Lay has in the portfolio.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with BofA. Your line is open.\nBryan Spillane: Thanks, operator. Good morning, everybody. Ramon, I guess, a question on PBNA and specifically on Gatorade and Mountain Dew. The volumes are still -- with Gatorade noticeably weak in the quarter. And so can you just talk about, one, how much in the quarter might have been affected by the weather? And then second, I guess, as we're thinking about volume recovery for the whole for the enterprise at PBNA, just what's on tap for both Mountain Dew and Gatorade to stabilize the volume trend?\nRamon Laguarta: That's good, Bryan. Just actually we feel good about those two brands. Those two brands actually gained share in Q1, so Mountain Dew and Gatorade, in their own category. So that's a meaningful good performance, I would say. Now Gatorade, as you mentioned, a little bit of weather impact. So we're not concerned about Gatorade this year as the weather improves, I think we have the right investments, the right commercial programs. Our G2DSD was impactful to us last year operationally. I think we've learned a lot on how to deal with a very high seasonality product and category and give the better service to our customers and maintain the product in stock and available. So we feel good about we have the platform to take Gatorade to higher market share in a faster growing category. Now with regards to Dew, the launch of bubly burst has been very, very good to the brand. We launched it as a permanent additional flavor to the portfolio early in the year. It's been obviously successful. We knew it was a successful LTR and therefore, it's a successful permanent product. And it's been bringing incremental consumers to the brand and help us gain share now. Obviously, we will keep investing in the portfolio and the brand, and we have strong programs for the summer. Hopefully, that will deliver as we expect, and we'll continue to build Mountain Dew in the category. So feeling good about those two brands.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is open.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks, good morning. In the prepared remarks, I noticed in the discussion of PBNA and plans to improve profitability there. There were two new bullets. The first two talking about deemphasizing certain product and package combinations and the second around revenue management and increasingly precise consumer value proposition. So I was curious if you could just -- I know there's new management for that business as well. So I would love to get a little bit more color maybe around those two points? I thought would be helpful. Thanks.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. Lauren, I think the -- I don't know, maybe we have put a bit more detail, but the intentionality was always there. And I mentioned last time on the last couple of calls that we're making choices in PBNA in terms of making sure that we deliver profitable growth, and we'll continue to make those choices emphasizing the parts of the portfolio where there is a better return on the investments for us and eliminating those parts of the portfolio where the margins are not that attractive and they're going to get probably not that better over time. So we've been referring to categories like packed water or some of the less profitable take-home formats, where we will be making choices. We feel good about both the productivity at PBNA under margin expansion of PBNA. And we feel that, that will continue based on the ideas that we have and the organizational focus that the team has been putting under the new management, but also the old management in PBNA. There's much more focus on becoming a better operating machine in the supply chain and sales and expanding the margin. So, we feel good about PBNA margin expansion and profitable growth delivery this year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nAndrea Teixeira: Hi, good morning. Thank you. So, Ramon, if you can please comment on the overall consumption and in particular for snacks and how consumer behavior evolved in the context of your comments about normalization? And then a clarification for Jamie, on the margin outlook. On the prepared remarks, you mentioned a more benign commodities environment, but that has recently changed in particular, for oil and looking at DSD. Hoping to get some clarification on the diesel impact or this is going to be more further down and perhaps not even impacting 2024? Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. So, listen, Andrea hi. The -- I would say the consumer globally, we think is very resilient. And we see it in, as you saw from our international business performance. And it's basically supported by two facts, very low unemployment or quite low unemployment globally and wages growing at a good pace in majority of the countries where we participate. So, those two things make us feel quite good about the consumer. Now, when you double click, there is probably two areas that were -- that probably surface. One is Chinese consumers. I think Chinese consumers are being very cautious and we're seeing the savings rate really going very high in China. Our category is still resilient in China, but especially we're delivering growth through share of market gains in China. So, that's a good performance by the team, but an area of watch out for us. The other double-click is in the, I would say, the lower income consumer in the U.S. The lower income consumer in the U.S. is stretched, is making a lot of -- he is strategizing a lot to make their budgets get to the end of the month. And that's a consumer that is choosing what to buy, where to buy and making a lot of choices. That's a consumer that we're emphasizing in our commercial programs. I think we're learning how best to keep that consumer in our categories and the frequency that we want that consumer, and we are pivoting our commercial plans, our innovation, giving that consumer the right innovation, the right value in different parts of the month through different channels, digital and physical. Making sure that the ROI on the investments are the best ROIs. So, those two are the consumers that I would say we're paying more attention in terms of specific commercial programs. But I would say the consumer is very resilient everywhere else. And our teams, I think, are pivoting to maintain our brands top of mind in their baskets at the frequency that we want and continue to gain market share. So, this applies to beverages and to snacks. Your question was more on snacks, but I think it applies to both categories. So, I know Jamie on.\nJamie Caulfield: Yes. Andrea, on commodities, really no change in the outlook. A couple of points I just want to emphasize. One is the diversity of the inputs in the basket, so no single commodity accounts for more than 10% of the total. So that diversification kind of smooth things out. And the other point I'd make is we do tend to forward buy and hedge, so that we've got good visibility for the year that helps us with planning the business overall. And so outlook Q2 through Q4, so relatively benign inflation and not a lot of volatility in the rate of inflation quarter-to-quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS. Your line is open.\nPeter Grom: Thanks operator and good morning, everyone. So I was hoping to get an update on the CELSIUS agreement and kind of just your broader energy drink strategy at this point. In the release, you spoke positively about the partnership, but I think there were some changes to the incentive structure a few weeks back. So maybe first, just any thoughts on how the brand is performing as part of your energy portfolio? And then just like anything you can share in terms of what changed with the agreement? But maybe specifically, how does it really help Pepsi? And maybe what benefit does it provide for CELSIUS, if anything? Thanks.\nRamon Laguarta: Yeah. Thank you, Peter. I will not talk too much about the agreement other than saying that it's a good alignment of the long-term interest of both companies, and it's great for PepsiCo shareholders. The partnership with CELSIUS is strong, and it's helping us to gain scale in our go-to-market, specifically in some channels where we need volume to justify some of the economics of the call. So that role continues. We're pleased with the partnership. Energy is a fast-growing category, profitable, that is great for our portfolio. So that's what I would say. We remain pleased with the partnership and we'll continue to build the partnership going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Filippo Falorni with Citi. Your line is open.\nFilippo Falorni: Hey, good morning, everyone. So I wanted to go back to Frito but on the top line trends. Clearly, you guys were setting the toughest comp of the year in Frito-Lay. You mentioned you expect some sequential improvement. So maybe you could talk about volume trajectory, particularly for the business? And Ramon, you spoke in the past about the cycling of this shift towards smaller pack sizes. So maybe you can give us an update on that, and also any potential impact from cycling the reduction in SNAP benefits from last year? Thank you.\nRavi Pamnani: Yeah. I would say the Frito-Lay continues to outperform the category. And as I said earlier, the big opportunity for Frito-Lay is continue to create occasions for our savory category, bringing them from broader macro snacks or snacks and meals overlap, how do we bring more category stores, more occasion store snacking. So those are the two big strategic objectives of Frito-Lay. And all our innovation and pricing and channel mix and everything else is against that large objective and do it faster than others, so that we continue to gain shares. So as we -- as we look at the business performance, as you said, this is the toughest lap. I think last year, we grew 16% in Q1, and that lap is still high in Q2, but then it gets much better than half two. So we should expect a gradual sequential improvement of our volume for Frito-Lay, especially in the second half of the year, and we'll continue to be the guardians of the savory category and make sure it's valued properly, and it generates growth for our customers ahead of what food generates for our customers, and we continue to capture a disproportionate share of that very fast-growing and profitable business.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just you mentioned multiple times on gaining share within the category. Could you just give us some -- in multiple regions, can you just give us some context on what the categories are growing or at least what -- maybe what they're expected to grow as you think about the next \u2013 next year or so?\nRamon Laguarta: We -- yes, I mean, like what I said is that our goal is always for our categories to grow faster than overall food and beverages. I think that makes us a very attractive partner with our retail partners, and we deliver growth for them. And our categories are profitable. So it's a good combination of growth and profitability for our customers. So that's what we're trying to do. I think our categories will continue to grow faster than food and beverages in the majority of the countries around the world, given the trends on urbanization and the secular trends that we've been talking about both for convenient foods and beverages. So we feel good about that and our commercial programs, innovation and investments are in to deliver that for our partners. Obviously, there's countries around the world where we do better, others we do less well. And our goal is to keep emphasizing the ones we do better and improve the ones that we don't do so well. And that's how we're managing the company.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nRobert Moskow: Hi. Thanks for the question. The 4% price mix benefit in Frito-Lay North America is pretty impressive in a food industry where there's just not a lot of pricing left. And I imagine a lot of it is from price pack architecture or maybe even consumers shifting to different pack sizes. Can you help delineate a little bit more like what's -- which of those is driving it more than the other? Or if it's about the same? And how do you expect it to evolve for the rest of the year? Do you expect it to be pretty constant?\nJamie Caulfield: Hey, Robert. It\u2019s Jamie. And its majority is price but there\u2019s an element of mix in there. I\u2019d put it that probably two-thirds price and one-third mix. And yes, it comment earlier on our inflationary trends would expect them to be fairly moderate for the balance of the year, fairly smooth through the balance of the year. So I wouldn't expect a lot of volatility in that buying revenue relationship.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nRobertOttenstein: Great. Thank you very much. Two kind of follow-ups, if I may. Can you please talk about the spring shelf sets? Is it pretty much done? And how do you feel good about what you're seeing both on the Frito-Lay side and on the beverage side? And I understand on the beverage side, you're discontinuing some SKUs. So are you gaining shelf space where you want to? And then just a follow-up to an earlier question on CELSIUS. Maybe if you can give us an idea of how your energy drink strategy overall is evolving and what's going on with Rockstar, Starbucks, Mountain Dew in terms of the overall energy drink strategy? Thank you.\nRamon Laguarta: Yeah. Listen, I'll step back a little bit. I would say our customer negotiations have been good and completed all over the world and especially Europe took a bit longer, but it's a very positive impact to our overall, I would say, European business and other parts of the world are less impacted by this type of negotiations -- are good. We feel good, including the US. To your specific question on space gains, I think it's going to be a good reset time for us across snacks and beverages. It's not completed yet. It's way normally I would say, probably another six weeks or so. We're feeling good about where we've seen already reset the performance improvement in the business. So that's good, well done by the commercial teams. So yeah, we feel good overall, and that's why we are reaffirming our guidance to grow at least over 4% in our net revenue for this year.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities.\nChris Carey: Hi, everyone. So one question on APAC division. Ramon, I think you were a bit more cautious or balanced on the Chinese consumer and yet double-digit growth in the quarter in China. I just wonder how APAC came in relative to your own expectations that whether there's any timing dynamic here or whether you see these results as perhaps a bit more durable going forward? And if I could just sneak in from the at-home versus away-from-home consumption globally, as you see some of the weaker trends from the lower income consumer, are you seeing any acceleration in that shift, which might be helping your business on a global basis as well? Thanks.\nRamon Laguarta: Two things, thanks. Good questions. I think the APAC performance is a little bit impacted by the timing of Chinese New Year. So there is a bit of benefit in our Q1 numbers versus Q2. It was a bit earlier this year. But the reality is that the APAC region is improving, I would say, outside of China. China still, as I mentioned earlier, I think the consumer is cautious and the consumer is saving a lot. And it might not impact so much the low price, let's say, products as ours. It might probably impact some other categories a bit harder than ours. The truth is that in China, as I said earlier, our team is not only this year, but already consistently for the last four, five years, been gaining share and creating a very capable and profitable business in China, we're very proud of. Now, to your other question on away-from-home, in-home, we're seeing mobility obviously, going back to pre-pandemic times anything we all forgot COVID anymore. And we're seeing, obviously, that impact in the consumption of food between home and away-from-home, especially in the U.S., I would say, it's probably the country that is having more impact. So, yes, away-from-home is growing faster than in-home for us and we're pivoting resources to away-from-home both in our food business and our beverage business, and we're trying to capture as much as possible that consumption that is moving to away-from-home. Internationally as well, I would say that is a huge wide space for growth for our business, both in trying to improve the availability of our current products and also creating new solutions that are more targeting meals and meal replacement as consumers buy more food away-from-home. And I think our brands belong in some of those occasions and as I mentioned at CAGNY, we're building both innovation and business models that can help us capture this meal location away-from-home with some of our large brands like Lays, Doritos, Tostidos, some of our well-known global brands.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nSteve Powers: Hey thanks and good morning. Ramon, maybe it ties to the pressures you mentioned earlier on the lower-income consumers in the U.S. or maybe even your comments just now on at home versus away-from-home. But if I think back over the last six-plus months, we've seen arguably unexpected slowing across many categories, but really in many immediate consumption categories where I think it was most unexpected across savory snacks, sweet snacks, arguably a number of beverage categories as well. Do you agree with that kind of unexpected slowing comments? And if so, how do you see the drivers? How do you stack up the drivers? Where do you think we are in that cycle? And how does that factor into your expectations on momentum recovery across your North American beverages -- sorry, North American businesses? I think the easing comps are obvious. I'm just -- I'm curious about sort of the -- your expectations on demand itself sequentially improving?\nRamon Laguarta: That's great. Now, this is a great question and I think we need to step back and look at the bigger numbers. Obviously, there was huge inflation in our categories driven by input inflation over the last couple of years and operating cost inflation. Now, what makes us feel optimistic is a couple of data. Number one, I think wages are growing above inflation, and we see that not only in the U.S., but across the world. And we see our consumer packaged food inflation below, I would say, total CPI. So, those two numbers make us feel comfortable that the consumers will start coming back to our categories at the frequency and with the same level of -- or higher frequency than in the past. So those are two big numbers. Obviously, each one of us with our commercial programs, our innovation, our channel strategy is trying to accelerate that pivot back. But we feel good about the price volume mix that we see in our business, and that's how we think that we will continue to sequentially improve over the balance of the year into further years. Our North Star remains the same, is to make sure that, as I said earlier, we have innovation and consumer programs and channel programs that continue to drive savory snacks, ahead of micro snacks, ahead of food and the same with LRB, ahead of overall liquid consumption and ahead of food and beverages. So that drives value for our business and that drives value for our customers and that's how we think about driving the company long-term.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge Research. Your line is open.\nBrett Cooper: Good morning. A question on the international business. On these calls over the years, PepsiCo has spoken about managing international profit delivery to provide affordability to consumers and support recruitment. And if we look at margins in the international business, they're up versus COVID or versus pre-COVID levels. So can you help us understand beyond the headline financial results that we can see, I guess, evidence of what you look at to ensure you're providing proper levels of affordability for category development to support the very long-term for that business? Thanks.\nRamon Laguarta: Yes. And the -- we're always very conscious of the relative value of our product versus other potential substitute products in the categories that we participate. So if you think about snacks, the big opportunities to transform and packaged snacks into packet snacks or other macro snacks into savory snacks. And we always look at that value ratio in every market, in every geography for different types of consumers. Now the same with beverages, right, moving from non-commercial beverages to commercial beverages, that is always the opportunity for us as an industry. We look at that very carefully. Now why are our margins expanding internationally because as we gain scale and obviously, that our fixed cost leverage is much better, and that's how we're getting to more profitable businesses in international markets, especially the large markets, whilst we keep affordability at the center of our strategy because that's long-term, including other things that we do, obviously, with availability and with innovation. We make our categories continue to grow at a very fast pace. But as you mentioned, affordability and relative value of our category is a key KPI that we measure all the time in every market because it's the key source of continuous growth for our categories.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Gerald Pascarelli with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.\nGerald Pascarelli: Great. Thanks very much. Question on Europe. Another really strong quarter here, like the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. It looks like it accelerated on an underlying two-year basis. So maybe if you could provide some color on the driver markets, ones that maybe came in better than your expectations? And then how you would compare how developed markets in Europe are performing relative to what we're seeing in the US? Thanks.\nRamonLaguarta: Yeah. Thank you and a good observation. I think our team in Europe is doing a fantastic work. It started with strong productivity, simplifying the business and driving cost control, eliminating duplication and then reinvesting that money back into our brands and becoming more competitive and also driving our availability and driving our brand preference. And that is a flywheel that is working for us across both developing and developed markets in Europe. Obviously, developing markets a bit more. So if you think about Eastern Europe markets are growing a little bit faster than Western Europe markets. Western Europe markets have been impacted a little bit in this first quarter by some of the negotiations, and that's not atypical in Europe. But I think we have a good flywheel in Europe, and Europe will be expanding its portfolio along the lines of what the US has been doing, which will give us additional consumers and additional penetration in households across developed and developing markets. So we feel good about the flywheel in Europe. But at the center of that is a very strong productivity, cost discipline and reinvestment strategy that is, in a way, what we're trying to do across the full company, elevating our productivity and driving their investments both into affordability, availability, a better brand equity and then investing back into our future, digitalization and sustainability at the center of that investment. So it's a flywheel that we're trying to do for all the world. Clearly, Europe is doing a good job at implementing it.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back to Ramon Laguarta for any closing remarks.\nRamon Laguarta : Yeah. Thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning and for the confidence that you've placed in us and in our stock. And we hope that you all stay healthy and safe. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.\nRavi Pamnani: Thank you, gentlemen. Appreciate your help.\nOperator: You're welcome.",

            "content": "Hey, Bonnie, it's Jamie here. How are you? Yeah on Frito, when you look at the Q1 profit, the thing to keep in mind is last year, we're lapping 24% growth in the first quarter of last year. I think we had 180 basis points of margin improvement last year. And we don't want to push the P&L that hard. The growth last year, growth this year, part of that has to do with investment timing, the flow of productivity. But I think you'll see margin improvement over time at Frito, but this is a business that has very healthy margins already, and we want to make sure that we're investing back in the business to sustain growth. Yes. Andrea, on commodities, really no change in the outlook. A couple of points I just want to emphasize. One is the diversity of the inputs in the basket, so no single commodity accounts for more than 10% of the total. So that diversification kind of smooth things out. And the other point I'd make is we do tend to forward buy and hedge, so that we've got good visibility for the year that helps us with planning the business overall. And so outlook Q2 through Q4, so relatively benign inflation and not a lot of volatility in the rate of inflation quarter-to-quarter. Hey, Robert. It's Jamie. And its majority is price but there's an element of mix in there. I'd put it that probably two-thirds price and one-third mix. And yes, it comment earlier on our inflationary trends would expect them to be fairly moderate for the balance of the year, fairly smooth through the balance of the year. So I wouldn't expect a lot of volatility in that buying revenue relationship."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Ramon Laguarta",
            "content": "Great. Thank you, Dara. And yes we're very pleased with the performance of international businesses in Q1, but also in the last few quarters, as you mentioned. And this has been an area of investment for us now for a few years, both in snacks and in beverages and trying to build scaled businesses in most of the markets where the scale in terms of population and profitable growth. So, I feel very good about our ability to continue to outperform our categories in international and to keep our categories growing both food and beverages in the future. Our innovation is strong. Our ability to understand local rituals and local food and beverage occasions is better than ever. We are adapting our portfolio to that. Our ability to attract the best talent in the markets where we participate and build really capable teams is better than ever. We've been investing in capacity. We're -- right now, we're in the process of opening factories in Vietnam and in China and in India and in Mexico, and we just opened one in Poland. So we keep expanding our manufacturing and our go-to-market capabilities in those markets. So we feel good, and I think that it's going to continue to be a big source of growth for us. As we mentioned in CAGNY, I think our international business is already $36 billion and it's growing at a very high single-digit level and with very good profitability. So it is part of the future growth story for PepsiCo for sure. Yeah, Bonnie. I think on top of what Jamie said, for the long term, the key goal for Frito in the US is to continue to grow the salty, savory category at a very high rate and continue to get occasions from other parts of macro snacks into the savory and from meals into savory, and continue to gain share of that category as it has been doing and including Q1. So that's the ultimate goal. Because that, if you think about the high margin that we have in that business and the impact it would have in the overall PepsiCo margins, that's the role that Frito-Lay has in the portfolio. That's good, Bryan. Just actually we feel good about those two brands. Those two brands actually gained share in Q1, so Mountain Dew and Gatorade, in their own category. So that's a meaningful good performance, I would say. Now Gatorade, as you mentioned, a little bit of weather impact. So we're not concerned about Gatorade this year as the weather improves, I think we have the right investments, the right commercial programs. Our G2DSD was impactful to us last year operationally. I think we've learned a lot on how to deal with a very high seasonality product and category and give the better service to our customers and maintain the product in stock and available. So we feel good about we have the platform to take Gatorade to higher market share in a faster growing category. Now with regards to Dew, the launch of bubly burst has been very, very good to the brand. We launched it as a permanent additional flavor to the portfolio early in the year. It's been obviously successful. We knew it was a successful LTR and therefore, it's a successful permanent product. And it's been bringing incremental consumers to the brand and help us gain share now. Obviously, we will keep investing in the portfolio and the brand, and we have strong programs for the summer. Hopefully, that will deliver as we expect, and we'll continue to build Mountain Dew in the category. So feeling good about those two brands. Yes. Lauren, I think the -- I don't know, maybe we have put a bit more detail, but the intentionality was always there. And I mentioned last time on the last couple of calls that we're making choices in PBNA in terms of making sure that we deliver profitable growth, and we'll continue to make those choices emphasizing the parts of the portfolio where there is a better return on the investments for us and eliminating those parts of the portfolio where the margins are not that attractive and they're going to get probably not that better over time. So we've been referring to categories like packed water or some of the less profitable take-home formats, where we will be making choices. We feel good about both the productivity at PBNA under margin expansion of PBNA. And we feel that, that will continue based on the ideas that we have and the organizational focus that the team has been putting under the new management, but also the old management in PBNA. There's much more focus on becoming a better operating machine in the supply chain and sales and expanding the margin. So, we feel good about PBNA margin expansion and profitable growth delivery this year. Yes. So, listen, Andrea hi. The -- I would say the consumer globally, we think is very resilient. And we see it in, as you saw from our international business performance. And it's basically supported by two facts, very low unemployment or quite low unemployment globally and wages growing at a good pace in majority of the countries where we participate. So, those two things make us feel quite good about the consumer. Now, when you double click, there is probably two areas that were -- that probably surface. One is Chinese consumers. I think Chinese consumers are being very cautious and we're seeing the savings rate really going very high in China. Our category is still resilient in China, but especially we're delivering growth through share of market gains in China. So, that's a good performance by the team, but an area of watch out for us. The other double-click is in the, I would say, the lower income consumer in the U.S. The lower income consumer in the U.S. is stretched, is making a lot of -- he is strategizing a lot to make their budgets get to the end of the month. And that's a consumer that is choosing what to buy, where to buy and making a lot of choices. That's a consumer that we're emphasizing in our commercial programs. I think we're learning how best to keep that consumer in our categories and the frequency that we want that consumer, and we are pivoting our commercial plans, our innovation, giving that consumer the right innovation, the right value in different parts of the month through different channels, digital and physical. Making sure that the ROI on the investments are the best ROIs. So, those two are the consumers that I would say we're paying more attention in terms of specific commercial programs. But I would say the consumer is very resilient everywhere else. And our teams, I think, are pivoting to maintain our brands top of mind in their baskets at the frequency that we want and continue to gain market share. So, this applies to beverages and to snacks. Your question was more on snacks, but I think it applies to both categories. So, I know Jamie on. Yeah. Thank you, Peter. I will not talk too much about the agreement other than saying that it's a good alignment of the long-term interest of both companies, and it's great for PepsiCo shareholders. The partnership with CELSIUS is strong, and it's helping us to gain scale in our go-to-market, specifically in some channels where we need volume to justify some of the economics of the call. So that role continues. We're pleased with the partnership. Energy is a fast-growing category, profitable, that is great for our portfolio. So that's what I would say. We remain pleased with the partnership and we'll continue to build the partnership going forward. We -- yes, I mean, like what I said is that our goal is always for our categories to grow faster than overall food and beverages. I think that makes us a very attractive partner with our retail partners, and we deliver growth for them. And our categories are profitable. So it's a good combination of growth and profitability for our customers. So that's what we're trying to do. I think our categories will continue to grow faster than food and beverages in the majority of the countries around the world, given the trends on urbanization and the secular trends that we've been talking about both for convenient foods and beverages. So we feel good about that and our commercial programs, innovation and investments are in to deliver that for our partners. Obviously, there's countries around the world where we do better, others we do less well. And our goal is to keep emphasizing the ones we do better and improve the ones that we don't do so well. And that's how we're managing the company. Yeah. Listen, I'll step back a little bit. I would say our customer negotiations have been good and completed all over the world and especially Europe took a bit longer, but it's a very positive impact to our overall, I would say, European business and other parts of the world are less impacted by this type of negotiations -- are good. We feel good, including the US. To your specific question on space gains, I think it's going to be a good reset time for us across snacks and beverages. It's not completed yet. It's way normally I would say, probably another six weeks or so. We're feeling good about where we've seen already reset the performance improvement in the business. So that's good, well done by the commercial teams. So yeah, we feel good overall, and that's why we are reaffirming our guidance to grow at least over 4% in our net revenue for this year. Two things, thanks. Good questions. I think the APAC performance is a little bit impacted by the timing of Chinese New Year. So there is a bit of benefit in our Q1 numbers versus Q2. It was a bit earlier this year. But the reality is that the APAC region is improving, I would say, outside of China. China still, as I mentioned earlier, I think the consumer is cautious and the consumer is saving a lot. And it might not impact so much the low price, let's say, products as ours. It might probably impact some other categories a bit harder than ours. The truth is that in China, as I said earlier, our team is not only this year, but already consistently for the last four, five years, been gaining share and creating a very capable and profitable business in China, we're very proud of. Now, to your other question on away-from-home, in-home, we're seeing mobility obviously, going back to pre-pandemic times anything we all forgot COVID anymore. And we're seeing, obviously, that impact in the consumption of food between home and away-from-home, especially in the U.S., I would say, it's probably the country that is having more impact. So, yes, away-from-home is growing faster than in-home for us and we're pivoting resources to away-from-home both in our food business and our beverage business, and we're trying to capture as much as possible that consumption that is moving to away-from-home. Internationally as well, I would say that is a huge wide space for growth for our business, both in trying to improve the availability of our current products and also creating new solutions that are more targeting meals and meal replacement as consumers buy more food away-from-home.
