A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today\u2019s presentation are available on Union Pacific\u2019s website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Mr. Fritz, you may now begin.\nLance Fritz: Thank you very much, Rob, and good morning, everybody. And welcome to Union Pacific\u2019s fourth quarter earnings conference call. I apologize for the delay. Our service provider was experiencing technical difficulties this morning. We will handle any necessary and appropriate public disclosures after the call. With me today in Omaha are Eric Gehringer, Executive Vice President of Operations; Kenny Rocker, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; and Jennifer Hamann, our Chief Financial Officer. Before discussing our fourth quarter and full year results, I must first acknowledge the performance of our exceptional employees. 2020 presented challenges that no one anticipated and all of us hope to never experience again. The women and men of Union Pacific worked hard in the face of the pandemic to provide our customers with fluid and uninterrupted service. Their dedication produced service and efficiency improvements that are now part of the UP DNA, positioning our company to flourish in the days ahead. This past year has reinforced my conviction that our people are truly the best in the business. Moving on to our fourth quarter results. This morning, Union Pacific is reporting 2020 fourth quarter net income of $1.4 billion or $2.05 per share. These results include the impact of the previously announced $278 million pretax non-cash impairment charge related to our Brazos yard investment. Excluding that charge, adjusted net income is $1.6 billion or $2.36 per share. This compares to $1.4 billion or $2.02 per share in the fourth quarter of 2019. Our adjusted quarterly operating ratio came in at 55.6%, an all time quarterly record and 410 basis points better than the fourth quarter of 2019. These outstanding results demonstrate our potential when we leverage all three profitability drivers simultaneously, volume growth, productivity and pricing. Our fourth quarter and full year performance bolsters the optimism we have for the long-term potential of our company. To provide a bit more detail, we\u2019re going to start with Eric and an operations update.\nEric Gehringer: Thanks, Lance, and good morning. The operating team delivered impressive results in the quarter, as we did an excellent job adding volume to our network in an extremely efficient manner, while also managing the normal challenges associated with the holidays. The fourth quarter is another proof statement of how PSR has continued to transform our operations. I\u2019m proud of our entire operating team and their achievements during a very challenging year. We could have not achieved what we did in 2020 without their support and commitment. Moving to slide four, I\u2019d like to update you on our key performance indicators where the team once again made improvements across nearly all of our measures. Freight car velocity and freight car terminal dwell both improved year-over-year, driven by focusing on asset utilization and reducing car touches. Locomotive and workforce productivity both all time quarterly records improved as we continue to use those resources more efficiently through our PSR journey. These improvements were driven by an evergreen process to evaluate and adjust our transportation plan, while using fewer locomotives. In addition, the train and engine workforce decreased 12% versus 2019, while volume increased 3%. In the face of intermodal volume growth of 12%, we maintain a high level of service as evidenced by our intermodal trip plan compliance results. To achieve higher levels, we are working with customers to improve the timely pickup of containers in order to improve box turns, increase parking capacity and create chassis supply. We view our intermodal ramps as production facilities that must improve their efficiency in order to drive a more reliable service product. Finally, our manifest service remains strong during the quarter, driving a 3 point improvement in trip planned compliance for manifest and autos. The team did an excellent job of maintaining this service product throughout the year, despite the significant fluctuations in demand. This past year presented quite the challenge to the operating team. The drastic fall off in volume in April, followed by the rapid recovery in July required agility, as we shut down portions of our operations and then reopen them, all while staying focused on keeping our employees safe and healthy. The improvement we made across all of our key metrics during 2020 provides a strong foundation for continued improvement in 2021. Slide five highlights some of our recent network changes. We continue to push train length to drive productivity, while providing a better service product to our customers. Compared to the fourth quarter 2018, when we first began implementing precision scheduled railroading, we have increased train length across our system by 30% or 2100 feet to approximately 9150 feet in the fourth quarter of 2020. This is a tremendous progress, especially when you consider that our seven-day car loadings fell 9% over the same period. One enabler of this great progress is our siding extension program. We completed 36 sidings in 2020, allowing longer trains to run in both directions and reducing train starts. This was a monumental accomplishment by our engineering department to finish these sidings and then by our network design team to leverage this increased capability. The redesign of our operations in Houston remained on track. Recent investments at our Englewood yard focused on extending the bowl tracks to add density to the yard and facilitate longer trains. This project also leverages the investments we\u2019ve made along the main line. Finally, last month, we announced a new service from Southern California to a pop up intermodal ramp in the Twin Cities of Minnesota. With minimal capital investment, we are turning an existing yard into a small intermodal terminal, allowing us to provide new service to an attractive market in a quick and efficient manner. As I look to the future, I\u2019m excited about the full pipeline of projects. We have to drive service enhancements and productivity across our entire network. Turning to capital spending, as demonstrated on slide six, Union Pacific continues to deliver value to our shareholders through the efficient use of capital. Our PSR implementation has generated significant capacity, allowing us to maintain this discipline in 2021. Pending final approval by our Board of Directors, we are targeting capital spending of $2.9 billion in 2021, basically flat with last year. About 80% of our planned capital investment is replacement spending to harden our infrastructure, replace older assets and improve the safety and resiliency of the network. We remained focused on modernizing our locomotive fleet through the upgrade of older core units, generating a longer life out of an existing asset, boosting its reliability and improving its fuel efficiency is a win for all stakeholders. The plan also includes targeted freight car acquisitions to support replacement and growth opportunities. We will continue to invest in capacity projects on our network to improve productivity and operational efficiency. We plan to complete more than 20 siding extensions focused in the Southern and Pacific Northwest parts of our network. These sidings support our train length initiatives and target future growth areas for our business. Finally, we remain focused on our enhancements to our energy management system to reduce fuel consumption, leveraging integration with our PTC platform. Looking to 2021, we remain focused on continuing to drive the organization using the PSR principles that have led us to this new level of operational excellence. Everything we do must be done with an eye towards doing our work safer. While maintaining a high standard on the prevention of our personal injuries, we recognize we have yet to reach our full potential. Our improvement in rail incidents in 2020 indicates that we have the right plan in place to make the entire network safer. We will be judicious with our resources and turn them quickly. We are determined to be as efficient as possible at our terminals to improve the reliability of our service product and we will push productivity through train length and other initiatives. We must continue to deliver a highly consistent and reliable service product for our customers. There are many opportunities for us to improve across all aspects of our operations, we must seize upon those in order to fulfill the long-term goals of our railroads. With that, I will turn it over to Kenny to provide an update on the business environment.\nKenny Rocker: Thank you, Eric, and good morning. Today I\u2019m pleased to report our fourth quarter results as our volume was up 3%. The fourth quarter ended strong with December posting the highest seven-day carloaded month in 2020. Solid gains in our premium business grew during the quarter were partially offset by declines in our industrial market. Freight revenue was down 1% for the quarter, as our increase in volume was offset by lower fuel and a negative mix -- business mix. So let\u2019s take a closer look at how the fourth quarter performed for each of our business groups. Starting with bulk, revenue for the quarter was up 1% on flat volume and a 1% increase in average revenue per car. Coal and renewable carloads were down 16% as a result of continued high customer inventory levels, lower export demand and a mild start to winner. Volume for grain and grain products was up 20%, driven by increased demand for export grain. Fertilizer and sulfur carloads were down 2% due to less export potash shipment, which was partially offset by strong industrial sulfur and domestic fertilizer shipments. And finally, food and refrigerated volume was up 7% due primarily to strong beverage shipments in the quarter. Moving on to industrial. Industrial revenue declined 7% from a 6% decrease in volume. Average revenue per car also declined 2% due to lower fuel surcharge and negative mix. Energy and specialized shipments decreased 16%, primarily driven by reduced petroleum shipments due to low oil prices and reduced demand. Forest product volume grew by 11%. Strength in lumber was driven by strong housing start, along with an increase in repair and remodel. We also saw strength in brown paper, driven by increased box demand and low inventory. Industrial chemicals and plastic shipments were flat for the quarter. Lower industrial chemicals volume was offset by growth in plastics from increased production and improved operating rates. Domestic plastic demand for food packaging and medical supplies remain strong. Metals and minerals volume was down 7%, primarily driven by market softness in rock and reduced frac sand shipments associated with the decline in oil prices and surplus local sands. Turning now to premium. Revenue for the quarter was up 5% on a 9% increase in volume, average revenue per car declined by 4%, reflecting the mix impact from increased intermodal shipments. Automotive volume was down 3% for the quarter. Finished vehicle shipments were flat, highlighting continued recovery in demand and strong inventory restocking. Shipments of auto parts were down 5%, mostly due to COVID-related disruptions, causing supply chain shortages apart. Intermodal volume increased by 12% year-over-year, driven by continued strength in domestic truckload and parcel shipments. Despite the pandemic, retail sales increase throughout the quarter and we continue to see the ecommerce footprint grow as a percentage of total sales. Now looking ahead to 2021, as we put together our plan for the year, we start with the key economic indicators that drive our business, as illustrated on slide 12. We\u2019re keeping a close eye on the economic forecast. As you know, there has been some volatility in recent months with the timing of the recovery, largely push into the second half of 2021. But the latest economic assumptions released in January, show more bullish outlook in some markets. While our goal is to outpace the market, there are still some pieces of our business that will continue to be adversely impacted by external factors. The piece we\u2019re watching most closely is the industrial economy, which is still expected to be weak year-over-year in the first quarter. Looking more closely at our three business teams, for our bulk commodities, we expect a continued negative outlook for coal in 2021. Electricity demand and natural gas prices are forecasted to improve. However, high customer inventory levels entering the year combined with an increased demand for other energy sources and a contract loss presents a challenging market. As always, weather conditions will be a key factor of demand. All in, we see lower year-over-year coal volumes, reducing total company carloading by roughly 1%. However, there is continued strength for export grain, as China remains committed to incremental ag product purchases in the 2021 calendar year, with clearly a tougher year-over-year comparison in the back half of the year. We also are optimistic with our biofuel shipments, a domestic production is expected to increase which will drive new volume at new UP destination facilities of renewable diesel feedstocks and finished products. Looking at our industrial commodities, energy comp for the first quarter will continue to be challenged and beyond the first quarter, there is uncertainty. However, our diverse portfolio, improved service product and ability to compete will drive growth. In addition, we\u2019re encouraged with the sequential improvements we\u2019re seeing for industrial production and a projection for growth in the second half. This improvement along with growth in plastic shipments should be a positive for us in 2021. And lastly, for premium, we expect strong uplift in both our automotive and intermodal businesses. Automotive sales are forecasted to increase from 14 million units in 2020 to closer to 16 million in 2021. A continuing benefit from vehicle inventory restocking efforts, plus recent win to convert finished vehicles and auto parts shipments from over-the-road truck will further bolster UP\u2019s automotive business. Retail inventories remain relatively low and truck utilization is expected to remain high in 2021. Retail inventory restocking along with continued strengthened retail sales and a tighter trucks supply should drive domestic intermodal volumes higher in the year. Our premium business will benefit from the new Twin Cities intermodal terminal, which Eric mentioned earlier. We\u2019re starting out small with current capacity of roughly 20,000 loads and future plans to build out to over five times that. We\u2019re excited to see that this new terminal has already started to receive loaded containers from Los Angeles in the first week of January. Furthermore, we continue to pursue additional expansion opportunity to penetrate the market. In summary, I\u2019m proud of our commercial team. They did a fabulous job in 2020 to stay close to customers and win new business. As we began 2021, I\u2019m excited about the opportunities we have in the pipeline to grow with customers and penetrate new markets. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jennifer to review our financial performance.\nJennifer Hamann: Thanks, Kenny, and good morning. I\u2019m going to start off this morning with our adjusted income statement on slide 15, where we provide both the reported and adjusted look to remove the impact of the Brazos impairment charge. Throughout my remarks today I will speak to the adjusted results. Operating revenue totaled $5.1 billion, down 1% versus 2019 on a 3% year-over-year volume growth. Adjusted operating expense decreased 8% to $2.9 billion as we continue demonstrating our ability to grow without adding costs in at a one for one. Taken together, we are reporting fourth quarter adjusted operating income of $2.3 billion, a 9% increase versus 2019. Other income of $66 million is up $10 million versus 2019, as a result of increased real estate gains. Interest expense was flat compared to 2019, as we mitigated the impact of increased debt levels by lowering our effective interest rate 20 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted net income of $1.6 billion increased 13% versus 2019, which when combined with share repurchases led to a 17% increase in earnings per share to $2.36. Our 55.6 % adjusted operating ratio was 410 basis points better year-over-year and is an all time quarterly record for Union Pacific. Core improvement totaled 320 basis points as lower fuel prices contributed 90 basis points. Looking more closely at fourth quarter revenue, slide 16 provides a breakdown of our freight revenue, which totaled $4.8 billion, down 1% versus 2019, 3% volume growth was offset by the impact of lower diesel fuel prices, down 33% year-over-year, which reduced revenue by 3.5 points. Although, we continue to yield pricing dollars in excess of inflation in the fourth quarter and experienced an improving pricing environment, these gains were more than offset by a negative business mix and reduced freight revenue a 0.25 point. Strong intermodal volumes and lower petroleum carloads were a mixed headwind in the fourth quarter. However, strength in grain shipments helped mitigate that impact both year-over-year and sequentially. Now let\u2019s move on to slide 17, which provides a summary of our fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses. Starting first with compensation and benefits expense, which decreased 3% year-over-year as we offset wage inflation and the $37 million one-time employee bonus with lower force counts, excluding the bonus impact, quarterly cost per employee remained elevated, increasing 9% as we tightly managed headcount. Fourth quarter workforce levels declined 14% or about 4,800 full time equivalents, driven primarily by the great work Jim, Eric and team have done to grow train length, our train and engine workforce continues to be more than volume variable down 12%, while management, engineering and mechanical workforces to kept together decreased 15%. Quarterly fuel expense decreased 35%, a result of lower diesel fuel prices and an improved fuel consumption rate offset by volume growth. Our fourth quarter fuel consumption rate decreased 4% versus 2019, with roughly half of the improvement driven by core productivity, half from middle line run through fuel adjustments, with some offset related to business mix. Purchase services and material expense declined 7% in the quarter, driven by more productive use of our locomotive fleet and a couple of favorable interline settlements. As automotive shipments remain impacted by the pandemic, subsidiary drayage expense was also lower year-over-year. Equipment and other rents fell 4% in the quarter, as a result of lower locomotive and freight car lease expense, as we continue to use those assets more efficiently. Increased intermodal volumes offset a portion of those savings however. The other expense line is where you see the impact of the $278 million non-cash impairment charge, when adjusted this expense category was up 2% year-over-year. As you\u2019ll recall, last year, in the fourth quarter, we reported a $25 million insurance recovery in this cost line. So, solid expense control including state and local taxes, which ended the quarter better than expected. Freight loss and damage expense also was lower year versus 2019, as we run a safer railroad. Turning for a moment to our 2021 expense expectations, look for the following. Depreciation expense to be relatively flat versus 2020, purchase services and materials expense to increase high-single digits with the recovery in the auto volumes and other expenses should be up low-single digits, primarily driven by higher state and local taxes in 2021, and for income taxes, we expect our annual effective tax rate to be between 23% and 24%. Looking now at productivity, we continued our strong productivity trend in the fourth quarter, generating $170 million of productivity. We finished 2020 at $708 million and a total of nearly $1.4 billion over the past two years, a fantastic achievement by the entire Union Pacific team. These productivity gains were led by the operating departments continued progress on train length initiatives and more efficient use of all of our resources. Importantly, as Eric demonstrated on the KPI slide, we achieve this higher level of productivity, while also improving the reliability of our service product. To finalize the cost variability analysis we provided throughout 2020, slide 18 illustrates how we were more than volume variable on a fuel adjusted basis, whether viewed year-over-year or sequentially. Stepping back to look at full year 2020 on slide 19, we\u2019re reporting earnings per share of $7.88, which when adjusted for the impairment charge is $8.19, declining only 2% versus 2019, despite facing volume and revenue declines of 7% and 10%, respectively, driven by the strong productivity gains, I just discussed, adjusted operating income only declined 5% to $8.1 billion. Our full year adjusted operating ratio of 58.5% represents an improvement of 210 basis points versus 2019. Collectively, these results demonstrate the organization\u2019s agility and overall transformation as we work to overcome 2020 challenges. Turning now to cash and returns, Union Pacific maintained a strong cash position throughout 2020, as we purposefully maintain greater liquidity through the pandemic, while at the same time, continuing to generate significant cash flow. Aided by the timing of some tax payments, full year 2020 cash from operations decreased only 1% versus 2019 to $8.5 billion, despite a 6% decrease in adjusted net income. Free cash flow after capital investments totaled $5.6 billion, resulting in 101% adjusted cash conversion rate. Our dividend payout ratio for 2020 adjusted for the impairment charge was 47% or slightly above our 40% to 45% target range, as we maintain their dividend through the economic downturn and distributed $2.6 billion to shareholders. And although we paused our repurchase activity during 2020 in an effort to preserve liquidity, we still repurchased a total of 22 million common shares or 4% during 2020, at an all in cost of $3.7 billion. This includes repurchases of 749 million made in the fourth quarter. In combination dividends and share repurchases totaled $6.3 billion returned to our shareholders. Turning to the strength of our balance sheet, Union Pacific remains committed to maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating, ending 2020 with a BAA1 rating from Moody\u2019s and an A- from S&P. Excluding the impairment charge, we finished the year at a comparable adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.8 times. Our all in adjusted debt balance at December 31, 2020, of $29 billion increased $1.5 billion from your in 2019, as we took actions in the fourth quarter to pay down $1.3 billion of debt, given our strong liquidity position. Finally, our adjusted return on invested capital came in at 14.3%, down from 2019, due to the impact of the pandemic on our earnings and while a declining ROIC is never desirable, staying within a historically high range reflects our long-term capital discipline, as well as the added benefit of PSR capacity creation. Turning to 2021, we are confident in our ability to execute on the opportunities ahead. Importantly, our outlook for the year includes the potential for improvement across all three performance drivers, volume, price and productivity. With volume we\u2019re looking for full year growth in the 4% to 6% range, largely driven by year-over-year increases in the second quarter. Our visibility to the year is murky however and it really depends on a number of factors, the vaccine rollout, the sustainability of consumer demand and trade, particularly as it relates to grain volumes and a second half industrial recovery. But as you heard from Kenny, we are bullish about our opportunity to win in the marketplace and drive business to our railroad. From a business mix perspective, we see mixed staying negative in 2021, with the most pronounced challenges in the first and fourth quarters. The first quarter will be pressured as we move from an environment where crude and industrial car loadings grew in 2020 to today where those volumes are lower year-over-year admits growing intermodal business. However, we could see those first quarter headwinds moderate some if grain shipments stay strong. That grain strength and tough year-over-year comparisons will likely become a headwind though in the back half of 2021, particularly in the fourth quarter. With an improved demand environment, as well as a reliable service product, we will remain disciplined in our pricing approach and expect to yield pricing dollars in excessive inflation dollars in 2021, embedded in that guidance is our expectation that all in inflation for the year is expected to be around 2.25%. On the productivity front, you heard Eric outline our plans for continued progress, which should generate roughly $500 million of added productivity this year. The combination of growing volumes, pricing above inflation and ongoing productivity should produce a full year operating ratio that is one of the best if not the best in the rail industry in 2021. And assuming the year plays out, as I have just described, we\u2019d expect to be in the range of 150 basis points to 200 basis points of operating ratio improvement 2021, so another solid year of gains. In terms of first quarter guidance, we\u2019re expecting volumes to grow in the low single-digit range, with a potentially tougher operating ratio comparison, dependent on the mix headwinds, I just mentioned. Turn into cash and capital, you heard our plan to invest around $2.9 billion of capital for the year, well within our long-term guidance of less than 15% of revenue, as we generate capacity through our PSR journey. The combination of topline growth, increasing profitability and ongoing capital discipline should result in a cash conversion rate that again is in that 100% range and positions us to drive strong cash returns to our shareholders in the form of an industry leading dividend payout and strong share repurchases. Bottomline, we expect our performance in 2021 to be a great step toward achieving a 55% operating ratio, which is ultimately about enabling growth through efficiency and generating more cash. Before I turn it back to Lance, I\u2019d like to add my thank you to our exceptional workforce. 2020 was a very difficult year and our employees really rose up against the adversity and showed us what is possible. So, with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Lance.\nLance Fritz: Thank you, Jennifer. When we began our PSR journey in the fourth quarter of 2018, our objective was to drive efficiency across every facet of the operations while providing customers with a safer and more reliable service product. As you heard today, we\u2019ve made tremendous strides toward that goal and we are building a solid foundation of operational excellence. We made good progress across a number of areas in safety last year. We achieved substantial improvement on the rail incident side, while we held the line on personal injuries in a very challenging year. Our safety performance is moving in the right direction and I expect continued improvement. In 2020 we took a step forward to reverse the impact of global warming. Our commitment to set science-based targets and an improved fuel consumption rate demonstrate our pledge to operate sustainably. While there\u2019s more work to be done, these are important milestones to reduce our carbon footprint and help our customers do the same. Best of all, our enhanced service product combined with a lower cost structure is helping UP win in the marketplace and grow. And as you heard from Kenny, our team is energized about the prospect of an improving economy that only expands opportunity to win new business. To wrap up, watch for more information soon on an upcoming Investor Day in early May. While we would love to meet in person, it will most likely be a virtual event. Regardless, we\u2019re excited to lay out our vision to lead Union Pacific into a future of long-term growth and excellent returns. With that, let\u2019s open up the line for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question today comes from Justin Long with Stephens.\nJustin Long: Thanks. Good morning and congrats on the quarter. Maybe to start with one for Jennifer on the guidance, so you talked about the expectation for 150 basis points to 200 basis points of improvement this year. But just given there were some unusual items in 2020, can you talk about the base 2020 OR that you\u2019re using for that guidance? And then on the first quarter OR guidance, I just wanted to clarify, are you expecting a deterioration on a sequential basis or year-over-year? I just wanted to make sure I understood that.\nJennifer Hamann: Okay. I\u2019ll start with that last one, Justin, in terms of the Q1. As you know, there\u2019s seasonality in our operating ratio and Q1 is generally our worst operating ratio of the year. And so my comments were on a year-over-year basis, not sequentially. Because that\u2019s -- that would be a very tough call to roll Q4 into Q1 when you think about the fact that you\u2019ve got the inflation that comes in year one, first of the year in terms of inflation, health and welfare, payroll tax is starting up again. So that was a year-over-year comment. In terms of full year guidance, when we look at the 58.5%, we did have about 130 basis points that was attributable to fuel on a year-over-year basis and as we\u2019re looking forward, we\u2019re really not expecting any kind of a headwind or tailwind from fuel as part of that 150 basis points to 200 basis points of guidance into next year. You\u2019re right there were some unusual things that happened during the course of 2020. We did take some employee salary actions through the course of the year. We did that for about three months. We shut down some shop closures. So obviously those will be costs that will come back into the year that aren\u2019t going to be present on a year-over-year basis. But that\u2019s how we look at it and so when we\u2019re giving the 150 basis points to 100 -- excuse me, 150 basis points to 200 basis points, that\u2019s to the 58.5%, and obviously, you can make some adjustments to that to kind of set up what you see as a comparable.\nJustin Long: Okay. Great. Very helpful. And then, I wanted to ask about service and the key performance metrics. I know you have that slide in the presentation that outlines the progression there. But talking to shippers, the big question is, has a service improvement come as a function of a lower volume environment? I know in the fourth quarter that that changed. But how are you thinking about those key performance metrics in 2021 as volumes improve, and let\u2019s say, they\u2019re in line with your guidance? Do you feel like you can still improve on these performance metrics across the board, and if so, maybe you could talk about where you see the most opportunity?\nLance Fritz: Eric, do you want to take that.\nEric Gehringer: Yeah. I appreciate the question. So as we\u2019ve mentioned before, we did have challenges when you look at the entire ecosystem that is the supply chain. As we\u2019ve reported this morning on a 12% increase in volume in intermodal, we also saw an improvement in our trip plan compliance for intermodal up to 83%. I do expect that to continue. There is opportunities moving forward. I can even tell you three weeks into the year, I\u2019ve seen a significant improvement off that 83% fourth quarter base. Now when you think about the opportunities and where we can go with that to continue to improve, we\u2019ve been focused on that in 2020 and it remains a very critical item for us in 2021. As we think about how do we operate our intermodal terminals, but also how do we partner with our customers. So we\u2019ve spoken before about the Gate Reservation System, that\u2019s a continued opportunity for us. Every opportunity that we can see as a railroad that inbound traffic allows us to more efficiently plan for it, and obviously, turn that efficiency into improved performance for the customer. At the same time, you\u2019re seeing us work through the intermodal ramps themselves and when we think about generating capacity, how do we ensure that we do that in a very reliable manner, because increased capacity will drive fluidity and that fluidity drives to better performance over the road. So very focused on in 2021 and it\u2019ll be a key result that we need to drive even off this relatively high base of 83% in the fourth quarter.\nLance Fritz: Hey. Eric and Justin, just a proof statement, when you look backwards into 2020, we improved year-over-year our service product in the second quarter as volumes drop and we improved our service product year-over-year in the third quarter and fourth quarter when volumes came back. So we\u2019ve got a proof statement that we\u2019re able to in either environment continue to make improvements.\nKenny Rocker: I\u2019ll add there, we\u2019ve been working really closely with our customers and they have recognized that as the product comes through our line, that that service product has improved. So Eric talked about the whole supply chain. Yeah, we\u2019ve seen some puts and takes in terms of chassis supply and that sort of thing. But once that is on our network, Eric and his team are really performing.\nJustin Long: Okay. Great. I appreciate the time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Seidl: Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everybody. I wanted to talk a little bit about the outlook on the volume side and narrowed down a bit 4% to 6% sounds pretty good on the outlook. You mentioned domestic intermodal growing, could you talk a little bit about the international intermodal expectations, especially as we go throughout the year, because there was -- there seems to be a clear ramp up through the ports in fourth quarter and actually in the 1Q here?\nLance Fritz: Kenny, do you want to take that.\nKenny Rocker: Yeah. Let me just take a step back and highlight a few comments that I made earlier this morning in terms of the challenges on the energy side and highlights the fact that, hey, maybe we\u2019d be at that 5% to 7% range, if you pulled out the coal that we acknowledged. Having said all that, on the international intermodal side, we said this publicly, we stated that we\u2019ve had a pretty significant win in the second half of the year, we\u2019re expecting that to continue to ramp on. We also have been encouraged by as the supply chain itself settles down that we should we believe we\u2019ll see more of those international boxes moved to a on dock type scenario versus being transported. So, on the international side, if the trade opens up, as consumer spending gets better, we would expect that that volume would increase. And as I stated earlier, the service product in that area has really improved and even as we sit today, it\u2019s a very strong service product.\nJason Seidl: Okay. That\u2019s good color. Kenny, appreciate that. My follow up is going to be for Jennifer. Jennifer, you mentioned you guys got a little bit more conservative on the cash side with COVID. Clearly, ramping up, though, your share repurchase activity in 4Q, given the outlook for CapEx is relatively flat and it looks like you guys are looking to grow some of your profits here in 2021. How should we think about the share repurchase program? Are you guys going to try to play a little bit of catch up in 2021?\nJennifer Hamann: So, thanks, Jason, for that question. In terms of catch up, we still have probably a little bit higher cash balance that we\u2019re carrying today at the $1.8 billion. So that gives us, I think, a good strong start into the year. And then we\u2019ll see how the rest of the year plays out. Certainly, as we talk at our Analyst Day in May, we\u2019re going to outline probably some more specific plans around not only our long-term outlook of the business performance, but then how we\u2019re going to deploy that that cash to shareholders. So we\u2019ll probably talk more in May.\nJason Seidl: Okay. Appreciate the time as always. Everyone be safe out there.\nJennifer Hamann: Yeah. Thanks, Jason.\nLance Fritz: Thank you, Jason. Same to you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\nScott Group: Hey. Thanks. Good morning, guys. So, Jennifer, I didn\u2019t hear any color around labor cost outlook for the year. Maybe if you can share some thoughts there. And I guess, I\u2019m trying to figure out full year OR is typically pretty similar with what you do in the fourth quarter and the guidance implies something worse than that. So maybe it\u2019s on the labor side. And then if I can just bigger picture on the operating ratio, I know it\u2019s not a full year, you just sort of did that mid-50s OR with down revenue? Does that feel like the as good as it can get or do you feel like there\u2019s room for further improvement on that longer as you go out the next few years? Thank you.\nJennifer Hamann: Well, let me take that last part first. I mean, you\u2019ve heard us say, Scott, that while we have the 55% target out there that we\u2019re still moving towards. We\u2019ve not said that that\u2019s an absolute endpoint. We still see opportunities ahead of us to continue to improve the efficiency. You\u2019ve heard, Eric, talk through some of that and we\u2019re very bullish. We\u2019re -- we think there\u2019s lots of opportunities ahead. So, again, those will be things that we talked more about in May. In terms of the statement about fourth quarter being a predication in terms of what our full year is going to be, I absolutely appreciate that optimism and confidence, and we feel very confident ourselves. But as you know, there\u2019s a lot of puts and takes and there\u2019s variations. We did have a bit of a help from fuel in 2020 that we\u2019re not expecting in 2021. But it really is rooted in those three guidance levels that we gave you in terms of our volume, our pricing and productivity, if we can outperform on any of those categories versus our outlook today that would be upside certainly.\nLance Fritz: Yeah. I want to re-emphasize that, Jennifer, that the guidance we gave is built on assumptions we outlined. And if those -- if we can make those assumptions better, we will. We want to grow faster the market. We\u2019re going to get as much productivity as we can. We\u2019re going to be relentless about efficiency.\nJennifer Hamann: Yeah. And you also asked about the labor side, we\u2019re not giving specific labor cost inflation. If you -- if you\u2019re talking about kind of where we\u2019ve seen that elevated cost per employee, we do expect that to continue. We\u2019re going to continue to manage the workforce very tightly and we think that\u2019s the right decision overall to make.\nScott Group: Thank you, guys.\nJennifer Hamann: Yeah. Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Wetherbee: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. May be my question to be on the pricing side, so it sounds like there\u2019s an opportunity there on price and maybe particularly on the intermodal side. There\u2019s a setup I think in the truckload market that looks kind of similar to what we saw in 2018 in terms of inflationary pricing. So just wanted to get a sense of maybe what you think the opportunity is and maybe using \u201818 as a corollary, do you think we can get that type of acceleration in the core pricing side as we move forward and sort of where within the book of business, do you see the best opportunity?\nKenny Rocker: So, first off, I just want to say that all starts with our service product, which allows us to really go out and compete and price to the marketplace, and so we\u2019re excited about the service product and where it is. Having said that, we\u2019re in January. We\u2019re in the early part of bid season. We\u2019ve gone through 15% to 20% of the bids out there. And what I would tell you is that, based on the tight supply, based on the tight market, there is a somewhat favorable opportunity for us in product in terms of that environment. We\u2019d much rather be in this environment than the loop environments you\u2019ve heard us talk about in \u201819 and first part of the \u201820. So we\u2019ll see how it plays. We\u2019ll have a little bit more clarity as we get through our bid season. But right now, it appears to be a favorable environment.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nJon Chappell: Thank you. Good morning. Kenny, I want to follow up with you. Obviously, some well publicized congestion issues, you guys had to surcharge to the fourth quarter, probably, couldn\u2019t take out as much business as you wanted to. We\u2019ve read you\u2019ve lifted the surcharge. Should we read that to mean that you have the confidence that not only can you keep up this pretty strong intermodal trip planned compliance, but there\u2019s also an opportunity for you to take some of the business that is been piling up in the West Coast that maybe weren\u2019t able to take in the fourth quarter and really grow the entire intermodal franchise at a greater pace than maybe otherwise without those issues?\nKenny Rocker: Yeah. There\u2019s -- believe or not, there is a lot to unpack here. Let me take the surcharges first. So, first of all, those surcharges were in place for our customers that are in our MCP program. So I want to clarify that. We have a program where customers receive containers and we want to make sure those customers under that program receive those containers. During peak season, we ran into a scenario where we wanted to make sure those customers received them because of the high demand. Demand is tight right now, but it\u2019s not as tight as it was in the peak season. So we\u2019ve removed those surcharges and we want to go out there and grow. Let me pivot to another part of your comments around the congestion and just really break down what we\u2019re seeing in the marketplaces. A lot of the containers are coming off the water. Some of them are going on dock to buy rail, when I talked about that service product in great. Other parts of that business is going into warehouses out there and what you\u2019re seeing is some of those containers are out there, they are not turning some of the chassis they\u2019re not turning that\u2019s where that can shift and then the supply chain is going off. We\u2019re working with customer very closely. Eric is working with customers very closely. We\u2019ve made some changes to our accessorial charges to really incentivize and make sure that all customers in our supply chain get the service product. But again, as I stated, once we saw Union Pacific we\u2019ve done a just a fabulous job of executing that service product.\nJon Chappell: All right. Thank you, Kenny. Very helpful.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nTom Wadewitz: Yeah. Good morning. I wanted to ask you a bit about where you think the network goes and what are -- from a terminal perspective and maybe it relates a little bit to the congestion? So are you planning -- are you complete with your terminal consolidation in Chicago? Are you still planning to do terminal consolidation in LA and intermodal? And then what should we think about in terms of metrics that would improve the most in 2021? You had great improvement in train lengths in 2020 and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s -- it\u2019s kind of a nice line up to the right. Does that continue with the same slope or are there other key PSR metrics that we should look at that may be improved more, given your focus on the operating side in 2021? Thank you.\nEric Gehringer: Sure, Tom. Thanks for the question. So let\u2019s start with an update on Chicago. So our consolidation of intermodal ramps in Chicago is complete. We are working right now -- and the construction is complete. We\u2019re working right now here in the month of January to consolidate the G1 operation into G2. At the same time, we\u2019ve finished our consolidation of our two intermodal ramps in Houston and that\u2019s 100% complete. Now to your point, the efforts that we put forward looking at our terminals to drive increased efficiency, they never end. Just this month, in fact, with the investments we made in Englewood, we\u2019re rationalizing the hump that we have at Settegast. Now, we often talk on these calls about humps. But I think it\u2019s important to point out that when we think about terminal efficiency and continued gains, it\u2019s all of our terminals. So even if it doesn\u2019t have a hump, we still look for it, because in a PSR strategy and being a PSR railroad, you\u2019re still driven after safety to touch the cars less. So, even our non-hump terminals represent opportunities to touch the cars less by rationalizing out switching operations. We may use them for other operations like black swapping, but not for switching. So here in the fourth quarter, we stopped switching in Mason City, Iowa. We rationalized switching in El Paso, Texas. Now, again, to be very clear, those efforts will continue in 2021 and beyond. Now, regarding the metrics, you\u2019re going to watch the ones that we report, but of course, internally, we have many more metrics that we help us not only are lagging indicators, but leading indicators. I would leave you with on the car dwell and car velocity. Those are going to be your two biggest indicators of the benefits that we get by making improvements in our terminals, regardless of whether it\u2019s a hump or just a conventional classification here.\nTom Wadewitz: Can you comment briefly on the LA question, whether you\u2019re going to do consolidation in terminals there or not?\nEric Gehringer: Across the entire system, we\u2019re always looking for opportunities. We have a team out in the field. And here in Omaha that is very focused on constantly asking ourselves as we make changes, are there then additional opportunities based on those changes? So that\u2019s as far as I\u2019ll guide you through today.\nTom Wadewitz: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse.\nAllison Landry: Thanks. Good morning. Maybe just following up on Tom\u2019s question about the intermodal network, you\u2019ve talked about some changes. But specifically, I think, a couple of the other rails have announced the development of a big logistics parks next to major intermodal terminals. I think the BN has a couple on their network. Is there any opportunity on the UP network for something like that, where you can sort of create these sticky long-term relationships with customers and really drive long-term share gain?\nLance Fritz: Yeah. Allison, this is Lance. I\u2019ll start and then I\u2019m going to turn it over to Kenny for some detail. The short answer is yes and they do exist. We\u2019ve got a very large industrial park immediately adjacent to the Dallas Intermodal Terminal, where we\u2019ve talked to historically and it\u2019s alive and running about the Dallas to dock plastics product. So, yeah, there are opportunities like that and we do search for ways to use our real estate to the benefit of the railroad and that\u2019s happening all the time. Kenny?\nKenny Rocker: Yeah. I appreciate that question. I tell you what, if you look at our network today, I\u2019m glad you asked it, because we haven\u2019t talked about it quite a bit. But we have 11 rail ports that are out there. You look at the major terminal like, whether it\u2019s Los Angeles, whether that\u2019s Houston, whether it\u2019s Dallas, even if you look at the Chicago area. We already have rail ports in those major areas that we align, trying to take trucks off the road and complement it with the intermodal network or carload network for that matter. So we\u2019re doing that today. I don\u2019t want anyone to leave with the impression that that\u2019s not occurring today. There are more opportunities for us to go out there and be aggressive and you\u2019re seeing some of that with the Twin Cities intermodal terminal.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna.\nBascome Majors: Yes. Good morning. In the last two years, you\u2019ve increased your train length by roughly 30% and I believe you said the volumes down and there were period where we\u2019re about 9% on a daily basis. So that\u2019s considerable progress. I was just curious, when we think about the model of growing merchandise traffic and adding new revenue cars to existing train starts and the typically high incremental margins that come with that. Has that calculus been changed a little bit as far as how much capacity is left to go, as hopefully the industrial economy recovers or is there still a lot of runway to continue that historic relationship that you typically see when industrial traffic recovers? Thanks.\nJennifer Hamann: Yeah. Bascome, this is Jennifer. I would say that we have not changed our enthusiasm around that. And if anything, I think is we\u2019re continuing to find ways to not only build train length, but combine the different types of traffic that are moving on our train. That gives us further opportunity to do that. So those are things that were definitely have been doing and we will continue to do and I think it drives very favorable results as you saw in the fourth quarter.\nLance Fritz: Yeah. And Bascome if you were kind of part of your question, I thought I heard, is there a limit to train length at some point in the future? I think, Eric had mentioned, we\u2019re going to continue to find train length and plan for finding train length opportunity through 2021. Part of that reflected in our capital plan for another 20 siding extensions or new sidings. And so we don\u2019t see an end to that yet either.\nBascome Majors: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Hoexter: Hey. Good morning. Great job on the operating ratio, but, Jen, I think there\u2019s a little bit of confusion if you could just clarify your comment on the first quarter? Is it going to be worse year-over-year? Is it just tough? Just maybe some clarification, because I think there\u2019s some confusion on your comments and thoughts? And then just a follow up on that last one, the siding length, you\u2019re only building half the number of new sidings this year versus last year, so 20 versus 36? Should we expect deceleration on that progress or is there anything -- any comment about the deceleration there? Thanks.\nJennifer Hamann: Let me start with the OR question and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Eric to talk to you about sidings. So my commentary is that, we are going to have a little bit tougher comparison here in the first quarter, and again, I\u2019m talking year-over-year, just because of the mix headwinds that we\u2019re facing. Not saying that we can improve it. Just saying that you need to take into that that mix headwinds as you\u2019re looking at the calculus with the down industrial volumes, particularly less crude oil, but hopefully, we\u2019re continuing to see strong grain and that will help and you saw what green certainly did in terms of helping that business mix profile in the fourth quarter. So that was my commentary, Ken.\nEric Gehringer: Ken, I would say\u2026\nKen Hoexter: Okay.\nEric Gehringer: Ken, I appreciate the question, when you think about the siding and doing 20 versus 36, I would not read into that as an intentional deceleration. What I would read into it is we\u2019re being very judicious with working through the process that we have used over the last two years to truly understand where are the largest opportunities and then making the investment when we need it. We still want to continue to challenge ourselves, though, that growing train length does not necessarily all about capital investments. Jennifer briefly mentioned and I will elaborate, some of its just process. We have, for example, trackers today that are really more data analytics, that help us to see hours in advance of a combination opportunity where we can take two trains and put them together. We can see that five hours, six hours in advance, sometimes even longer. And what that allows us to do is for the local team to prepare for that, and then also, for example, our Harriman Dispatch Center to ensure that we have resources up against that. So we\u2019re seeing the railroad with better clarity than we have ever before and you are going to continue to see us grow train length, but it\u2019s not always going to be driven by capital investment alone. \nKen Hoexter: Great. Thanks, Eric. Thanks, Jen.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my question. I guess, following on that line of thought there, you guys are keeping CapEx flat again, obviously, some spare capacity in the network, like, you\u2019re talking about there. But I guess, how sustainable do you see this equation, keeping CapEx around these levels continuing to grow volume? Isn\u2019t there\u2019s some point at which physical capacity would be required? And I guess just as a quick follow on to that too, how are you guys keeping D&A flat this year, if you don\u2019t mind?\nLance Fritz: So let me start on the capital and then we\u2019ll turn it over to either Jennifer or Eric on the second part. So when we think about capital and long-term looking into the future, we\u2019ve created quite a bit of excess capacity or open capacity through PSR and unified plan. And nothing would please us more than to have enough volume growth to justify investing more capital. You look at our ROIC, we -- every dollar that we put in the ground generating 15% plus, we love that. But we just don\u2019t need it, given the amount of capacity that we have at hand, the way we\u2019re running the railroad today. So, Brandon, it\u2019s very difficult to look out into the future and say, boy, at this date, certain we will need to turn on more growth capital. It\u2019s going to depend on where the car loads are in the network, how much they are, but again, when we do face that question, that\u2019s a very good day for us.\nJennifer Hamann: Yeah. And I think it\u2019s important to note that in the 29 [ph] that we -- roughly that we spent in 2020 and we\u2019re going to spend again there in 2021. We\u2019re making investments for growth in there. That\u2019s not all maintenance CapEx and you think about some of the investments that we\u2019re doing in the terminals and intermodal facilities in Chicago, in Houston, that\u2019s going to support growth. So I think you need to keep that in mind too. Going back to your question on D&A being flat? I guess I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re asking that. Were you asking that in terms of how do we do that in 2020? How are we doing that in 2021? Could you maybe clarify that a little bit?\nBrandon Oglenski: Oh! Sorry. I think you said D&A would be flat this year, right?\nJennifer Hamann: D&A, I\u2019m sorry.\nBrandon Oglenski: Yeah.\nJennifer Hamann: Can\u2019t help. Sorry, I thought you said, G&A. Depreciation expense, so as you know, we do studies every year in terms of looking at some rail life and I think we\u2019ve got a little bit of favorable news there on rail and that\u2019s helping us out a little bit on the depreciation side.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks, Operator. Hi, everybody. Lance and Kenny, I guess, I just wanted to ask about growth. Because I think from here, growth and -- I guess, growth alone is what will allow the company to kind of realize the full benefits of all the changes with respect to the operations and the network. And I guess I\u2019m not just talking about a rising tide, easy comps, cyclical recovery, but rather kind of above market growth and market share wins. And I think it would be fair to say that, the last decade was not characterized by growth, but rather maybe pricing and return. So you have a better network, a leaner network, I just love to get a sense of how are you going to pivot the business and the culture of the company towards growth? And maybe even just give us some tangible examples, because I think you have the market share wins, but if you could just provide a little bit more clarity on those?\nLance Fritz: That\u2019s an excellent question. You\u2019re exactly right, that we are in the process of turning our sites to -- while continuing to improve our margins and yields to add to that more strengthen the growth leg of the stool. And Kenny, you\u2019ve got a couple of things culturally that you\u2019ve done inside the commercial organization. It\u2019s not all just about the commercial organization in terms of supporting growth. But I think they\u2019re indicative of where we\u2019re going.\nKenny Rocker: Yeah. That\u2019s a great question. And I\u2019ll tell you, we have a number of commodities that will grow and we still have to compete. We still have to go out there and compete against trucks and other modes to go out there and win that business. We have good line of sight of those. We feel good about it. I like your word choice of culturally. I\u2019ll tell you our teams were very excited about where we are. We\u2019ve changed our compensation program, so that we can motivate the sales team to go out there and win. We want to make sure that they are spending their energy and focus on carload growth. And I can tell you that the leadership team here at the table with me, we\u2019re all supportive and they\u2019re all committed to that carload growth. I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t say we had really good clarity on what those goals are transparency, on what it\u2019s like to win and really clear metrics that support growth. But behind it, we have things like ensuring that there\u2019s good, not necessarily margins, but that we\u2019re winning with the right kind of margins and we\u2019ve achieved the right kind of price. So it\u2019s all baked in there to just motivate the team and we expect that to be a great cultural change\u2026\nAmit Mehrotra: Yeah.\nKenny Rocker: \u2026for us.\nLance Fritz: And Kenny, you\u2019ve changed your work structure to streamline it. You\u2019ve distributed business development goals to more broad than just each salesperson. Everybody on your team has business development responsibility. Amit, there\u2019s just example after example of fundamental changes that have been put in place in 2020 that we think are going to drive growth in 2021 and beyond.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for the end market commentary for 2021. But I think one of the end markets missing there was international intermodal. Apologies if I missed this. But can you address kind of what do you see in terms of trends there given that that was one of the markets that really was -- was really volatile in 2020?\nLance Fritz: Yeah. Again, the big things we\u2019re looking at is consumer spending and trade there, the timing of the vaccination, adoption of the vaccination. We expect to have a direct impact on those international intermodal volumes. As the demand we believe we will be sustained. We feel good about the service product. We feel good about our interaction with our customers and the processes that they\u2019ve adopted to allow us to efficiently grow there. So all of that going into 2021 we believe will be a positive for us.\nRavi Shanker: Good. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi. Good morning. I would love to circle back to that growth question. Just in terms of, I would love to hear your perspective on technology as an enabler of that growth? Are you looking at it more as sort of a productivity enhancer or is there more opportunity on sort of reliability and service in terms of gaining that share back, any thoughts?\nLance Fritz: Yeah. Let me start with that and then I think everybody on the team might have a perspective. The first thing I want to note is our most recent addition to the senior leadership team with Rahul Jalali, who joined us as our CIO. I think it was in early November last year. He\u2019s bringing fresh energy and perspective to the team. And Allison, we think about the role of technology, all of the above, in terms of what you asked about it, it definitely plays a role in growth, in terms of customer experience, in terms of us developing platforms and ecosystems for our customers to participate in and resolving their needs from their perspective. There\u2019s been a real juice applied to that in recent months. And we\u2019re going to continue to use technology to enhance efficiency and productivity. UP vision is a great example of that getting something a minimum -- of minimally viable product in the hands of our operations team and then developing it on the fly into a very, very strong productivity tool today. But Kenny and Eric, you guys are the ones experiencing it.\nKenny Rocker: Yeah. I would tell you, we certainly want to take advantage of it from a commercial standpoint to go out there and make it easier for customers to do business with us with again pointing towards growth. So, yes, we have a number of visibility tools that our customers are using, so they can see what\u2019s coming to them at their plant either on the UP or offline. We\u2019ve certainly talked about the usage of API\u2019s before and it\u2019s opened up markets for us and I mean, literally, we\u2019ve been able to go out there and win business with having API\u2019s in our tool kit. Again, we\u2019ve done a great job of expanding that customer engagement with the API capabilities. I\u2019ve been encouraged to Lance\u2019s comments with Rahul coming on Board. And he really have a vision for helping us remove pain points that the customer might have through IT. And then lastly, just to set up, Eric here, from a visibility standpoint, we certainly utilize technology to see what\u2019s common to us. So a good example of that is, the containers that are heading into the West Coast port. We have a better handle and more clarity now of what at the port, what\u2019s coming to the point port and we utilize that to leverage to come up with a good strong solid service product.\nEric Gehringer: So, Allison, Lance and Kenny have both highlighted tools and technology that allows us to see our railroads that. What I\u2019m very excited about on top of all that is we have made tremendous strides in technology on how we execute on our railroad. So if you think about, for example, the upgrade with our implementation of our CATX [ph] system at the Harriman Dispatch Center. This drives not only more fluidity, but it drives improved customer service. When I look at what our engineering department and mechanical departments are doing to reinvent the way they do their work, whether it\u2019s to occupy less time or whether it\u2019s to do the work in a more efficient manner, there are almost a countless number of initiatives that relate to technology that are driving that and you\u2019ll see that continue in 2021 and beyond.\nAllison Poliniak: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nCherilyn Radbourne: Thanks very much and good morning. Most of my questions have been asked, but I was hoping that you could expand a little bit on the outlook for your grain franchise, including where export flows stand now relative to normal and where do you think on farm inventory stand?\nKenny Rocker: Now, those are a couple good questions, Cherilyn. I appreciate that. You know right now we\u2019re kind of in the early innings and so what I tell you is that for this quarter, Jennifer mentioned that, and it\u2019s still pretty early innings and but it looks like grain in the near-term will hold up. And so we\u2019ll have to see. We\u2019re working with our customers very closely to get forecasts on that. I\u2019ll tell you, though, in the back half of the year, the comps get a lot tougher. However, that will still be a very strong 2021. So you want to keep that in perspective. I think the back -- last part of your question is just around inventory. We feel good about the fact that there\u2019s still quite a bit of grain out there. We\u2019ve saw the grain inventory decrease about 10% year-over-year. We\u2019re expecting a pretty strong crop. With that, we feel good about that demand being sustained. So, Eric, and his team will deliver that and our commercial team will then engage to maximize as many shuttles as we can get.\nLance Fritz: And Cherilyn, I would add, current demand is being large -- from export perspective being largely driven by China and China\u2019s entry back into the U.S. bean market, partly reflecting the Phase 1 U.S.-China trade deal, partly reflecting a basically recovered hog herd in domestic China. So what China does through the year is really going to kind of predicate what happens in the second half of the year in terms of export grain.\nKenny Rocker: That\u2019s right on Lance. I mean, you got that dynamic. Some of our customers have talked about -- talk to us about Brazil and whether or not there\u2019s a drought down there that might impact the demand. But I can tell you, we\u2019re focused on executing and getting as much grain business as we can export out of the country if we can.\nCherilyn Radbourne: Great. Thank you for the time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hey. Thank you. Good morning. So one more question on growth, Lance, you talked in the press release about taking share of the freight transportation market. I want to ask if you could provide some more context around that, sounds like we need to do to get there is a bit of a mix of infrastructure, service technology and then focus from the sales team. But where do you see the biggest opportunities, are they, like, coal or commodity type? And do you think this is something you can actually quantify when we get to the Analyst Day in May? And then I guess on a related point, typically we think about some of the conversion opportunities coming with that as a neutral and negative mix. Appreciate can you just comments about the system and the margin accretive, but how do you reconcile the two kind of what we\u2019ve seen in the past versus what you are targeting is that more of a density play or is it better service and better pricing? So putting some context around that would be appreciated.\nLance Fritz: Okay. Brian, so let me try to unpack that and I\u2019ll try to do that holistically. So the question being around growing our share of the freight market and what does that mean? And you\u2019ve asked some questions around the implications of mix and what it takes to win and what gives us confidence. So when we talk about growing our share of the freight market, we are deliberately broad, because we\u2019re focused, first and foremost, on converting trucks from highway. Inside of that we\u2019re looking for commodities that are under penetrated to train and have the dynamic where they should be -- we should see greater share overall of train penetrating freight. And also customers, they used to ship on us and don\u2019t anymore trying to unpack why and what we can do about that and new markets that are opening up to us, both because of our service product and our cost structure. So, we\u2019re deliberately broad because there the target markets are deliberately broad. In terms of what it takes, it takes an excellent service product and for most customers perspective that\u2019s reliability and consistency. There\u2019s also a safety and an ESG component there. Many of our customers look to us to help them meet some of their commitments to their shareholders and stakeholders in terms of their carbon footprint. So there\u2019s that. It also takes us having a deep knowledge of the marketplace through Kenny\u2019s commercial team. That\u2019s, that\u2019s the secret sauce of the commercial team is understanding many markets deeply, deeply enough to understand what it takes to win. And then we\u2019ve got to have service products designed that do that that means the needs of our customers. And you\u2019ve got it partly right, I think, maybe even largely right and that is, as we grow, looking forward, a lot of that looks like it\u2019s going to go into the intermodal product and our intermodal product, everything else equal tends to mix us down. Now having said that, our intermodal product is also becoming more profitable over time and we\u2019re not going to stop on that initiative. And we\u2019re also very, very confident in our ability to leverage growth through productivity. So you put that all together and bottomline what it says is, we\u2019re going to continue to use all three legs of the stool to make future margin generation better than today. And our confidence coming out of 2020 has really never been higher being able to do that.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Got it. Thank you, Lance. Appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of David Ross with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Ross: Yes. Good morning, everyone. I just wanted to touch on Mexico for a little bit. Commentary on the growth you\u2019re expecting in 2021 in the Mexico business versus the U.S. business, should it be better or should it be worse, but the same?\nKenny Rocker: Yeah. So thanks for bringing that up. First of all, we\u2019ve been encouraged by the fact that, that Mexico business, we\u2019ve got a significant percentage of that tied to the automotive network and we\u2019re seeing that comeback, which is encouraging to us. We\u2019re also seeing some areas like the Mexico Energy Reform, the combat area or pipeline for growth for us. As I look at some of the wins that we\u2019ve had, to Lance\u2019s comments around that truck business, really Mexico as an area where we have to go after and grow the pieces of business that were over the road that we haven\u2019t won before. So we are encouraged about Mexico. At the same time, if you look at it as a whole, Mexico is still under penetrated, once you walk out thought of that automotive network and so we\u2019ve been working with customers and supply chain partners to see what we can do to untap some of those markets. So we\u2019re pretty encouraged about Mexico and what it has both for 2021 and long-term.\nDavid Ross: Got you.\nLance Fritz: Thank you, David.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC. Please proceed with your question.\nWalter Spracklin: Yeah. Thanks very much, Operator. So I want to take a little bit more cautious question around the growth or cautious angle to the growth question. When other PSR railroads or other railroads have converted to PSR, they\u2019ve noted, obviously, a very significant service improvement that\u2019s led to the ability to grow share very, very strongly, especially if they\u2019re up against the non-PSR railroad, as you are. My question, therefore is, does that -- what is the capacity of your organization to grow? Are there any capacity issues that you\u2019ve identified that you need to address in order to accommodate that growth and are you -- when we seen other railroads tempted to go down rather unconventional paths toward growth, acquiring another market? So what are your thoughts around kind of not the pure rail related growth opportunities, but going down some of those other routes, your view on that be appreciated as well?\nEric Gehringer: Yeah. Walter, let me take a stab at that and maybe Jennifer wants to add to my comments. Thank you very much for the question. So when we think about growth and using our service product to grow? I -- absent some surprising very regionalized response, I think we\u2019ve got good capacity around the network. We\u2019ve got the ability to react to growth as it\u2019s occurring, if we need to add to whatever our capacity is. And I candidly, I just look forward, and I don\u2019t see even in some strong growth, I don\u2019t see a surprise to us that would cause us alarm. I think our processes, our mechanisms for seeing growth as it\u2019s occurring, know where it\u2019s happening, being deliberate about what we\u2019re going after. I really think the network is on very good footing. So that\u2019s the -- what is needed in a capacity perspective. In terms of the part of your question about what elements are you thinking about growth when it comes to non-traditional? Unpacking we think of three ways to grow. The first is put carloads to fit the network that are profitable on the network. Clearly, that\u2019s a step one and the most favored way to grow because it\u2019s got great incremental margins and it uses capacity that\u2019s available. Another way for us to grow is to do more for our customers, perform more function for them in their supply chains logistics. And that\u2019s always an opportunity and we\u2019re working on that, because it also helps make customers stickier with us. We\u2019re providing greater value to them and in the process solving their problems, whatever their addressable problems are for us. Then the third way that we think about growth is increasing the geographical footprint. We\u2019ve been pretty clear that when we think about that from a class one merger perspective that there\u2019s a lot of opportunity for regulation to destroy value in that process. And so far, the economics just don\u2019t look like they pencil out. But that\u2019s not the only way to increase our geographic footprint. We can do it through, one of the earlier questions, how do we use our real estate to increase our reach maybe through incremental transit loads or incremental logistics parts. So, yeah, Walter, we\u2019re thinking about all three, all three have action against them and I think we\u2019ll probably get into a bit more detail on that when it comes to the Investor Day.\nJennifer Hamann: Yeah. And Walter, just to quickly kind of put a bow on it. I mean, I think, that\u2019s what you\u2019re touching on is what we see as the great leverage and great opportunity that\u2019s ahead of us is to grow in a less capital intensive manner over the next period of time. When you think about the locomotive assets that we can deploy, the freight cars, the track capacity, the ability to redeploy terminals if we need to, I mean, those are all great new storage for us to the extent that we start deploying those assets and we see a future where we will be deploying those assets. I think that\u2019s the real value and the leverage that we have ahead of us.\nWalter Spracklin: Makes a lot of sense. Appreciate the time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJordan Alliger: Yeah. Hi. Good morning. A question just on the revenue per carload yield, I heard what you\u2019re saying about the first quarter and fourth quarter. Just sort of wondering from a context standpoint, I get the headwind. Can you sort of put that in context of the minus 4% you did in the fourth quarter? Could it look better versus that? Are we talking the same order of magnitude? And that sort of the second part of it is, in terms of the second quarter and third quarter when industrials set to most likely inflect positive, could there be a period where mix becomes a tailwind in 2021?\nJennifer Hamann: Yeah. Jordan, I think, you\u2019re thinking of it right. So if we think about revenue per unit or arc, just flat revenue in the first quarter, you heard us say that we\u2019re looking at low single-digit growth on a volume standpoint. But we are going to continue to have a pretty strong fuel headwind in the first quarter as we did through much of 2020. Right now we\u2019re paying call it a $60 or so a gallon for fuel. I think we paid close to a $90 in the first quarter of last year. So just that fuel surcharge revenue is going to be a driver there in terms of the revenue per unit, you all see that and then obviously the mix. With the industrial car loadings continuing to be down, that\u2019s our highest average revenue per car unit type of business and so that creates a headwind. We\u2019re bullish on the grain and feel good about that. So, we\u2019ll look to move as much of that as we possibly can. But there is going to be [Technical Difficulty]. I think as you also talk the second half to the second and third quarters, we have opportunities. Kenny talks about an improving price environment. You\u2019re going to have that headwind abate relative to the year-over-year fuel change and then if we can get some growth on an industrial side, that could be great news as well.\nJordan Alliger: Just follow up quickly on that on the arc for intermodal, which I guess has been running a bit negative. Is there mixed stuff going on there too is, does that have a chance to better pricing to move in a positive direction in the upcoming quarters? Thanks.\nJennifer Hamann: Yeah. I mean, again, as you know, there\u2019s mix within mix. So within intermodal, you have both international and domestic, and there are differences there and then as part of that premium group, overall, automotive is in there. And automotive obviously is a big part of that, when you see those volumes down year-over-year and intermodal growing.\nEric Gehringer: Yeah.\nJordan Alliger: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question this morning is coming from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Vernon: Hey. Good morning. And on this topic of kind of catalyzing growth, Lance, when I look at the performance metrics page and the trip plan compliance is specifically like 83% for intermodal, 74% for manifest. I think one of the easiest levers you could have to take more share would be to improve those metrics. I guess I\u2019m looking for some perspective on how satisfied you are with the trip plan compliance today. How does that compare to your primary competitor in the West? And then what can you do to drive those metrics up, because I would think that would be one of the easier paths towards maximizing your share with existing -- with customers?\nLance Fritz: That\u2019s a great question, David. So we are not satisfied with our KPIs. We\u2019re pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made and we think they are good in the marketplace and position us to be able to compete for and win business. But we also think there\u2019s some upside in terms of improvement. Having said that, 100% is not an outcome. That\u2019s reasonable that that\u2019s actually likely or even optimal. In the railroad environment, the way we measure trip plan compliance, whether it\u2019s for the intermodal product or manifest and autos. What we have said and do think, is that we can get that intermodal trip plan compliance into the high 80%s and low 90%s and have it sit there, and if we can get the manifest and autos into the 80% ballpark and low 80%s and have it sit there, that\u2019s a sweet spot, balancing out resources and fulfilling a consistent reliable service product that supports the needs of our customers. So there is a bit of an upside there, David. I wouldn\u2019t hang my hat on that\u2019s going to generate 2x and 3x and 4x growth. What that does is it continues to set us up to compete effectively. And we\u2019re already really set to compete effectively against our primary rail competition and we\u2019ve got a lot of work underway with some delivery on being able to compete effectively with truck.\nDavid Vernon: And is there any sort of tension between trip plan client\u2019s number and train lines, I guess, like operationally, I would think that there might be a little bit of tension there. But I mean, this is a situation where we are right now or where we\u2019re maximizing efficiency and maybe leaving some growth on the table. Is that the way to think about it or is that not the way we to think about it?\nLance Fritz: No. I wouldn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right way to think about it, David. Although you\u2019re right that, we have moved virtually all, I think all of our critical operating KPIs in 2020 favorably in comparison to 2019, both the efficiency and productivity measures and the service measures. So we\u2019ve demonstrated we can move them both in the same direction. It\u2019s not easy, right? That\u2019s not a layup. Because if we don\u2019t think about our network right, we can get into a place where we\u2019re making those false trade-offs between productivity and efficiency and the service product. I label them false trade-off because I think they are, if we think about our network, right, we can do the hard work on both.\nDavid Vernon: All right.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we\u2019ve reached the end of our question-and-answer session. Now I\u2019ll hand the floor back to Mr. Lance Fritz, for any closing comments.\nLance Fritz: Thank you, Rob, and thank you all for your questions. We look forward to talking with you again in April, when we discuss our first quarter 2021 results. Until then, I wish all of you good health and safety, and please take care. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Eric Gehringer",
            "content": "Thanks, Lance, and good morning. The operating team delivered impressive results in the quarter, as we did an excellent job adding volume to our network in an extremely efficient manner, while also managing the normal challenges associated with the holidays. The fourth quarter is another proof statement of how PSR has continued to transform our operations. I'm proud of our entire operating team and their achievements during a very challenging year. We could have not achieved what we did in 2020 without their support and commitment. Moving to slide four, I'd like to update you on our key performance indicators where the team once again made improvements across nearly all of our measures. Freight car velocity and freight car terminal dwell both improved year-over-year, driven by focusing on asset utilization and reducing car touches. Locomotive and workforce productivity both all time quarterly records improved as we continue to use those resources more efficiently through our PSR journey. These improvements were driven by an evergreen process to evaluate and adjust our transportation plan, while using fewer locomotives. In addition, the train and engine workforce decreased 12% versus 2019, while volume increased 3%. In the face of intermodal volume growth of 12%, we maintain a high level of service as evidenced by our intermodal trip plan compliance results. To achieve higher levels, we are working with customers to improve the timely pickup of containers in order to improve box turns, increase parking capacity and create chassis supply. We view our intermodal ramps as production facilities that must improve their efficiency in order to drive a more reliable service product. Finally, our manifest service remains strong during the quarter, driving a 3 point improvement in trip planned compliance for manifest and autos. The team did an excellent job of maintaining this service product throughout the year, despite the significant fluctuations in demand. This past year presented quite the challenge to the operating team. The drastic fall off in volume in April, followed by the rapid recovery in July required agility, as we shut down portions of our operations and then reopen them, all while staying focused on keeping our employees safe and healthy. The improvement we made across all of our key metrics during 2020 provides a strong foundation for continued improvement in 2021. Slide five highlights some of our recent network changes. We continue to push train length to drive productivity, while providing a better service product to our customers. Compared to the fourth quarter 2018, when we first began implementing precision scheduled railroading, we have increased train length across our system by 30% or 2100 feet to approximately 9150 feet in the fourth quarter of 2020. This is a tremendous progress, especially when you consider that our seven-day car loadings fell 9% over the same period. One enabler of this great progress is our siding extension program. We completed 36 sidings in 2020, allowing longer trains to run in both directions and reducing train starts. This was a monumental accomplishment by our engineering department to finish these sidings and then by our network design team to leverage this increased capability. The redesign of our operations in Houston remained on track. Recent investments at our Englewood yard focused on extending the bowl tracks to add density to the yard and facilitate longer trains. This project also leverages the investments we've made along the main line. Finally, last month, we announced a new service from Southern California to a pop up intermodal ramp in the Twin Cities of Minnesota. With minimal capital investment, we are turning an existing yard into a small intermodal terminal, allowing us to provide new service to an attractive market in a quick and efficient manner. As I look to the future, I'm excited about the full pipeline of projects. We have to drive service enhancements and productivity across our entire network. Turning to capital spending, as demonstrated on slide six, Union Pacific continues to deliver value to our shareholders through the efficient use of capital. Our PSR implementation has generated significant capacity, allowing us to maintain this discipline in 2021. Pending final approval by our Board of Directors, we are targeting capital spending of $2.9 billion in 2021, basically flat with last year. About 80% of our planned capital investment is replacement spending to harden our infrastructure, replace older assets and improve the safety and resiliency of the network. We remained focused on modernizing our locomotive fleet through the upgrade of older core units, generating a longer life out of an existing asset, boosting its reliability and improving its fuel efficiency is a win for all stakeholders. The plan also includes targeted freight car acquisitions to support replacement and growth opportunities. We will continue to invest in capacity projects on our network to improve productivity and operational efficiency. We plan to complete more than 20 siding extensions focused in the Southern and Pacific Northwest parts of our network. These sidings support our train length initiatives and target future growth areas for our business. Finally, we remain focused on our enhancements to our energy management system to reduce fuel consumption, leveraging integration with our PTC platform. Looking to 2021, we remain focused on continuing to drive the organization using the PSR principles that have led us to this new level of operational excellence. Everything we do must be done with an eye towards doing our work safer. While maintaining a high standard on the prevention of our personal injuries, we recognize we have yet to reach our full potential. Our improvement in rail incidents in 2020 indicates that we have the right plan in place to make the entire network safer. We will be judicious with our resources and turn them quickly. We are determined to be as efficient as possible at our terminals to improve the reliability of our service product and we will push productivity through train length and other initiatives. We must continue to deliver a highly consistent and reliable service product for our customers. There are many opportunities for us to improve across all aspects of our operations, we must seize upon those in order to fulfill the long-term goals of our railroads. With that, I will turn it over to Kenny to provide an update on the business environment. Yeah. I appreciate the question. So as we've mentioned before, we did have challenges when you look at the entire ecosystem that is the supply chain. As we've reported this morning on a 12% increase in volume in intermodal, we also saw an improvement in our trip plan compliance for intermodal up to 83%. I do expect that to continue. There is opportunities moving forward. I can even tell you three weeks into the year, I've seen a significant improvement off that 83% fourth quarter base. Now when you think about the opportunities and where we can go with that to continue to improve, we've been focused on that in 2020 and it remains a very critical item for us in 2021. As we think about how do we operate our intermodal terminals, but also how do we partner with our customers. So we've spoken before about the Gate Reservation System, that's a continued opportunity for us. Every opportunity that we can see as a railroad that inbound traffic allows us to more efficiently plan for it, and obviously, turn that efficiency into improved performance for the customer. At the same time, you're seeing us work through the intermodal ramps themselves and when we think about generating capacity, how do we ensure that we do that in a very reliable manner, because increased capacity will drive fluidity and that fluidity drives to better performance over the road. So very focused on in 2021 and it'll be a key result that we need to drive even off this relatively high base of 83% in the fourth quarter. Sure, Tom. Thanks for the question. So let's start with an update on Chicago. So our consolidation of intermodal ramps in Chicago is complete. We are working right now -- and the construction is complete. We're working right now here in the month of January to consolidate the G1 operation into G2. At the same time, we've finished our consolidation of our two intermodal ramps in Houston and that's 100% complete. Now to your point, the efforts that we put forward looking at our terminals to drive increased efficiency, they never end. Just this month, in fact, with the investments we made in Englewood, we're rationalizing the hump that we have at Settegast. Now, we often talk on these calls about humps. But I think it's important to point out that when we think about terminal efficiency and continued gains, it's all of our terminals. So even if it doesn't have a hump, we still look for it, because in a PSR strategy and being a PSR railroad, you're still driven after safety to touch the cars less. So, even our non-hump terminals represent opportunities to touch the cars less by rationalizing out switching operations. We may use them for other operations like black swapping, but not for switching. So here in the fourth quarter, we stopped switching in Mason City, Iowa. We rationalized switching in El Paso, Texas. Now, again, to be very clear, those efforts will continue in 2021 and beyond. Now, regarding the metrics, you're going to watch the ones that we report, but of course, internally, we have many more metrics that we help us not only are lagging indicators, but leading indicators. I would leave you with on the car dwell and car velocity. Those are going to be your two biggest indicators of the benefits that we get by making improvements in our terminals, regardless of whether it's a hump or just a conventional classification here. Across the entire system, we're always looking for opportunities. We have a team out in the field. And here in Omaha that is very focused on constantly asking ourselves as we make changes, are there then additional opportunities based on those changes? So that's as far as I'll guide you through today. Ken, I would say... Ken, I appreciate the question, when you think about the siding and doing 20 versus 36, I would not read into that as an intentional deceleration. What I would read into it is we're being very judicious with working through the process that we have used over the last two years to truly understand where are the largest opportunities and then making the investment when we need it. We still want to continue to challenge ourselves, though, that growing train length does not necessarily all about capital investments. Jennifer briefly mentioned and I will elaborate, some of its just process. We have, for example, trackers today that are really more data analytics, that help us to see hours in advance of a combination opportunity where we can take two trains and put them together. We can see that five hours, six hours in advance, sometimes even longer. And what that allows us to do is for the local team to prepare for that, and then also, for example, our Harriman Dispatch Center to ensure that we have resources up against that. So we're seeing the railroad with better clarity than we have ever before and you are going to continue to see us grow train length, but it's not always going to be driven by capital investment alone. So, Allison, Lance and Kenny have both highlighted tools and technology that allows us to see our railroads that. What I'm very excited about on top of all that is we have made tremendous strides in technology on how we execute on our railroad. So if you think about, for example, the upgrade with our implementation of our CATX [ph] system at the Harriman Dispatch Center. This drives not only more fluidity, but it drives improved customer service. When I look at what our engineering department and mechanical departments are doing to reinvent the way they do their work, whether it's to occupy less time or whether it's to do the work in a more efficient manner, there are almost a countless number of initiatives that relate to technology that are driving that and you'll see that continue in 2021 and beyond. Yeah. Walter, let me take a stab at that and maybe Jennifer wants to add to my comments. Thank you very much for the question. So when we think about growth and using our service product to grow? I -- absent some surprising very regionalized response, I think we've got good capacity around the network. We've got the ability to react to growth as it's occurring, if we need to add to whatever our capacity is. And I candidly, I just look forward, and I don't see even in some strong growth, I don't see a surprise to us that would cause us alarm. I think our processes, our mechanisms for seeing growth as it's occurring, know where it's happening, being deliberate about what we're going after. I really think the network is on very good footing. So that's the -- what is needed in a capacity perspective.

            "content": "Thanks, Kenny, and good morning. I'm going to start off this morning with our adjusted income statement on slide 15, where we provide both the reported and adjusted look to remove the impact of the Brazos impairment charge. Throughout my remarks today I will speak to the adjusted results. Operating revenue totaled $5.1 billion, down 1% versus 2019 on a 3% year-over-year volume growth. Adjusted operating expense decreased 8% to $2.9 billion as we continue demonstrating our ability to grow without adding costs in at a one for one. Taken together, we are reporting fourth quarter adjusted operating income of $2.3 billion, a 9% increase versus 2019. Other income of $66 million is up $10 million versus 2019, as a result of increased real estate gains. Interest expense was flat compared to 2019, as we mitigated the impact of increased debt levels by lowering our effective interest rate 20 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted net income of $1.6 billion increased 13% versus 2019, which when combined with share repurchases led to a 17% increase in earnings per share to $2.36. Our 55.6 % adjusted operating ratio was 410 basis points better year-over-year and is an all time quarterly record for Union Pacific. Core improvement totaled 320 basis points as lower fuel prices contributed 90 basis points. Looking more closely at fourth quarter revenue, slide 16 provides a breakdown of our freight revenue, which totaled $4.8 billion, down 1% versus 2019, 3% volume growth was offset by the impact of lower diesel fuel prices, down 33% year-over-year, which reduced revenue by 3.5 points. Although, we continue to yield pricing dollars in excess of inflation in the fourth quarter and experienced an improving pricing environment, these gains were more than offset by a negative business mix and reduced freight revenue a 0.25 point. Strong intermodal volumes and lower petroleum carloads were a mixed headwind in the fourth quarter. However, strength in grain shipments helped mitigate that impact both year-over-year and sequentially. Now let's move on to slide 17, which provides a summary of our fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses. Starting first with compensation and benefits expense, which decreased 3% year-over-year as we offset wage inflation and the $37 million one-time employee bonus with lower force counts, excluding the bonus impact, quarterly cost per employee remained elevated, increasing 9% as we tightly managed headcount. Fourth quarter workforce levels declined 14% or about 4,800 full time equivalents, driven primarily by the great work Jim, Eric and team have done to grow train length, our train and engine workforce continues to be more than volume variable down 12%, while management, engineering and mechanical workforces to kept together decreased 15%. Quarterly fuel expense decreased 35%, a result of lower diesel fuel prices and an improved fuel consumption rate offset by volume growth. Our fourth quarter fuel consumption rate decreased 4% versus 2019, with roughly half of the improvement driven by core productivity, half from middle line run through fuel adjustments, with some offset related to business mix. Purchase services and material expense declined 7% in the quarter, driven by more productive use of our locomotive fleet and a couple of favorable interline settlements. As automotive shipments remain impacted by the pandemic, subsidiary drayage expense was also lower year-over-year. Equipment and other rents fell 4% in the quarter, as a result of lower locomotive and freight car lease expense, as we continue to use those assets more efficiently. Increased intermodal volumes offset a portion of those savings however. The other expense line is where you see the impact of the $278 million non-cash impairment charge, when adjusted this expense category was up 2% year-over-year. As you'll recall, last year, in the fourth quarter, we reported a $25 million insurance recovery in this cost line. So, solid expense control including state and local taxes, which ended the quarter better than expected. Freight loss and damage expense also was lower year versus 2019, as we run a safer railroad. Turning for a moment to our 2021 expense expectations, look for the following. Depreciation expense to be relatively flat versus 2020, purchase services and materials expense to increase high-single digits with the recovery in the auto volumes and other expenses should be up low-single digits, primarily driven by higher state and local taxes in 2021, and for income taxes, we expect our annual effective tax rate to be between 23% and 24%. Looking now at productivity, we continued our strong productivity trend in the fourth quarter, generating $170 million of productivity. We finished 2020 at $708 million and a total of nearly $1.4 billion over the past two years, a fantastic achievement by the entire Union Pacific team. These productivity gains were led by the operating departments continued progress on train length initiatives and more efficient use of all of our resources. Importantly, as Eric demonstrated on the KPI slide, we achieve this higher level of productivity, while also improving the reliability of our service product. To finalize the cost variability analysis we provided throughout 2020, slide 18 illustrates how we were more than volume variable on a fuel adjusted basis, whether viewed year-over-year or sequentially. Stepping back to look at full year 2020 on slide 19, we're reporting earnings per share of $7.88, which when adjusted for the impairment charge is $8.19, declining only 2% versus 2019, despite facing volume and revenue declines of 7% and 10%, respectively, driven by the strong productivity gains, I just discussed, adjusted operating income only declined 5% to $8.1 billion. Our full year adjusted operating ratio of 58.5% represents an improvement of 210 basis points versus 2019. Collectively, these results demonstrate the organization's agility and overall transformation as we work to overcome 2020 challenges. Turning now to cash and returns, Union Pacific maintained a strong cash position throughout 2020, as we purposefully maintain greater liquidity through the pandemic, while at the same time, continuing to generate significant cash flow. Aided by the timing of some tax payments, full year 2020 cash from operations decreased only 1% versus 2019 to $8.5 billion, despite a 6% decrease in adjusted net income. Free cash flow after capital investments totaled $5.6 billion, resulting in 101% adjusted cash conversion rate. Our dividend payout ratio for 2020 adjusted for the impairment charge was 47% or slightly above our 40% to 45% target range, as we maintain their dividend through the economic downturn and distributed $2.6 billion to shareholders. And although we paused our repurchase activity during 2020 in an effort to preserve liquidity, we still repurchased a total of 22 million common shares or 4% during 2020, at an all in cost of $3.7 billion. This includes repurchases of 749 million made in the fourth quarter. In combination dividends and share repurchases totaled $6.3 billion returned to our shareholders. Turning to the strength of our balance sheet, Union Pacific remains committed to maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating, ending 2020 with a BAA1 rating from Moody's and an A- from S&P. Excluding the impairment charge, we finished the year at a comparable adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.8 times. Our all in adjusted debt balance at December 31, 2020, of $29 billion increased $1.5 billion from your in 2019, as we took actions in the fourth quarter to pay down $1.3 billion of debt, given our strong liquidity position. Finally, our adjusted return on invested capital came in at 14.3%, down from 2019, due to the impact of the pandemic on our earnings and while a declining ROIC is never desirable, staying within a historically high range reflects our long-term capital discipline, as well as the added benefit of PSR capacity creation. Turning to 2021, we are confident in our ability to execute on the opportunities ahead. Importantly, our outlook for the year includes the potential for improvement across all three performance drivers, volume, price and productivity. With volume we're looking for full year growth in the 4% to 6% range, largely driven by year-over-year increases in the second quarter. Our visibility to the year is murky however and it really depends on a number of factors, the vaccine rollout, the sustainability of consumer demand and trade, particularly as it relates to grain volumes and a second half industrial recovery. But as you heard from Kenny, we are bullish about our opportunity to win in the marketplace and drive business to our railroad. From a business mix perspective, we see mixed staying negative in 2021, with the most pronounced challenges in the first and fourth quarters. The first quarter will be pressured as we move from an environment where crude and industrial car loadings grew in 2020 to today where those volumes are lower year-over-year admits growing intermodal business. However, we could see those first quarter headwinds moderate some if grain shipments stay strong. That grain strength and tough year-over-year comparisons will likely become a headwind though in the back half of 2021, particularly in the fourth quarter. With an improved demand environment, as well as a reliable service product, we will remain disciplined in our pricing approach and expect to yield pricing dollars in excessive inflation dollars in 2021, embedded in that guidance is our expectation that all in inflation for the year is expected to be around 2.25%. On the productivity front, you heard Eric outline our plans for continued progress, which should generate roughly $500 million of added productivity this year. The combination of growing volumes, pricing above inflation and ongoing productivity should produce a full year operating ratio that is one of the best if not the best in the rail industry in 2021. And assuming the year plays out, as I have just described, we'd expect to be in the range of 150 basis points to 200 basis points of operating ratio improvement 2021, so another solid year of gains. In terms of first quarter guidance, we're expecting volumes to grow in the low single-digit range, with a potentially tougher operating ratio comparison, dependent on the mix headwinds, I just mentioned. Turn into cash and capital, you heard our plan to invest around $2.9 billion of capital for the year, well within our long-term guidance of less than 15% of revenue, as we generate capacity through our PSR journey. The combination of topline growth, increasing profitability and ongoing capital discipline should result in a cash conversion rate that again is in that 100% range and positions us to drive strong cash returns to our shareholders in the form of an industry leading dividend payout and strong share repurchases. Bottomline, we expect our performance in 2021 to be a great step toward achieving a 55% operating ratio, which is ultimately about enabling growth through efficiency and generating more cash. Before I turn it back to Lance, I'd like to add my thank you to our exceptional workforce. 2020 was a very difficult year and our employees really rose up against the adversity and showed us what is possible. So, with that, I'll turn it back to Lance. Okay. I'll start with that last one, Justin, in terms of the Q1. As you know, there's seasonality in our operating ratio and Q1 is generally our worst operating ratio of the year. And so my comments were on a year-over-year basis, not sequentially. Because that's -- that would be a very tough call to roll Q4 into Q1 when you think about the fact that you've got the inflation that comes in year one, first of the year in terms of inflation, health and welfare, payroll tax is starting up again. So that was a year-over-year comment. In terms of full year guidance, when we look at the 58.5%, we did have about 130 basis points that was attributable to fuel on a year-over-year basis and as we're looking forward, we're really not expecting any kind of a headwind or tailwind from fuel as part of that 150 basis points to 200 basis points of guidance into next year. You're right there were some unusual things that happened during the course of 2020. We did take some employee salary actions through the course of the year. We did that for about three months. We shut down some shop closures. So obviously those will be costs that will come back into the year that aren't going to be present on a year-over-year basis. But that's how we look at it and so when we're giving the 150 basis points to 100 -- excuse me, 150 basis points to 200 basis points, that's to the 58.5%, and obviously, you can make some adjustments to that to kind of set up what you see as a comparable. So, thanks, Jason, for that question. In terms of catch up, we still have probably a little bit higher cash balance that we're carrying today at the $1.8 billion. So that gives us, I think, a good strong start into the year. And then we'll see how the rest of the year plays out. Certainly, as we talk at our Analyst Day in May, we're going to outline probably some more specific plans around not only our long-term outlook of the business performance, but then how we're going to deploy that that cash to shareholders. So we'll probably talk more in May. Yeah. Thanks, Jason. Well, let me take that last part first. I mean, you've heard us say, Scott, that while we have the 55% target out there that we're still moving towards. We've not said that that's an absolute endpoint. We still see opportunities ahead of us to continue to improve the efficiency. You've heard, Eric, talk through some of that and we're very bullish. We're -- we think there's lots of opportunities ahead. So, again, those will be things that we talked more about in May. In terms of the statement about fourth quarter being a predication in terms of what our full year is going to be, I absolutely appreciate that optimism and confidence, and we feel very confident ourselves. But as you know, there's a lot of puts and takes and there's variations. We did have a bit of a help from fuel in 2020 that we're not expecting in 2021. But it really is rooted in those three guidance levels that we gave you in terms of our volume, our pricing and productivity, if we can outperform on any of those categories versus our outlook today that would be upside certainly. Yeah. And you also asked about the labor side, we're not giving specific labor cost inflation. If you -- if you're talking about kind of where we've seen that elevated cost per employee, we do expect that to continue. We're going to continue to manage the workforce very tightly and we think that's the right decision overall to make. Yeah. Thanks, Scott. Yeah. Bascome, this is Jennifer. I would say that we have not changed our enthusiasm around that. And if anything, I think is we're continuing to find ways to not only build train length, but combine the different types of traffic that are moving on our train. That gives us further opportunity to do that. So those are things that were definitely have been doing and we will continue to do and I think it drives very favorable results as you saw in the fourth quarter. Let me start with the OR question and then I'll turn it over to Eric to talk to you about sidings. So my commentary is that, we are going to have a little bit tougher comparison here in the first quarter, and again, I'm talking year-over-year, just because of the mix headwinds that we're facing. Not saying that we can improve it. Just saying that you need to take into that that mix headwinds as you're looking at the calculus with the down industrial volumes, particularly less crude oil, but hopefully, we're continuing to see strong grain and that will help and you saw what green certainly did in terms of helping that business mix profile in the fourth quarter. So that was my commentary, Ken. Yeah. And I think it's important to note that in the 29 [ph] that we -- roughly that we spent in 2020 and we're going to spend again there in 2021. We're making investments for growth in there. That's not all maintenance CapEx and you think about some of the investments that we're doing in the terminals and intermodal facilities in Chicago, in Houston, that's going to support growth. So I think you need to keep that in mind too. Going back to your question on D&A being flat? I guess I'm not sure if you're asking that. Were you asking that in terms of how do we do that in 2020? How are we doing that in 2021? Could you maybe clarify that a little bit? D&A, I'm sorry. Can't help. Sorry, I thought you said, G&A. Depreciation expense, so as you know, we do studies every year in terms of looking at some rail life and I think we've got a little bit of favorable news there on rail and that's helping us out a little bit on the depreciation side. Yeah. And Walter, just to quickly kind of put a bow on it. I mean, I think, that's what you're touching on is what we see as the great leverage and great opportunity that's ahead of us is to grow in a less capital intensive manner over the next period of time. When you think about the locomotive assets that we can deploy, the freight cars, the track capacity, the ability to redeploy terminals if we need to, I mean, those are all great new storage for us to the extent that we start deploying those assets and we see a future where we will be deploying those assets. I think that's the real value and the leverage that we have ahead of us. Yeah. Jordan, I think, you're thinking of it right. So if we think about revenue per unit or arc, just flat revenue in the first quarter, you heard us say that we're looking at low single-digit growth on a volume standpoint. But we are going to continue to have a pretty strong fuel headwind in the first quarter as we did through much of 2020. Right now we're paying call it a $60 or so a gallon for fuel. I think we paid close to a $90 in the first quarter of last year. So just that fuel surcharge revenue is going to be a driver there in terms of the revenue per unit, you all see that and then obviously the mix. With the industrial car loadings continuing to be down, that's our highest average revenue per car unit type of business and so that creates a headwind. We're bullish on the grain and feel good about that. So, we'll look to move as much of that as we possibly can. But there is going to be [Technical Difficulty]. I think as you also talk the second half to the second and third quarters, we have opportunities. Kenny talks about an improving price environment. You're going to have that headwind abate relative to the year-over-year fuel change and then if we can get some growth on an industrial side, that could be great news as well. Yeah. I mean, again, as you know, there's mix within mix. So within intermodal, you have both international and domestic, and there are differences there and then as part of that premium group, overall, automotive is in there. And automotive obviously is a big part of that, when you see those volumes down year-over-year and intermodal growing."

            "name": "Kenny Rocker",
            "content": "Thank you, Eric, and good morning. Today I'm pleased to report our fourth quarter results as our volume was up 3%. The fourth quarter ended strong with December posting the highest seven-day carloaded month in 2020. Solid gains in our premium business grew during the quarter were partially offset by declines in our industrial market. Freight revenue was down 1% for the quarter, as our increase in volume was offset by lower fuel and a negative mix -- business mix. So let's take a closer look at how the fourth quarter performed for each of our business groups. Starting with bulk, revenue for the quarter was up 1% on flat volume and a 1% increase in average revenue per car. Coal and renewable carloads were down 16% as a result of continued high customer inventory levels, lower export demand and a mild start to winner. Volume for grain and grain products was up 20%, driven by increased demand for export grain. Fertilizer and sulfur carloads were down 2% due to less export potash shipment, which was partially offset by strong industrial sulfur and domestic fertilizer shipments. And finally, food and refrigerated volume was up 7% due primarily to strong beverage shipments in the quarter. Moving on to industrial. Industrial revenue declined 7% from a 6% decrease in volume. Average revenue per car also declined 2% due to lower fuel surcharge and negative mix. Energy and specialized shipments decreased 16%, primarily driven by reduced petroleum shipments due to low oil prices and reduced demand. Forest product volume grew by 11%. Strength in lumber was driven by strong housing start, along with an increase in repair and remodel. We also saw strength in brown paper, driven by increased box demand and low inventory. Industrial chemicals and plastic shipments were flat for the quarter. Lower industrial chemicals volume was offset by growth in plastics from increased production and improved operating rates. Domestic plastic demand for food packaging and medical supplies remain strong. Metals and minerals volume was down 7%, primarily driven by market softness in rock and reduced frac sand shipments associated with the decline in oil prices and surplus local sands. Turning now to premium. Revenue for the quarter was up 5% on a 9% increase in volume, average revenue per car declined by 4%, reflecting the mix impact from increased intermodal shipments. Automotive volume was down 3% for the quarter. Finished vehicle shipments were flat, highlighting continued recovery in demand and strong inventory restocking. Shipments of auto parts were down 5%, mostly due to COVID-related disruptions, causing supply chain shortages apart. Intermodal volume increased by 12% year-over-year, driven by continued strength in domestic truckload and parcel shipments. Despite the pandemic, retail sales increase throughout the quarter and we continue to see the ecommerce footprint grow as a percentage of total sales. Now looking ahead to 2021, as we put together our plan for the year, we start with the key economic indicators that drive our business, as illustrated on slide 12. We're keeping a close eye on the economic forecast. As you know, there has been some volatility in recent months with the timing of the recovery, largely push into the second half of 2021. But the latest economic assumptions released in January, show more bullish outlook in some markets. While our goal is to outpace the market, there are still some pieces of our business that will continue to be adversely impacted by external factors. The piece we're watching most closely is the industrial economy, which is still expected to be weak year-over-year in the first quarter. Looking more closely at our three business teams, for our bulk commodities, we expect a continued negative outlook for coal in 2021. Electricity demand and natural gas prices are forecasted to improve. However, high customer inventory levels entering the year combined with an increased demand for other energy sources and a contract loss presents a challenging market. As always, weather conditions will be a key factor of demand. All in, we see lower year-over-year coal volumes, reducing total company carloading by roughly 1%. However, there is continued strength for export grain, as China remains committed to incremental ag product purchases in the 2021 calendar year, with clearly a tougher year-over-year comparison in the back half of the year. We also are optimistic with our biofuel shipments, a domestic production is expected to increase which will drive new volume at new UP destination facilities of renewable diesel feedstocks and finished products. Looking at our industrial commodities, energy comp for the first quarter will continue to be challenged and beyond the first quarter, there is uncertainty. However, our diverse portfolio, improved service product and ability to compete will drive growth. In addition, we're encouraged with the sequential improvements we're seeing for industrial production and a projection for growth in the second half. This improvement along with growth in plastic shipments should be a positive for us in 2021. And lastly, for premium, we expect strong uplift in both our automotive and intermodal businesses. Automotive sales are forecasted to increase from 14 million units in 2020 to closer to 16 million in 2021. A continuing benefit from vehicle inventory restocking efforts, plus recent win to convert finished vehicles and auto parts shipments from over-the-road truck will further bolster UP's automotive business. Retail inventories remain relatively low and truck utilization is expected to remain high in 2021. Retail inventory restocking along with continued strengthened retail sales and a tighter trucks supply should drive domestic intermodal volumes higher in the year. Our premium business will benefit from the new Twin Cities intermodal terminal, which Eric mentioned earlier. We're starting out small with current capacity of roughly 20,000 loads and future plans to build out to over five times that. We're excited to see that this new terminal has already started to receive loaded containers from Los Angeles in the first week of January. Furthermore, we continue to pursue additional expansion opportunity to penetrate the market. In summary, I'm proud of our commercial team. They did a fabulous job in 2020 to stay close to customers and win new business. As we began 2021, I'm excited about the opportunities we have in the pipeline to grow with customers and penetrate new markets. With that, I'll turn it over to Jennifer to review our financial performance. I'll add there, we've been working really closely with our customers and they have recognized that as the product comes through our line, that that service product has improved. So Eric talked about the whole supply chain. Yeah, we've seen some puts and takes in terms of chassis supply and that sort of thing. But once that is on our network, Eric and his team are really performing. Yeah. Let me just take a step back and highlight a few comments that I made earlier this morning in terms of the challenges on the energy side and highlights the fact that, hey, maybe we'd be at that 5% to 7% range, if you pulled out the coal that we acknowledged. Having said all that, on the international intermodal side, we said this publicly, we stated that we've had a pretty significant win in the second half of the year, we're expecting that to continue to ramp on. We also have been encouraged by as the supply chain itself settles down that we should we believe we'll see more of those international boxes moved to a on dock type scenario versus being transported. So, on the international side, if the trade opens up, as consumer spending gets better, we would expect that that volume would increase. And as I stated earlier, the service product in that area has really improved and even as we sit today, it's a very strong service product. So, first off, I just want to say that all starts with our service product, which allows us to really go out and compete and price to the marketplace, and so we're excited about the service product and where it is. Having said that, we're in January. We're in the early part of bid season. We've gone through 15% to 20% of the bids out there. And what I would tell you is that, based on the tight supply, based on the tight market, there is a somewhat favorable opportunity for us in product in terms of that environment. We'd much rather be in this environment than the loop environments you've heard us talk about in \u201819 and first part of the \u201820. So we'll see how it plays. We'll have a little bit more clarity as we get through our bid season. But right now, it appears to be a favorable environment. Yeah. There's -- believe or not, there is a lot to unpack here. Let me take the surcharges first. So, first of all, those surcharges were in place for our customers that are in our MCP program. So I want to clarify that. We have a program where customers receive containers and we want to make sure those customers under that program receive those containers. During peak season, we ran into a scenario where we wanted to make sure those customers received them because of the high demand. Demand is tight right now, but it's not as tight as it was in the peak season. So we've removed those surcharges and we want to go out there and grow. Let me pivot to another part of your comments around the congestion and just really break down what we're seeing in the marketplaces. A lot of the containers are coming off the water. Some of them are going on dock to buy rail, when I talked about that service product in great. Other parts of that business is going into warehouses out there and what you're seeing is some of those containers are out there, they are not turning some of the chassis they're not turning that's where that can shift and then the supply chain is going off. We're working with customer very closely. Eric is working with customers very closely. We've made some changes to our accessorial charges to really incentivize and make sure that all customers in our supply chain get the service product. But again, as I stated, once we saw Union Pacific we've done a just a fabulous job of executing that service product. Yeah. I appreciate that question. I tell you what, if you look at our network today, I'm glad you asked it, because we haven't talked about it quite a bit. But we have 11 rail ports that are out there. You look at the major terminal like, whether it's Los Angeles, whether that's Houston, whether it's Dallas, even if you look at the Chicago area. We already have rail ports in those major areas that we align, trying to take trucks off the road and complement it with the intermodal network or carload network for that matter. So we're doing that today. I don't want anyone to leave with the impression that that's not occurring today. There are more opportunities for us to go out there and be aggressive and you're seeing some of that with the Twin Cities intermodal terminal. Yeah. That's a great question. And I'll tell you, we have a number of commodities that will grow and we still have to compete. We still have to go out there and compete against trucks and other modes to go out there and win that business. We have good line of sight of those. We feel good about it. I like your word choice of culturally. I'll tell you our teams were very excited about where we are. We've changed our compensation program, so that we can motivate the sales team to go out there and win. We want to make sure that they are spending their energy and focus on carload growth. And I can tell you that the leadership team here at the table with me, we're all supportive and they're all committed to that carload growth. I'd be remiss if I didn't say we had really good clarity on what those goals are transparency, on what it's like to win and really clear metrics that support growth. But behind it, we have things like ensuring that there's good, not necessarily margins, but that we're winning with the right kind of margins and we've achieved the right kind of price. So it's all baked in there to just motivate the team and we expect that to be a great cultural change... ...for us. Yeah. I would tell you, we certainly want to take advantage of it from a commercial standpoint to go out there and make it easier for customers to do business with us with again pointing towards growth. So, yes, we have a number of visibility tools that our customers are using, so they can see what's coming to them at their plant either on the UP or offline. We've certainly talked about the usage of API's before and it's opened up markets for us and I mean, literally, we've been able to go out there and win business with having API's in our tool kit. Again, we've done a great job of expanding that customer engagement with the API capabilities. I've been encouraged to Lance's comments with Rahul coming on Board. And he really have a vision for helping us remove pain points that the customer might have through IT. And then lastly, just to set up, Eric here, from a visibility standpoint, we certainly utilize technology to see what's common to us. So a good example of that is, the containers that are heading into the West Coast port. We have a better handle and more clarity now of what at the port, what's coming to the point port and we utilize that to leverage to come up with a good strong solid service product. Now, those are a couple good questions, Cherilyn. I appreciate that. You know right now we're kind of in the early innings and so what I tell you is that for this quarter, Jennifer mentioned that, and it's still pretty early innings and but it looks like grain in the near-term will hold up. And so we'll have to see. We're working with our customers very closely to get forecasts on that. I'll tell you, though, in the back half of the year, the comps get a lot tougher. However, that will still be a very strong 2021. So you want to keep that in perspective. I think the back -- last part of your question is just around inventory. We feel good about the fact that there's still quite a bit of grain out there. We've saw the grain inventory decrease about 10% year-over-year. We're expecting a pretty strong crop. With that, we feel good about that demand being sustained. So, Eric, and his team will deliver that and our commercial team will then engage to maximize as many shuttles as we can get. That's right on Lance. I mean, you got that dynamic. Some of our customers have talked about -- talk to us about Brazil and whether or not there's a drought down there that might impact the demand. But I can tell you, we're focused on executing and getting as much grain business as we can export out of the country if we can. Yeah. So thanks for bringing that up. First of all, we've been encouraged by the fact that, that Mexico business, we've got a significant percentage of that tied to the automotive network and we're seeing that comeback, which is encouraging to us. We're also seeing some areas like the Mexico Energy Reform, the combat area or pipeline for growth for us. As I look at some of the wins that we've had, to Lance's comments around that truck business, really Mexico as an area where we have to go after and grow the pieces of business that were over the road that we haven't won before. So we are encouraged about Mexico. At the same time, if you look at it as a whole, Mexico is still under penetrated, once you walk out thought of that automotive network and so we've been working with customers and supply chain partners to see what we can do to untap some of those markets. So we're pretty encouraged about Mexico and what it has both for 2021 and long-term."

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you. Mr. Fritz, you may now begin.\nLance Fritz: And thank you, Rob. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to Union Pacific's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me today in Omaha are Jim Vena, Chief Operating Officer; Kenny Rocker, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; and Jennifer Hamann, Chief Financial Officer. As I'm sure, you all saw on Tuesday, we announced a transition that will take place in our operating department. Jim Vena will be transitioning his responsibilities over to Eric Gehringer at the beginning of the year, while staying on until the end of June as a senior adviser. I'm excited to have Eric lead our operating department into the future. Eric has a track record of success at our company and will push the team to continue to think boldly as we pursue operational excellence. I want to express my deep appreciation to Jim for the leadership he brought to Union Pacific. Jim accomplished everything I could have hoped for and more. He brought a level of expertise and speed of decision-making that has been critical to our transformation. I'm very pleased that he's going to continue working closely with Eric and the rest of the team over the next several months to guide us through a smooth transition. while seeing some key projects to completion. Thank you very much. Jim. Before discussing our third quarter results, I want to acknowledge the work of our dedicated employees. As we continue to operate our railroad through the pandemic, the women and men of Union Pacific are doing an excellent job keeping themselves and their families safe. As a result, they are able to provide our customers with a service product that is fluid and uninterrupted. Our rail network continues to operate at a very high level, reflecting the talent, commitment, and resilience of our Union Pacific team. Moving to third quarter results. This morning, Union Pacific is reporting 2020 third quarter net income of $1.4 billion or $2.01 per share. This compares to $1.6 billion or $2.22 per share in the third quarter of 2019. Our quarterly operating ratio came in at 58.7% an all-time quarterly record and an 80 basis point improvement compared to the third quarter of 2019, despite moving 4% fewer carloads. Our third quarter results represent another step in our company's transformation. We demonstrated our ability to adjust to a sharp rebound in volume, while continuing to provide a safe, efficient and reliable service product to our customers. The results we are delivering both operationally and financially deepen our conviction that the changes we're making to transform our railroad are on track and on target. So with that, I'll turn it over to Jim to provide an operations update.\nJim Vena: Thanks, Lance, and good morning, everyone. We had an impressive quarter to turn in the results you see today. We had to watch our asset utilization closely as we dealt with a sharp volume increase following the equally sharp volume decline of the second quarter, as we continue to navigate the pandemic. And we have had some significant weather events in this quarter as well. In the face of those challenges, the team delivered strong productivity gains to the tune of $205 million and a total of $610 million year-to-date, all in all a very strong quarter for the entire operating team. Turning to slide 4, I'd like to update you on our key performance indicators. Driven by the team's relentless focus on asset utilization and reducing car touches, freight car velocity and freight car terminal dwell both improved 3%. These improvements along with increased train length, which we'll talk more about on the next slide demonstrate how our operating model is striking the right balance between service and efficiency. We continue to adjust our transportation plan to run a more efficient network that requires fewer locomotives. In the third quarter, we achieved a quarterly record in locomotive productivity, an 11% improvement versus last year, which is all the more impressive when you consider the mix challenge of trading coal and sand volumes for intermodal volumes. Workforce productivity also a quarterly record improved 13% from third quarter 2019. Productivity improvements were led by the train and engine workforce down 22% versus last year, which significantly outpace the 4% volume decline. Our manifest service remained strong during the quarter driving a 5-point improvement in trip plant compliance for manifest and autos. Intermodal trip plant compliance decreased in the quarter, reflecting the impact seen across the entire intermodal supply chain from the sharp West Coast volume increase. Although, we positioned the equipment near the L.A. Basin in anticipation of a surge the resulting imbalances following the first wave of the freight as well as the sharp uptick in demand for both TE&Y and terminal employees took a few weeks to work through the network. But the team responded quickly with resources and transportation plan changes, enabling us to exit the quarter with intermodal trip plan compliance back in the low to mid-80s. Our results have been strong this year, and we expect to see continued improvement in the fourth quarter. Slide 5 highlights some of our recent network changes. Our focus on increasing train length and handling traffic efficiently remains strong. We were able to absorb the majority of the sequential volume increase by adding traffic to our existing train network. Compared to the fourth quarter 2018, when we first began implementing our version of precision scheduled railroading we have increased train length across our system by 28% or 1950 feet to approximately 9,000 feet in third quarter of 2020. We've completed 28 15,000-foot sidings through the third quarter allowing longer trains to run in both directions and reduced the number of train starts. We plan to have another eight sidings completed by the end of 2020. We recently curtailed operations at the East Hump in our North Platte Nebraska yard. This location was unique in that, it previously had two humps. Going forward, the cars will either be processed at the still active west hump or flat switched. The redesign of our operations in Chicago and Houston remains on track. Chicago intermodal consolidation is set to be complete by year-end. We are also making progress in Houston to consolidate our intermodal facilities into one location to expand, switching capability and improve our ability to run longer trains out of the Inglewood yard. Finally, we continue to make organizational changes to better align resources and responsibilities. During the quarter, we took an additional workforce reduction in the operating department and also integrated intermodal operations into the transportation department. We will continue to seek efficiency in all facets of what we do and there remain many more opportunities ahead of us. To wrap-up, we remain committed to protecting our employee's health and safety and providing strong service to our customers. We will continue to make structural changes to improve operational performance and efficiency. The changes we're making in Chicago and Houston will drive continued improvements in our intermodal service product allowing us to be more competitive in those markets. We have made great progress in transforming our operations to this point. Our focus is unwavering, as we will continue to improve safety service asset utilization and network efficiency in order to provide customers with a service product that is competitive and provides value. Before I turn it over to Kenny, I want to make a few comments on Tuesday's announcement. I'm very proud of what we've accomplished during my time at Union Pacific. Really the results speak for themselves. We've got the leadership team and culture and a great place to continue to flourish and Eric is the right person to lead the team. He's a very talented railroader and brings a great skill set to the position. I know he'll continue to challenge the team to be relentless in their pursuit of efficiency. I'm going to stick around for a bit longer to make sure the transition is smooth and some key projects are completed. I'm very confident that this team won't back off on the progress we've made or making to produce an industry-best product for our customers. With that, I'll turn it over to Kenny to provide an update on the business environment.\nKenny Rocker: Thank you, Jim and good morning. For the third quarter, our volume was down 4%, primarily due to declines in our industrial and bulk business groups. The decrease in volume coupled with a 7% decline in average revenue per car drove freight revenue to be down 11% in the quarter. Weak economic conditions related to the pandemic continue to impact multiple market segments but it was partially offset by stronger demand in the premium group. So, let's take a closer look at how the third quarter performed for each of our business groups. Starting with bulk, revenue for the quarter was down 12% on a 9% decrease in volume and a 3% decrease in average revenue per car. Coal and renewable carloads were down 21% as a result of weaker market conditions from low natural gas prices and soft export demand. Volume for grain and grain products was up 3% from an increased demand of export grain partially offset by pandemic-reduced demand for ethanol. Fertilizer and sulfur carloads were up 4% due to the stronger export potash, slightly offset by lower production of phosphate rock. Finally, food and refrigerated volume was flat and strong beverage shipments were offset by softer food service and restaurant demand. Moving on to industrial, industrial revenue declined 18% from a 16% decrease in volume. Average revenue per car also declined 2% due to a lower fuel surcharge and negative mix. Energy and specialized shipments decreased 20%, primarily driven by reduced petroleum shipments due to low oil prices coupled with weak demand. Forest products volume was flat. Growth in lumber shipment from improved housing starts and repair and remodels offset declines in paper shipments. Industrial chemicals and plastic shipments declined by 9% due to the pandemic-related impacts on both global and domestic demand. Industrial chemicals volume had the largest reduction as these carloads are closely tied to industrial production. Metals and minerals volumes decreased by 22% due to reduced sand shipments associated with the decline in oil prices and a surplus in local sand. Rock shipments were also reduced due to the pandemic-related impact on demand and project delays. Turning now to premium, revenue for the quarter was down 1% on a 5% increase in volume. Average revenue per car declined by 6%, reflecting a lower mix from increased intermodal shipments. Automotive volume was down 9% for the quarter. At the beginning of the quarter, most North American manufacturing plants have resumed production, but our run rates were about 15% below 2019. Production volumes steadily increased throughout the third quarter as dealers restocked inventory. Intermodal volume decreased by 9% year-over-year driven by strength in domestic truckload and parcel shipments as well as onboarding new international business. Despite the pandemic, sales for most retailers increased throughout the quarter. And not only did we see the footprint of e-commerce sales of total U.S. retail sales grow year-over-year, but more importantly, we saw our volume increase as a result of key business wins. As we enter the fourth quarter, you can see on slide 11 that our overall volume is currently up 4% year-over-year. Based on these run rates we'd expect year-over-year fourth quarter volumes to be up low single-digit. We expect premium volumes to remain strong similar to current run rates for the remainder of the year. Strength in e-commerce is likely to continue and volumes will be bolstered by inventory restocking as we enter peak holiday shopping season coupled with recent business development wins. For bulk, the coal market remains challenged as high inventory and weather conditions continue to be factors. However, we have a positive outlook for export grain due to China's continued purchases. Additionally, we expect to see continued strength in beer shipments and we could see modest growth in our food and refrigerated line if food service and restaurant demand improve. And lastly, for industrial, the potential for crew by rail remains largely uncertain. If oil prices remain depressed, then we anticipate continued year-over-year declines. But on a positive note, we are anticipating slow sequential quarterly improvements for most of our other markets. The outlook for housing starts remain positive and our improved service product is opening up new markets for us like some short-haul business that wouldn't have been so attractive to us in the past. This is just one example of how we're staying focused on things we can control. The team has done a fabulous job executing on our marketing initiatives to win new business and as Jim stated earlier, our service product continues to improve, which helps our customers compete in the marketplace. With that, I'll turn it over to Jennifer who's going to talk about our financial performance. \nJennifer Hamann: Thank you, Kenny and good morning. As you heard from Lance earlier, Union Pacific is reporting third quarter earnings per share of $2.01 and a quarterly operating ratio of 58.7% an all-time quarterly record and our first sub-59 quarter. Looking at our quarterly income statement, operating revenue totaled $4.9 billion down 11% versus last year on a 4% year-over-year volume decline demonstrating our consistent ability to adjust cost with volume, operating expense decreased 12% to $2.9 billion. Taken together we are reporting third quarter operating income of $2 billion, a 9% decrease versus 2019. Other income of $37 million was down $16 million versus last year as a result of lower interest income as well as less rental income. Interest expense increased 11% due to increased debt levels and costs associated with our recent debt exchange. Income tax expense was lower, down 12% as a result of lower pretax quarterly income. Net income of $1.4 billion, declined 12% versus last year, which combined with share repurchases led to a 9% decrease in earnings per share to $2.01. As I just mentioned, our 58.7% operating ratio was 80 basis points better year-over-year. Lower fuel prices had a 100 basis point positive impact on the operating ratio while fuel surcharge lag negatively impacted earnings per share by $0.03. Turning now to slide 14, which provides a breakdown of our freight revenue, totaling $4.6 billion, down 11% versus 2019. The primary contributor to the year-over-year decline was a 4% decrease in carloadings, a substantial improvement from the second quarter, but still in negative territory. Lower diesel fuel prices, down 35% year-over-year impacted revenue by 3.5 points. Positive, core pricing gains were more than offset by our business mix, reducing revenue 3.25 points. Although we continue to yield pricing dollars in excess of inflation, revenues were impacted by moving more business at a lower average revenue per car, something we commonly refer to as negative mix. A 9% increase in intermodal combined with industrial volume declines, which included the continued falloff in sand and crude carloads were strong contributors to that negative mix. Now let's move on to slide 15, which provides a summary of our third quarter operating expenses. As you heard Jim discuss, we did a great job operationally in the quarter adjusting to that sharp rebound in traffic. And at the same time, we're very effective controlling costs. If you look at the individual expense lines, comp and benefits expense decreased 11% year-over-year, as we offset wage inflation and higher severance cost through lower force counts. Third quarter workforce levels declined 18% or about 6,500 full-time equivalents versus last year, while sequentially increasing by fewer than 100. Our train and engine workforce continues to be more than volume variable down 22%, while management, engineering and mechanical workforces together decreased 14% with a portion of those reductions related to fewer capital employees. Quarterly fuel expense decreased 40% as a result of the significantly lower diesel fuel prices and lower volumes. Third quarter consumption rate increased slightly versus 2019, reflecting the mix impact of running fewer heavy-haul bulk shipments. Purchased services and materials expense declined 11% in the quarter, as we continue to use our locomotive fleet more productively. In addition, our loop subsidiary incurred less drayage expense versus last year with fewer auto shipments. Equipment and other rents fell 8% in the quarter despite mix pressure in this category related to increased intermodal shipments. However, freight car and locomotive productivity efforts more than offset that headwind, driving car hire savings and lower lease expense. Other expense was our only cost category that increased year-over-year, up 8% in the quarter, driven by $17 million of higher state and local taxes. We still expect this cost category to be up around 5% on a full year basis, in line with prior guidance. Looking now at productivity. As discussed during our second quarter call, the game plan was to leverage sequential volumes against our smaller cost structure, while maintaining a high level of service. And based on our results, I'd say we did just that. We continued our trend of generating strong net productivity, with the third quarter coming in at $205 million. The operating department's continued progress on train length initiatives, balanced with an improved service product and more efficient use of our workforce and locomotives, led those productivity gains. In addition, all areas of the company continue to control spending, as well as look for ways to do more with less. Our year-to-date net productivity of $610 million already exceeds both our expectations for 2020, as well as the impressive $590 million of net productivity, we achieved for the full year 2019. As we look to the fourth quarter, understanding that we do have a difficult comparison against last year's fourth quarter, we now expect full year 2020 net productivity to exceed $700 million or $1.3 billion over the last two years. This strong productivity is evident in our record quarterly operating ratio of 58.7%. Using the same barometer as past quarters for evaluating cost variability, year-over-year third quarter expenses were 180% volume variable on a fuel adjusted basis. Sequentially, as third quarter volumes increased 19% from the second quarter, fuel adjusted operating expenses only increased 11%. Moving on to cash and liquidity. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Union Pacific has been in a position of strength with our cash generation liquidity and balance sheet. Year-to-date cash from operations decreased only 4% versus 2019 to $6 billion despite a 12% decrease in net income. Free cash flow after capital investments totaled nearly $3.7 billion, resulting in a 93% cash conversion rate. After payment of our industry-leading quarterly dividend, cash on hand at the end of the third quarter was $2.6 billion. As volumes have remained relatively steady in the 160,000 seven-day carloading range, we are moving to redeploy some of that cash. We resume share repurchases in early October and announced our plans for a $500 million par call on debt due in early 2021. We also plan to pay off an additional $300 million of incremental debt we assumed earlier this year for added liquidity. From a balance sheet perspective, we finished the quarter at an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.9 times, as we continue to maintain strong investment-grade credit ratings from both Standard & Poor's and Moody's. As we've said before, navigating through this pandemic has reinforced our conviction that maintaining a solid investment-grade credit rating is critical and is an essential element to our commitment to provide strong cash returns to our owners, which totaled nearly $5 billion at the end of September. Turning now to our outlook. You heard Kenny talk about the positive drivers we see in the marketplace and our expectation that fourth quarter volumes will be our first quarter with positive year-over-year growth in two years. Given this improved outlook, we now expect full year volumes to be down 7% or so. As I pointed out earlier, we expect productivity to exceed $700 million for full year 2020, and our long-standing pricing guidance is unchanged. We expect the total dollars generated from our pricing actions to exceed rail inflation costs. We are committed to making sure each piece of business we move is earning an adequate return and that we are being compensated for the value we are delivering in the marketplace. Our expectations for volume, price and productivity should produce a record 2020 operating ratio. In fact, we now expect the full year 2020 operating ratio to improve by roughly one point and start with a five. While the course we've charted in 2020 is certainly much different than expected when we laid out our original targets being able to achieve a sub-60 operating ratio in the heart of a pandemic is an impressive accomplishment for the entire Union Pacific team. In terms of cash generation and capital allocation, full year capital expenditures are still projected to come in around $2.9 billion, as we make good progress on our renewal and productivity investments. We will continue providing strong cash returns to our owners through our dividend and share repurchases. And longer-term, capital expenditures remain projected to be below 15% of revenue, a dividend payout ratio of 40% to 45% of earnings and ultimately achieving that 55% operating ratio remains a vision and objective for our company. Wrapping up, I'd like to express my appreciation to our exceptional employees, the job they've done this year to work safely, stay nimble and provide a quality service product for our customers while also improving productivity is truly remarkable. Our goal of operating the safest most efficient and most reliable railroad in North America is clearly achievable knowing we have the best people in the business. With that I'll turn it back to Lance. \nLance Fritz: Thank you, Jennifer. Our first priority has been and will always be safety. We have a continuous focus on improvement and I'm confident the team has the right plan and is taking the right actions to make Union Pacific a safer railroad going forward. Our service and financial results demonstrate the transformation of our company. We are a more efficient and a more reliable railroad that is driving value for our customers on the way to achieving operational excellence. Our enhanced service product coupled with a lower cost structure and innovative new services is opening up new markets and opportunities with our customers. And as you heard from Kenny today the team is winning by converting more business to rail our customers are reducing their carbon footprint to the tune of an estimated 16 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions so far this year as we move together toward a more sustainable future. Our optimism for the future has never been greater as Union Pacific is well positioned for a future of long-term growth and excellent returns. So with that let's open up the line for your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. \nKen Hoexter: Great, good morning. And Jim great job over the last few years and good luck in the future. Maybe for Lance or Jim I guess just starting off. Keeping your employees down 18% with volumes accelerating a great job in the quarter and great job in the OR but you saw some intermodal struggles as you mentioned. Maybe you could talk a little bit about the incremental margins going forward and your thought on the pace of expense returns as you move into 2021, just given Jen just talked about the kind of inflection into positive volumes for the first time in a while? Thanks. \nLance Fritz: Jim you want to talk about the expense side and then we'll convert it to the go-forward margins? \nJim Vena: Okay. So thanks Ken. I appreciate the question and thanks for saying a good two years not quite two years, but we've got a little bit of work left to do. So I'm looking forward to the next few months to really get this place going even better. So, on the intermodal and the expense side, I think we showed in the quarter how we can handle the business and be smart about how we handle the business. It is -- if we need to win we need to be able to look at things on a full supply chain view and that's what we did. And everybody knew that you cannot easily react without really disrupting the entire network when it comes to the intermodal volume that increased substantially. But I think the speed that we reacted and where our metrics are after was a great move. The expense will continue on a unit basis to be less purely because of the capital investments we've made in the network and the efficiency. We turn our locomotives way quicker, we turn our crews quicker, we turn our cars quicker, we handle the inspections quicker. We do so many things faster that we'll continue to build on that. So I don't see -- whatever business comes on I think we still will be able to improve our efficiency across the board. \nLance Fritz: Yes and building up that Ken from an incremental margin or go forward margin perspective, of course we continue to expect that we're going to improve our margins. The capital investments that Jim just outlined are going to be a support. And we're also looking with Kenny's team at an end-to-end view of our intermodal product, whether it's international intermodal or domestic intermodal. And those both give us an opportunity to margin up whether it's by efficiency in the chain or an opportunity for better pricing. \nKen Hoexter: Thanks Lance, thanks Jim. \nLance Fritz: Thanks Ken.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.\nJustin Long: Good morning. Jim I'll echo the congrats and wanted to ask about the announced transition. I think a lot of investors are wondering if this means the heavy lifting on PSR and productivity gains is complete. So could you just address that? Do you disagree with that view? And if so, can you talk about why now is the right time to make this transition versus sticking around for another year or 2? \nJim Vena: Okay. Well listen I appreciate the question. So let me take it back to when I came on at Union Pacific. Lance and I sat down and we talked about what we needed to do and how I could help the team and -- at UP to drive the productivity that they already had in mind. It wasn't -- I think everybody in Union Pacific realized that listen there's an opportunity to become more efficient and be able to have a great service product and win in the marketplace. So those goals were there. And I was really -- it was refreshing to hear Lance and Rob we were all in the same room together talk about how we wanted to become the leader in the industry when it came to efficiency, operational efficiency and service excellence. So you build on that. I committed when I came on the 18 to 24 months. I could have stayed longer. I could have stayed shorter. There was nothing that was tying me into the company. But my job was to build the foundation of operational group that understood what was possible and what we could deliver. And I think that's what I've done. And I'm very comfortable that Eric is the right person to lead it. Let's just put this right down to is he Jim Vena? No he's not Jim Vena. And I'm not -- if you compare me to some of the other people that have led companies operationally, I'm not the same person. I think we've done a great job of not causing a lot of pain to our customers. In other situations people have done that. So we've been measured. Eric is the right guy. He's got the right background. He's got the right skill level. I like the way his mind works. He sees things quick. So I'm very confident that we've got that right. But below that and I'm disappointed in that we -- because of COVID we could not get everybody into CR team operationally whether it's Tom in the North or David Giandinoto in the South or John Turner very bright person, okay, or it's Hunt Cary. We've got a team of railroaders. And as you all know I've been railroading for a while that I'm very confident they understand what we're doing and they will deliver. Now I'm going to be around and I'll be honest if they make a slip up. I don't care whether I'm gone or not I will be phoning them okay? And asking them what the heck they're doing and I'll keep the heat on it. The worst thing we can do and the true measure of a leader is that, when you depart the team understands what's supposed to happen and you go out there and deliver. Two more points on that. One is, is I spent a lot of time with people at different levels in the company. And I've spent probably 20 days in the last three months putting on sessions with frontline supervisors that try to drive the decision-making have the right culture. And I'll continue to do that till the end of the year and some into the New Year. So I'm very confident that we've got the right team. And let me answer that last piece. What's left? Well, locomotives are going to be way more productive. Our train length, I see 10,000 feet, okay? I see our car freight velocity up another 5% or 10%. So I think that we are just starting. The mechanisms, the measures, the culture is all there to succeed. And I am not worried about it. And I am going to keep my Union Pacific stock. I'm not going to go out there and sell it because I'm very confident that we're going to do the right thing. So Justin, I hope -- a long answer and I apologize, but I just wanted to make sure I put it all on the table. \nJustin Long: That's very helpful. Very helpful insights. I appreciate the time.\nJim Vena: Thanks, Justin.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Jim, congratulations on the last, I guess, sub two years. Maybe one more for you before you head out into the new role and keeping an eye on things from afar. Look at all the buckets of productivity and the success you've had including this quarter, it is slowing down a little bit, but one area where we haven't seen as much improvement is really on fuel economy. You've got record train lengths that are going up. You've got locomotive productivity that's at all-time high newer fleets. So I know mix is an issue grade and topography is an issue, but some of your peers have been able to move the needle a bit more on that front and we haven't quite seen that yet from UP, in fact, going up a little bit in terms of consumption this quarter. So maybe you can help conceptualize or even quantify what that opportunity looks like? And if that's one of the big buckets you see left for the team as you step more into an advisory role? Thank you. \nJim Vena: So let me answer it backwards. Yes, it's a bucket that we see and it is a substantial bucket on an expense side that we think that we've got the right plan in. The number you see if you peel back the mix issue, this last quarter we had over 4% improvement in our fuel use on a GTM basis if you look underneath. Now that's masked with the change in the type of trains that we're running and the volume, but I'm very comfortable that we have the right process in place that we continue to drop. I don't think we're going to get 4% every quarter. But the best way to look at it is -- is if we put more on the same number of trains, with the same number of locomotives that we had before and that's what we're doing on an average number of horsepower per train and we're able to build the trains to what our capacity is we will continue to see that fuel productivity number improve. Are we going to be the best in the industry? No. There's some advantages for railroad I used to work at. Their mainline grade is pretty -- is weighed at about half of ours. So we're going to burn a little more fuel to get over some of those mountains getting out to the West Coast. But at the end of the day, we have a lot of advantages on how we can turn and use the fuel and we've spent money on technology, continue to -- so that the locomotives and the -- locomotive engineers are better at understanding how they operate and I see us continuing to get that. The mix turns -- Eric is probably going to get maybe a mix turn down the road and everybody will say he's brilliant on saving the fuel. So -- so I'm very comfortable. \nBrian Ossenbeck: I have actually -- have that one. All right. Thanks, Jim.\nJim Vena: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nAllison Landry: Thanks. Good morning. So just thinking about the fact that volumes are recovering in addition to the higher productivity gains that you're now looking for this year. Just as you think forward, would you expect to see a step function improvement in the OR in 2021 as volumes allow you to more fully realize the benefits of PSR? So maybe just some thoughts on that. I can appreciate you're not giving next year's guidance, but also if you could quickly address at what point do you think you can achieve the 55% OR? Thank you. \nLance Fritz: Yes, I'll start and ask Jennifer to back me up Allison. This is Lance. Good morning. So the moving parts as we look into next year, we do expect volumes to be better. Of course, it won't be hard to do that against the pandemic. And it's hard for us to gauge exactly how much better. But that will be a help. Productivity is going to continue. That will be a help. We haven't nailed down that target, but it's going to be healthy. And we've got plenty of initiatives moving into next year that we'll keep a shoulder into. Mix is a real big question mark. I don't see much reason to change our current mix experience until the industrial economy really starts recovering a little bit quicker and with more strength than we've seen so far post our trough in May. So that's the biggest question mark, I think, that will dictate just how much margin improvement we are able to attain next year. Jennifer?\nJennifer Hamann: Yes, Allison thanks for the question. You've heard us say many times the drivers of our performance are what Lance just laid out its volume, productivity and then the price piece. So we're encouraged by what you're seeing in the truck markets today and with the service product that we've got out there and all the work that Kenny and his team are doing. But we're still working through our plans for 2021, but we have every expectation that we've got a great road map ahead of us where we can continue to improve. We'll give you obviously more detail around that when we talk to you in January. And our hope is sometime next year we should be able to gather everyone as we were hoping to do in the fall of this year and with a little more certainty on what's going on with the economy and the pandemic be able to lay out for you guys kind of a multiyear plan that we see for ourselves and how we look to continue to make improvement and go to the 55% OR.\nAllison Landry: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. \nLance Fritz: Yes.\nJennifer Hamann: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Seidl: Thank you, operator. Good morning, Lance and Jim. Jim, congratulations on the retirement 2.0 there. I'm still looking -- wondering when it was going to come. \nJim Vena: Thank you. \nJason Seidl: I want to concentrate everyone a little bit on mix on intermodal because clearly the surge to the West Coast has been somewhat aided by restocking efforts that are likely to continue at least in the near future, but at some point that will abate. So how should we think about the mix between international business and more domestic business for 2021 and the impacts on the arc? \nLance Fritz: Kenny?\nKenny Rocker: Yes. So thanks for that question, Jason. First of all, I would just say that controlling what we can't control we're going to go out there and win as much business as we can in all those markets. And this year we've been able to do that. We've been able to grow our e-commerce business. We've got a great service product that Jim and the team has provided us. On the international side, we talked about an international win. And even on our domestic truckload side, we've been able to go out there and win new business. We have seen a little bit more of our international business transloaded into some of the West Coast ports. That just means that we have to compete on the domestic side, which I've said, we've been able to do. So regardless of how that product comes in, we've inserted a lot of technology with our customers to go out and win business, whether it's APIs that see the business coming from Asia, whether it's our ITR business to give great visibility to our customers on when their business will move. We feel like we've got a really strong domestic product to go out there and compete. And we've also won quite a bit on the international side.\nJason Seidl: Right. But Kenny, if it does slow down, should we expect a change in the arc for 2021 on the restocking side?\nJennifer Hamann: What specifically slows down Jason?\nJason Seidl: So the restocking efforts that we've seen in all the massive surge that West Coast supports lately. \nLance Fritz: Yes. So, Jason, this is Lance. I get what you're asking. So part of what we're seeing in domestic strength is a restocking, because we can see that in the data as well, right? Inventory is relatively down. Sales are up and the inventory sales ratio is below where I think retailers traditionally would like it to be. So as we look into next year, some amount of that destocking probably drops off a bit. It's hard to say just exactly what happens in impact on mix and overall arc as that's occurring. One thing that is likely to occur as we go into next year would be, the surcharges dropping off in the L.A. Basin and up in the PNW, but those are really asterisks right now in terms of the overall yield that we're reporting. They're helpful, but very marginal.\nKenny Rocker: Yes. The only thing I'll add to that is, if you look at the data, the retail sales have actually improved sequentially. So there is a pull element to the demand. And the inventory that they sit today, they're lower than they were in 2019. So they're still lower inventory. And then you think about that e-commerce business, I believe that there is a structural change out there with the consumer preference that there's going to be more e-commerce there that fits very nicely with our service product.\nLance Fritz: And that parcel business is very attractive to us.\nJennifer Hamann: Yes. I mean, we're just starting to get into the bid season for next year, Jason. And I think maybe that's part of your question too, in terms of if that truck market stays tight, we think that's a great opportunity for us, particularly with the service product that we've got to offer right now.\nJason Seidl: Okay. Well, looks fantastic. I appreciate the time, as always, everyone.\nLance Fritz: Yes. Thank you, Jason.\nJennifer Hamann: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking my question. Lance, I guess, in response to a previous question about intermodal, you said we're going to look to margin up in the future. But it's interesting here, because if I look north of the border since you guys peaked on volumes, go back more than a decade, we've seen greater than like 80% expansion in intermodal volume on the Canadian networks, or at least one of your competitors. It's been roughly flat for you guys over that same time period. And I know you've gone through a lot of mix shift in the network, but what can you tell your investors? Is the strategy here to continue to focus on margin above growth? I keep hearing you guys talk about a service product that's competitive, is now the time to focus a lot more on top line? And what strategies can you take? Can you be more proactive at the ports, because we've definitely seen a shift from U.S. West Coast up North to Canada?\nLance Fritz: Yes, Brandon. Thank you and that's a great series of questions. So the fundamental difference today versus 10 years ago is our service product is much, much better. It's much more reliable. We're actually doing what we say we're going to do. And we can see that very clearly in our KPIs when we break out the premium, the intermodal and automotive car trip plan compliance. And over 10 years that metric has actually gotten harder to achieve. So we're measuring ourselves through a harder metric and it's much higher in terms of absolute performance. Customers experience that. So the item number one is, we're positioned to be able to win business. Item number two is, we are not monolithic in terms of our focus. We want to grow. We know that growth volume is going to be a really important lever, as we continue to improve our operating ratio going forward and so is price and so is efficiency. And we think we can achieve all at the same time. And item number three, Brandon, a little bit of a proof statement that has been completely masked by the pandemic and its impact on the economy is in the last bid cycle, in the last bid season we were successful at winning business. We increased our penetration through the BCO cycle on their bid season and Kenny mentioned one, we increased our exposure in the parcel world and we've done it across a number of other retailers. So as we look forward, Brandon, you've got it exactly right. We are positioned to be able to grow and we're holding ourselves accountable for greater growth than we've experienced in the last 10 years. We should be able to achieve that. \nKenny Rocker: Yes. The only thing I'll add to that also is that the team has done a great job of inserting product into our supply chain. So whether it's matchbacks in Dallas, whether it's reloads out of the Midwest, we're doing everything we can to make it sticky for our customers. We've worked with the port to get some really strong standards to get out of the port, working with Jim's team. I talked about the technology on the API side where we're working with our largest international carriers, so that we can have visibility to when they come in and instill confidence and trust in our service. So we're taking a active, very proactive approach to winning in those markets.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you.\nLance Fritz: Yeah. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Group: Hey. Thanks. Good morning guys. So Jennifer, comp per employee was up 8%. I think you mentioned some severance. Can you quantify that and just give us some color on how to think about comp per employee going forward, just because it was a bunch higher than we thought? And then, can I just get one clarification? Lance you made a comment about intermodal and end-to-end. I'm not sure what that means and maybe what that should mean for the IMC relationship? Thank you.\nLance Fritz: Sure. I'll take that after Jennifer.\nJennifer Hamann: Sure. On the comp per employee side, Scott, you're right. I mentioned, we have wage inflation. That certainly was part of it. We did have severance. I'm not going to quantify that, but that is something that we don't expect to see in the fourth quarter. Jim mentioned some further headcount reductions that were made on the operating side of the world, so there was some severance involved with that. We also did have some higher cost per crew in the quarter. When you think about some of our weather challenges and the fact that we are staying quite lean from a headcount perspective and so we're working the crews a little bit harder, so a little bit higher overtime cost there. Going into the fourth quarter, we're going to still stay pretty lean as you still -- there's a little uncertainty around the economy. You've got the holiday season coming up, so I would expect that we're going to keep that crew base pretty lean. So you may see some elevated cost per crew. You're going to continue to have the wage inflation in 4Q, but you will not have the severance on a sequential basis. Lance?\nLance Fritz: Yeah. And Scott, your question on what did I mean by end-to-end in the domestic intermodal world? That's not an announcement of us going retail. So let me be crystal clear about that. But it is an indication that -- and a recognition that the service product that wins in the marketplace looks transparent to a customer from end-to-end and needs to be simplified and much easier to deal with. And we are working with our IMCs and our significant IMC partners to make that happen. And that needs to look like one point of contact consistency across the entire supply chain. And there's just a whole lot of work that's going into that that I wanted to make sure wasn't lost in this call.\nScott Group: Thank you.\nLance Fritz: Yeah.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup.\nChris Wetherbee: Hey. Hey, thanks and good morning. And congrats Jim, great job on the two years at the firm. I guess, I wanted to ask a question about sort of capital returns to shareholders. I know there's going to be some focus on debt pay down in the fourth quarter. Kind of curious, Jennifer, how you think about that impacting potential buybacks maybe in the near term, then sort of bigger picture do you think that there's an opportunity to kind of push a little harder on the buybacks as you go into next year and sort of cash flow comes up with earnings power? Just some thoughts around that would be helpful.\nJennifer Hamann: Sure, Chris. Thanks. In terms of fourth quarter, we came in - or end of the quarter, I should say, cash balance of $2.6 billion. That's -- we've typically ran closer to $1 billion, $1.5 billion in terms of cash balances. We've obviously been more conservative with that over the last couple of quarters with the pandemic and uncertainty. Things feel like they're evening down a little bit although you see the same news I do where cases are surging in different parts of the country. And so, we're going to be careful with that. But we think fourth quarter is a good time for us to start redeploying some of that cash. With interest rates being as low as they are, it's doing very little for us sitting in the bank right now. So we want to put some of that back to work. We're doing that through shares as well as paying off some debt. It has a little bit higher coupon a little higher cost for us. So we think that's the right economic thing to do. And as we look into 2021, again, in January, we'll talk more fulsomely about what our plans are not just for how we see the year playing out but how we're going to deploy cash. But we think certainly our job is twofold. It's to generate the cash through business and efficiency, and then deploy it back to our shareholders. I think we've got a good track record of doing that and rewarding our shareholders and we plan to continue that.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay, got it. Thank you.\nJennifer Hamann: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks, operator. Good morning, everybody. Jim, congrats on another successful tenure, I think you have the respect of everybody on this conference call. Just a quick question. Is there anything limiting you from joining another railroad relatively quickly? And would you be open to that when you do leave UNP, if you can address that? And then, Lance and Jennifer, we've been talking about the potential for incremental margins for a long time now in terms of how good they could be when the revenue growth turns positive. I just don't think we saw it to the extent that we would have in the third quarter, especially when you look at the sequential movements in non-fuel expenses. It was obviously a very challenging quarter from a congestion perspective, which may have something to do with this. So I was hoping you could just answer one, did the quarter kind of meet your expectations around flow-through from the sequential revenue growth? And then two, any cost that are worth maybe calling out that are specific to the congestion that we all know about that occurred on the West Coast? Thank you.\nJim Vena: You want to start?\nJennifer Hamann: I think I want you to start.\nJim Vena: Amit, you're pretty good. Thank you very much, and you slipped about five questions in there. That was pretty good. I love it. So, you've got it written down, Jennifer?\nJennifer Hamann: I think so.\nJim Vena: So, listen, I'm 62 years old. I feel great. I'm not looking further than what I've had the responsibility right now going forward. But all I'll tell you is, listen, we're going to elect a President that's either 74 or 78. So, I'm still a young guy, and I'll leave it at that.\nJennifer Hamann: And in terms of the margins, Amit, we did still have volumes down 4% in the quarter. And as I look at it, going from 2Q to 3Q, I would say that our margins improved sequentially, incrementally in the 60% kind of range. So I think that shows you there's power in the model. And as we look and see volumes go positive. I think that's the thing to focus on. And the fact with that we think we'll be able to have very strong incrementals. Were there some cost headwinds in the quarter? There always are. We called out the ones that we thought were most important. There were some severance costs. You've got a little associated with some of the mix impact. As Lance has said, that mix impact probably isn't going to change too much, but we're doing everything we can to improve the fluidity of the network and prove how efficiently we handle that business and that's our real opportunity. So, I'd say less in terms of big challenges more in terms of we see continued opportunity.\nLance Fritz: Yeah. Amit, this is Lance. So, we're not disappointed at all with our incremental margins in the quarter, and we also think there's continued opportunity to be even better than that.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.\nLance Fritz: Yeah.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I have a three-part question but on one topic. So I guess that counts as one question. Just I know we've discussed intermodal a fair bet, but just a couple more follow-ups there. First, can you just give us some color on how your customers are kind of taking what's happening right now? I mean clearly a lot of it was unprecedented, but at the same time are they upset about the surcharges and the service issues, or are they understanding? Second, if you do get higher volumes once this normalizes but offset by adding more resources and fewer surcharges, what does that mean for the profitability of the intermodal business heading into next year? And third, I'm not sure if you actually said this now, but what is the time line for resolution for the network issues?\nJennifer Hamann: What was that last part, Ravi, you dropped off a little bit?\nRavi Shanker: What is the time line for resolution for the network issues on the intermodal side? I'm not sure if you actually quantified that.\nKenny Rocker: Yeah. I'll start that off. Jim, you jump in if you got any questions in. When we walked into the third quarter, the entire supply chain was constrained. It's not a rail issue. You got the terminals. You got the port. You got the dray careers. Everyone was constrained. What we did immediately was got together as a team would operate in and then concurrently engaged our customers. And we did a number of things. You brought up a few. We adjusted our rates -- the transactional rates and our surcharges to make sure that we could protect those customers that are with us year round. We also inserted some new processes in place. So we gave our customers new guidelines for when they could bring their containers in. We sat down and talk with our customers about container dwelling and chassis dwelling. I talked about this a little bit earlier. We inserted as much technology as we could, adjusting and getting a higher percentage of our customers to our ITR functions so that they could have greater visibility to when the containers would move. We work with our dray carriers and started technology there. So they have really crystal clear times on when they can drop off or pick up a container. So as we stand today real-time, we feel really good about where we are. Yes it was bumpy earlier in the quarter. I think our customers really appreciate how we have worked with them up to this point. What I would also tell you is that as we are working with them to insert more efficiency and rigor around those processes, it's opened up more opportunities for us. I feel very bullish about the fact that with what Jim is doing with the train service, what our terminals are doing we're handling as much as possible but we can still through efficiency and adding in a little bit more equipment get more volume out of it. So we're feeling pretty bullish about it.\nJim Vena: Ravi, if I could and maybe I misunderstood the piece about how fluid the railroad is. The railroad is as fluid as it ever has been. We do not have a capacity issue. And in fact we are spending money to actually make it more efficient. Consolidation in Chicago that I talked about in prepared before was clear to say we want to consolidate to two big terminals and one smaller one in Chicago from six, so that we can turn the cars faster give the customer a better service be able to turn it. We see what the opportunity is and we also see what's happened north of the border and we think that to compete and to win without being a price discussion is to have a low cost. We operate our trains very efficiently. We operate them fast. We turn the cars quick. No one in North America moves in speed across their network with the premium business as fast as we do right now. So we can give the best service product to people whether you're going from L.A. over to Texas and we're going to be as fast as anybody into the Chicago market. So that's what it's all about. We think that if we have the right service, we got the capacity we know we have we spent on making the signings longer so that we can run more efficient trains. When our train miles are down, which means that -- in the 20% range that means that we've opened up that much capacity on top of the capacity we had before. So I'll tell you we have got this thing coming together properly. More efficient terminals, more efficient than visibility with our customers at the ports and working with the ports so that we have an efficient product there, move the containers out quicker, the domestic product to make speed and consistency that the customer wants. I'll tell you I'm very comfortable at where we're headed and we'll just continue to improve it.\nLance Fritz: And Ravi, let me touch base on your margin question, right? Because you had a question about what's going to happen to margins on intermodal product as you look forward? In the long run and in the intermediate run, what Jim just outlined is a big driver of the margin on that product line, which is the efficiency of the service product and its service reliability. That sets us up for pricing through Kenny. And our expectation with all of our product lines is that over time, we're going to continue to have an opportunity to improve its margin. So I don't look forward and get a concern as volume grows that costs are going to overrun some other aspect of that product. We're in great shape.\nJennifer Hamann: Yeah. And you mentioned the surcharges too. And I think it's important to point out those surcharges are really a net in the overall scheme of things. And so as we go through peak season we remove surcharges. That's not going to have an impact on our margins.\nRavi Shanker: Great. Thanks for the great detail. And Jim thanks for everything and good luck for the next phase.\nJim Vena: Thank you very much Ravi.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.\nJon Chappell: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Q&A fatigue makes it difficult to count to one, but I'm going to try my best here. Kenny we've talked a lot about mix and yield and I think conceptually it makes sense when you think about the growth of intermodal and some of the headwinds in the bulk categories. But you guys break out very clearly the sequential pace within commodity. And when we look at like grain and food and refrigerated and coals and fertilizers, the sequential step down has been even bigger than in some of the lower mix businesses. So what's kind of behind that? And what does it take to reverse that negative trend in the higher yield bulk segments? \nKenny Rocker: We're right there now. We -- I'll segment some of the commodities that you're talking about. We feel really good about grain and walking into this quarter the demand that's out there and the demand that should move in this quarter and I'll call it the near-term we should see more of that. If you look at the other industrial commodities I made the comment that they are improving sequentially. Now we can help with that we can go out and add business development wins on top of that. And that's what the team is focused on. Our marketing team has just done a great job of going out there with data analysis and looking at where we should be hunting, where we should look at prospect and where the leads are, where to reconnect with customers or smaller receivers that we've lost and the sales team has got a really good proactive look on how much business we're doing with them. So the markets are coming back slowly sequentially, which will help and we're going to accelerate that by going out there and win the business.\nJon Chappell: Okay, great. And thank you Kenny.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital. Please proceed with your question.\nWalter Spracklin: Yeah, thanks very much. Good morning everyone. And Jim you answered all my questions about your departure just to say congrats and good luck to you as well.\nJim Vena: Thank you.\nWalter Spracklin: Yeah. So moving on to Kenny I guess. You mentioned about stickiness of the customer and looking to get some fluidity out of the port. One of your peers in Canada has started to look proactively around using their land as a way to enhance or entice that stickiness about leasing land to a customer adjacent to facilities as one of those approaches. Do you have opportunity sets like that where when you look at your land portfolio that you could use that as a sales weapon to gain share in a more sticky way and in a way that gets some of that traffic and congestion out of the port and over to a transload facility more inland something along those lines?\nKenny Rocker: Yeah. Thanks for that question. The short answer is yes. And that's not something new for us. I don't want you to think that we haven't done that. We've been assessing our land, looking at our land. I won't go into details of where we are and how we think about it longer term, but I can tell you that we would expect to take advantage of the resources near the port.\nJim Vena: A great case in point, Kenny. And we've talked about this for years now, is Dallas to Dock and development that's happening around the Dallas intermodal terminal which Walter is literally thousands of acres. In your mind think a couple of thousand acres that we are developing and have developed in concert with a property developer that is rail-centric in its perspective. There's opportunities like that that we either have in the hopper have already executed or are beginning development plans for. \nWalter Spracklin: Any time frame of when that could be converted to a deal? \nJim Vena: Well sure. No specifics, but I would expect virtually every year we will have some aspect of that kind of business development occurring. \nJennifer Hamann: I mean there's business there now and there's opportunities to go forward. And certainly, you've heard us talk Walter as we have been consolidating facilities. I mean we're generating more opportunities along those lines when you think about our footprint and the land profile that we have to work with customers to further grow. \nJim Vena: Right. \nWalter Spracklin: Excellent. Thanks for the color.\nJim Vena: Thanks, Walter.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please state your question.\nTom Wadewitz : Yes. Good morning. I know you talked about this a little bit, so I hope this isn't too redundant, but I think it is something that investors and I think people were surprised on the change. So Jim, I was wondering if you could maybe offer any personal perspective on the change. I mean I think about it you don't sound like you're overly tired or unenthused about railroading. So it does -- it just seems surprising that you're leaving. So I don't know if there's any personal color you can add to that?  And whether there's a Board component? I mean do you talk to the Board about this and kind of say \"Hey why should I stay, or what's the path?\" So just wanted a little more perspective on that. And sticking with the two-part theme for Kenny, can you offer any thoughts on UP's franchise sensitivity to the homebuilding area? Just kind of how much of traffic is sensitive to that. So just a small add-on to that? Thank you. \nJim Vena: So listen I appreciate the question. The Board has been very supportive, clear understanding of what I came in? What the time line was? What I wanted to do? How I wanted to set it up and at what point I wanted to move on? I want to read there is absolutely nothing. The relationship is great with Lance. Relationship is great with the entire team. It's just -- it's a great time for me to move on and have a long-term person set-up. And Eric is a long-term person. You see his age that he can drive this thing. And I'm very comfortable. This is a strong team like the people that are sitting here with me around the table, I'm very impressed with what Kenny has been able to perform. He's going to bring the business into this company.  I just don't see -- we leverage the great facilities we have. It was a great question on -- that Walter asked us about what capability we have. So this is a great time. I think we've got a great network. We've got -- if not the best network pretty close to the best network in the entire industry. We leverage with a real efficient railroad. We grow the business. I just see this place keeping on moving ahead. And I've done what I needed to do. And Lance and I have worked out a real clear sort of help in the transition which I'll do with Eric and the entire team and I'm very comfortable that we've got the right team.  And listen Jennifer is top-notch and the relationship Lance and I have had has been spectacular. An outsider coming into a company that's -- the storied history that UP has and they welcomed me, we worked together. I can't be more comfortable with everybody that I've worked with in this company. So Kenny? \nKenny Rocker: Yes. So thanks for that question. I'll tell you we're encouraged by the recent numbers for housing starts here that came out earlier this week. What's more encouraging for us is the mix. So there's a stronger mix of single-family housing starts and the multi-family housing stars which works out well for us.  As a franchise, hey we enjoy some pretty long-haul shipments to Chicago down into Texas. And we feel good about our strategy and ability to compete along the I-5. I think what people fail to realize or sometimes miss is when we think about housing starts, we're just not thinking about the lumber. There's just so many other commodities that are behind it. You got cement, you've got PVC piping, you've got the rock, you've got plastic for the carpet. So housing starts just really fuel a lot of things. They got... \nLance Fritz: They've got like furniture, appliances, roofing... \nKenny Rocker: Look I could go on. It really fuels a lot of things. So that's a very encouraging macroeconomic change for us. \nTom Wadewitz : Is there a way to ballpark it though? Is it like 10% of the book that's sensitive or 20%? What's the ballpark? \nKenny Rocker: Yes. I think it's fair for us not to go in and try to arrange that out for you and just leave that the fact that, we like the fact that it's improving and we take advantage of moving not just that lumber of moving into the house, but everything associated with it. \nTom Wadewitz : Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJordan Alliger: Hi. I just wanted to come back quickly to the grain question. I know you said you're encouraged, but specifically on the export side our understanding is commitments for both soybean and corn are well above five-year averages to China. Just Kenny maybe you could give some sense or scope of the export grain franchise for UP? And what sort of tailwind that could really be? Thanks.\nKenny Rocker: Yes. So I've got myself in trouble trying to size this grain market before. So what I will confirm for you is that you're right in line, it's going to be right in there with the highs over the last five years. It's going to be a really strong market. And so I can confirm that for you. I won't size it for you, but it's going to be a really strong market for us. \nJordan Alliger: And Kenny, we'll participate there both out the PNW, we'll participate there out the Gulf? \nKenny Rocker: We've seen significant growth in those three areas and I'm adding Mexico to it. And so the PNW, the Gulf and Mexico, we have seen significant emphasis on that significant growth and we've got high expectations for the quarter. \nJordan Alliger: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of David Ross with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Ross: Thank you. And Jim, now that you mentioned, can you just run for [indiscernible]. \nJim Vena: I'm an American citizen, but I wasn\u2019t born in the U.S., so I cannot do it. Otherwise I would like to do sometime, let me tell you.\nDavid Ross: I would love to get you on Ballard, is a better third option. Going back to the improved efficiency of the network and the excess capacity that's generating for the UP, specifically in terms of railcar locomotive needs, how much do you think you can really grow volume-wise before you need new railcars new locomotives? And how much of that capacity have you actually taken out removed, retired versus just keeping in storage for future growth? \nKenny Rocker: Well let me start and then maybe Jennifer you want to talk about how we're handling it. But sure we've got lots of locomotives. I didn't even mention it this time. I think we've got 3,000 of them parked. So we won't be needing locomotives. If we could sell some of them and I'll leave that to Jennifer, but if we could do something and monetize them, I think we would but a pretty tough market. On the railcar side, it's depending on the mix of the traffic. We have cars, available cars parked, we've returned as many as we can to make us more efficient that way. So it's a mix on what we would have to add depending on the business. That's the way I look at it. If we were done operationally then you could say \"Boy if the business went up on one segment on the grain side, we'd have to go on and lease more cars to bring it in.\" We will not. We still have efficiency left to be able to \u2013 if the business goes up x, we're going to be half of that on the cars that we have to put in to be able to handle that business. And that's what I'm real comfortable with.\nJennifer Hamann: Yes. And on the freight car and locomotive side David, freight cars, we tend to own \u2013 this isn't entirely true but we tend to own the multi-use kind of cars. And so as you see changes in markets like we've seen the surge in grain, we've been able to repurpose some cars that had been hauling, I think fertilizer and move into grain service and obviously box cars is \u2013 can move anything. So our freight car fleet, we feel good about where that's at and our ability to deploy it as we need to. On the locomotive side, we look at the fleet by type, we have a relatively young fleet kind of overall and we have opportunities to modernize that fleet and redeploy it as the volumes come back up. And we see that as an opportunity for us going forward. We're obviously going to use that fleet as efficiently as possible, but we've got plans for every locomotive we own. And whether it's today or maybe tomorrow, that's the opportunity for us. And that's \u2013 you've heard us talk a lot about growth and the growth of margins. The capital efficiency of our ability to grow going forward is tremendous. When you think about the fact that we have the freight car assets, the locomotives and the track assets to put more business across and leverage that investment that we've already made is a tremendous opportunity for us. So we look forward to taking advantage of it. \nDavid Ross: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities.\nCherilyn Radbourne: Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in and Jim our best to you. I wanted to ask with the industry now operating based on kind of a similar philosophy, do you think there's an opportunity to work together a bit more creatively to develop new interchange traffic?\nLance Fritz: 100% Cherilyn. And we're actively working that with every other Class I railroad partner, of course excluding BNSF, there's really not much opportunity to do that with them. But whether you think about it in the context of \u2013 historically, there's this watershed area. And for us that typically is along the Mississippi River, where if there's an origination on my side of the river, it's short haul for me to get it to an Eastern carrier. And a lot of times historically that's not looked terribly attractive. But when we're all thinking about our business the same way now and we're all eager to grow with our excellent service product, we're all starting to think about you know, just because it's a short-haul on my side, if it generates an attractive relationship with the customer, it gets more railroad penetration and there's opportunity on their side of the river to originate for us, we're making those trades. And we're not doing it historically like we might have where in order to make the move attractive for me, I'm going to move it out a route and put it to a gateway where it doesn't make sense. So I get a little length of haul. That's not happening anymore, right? We're all thinking very clearly about best overall route structure. What's the price it takes to win? Is that attractive in total? And if it is let's do it. And doing it collectively.\nKenny Rocker: Yes. And I want to add on this one Lance. So to Lance's point, you're right. We're thinking about it as what would we do if we're one railroad. And that's product development components associated with that not just service. It could be something a little bit more than that. It could be something \u2013 a physical footprint that's there. Obviously, the equipment efficiency plays a part of it. But on an analog basis how do we go out and win that truck traffic that's out there that we haven't been able to capture.\nLance Fritz: Amen. A lot of opportunity there Cherilyn.\nCherilyn Radbourne: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Mr. Vernon, your line is open for question.\nDavid Vernon: Sorry, I was on mute there. So, Lance I wanted to come back to the question on domestic intermodal. We continue to hear from shippers as well as some of the supply chain partners that the ease of accessing the network, the service on the network is what it is and you guys have reported good metrics there. But as you think about the friction costs of getting in and out of the terminals on the intermodal, that is kind of holding back growth to a degree. And I'm just wondering, what can you as Union Pacific do over the next couple of years to solve that problem? You mentioned earlier that going retail or developing more retail capabilities isn't part of the solution. But I'm just wondering, how do we get out of the situation where when demand picks up, you end up in a situation where you got to throw up surcharges to keep traffic out of the yards?\nLance Fritz: Yes. Great question, David. And I want to also be clear, I didn't say that at some point in the future retail isn't the answer. I just wanted to make sure nobody thought I was announcing a new product on our call. So technology plays a really big role in what you were just talking about. What you're talking about David is fundamentally ease of doing business and removing blockages that keep customers from using the rail intermodal product. And to your point, Kenny has mentioned this before ITR. One of those can be, if you schedule a truck, when you bid for a truck you can get it scheduled at the time you want it, where you want it and be very confident that it's going to show up for you to load or to empty. We're reflecting the same kind of thing through ITR. ITR is basically a reservation system that allows domestic intermodal customers to know hey, I want to move this container from here to there and A., do you have availability on the day I want it? If the answer is yes, I'm booked and I know I got it. If the answer is no, I know when I can get it. And if it doesn't match my needs, it doesn't match my needs. But at least I have clarity and I don't make an assumption and then get angry when it doesn't happen. So that's one small example. We're also making it much easier for dray drivers, when they come on to the ramp with UPGo to be able to get through the gate quickly, know exactly where to park, where to drop-off and where to pick up and go. So they're getting a lot of help that way. We're helping the BCOs also by making sure we're tracking down chassis and keeping them productive in our terminal areas, right? Sometimes chassis get off property and they get lost or used for very different purposes that aren't bringing business to and from the railroad. So, there's just hundreds of different activity items in there that ultimately lead to a better customer experience. That's what I mean by that end-to-end experience. Kenny, you got anything else for that?\nKenny Rocker: No. I mean, the fact that we're sitting down with our customers, talking about these chassis, talking about the container dwell, giving them really good data points, managing with data. So yeah, that's good.\nDavid Vernon: And is there anything in the terminal side itself from an automation standpoint, or better throughput capacity that would also need to be addressed? Because this seems like every time the truck market gets tight we end up in the same kind of pig in the python, kind of problem.\nLance Fritz: That's a great question, right? And part of that is, yes. We can continue to be better and better, as we're rebuilding G4. We're introducing wide span gantry cranes there. That will be part of being able to get a box on and off, a well quickly. But part of that also though is making sure we have visibility deeper into the supply chain. Right now if stuff shows up with very little advanced notice, it's hard to realign our rail resources to handle it. To the extent we can get a week or even two, we can realign our resources pretty quickly. That gets back to ITR. ITR is most effective, when a maximum number of customers are using it. And they're using it as far out as they can. And we're working really hard with our customer base to get that to be kind of normalized behavior.\nDavid Vernon: All right. Thanks a lot for the time guys.\nLance Fritz: Yes.\nKenny Rocker: Thank you.\nOperator: You next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.\nBascome Majors: Yes Jim, congrats on the time you spend here. And good luck with whatever is next. Just wanted to focus on -- in the eight or nine months you've got left here, what are the one or two things you absolutely feel like you must wrap-up? And what are the larger projects that are going to take another couple of years or so, under Eric's leadership that are really kind of focused for that transition?\nJim Vena: Okay. Short-term, listen, we've had a lot of discussion about our intermodal service products. We see that as a growth area. So I'm going to concentrate on making sure the end-to-end view. Ports, domestic terminals, we make them as efficient as possible. We make the interaction with the customer as clear as possible, so that we can react better. I think we did a pretty good job of reacting to the big -- the bump up in business. But I think we can be better. Want to concentrate on the relationship with the other railroads. And how we interchange and how we move traffic back and forth, to make it even cleaner than we are today, because I think we can both win. That was a great question on, how we're reacting with the other customers. And listen, other than locomotives, asset utilization service, productivity, that's what I'm going to concentrate on in the next -- and I'll let Eric run it. And we'll make sure that we're attuned lined up together and finish that off. So that's what I'm going to do in the next six to eight months.\nBascome Majors: Thank you. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Jairam Nathan with Daiwa. Please proceed with your question.\nJairam Nathan: Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. I just had a question on CapEx. How should we think about it for next year given I think you're not going to be acquiring any locomotives. But are there any projects planned for next year, which would kind of puts and takes on the CapEx side? And also if you could -- I know you mentioned the package business is a very good business. Can you just kind of go through some of the economics of that business here?\nLance Fritz: I'll take CapEx. Jennifer, from a project perspective, there's nothing big that's unusual on the horizon. We're sticking with our guidance Jennifer?\nJennifer Hamann: Yeah. I mean, the less than 15% of revenue is where we would plan to be again for next year. And obviously, we'll talk more about that in January. I know we still have some siding projects that we plan to finish out some that, will finish out yet this year and a little bit more of that work. But we continue to have a robust plan. We'll modernize locomotives. We'll continue to make sure the infrastructure is in good shape. So I feel good about our ability to spend that capital to keep the railroad safe, efficient and add the capacity as needed for customers.\nLance Fritz: Well. And one thing that we haven't talked about on this call is our new CIO, coming over starting at the beginning of November. And technology we've talked about throughout the call is an important element of our overall service product and ability to grow and win business and I'm sure he's going to have a help and we'll also have some capital elements, but I don't think it will be an unusually high spend. \nJennifer Hamann: No. Kenny do you want to...? \nKenny Rocker: I don't have anything else. \nJennifer Hamann: I thought he asked... \nLance Fritz: He asked about parcel. How is the parcel biz and... \nKenny Rocker: Yes. I mean parcel has been strong. We've gone out there -- the market has grown, but like I mentioned we've gone out there and had some pretty strong wins across the board on our parcel business. Expanding beyond parcel because parcel business is a pretty what I'll call service-sensitive business. I've been very proud of the team our loop teams our carry [indiscernible] team. We've been able to win some service-sensitive business with two large OEMs. All of this is truck traffic. One of them is a new entrant to rail so -- and the product is both short haul and long haul. So if you look at e-commerce and look at the service-sensitive markets the team and -- behind that service product has done a great job of growing it. \nJairam Nathan: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question of the day comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi guys, good morning. So I just wanted to make sure I understand the comments around new business opportunities and wins. Are you starting to see those accelerate and broaden here with the improved network and some of the efficiencies that you pulled through? And certainly understanding it's been an unusual year. Are those opportunities where you thought they would be at this point in your journey? Any thoughts there? \nKenny Rocker: Yes. So the two changes there is a strong reliable service product that we haven't had in some time. The other thing is a lower cost structure would also make piece of the business more attractive that we haven't seen. I made some comments around opening up new markets and gave some examples of long-haul business just a few minutes ago. But we're also seeing the same thing with some short-haul business -- short-haul carload business where again if we can add large pieces to existing train service or even small volume pieces to existing train service, it drops to the bottom line. But those two things alone have really enabled our sales team and our marketing team to be very pointed and deliberate in having conversations with our customers about truck conversions. \nAllison Poliniak: Great. And just -- are those opportunities kind of now at this point in your journey are you kind of thinking are they where they should be at this point? Are they a little better? Any thoughts there? \nKenny Rocker: We have. We certainly have room to grow. There's opportunity for us to grow. And we're excited and bullish on where we expect to be. But there's no part of this where we're ready to say that we've arrived or we're done. We've got a lot of room to grow here. \nLance Fritz: Yes. Allison we think more, sooner better. That's what Kenny hears all the time. \nAllison Poliniak: Great. Thank you guys.\nOperator: We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. And I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Lance Fritz for closing comments. \nLance Fritz: Thank you again Rob and thanks everyone for the questions. It was a really good session today. I want to thank Jim again. I'm so pleased we've got him for as long as we do. We're going to put him to good use over the next eight months. And we look forward to talking with all of you again in January to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results. Until then I wish you all good health. Please take care of yourself and take care. Thank you. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jim Vena",
            "content": "Thanks, Lance, and good morning, everyone. We had an impressive quarter to turn in the results you see today. We had to watch our asset utilization closely as we dealt with a sharp volume increase following the equally sharp volume decline of the second quarter, as we continue to navigate the pandemic. And we have had some significant weather events in this quarter as well. In the face of those challenges, the team delivered strong productivity gains to the tune of $205 million and a total of $610 million year-to-date, all in all a very strong quarter for the entire operating team. Turning to slide 4, I'd like to update you on our key performance indicators. Driven by the team's relentless focus on asset utilization and reducing car touches, freight car velocity and freight car terminal dwell both improved 3%. These improvements along with increased train length, which we'll talk more about on the next slide demonstrate how our operating model is striking the right balance between service and efficiency. We continue to adjust our transportation plan to run a more efficient network that requires fewer locomotives. In the third quarter, we achieved a quarterly record in locomotive productivity, an 11% improvement versus last year, which is all the more impressive when you consider the mix challenge of trading coal and sand volumes for intermodal volumes. Workforce productivity also a quarterly record improved 13% from third quarter 2019. Productivity improvements were led by the train and engine workforce down 22% versus last year, which significantly outpace the 4% volume decline. Our manifest service remained strong during the quarter driving a 5-point improvement in trip plant compliance for manifest and autos. Intermodal trip plant compliance decreased in the quarter, reflecting the impact seen across the entire intermodal supply chain from the sharp West Coast volume increase. Although, we positioned the equipment near the L.A. Basin in anticipation of a surge the resulting imbalances following the first wave of the freight as well as the sharp uptick in demand for both TE&Y and terminal employees took a few weeks to work through the network. But the team responded quickly with resources and transportation plan changes, enabling us to exit the quarter with intermodal trip plan compliance back in the low to mid-80s. Our results have been strong this year, and we expect to see continued improvement in the fourth quarter. Slide 5 highlights some of our recent network changes. Our focus on increasing train length and handling traffic efficiently remains strong. We were able to absorb the majority of the sequential volume increase by adding traffic to our existing train network. Compared to the fourth quarter 2018, when we first began implementing our version of precision scheduled railroading we have increased train length across our system by 28% or 1950 feet to approximately 9,000 feet in third quarter of 2020. We've completed 28 15,000-foot sidings through the third quarter allowing longer trains to run in both directions and reduced the number of train starts. We plan to have another eight sidings completed by the end of 2020. We recently curtailed operations at the East Hump in our North Platte Nebraska yard. This location was unique in that, it previously had two humps. Going forward, the cars will either be processed at the still active west hump or flat switched. The redesign of our operations in Chicago and Houston remains on track. Chicago intermodal consolidation is set to be complete by year-end. We are also making progress in Houston to consolidate our intermodal facilities into one location to expand, switching capability and improve our ability to run longer trains out of the Inglewood yard. Finally, we continue to make organizational changes to better align resources and responsibilities. During the quarter, we took an additional workforce reduction in the operating department and also integrated intermodal operations into the transportation department. We will continue to seek efficiency in all facets of what we do and there remain many more opportunities ahead of us. To wrap-up, we remain committed to protecting our employee's health and safety and providing strong service to our customers. We will continue to make structural changes to improve operational performance and efficiency. The changes we're making in Chicago and Houston will drive continued improvements in our intermodal service product allowing us to be more competitive in those markets. We have made great progress in transforming our operations to this point. Our focus is unwavering, as we will continue to improve safety service asset utilization and network efficiency in order to provide customers with a service product that is competitive and provides value. Before I turn it over to Kenny, I want to make a few comments on Tuesday's announcement. I'm very proud of what we've accomplished during my time at Union Pacific. Really the results speak for themselves. We've got the leadership team and culture and a great place to continue to flourish and Eric is the right person to lead the team. He's a very talented railroader and brings a great skill set to the position. I know he'll continue to challenge the team to be relentless in their pursuit of efficiency. I'm going to stick around for a bit longer to make sure the transition is smooth and some key projects are completed. I'm very confident that this team won't back off on the progress we've made or making to produce an industry-best product for our customers. With that, I'll turn it over to Kenny to provide an update on the business environment. Okay. So thanks Ken. I appreciate the question and thanks for saying a good two years not quite two years, but we've got a little bit of work left to do. So I'm looking forward to the next few months to really get this place going even better. So, on the intermodal and the expense side, I think we showed in the quarter how we can handle the business and be smart about how we handle the business. It is -- if we need to win we need to be able to look at things on a full supply chain view and that's what we did. And everybody knew that you cannot easily react without really disrupting the entire network when it comes to the intermodal volume that increased substantially. But I think the speed that we reacted and where our metrics are after was a great move. The expense will continue on a unit basis to be less purely because of the capital investments we've made in the network and the efficiency. We turn our locomotives way quicker, we turn our crews quicker, we turn our cars quicker, we handle the inspections quicker. We do so many things faster that we'll continue to build on that. So I don't see -- whatever business comes on I think we still will be able to improve our efficiency across the board. Okay. Well listen I appreciate the question. So let me take it back to when I came on at Union Pacific. Lance and I sat down and we talked about what we needed to do and how I could help the team and -- at UP to drive the productivity that they already had in mind. It wasn't -- I think everybody in Union Pacific realized that listen there's an opportunity to become more efficient and be able to have a great service product and win in the marketplace. So those goals were there. And I was really -- it was refreshing to hear Lance and Rob we were all in the same room together talk about how we wanted to become the leader in the industry when it came to efficiency, operational efficiency and service excellence. So you build on that. I committed when I came on the 18 to 24 months. I could have stayed longer. I could have stayed shorter. There was nothing that was tying me into the company. But my job was to build the foundation of operational group that understood what was possible and what we could deliver. And I think that's what I've done. And I'm very comfortable that Eric is the right person to lead it. Let's just put this right down to is he Jim Vena? No he's not Jim Vena. And I'm not -- if you compare me to some of the other people that have led companies operationally, I'm not the same person. I think we've done a great job of not causing a lot of pain to our customers. In other situations people have done that. So we've been measured. Eric is the right guy. He's got the right background. He's got the right skill level. I like the way his mind works. He sees things quick. So I'm very confident that we've got that right. But below that and I'm disappointed in that we -- because of COVID we could not get everybody into CR team operationally whether it's Tom in the North or David Giandinoto in the South or John Turner very bright person, okay, or it's Hunt Cary. We've got a team of railroaders. And as you all know I've been railroading for a while that I'm very confident they understand what we're doing and they will deliver. Now I'm going to be around and I'll be honest if they make a slip up. I don't care whether I'm gone or not I will be phoning them okay? And asking them what the heck they're doing and I'll keep the heat on it. The worst thing we can do and the true measure of a leader is that, when you depart the team understands what's supposed to happen and you go out there and deliver. Two more points on that. One is, is I spent a lot of time with people at different levels in the company. And I've spent probably 20 days in the last three months putting on sessions with frontline supervisors that try to drive the decision-making have the right culture. And I'll continue to do that till the end of the year and some into the New Year. So I'm very confident that we've got the right team. And let me answer that last piece. What's left? Well, locomotives are going to be way more productive. Our train length, I see 10,000 feet, okay? I see our car freight velocity up another 5% or 10%. So I think that we are just starting. The mechanisms, the measures, the culture is all there to succeed. And I am not worried about it. And I am going to keep my Union Pacific stock. I'm not going to go out there and sell it because I'm very confident that we're going to do the right thing. So Justin, I hope -- a long answer and I apologize, but I just wanted to make sure I put it all on the table. Thanks, Justin. So let me answer it backwards. Yes, it's a bucket that we see and it is a substantial bucket on an expense side that we think that we've got the right plan in. The number you see if you peel back the mix issue, this last quarter we had over 4% improvement in our fuel use on a GTM basis if you look underneath. Now that's masked with the change in the type of trains that we're running and the volume, but I'm very comfortable that we have the right process in place that we continue to drop. I don't think we're going to get 4% every quarter. But the best way to look at it is -- is if we put more on the same number of trains, with the same number of locomotives that we had before and that's what we're doing on an average number of horsepower per train and we're able to build the trains to what our capacity is we will continue to see that fuel productivity number improve. Are we going to be the best in the industry? No. There's some advantages for railroad I used to work at. Their mainline grade is pretty -- is weighed at about half of ours. So we're going to burn a little more fuel to get over some of those mountains getting out to the West Coast. But at the end of the day, we have a lot of advantages on how we can turn and use the fuel and we've spent money on technology, continue to -- so that the locomotives and the -- locomotive engineers are better at understanding how they operate and I see us continuing to get that. The mix turns -- Eric is probably going to get maybe a mix turn down the road and everybody will say he's brilliant on saving the fuel. So -- so I'm very comfortable. You're welcome. Thank you. You want to start? Amit, you're pretty good. Thank you very much, and you slipped about five questions in there. That was pretty good. I love it. So, you've got it written down, Jennifer? So, listen, I'm 62 years old. I feel great. I'm not looking further than what I've had the responsibility right now going forward. But all I'll tell you is, listen, we're going to elect a President that's either 74 or 78. So, I'm still a young guy, and I'll leave it at that. Ravi, if I could and maybe I misunderstood the piece about how fluid the railroad is. The railroad is as fluid as it ever has been. We do not have a capacity issue. And in fact we are spending money to actually make it more efficient. Consolidation in Chicago that I talked about in prepared before was clear to say we want to consolidate to two big terminals and one smaller one in Chicago from six, so that we can turn the cars faster give the customer a better service be able to turn it. We see what the opportunity is and we also see what's happened north of the border and we think that to compete and to win without being a price discussion is to have a low cost. We operate our trains very efficiently. We operate them fast. We turn the cars quick. No one in North America moves in speed across their network with the premium business as fast as we do right now. So we can give the best service product to people whether you're going from L.A. over to Texas and we're going to be as fast as anybody into the Chicago market. So that's what it's all about. We think that if we have the right service, we got the capacity we know we have we spent on making the signings longer so that we can run more efficient trains. When our train miles are down, which means that -- in the 20% range that means that we've opened up that much capacity on top of the capacity we had before. So I'll tell you we have got this thing coming together properly. More efficient terminals, more efficient than visibility with our customers at the ports and working with the ports so that we have an efficient product there, move the containers out quicker, the domestic product to make speed and consistency that the customer wants. I'll tell you I'm very comfortable at where we're headed and we'll just continue to improve it. Thank you very much Ravi. Thank you. A great case in point, Kenny. And we've talked about this for years now, is Dallas to Dock and development that's happening around the Dallas intermodal terminal which Walter is literally thousands of acres. In your mind think a couple of thousand acres that we are developing and have developed in concert with a property developer that is rail-centric in its perspective. There's opportunities like that that we either have in the hopper have already executed or are beginning development plans for. Well sure. No specifics, but I would expect virtually every year we will have some aspect of that kind of business development occurring. Right. Thanks, Walter. So listen I appreciate the question. The Board has been very supportive, clear understanding of what I came in? What the time line was? What I wanted to do? How I wanted to set it up and at what point I wanted to move on? I want to read there is absolutely nothing. The relationship is great with Lance. Relationship is great with the entire team. It's just -- it's a great time for me to move on and have a long-term person set-up. And Eric is a long-term person. You see his age that he can drive this thing. And I'm very comfortable. This is a strong team like the people that are sitting here with me around the table, I'm very impressed with what Kenny has been able to perform. He's going to bring the business into this company.  I just don't see -- we leverage the great facilities we have. It was a great question on -- that Walter asked us about what capability we have. So this is a great time. I think we've got a great network. We've got -- if not the best network pretty close to the best network in the entire industry. We leverage with a real efficient railroad. We grow the business. I just see this place keeping on moving ahead. And I've done what I needed to do. And Lance and I have worked out a real clear sort of help in the transition which I'll do with Eric and the entire team and I'm very comfortable that we've got the right team.  And listen Jennifer is top-notch and the relationship Lance and I have had has been spectacular. An outsider coming into a company that's -- the storied history that UP has and they welcomed me, we worked together. I can't be more comfortable with everybody that I've worked with in this company. So Kenny? I'm an American citizen, but I wasn't born in the U.S., so I cannot do it. Otherwise I would like to do sometime, let me tell you. Okay. Short-term, listen, we've had a lot of discussion about our intermodal service products. We see that as a growth area. So I'm going to concentrate on making sure the end-to-end view. Ports, domestic terminals, we make them as efficient as possible. We make the interaction with the customer as clear as possible, so that we can react better. I think we did a pretty good job of reacting to the big -- the bump up in business. But I think we can be better. Want to concentrate on the relationship with the other railroads. And how we interchange and how we move traffic back and forth, to make it even cleaner than we are today, because I think we can both win. That was a great question on, how we're reacting with the other customers. And listen, other than locomotives, asset utilization service, productivity, that's what I'm going to concentrate on in the next -- and I'll let Eric run it. And we'll make sure that we're attuned lined up together and finish that off. So that's what I'm going to do in the next six to eight months."

            "content": "Thank you, Kenny and good morning. As you heard from Lance earlier, Union Pacific is reporting third quarter earnings per share of $2.01 and a quarterly operating ratio of 58.7% an all-time quarterly record and our first sub-59 quarter. Looking at our quarterly income statement, operating revenue totaled $4.9 billion down 11% versus last year on a 4% year-over-year volume decline demonstrating our consistent ability to adjust cost with volume, operating expense decreased 12% to $2.9 billion. Taken together we are reporting third quarter operating income of $2 billion, a 9% decrease versus 2019. Other income of $37 million was down $16 million versus last year as a result of lower interest income as well as less rental income. Interest expense increased 11% due to increased debt levels and costs associated with our recent debt exchange. Income tax expense was lower, down 12% as a result of lower pretax quarterly income. Net income of $1.4 billion, declined 12% versus last year, which combined with share repurchases led to a 9% decrease in earnings per share to $2.01. As I just mentioned, our 58.7% operating ratio was 80 basis points better year-over-year. Lower fuel prices had a 100 basis point positive impact on the operating ratio while fuel surcharge lag negatively impacted earnings per share by $0.03. Turning now to slide 14, which provides a breakdown of our freight revenue, totaling $4.6 billion, down 11% versus 2019. The primary contributor to the year-over-year decline was a 4% decrease in carloadings, a substantial improvement from the second quarter, but still in negative territory. Lower diesel fuel prices, down 35% year-over-year impacted revenue by 3.5 points. Positive, core pricing gains were more than offset by our business mix, reducing revenue 3.25 points. Although we continue to yield pricing dollars in excess of inflation, revenues were impacted by moving more business at a lower average revenue per car, something we commonly refer to as negative mix. A 9% increase in intermodal combined with industrial volume declines, which included the continued falloff in sand and crude carloads were strong contributors to that negative mix. Now let's move on to slide 15, which provides a summary of our third quarter operating expenses. As you heard Jim discuss, we did a great job operationally in the quarter adjusting to that sharp rebound in traffic. And at the same time, we're very effective controlling costs. If you look at the individual expense lines, comp and benefits expense decreased 11% year-over-year, as we offset wage inflation and higher severance cost through lower force counts. Third quarter workforce levels declined 18% or about 6,500 full-time equivalents versus last year, while sequentially increasing by fewer than 100. Our train and engine workforce continues to be more than volume variable down 22%, while management, engineering and mechanical workforces together decreased 14% with a portion of those reductions related to fewer capital employees. Quarterly fuel expense decreased 40% as a result of the significantly lower diesel fuel prices and lower volumes. Third quarter consumption rate increased slightly versus 2019, reflecting the mix impact of running fewer heavy-haul bulk shipments. Purchased services and materials expense declined 11% in the quarter, as we continue to use our locomotive fleet more productively. In addition, our loop subsidiary incurred less drayage expense versus last year with fewer auto shipments. Equipment and other rents fell 8% in the quarter despite mix pressure in this category related to increased intermodal shipments. However, freight car and locomotive productivity efforts more than offset that headwind, driving car hire savings and lower lease expense. Other expense was our only cost category that increased year-over-year, up 8% in the quarter, driven by $17 million of higher state and local taxes. We still expect this cost category to be up around 5% on a full year basis, in line with prior guidance. Looking now at productivity. As discussed during our second quarter call, the game plan was to leverage sequential volumes against our smaller cost structure, while maintaining a high level of service. And based on our results, I'd say we did just that. We continued our trend of generating strong net productivity, with the third quarter coming in at $205 million. The operating department's continued progress on train length initiatives, balanced with an improved service product and more efficient use of our workforce and locomotives, led those productivity gains. In addition, all areas of the company continue to control spending, as well as look for ways to do more with less. Our year-to-date net productivity of $610 million already exceeds both our expectations for 2020, as well as the impressive $590 million of net productivity, we achieved for the full year 2019. As we look to the fourth quarter, understanding that we do have a difficult comparison against last year's fourth quarter, we now expect full year 2020 net productivity to exceed $700 million or $1.3 billion over the last two years. This strong productivity is evident in our record quarterly operating ratio of 58.7%. Using the same barometer as past quarters for evaluating cost variability, year-over-year third quarter expenses were 180% volume variable on a fuel adjusted basis. Sequentially, as third quarter volumes increased 19% from the second quarter, fuel adjusted operating expenses only increased 11%. Moving on to cash and liquidity. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Union Pacific has been in a position of strength with our cash generation liquidity and balance sheet. Year-to-date cash from operations decreased only 4% versus 2019 to $6 billion despite a 12% decrease in net income. Free cash flow after capital investments totaled nearly $3.7 billion, resulting in a 93% cash conversion rate. After payment of our industry-leading quarterly dividend, cash on hand at the end of the third quarter was $2.6 billion. As volumes have remained relatively steady in the 160,000 seven-day carloading range, we are moving to redeploy some of that cash. We resume share repurchases in early October and announced our plans for a $500 million par call on debt due in early 2021. We also plan to pay off an additional $300 million of incremental debt we assumed earlier this year for added liquidity. From a balance sheet perspective, we finished the quarter at an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.9 times, as we continue to maintain strong investment-grade credit ratings from both Standard & Poor's and Moody's. As we've said before, navigating through this pandemic has reinforced our conviction that maintaining a solid investment-grade credit rating is critical and is an essential element to our commitment to provide strong cash returns to our owners, which totaled nearly $5 billion at the end of September. Turning now to our outlook. You heard Kenny talk about the positive drivers we see in the marketplace and our expectation that fourth quarter volumes will be our first quarter with positive year-over-year growth in two years. Given this improved outlook, we now expect full year volumes to be down 7% or so. As I pointed out earlier, we expect productivity to exceed $700 million for full year 2020, and our long-standing pricing guidance is unchanged. We expect the total dollars generated from our pricing actions to exceed rail inflation costs. We are committed to making sure each piece of business we move is earning an adequate return and that we are being compensated for the value we are delivering in the marketplace. Our expectations for volume, price and productivity should produce a record 2020 operating ratio. In fact, we now expect the full year 2020 operating ratio to improve by roughly one point and start with a five. While the course we've charted in 2020 is certainly much different than expected when we laid out our original targets being able to achieve a sub-60 operating ratio in the heart of a pandemic is an impressive accomplishment for the entire Union Pacific team. In terms of cash generation and capital allocation, full year capital expenditures are still projected to come in around $2.9 billion, as we make good progress on our renewal and productivity investments. We will continue providing strong cash returns to our owners through our dividend and share repurchases. And longer-term, capital expenditures remain projected to be below 15% of revenue, a dividend payout ratio of 40% to 45% of earnings and ultimately achieving that 55% operating ratio remains a vision and objective for our company. Wrapping up, I'd like to express my appreciation to our exceptional employees, the job they've done this year to work safely, stay nimble and provide a quality service product for our customers while also improving productivity is truly remarkable. Our goal of operating the safest most efficient and most reliable railroad in North America is clearly achievable knowing we have the best people in the business. With that I'll turn it back to Lance. Yes, Allison thanks for the question. You've heard us say many times the drivers of our performance are what Lance just laid out its volume, productivity and then the price piece. So we're encouraged by what you're seeing in the truck markets today and with the service product that we've got out there and all the work that Kenny and his team are doing. But we're still working through our plans for 2021, but we have every expectation that we've got a great road map ahead of us where we can continue to improve. We'll give you obviously more detail around that when we talk to you in January. And our hope is sometime next year we should be able to gather everyone as we were hoping to do in the fall of this year and with a little more certainty on what's going on with the economy and the pandemic be able to lay out for you guys kind of a multiyear plan that we see for ourselves and how we look to continue to make improvement and go to the 55% OR. Thanks. What specifically slows down Jason? Yes. I mean, we're just starting to get into the bid season for next year, Jason. And I think maybe that's part of your question too, in terms of if that truck market stays tight, we think that's a great opportunity for us, particularly with the service product that we've got to offer right now. Thank you. Sure. On the comp per employee side, Scott, you're right. I mentioned, we have wage inflation. That certainly was part of it. We did have severance. I'm not going to quantify that, but that is something that we don't expect to see in the fourth quarter. Jim mentioned some further headcount reductions that were made on the operating side of the world, so there was some severance involved with that. We also did have some higher cost per crew in the quarter. When you think about some of our weather challenges and the fact that we are staying quite lean from a headcount perspective and so we're working the crews a little bit harder, so a little bit higher overtime cost there. Going into the fourth quarter, we're going to still stay pretty lean as you still -- there's a little uncertainty around the economy. You've got the holiday season coming up, so I would expect that we're going to keep that crew base pretty lean. So you may see some elevated cost per crew. You're going to continue to have the wage inflation in 4Q, but you will not have the severance on a sequential basis. Lance? Sure, Chris. Thanks. In terms of fourth quarter, we came in - or end of the quarter, I should say, cash balance of $2.6 billion. That's -- we've typically ran closer to $1 billion, $1.5 billion in terms of cash balances. We've obviously been more conservative with that over the last couple of quarters with the pandemic and uncertainty. Things feel like they're evening down a little bit although you see the same news I do where cases are surging in different parts of the country. And so, we're going to be careful with that. But we think fourth quarter is a good time for us to start redeploying some of that cash. With interest rates being as low as they are, it's doing very little for us sitting in the bank right now. So we want to put some of that back to work. We're doing that through shares as well as paying off some debt. It has a little bit higher coupon a little higher cost for us. So we think that's the right economic thing to do. And as we look into 2021, again, in January, we'll talk more fulsomely about what our plans are not just for how we see the year playing out but how we're going to deploy cash. But we think certainly our job is twofold. It's to generate the cash through business and efficiency, and then deploy it back to our shareholders. I think we've got a good track record of doing that and rewarding our shareholders and we plan to continue that. Thanks. I think I want you to start. I think so. And in terms of the margins, Amit, we did still have volumes down 4% in the quarter. And as I look at it, going from 2Q to 3Q, I would say that our margins improved sequentially, incrementally in the 60% kind of range. So I think that shows you there's power in the model. And as we look and see volumes go positive. I think that's the thing to focus on. And the fact with that we think we'll be able to have very strong incrementals. Were there some cost headwinds in the quarter? There always are. We called out the ones that we thought were most important. There were some severance costs. You've got a little associated with some of the mix impact. As Lance has said, that mix impact probably isn't going to change too much, but we're doing everything we can to improve the fluidity of the network and prove how efficiently we handle that business and that's our real opportunity. So, I'd say less in terms of big challenges more in terms of we see continued opportunity. What was that last part, Ravi, you dropped off a little bit? Yeah. And you mentioned the surcharges too. And I think it's important to point out those surcharges are really a net in the overall scheme of things. And so as we go through peak season we remove surcharges. That's not going to have an impact on our margins. I mean there's business there now and there's opportunities to go forward. And certainly, you've heard us talk Walter as we have been consolidating facilities. I mean we're generating more opportunities along those lines when you think about our footprint and the land profile that we have to work with customers to further grow. Yes. And on the freight car and locomotive side David, freight cars, we tend to own \u2013 this isn't entirely true but we tend to own the multi-use kind of cars. And so as you see changes in markets like we've seen the surge in grain, we've been able to repurpose some cars that had been hauling, I think fertilizer and move into grain service and obviously box cars is \u2013 can move anything. So our freight car fleet, we feel good about where that's at and our ability to deploy it as we need to. On the locomotive side, we look at the fleet by type, we have a relatively young fleet kind of overall and we have opportunities to modernize that fleet and redeploy it as the volumes come back up. And we see that as an opportunity for us going forward. We're obviously going to use that fleet as efficiently as possible, but we've got plans for every locomotive we own. And whether it's today or maybe tomorrow, that's the opportunity for us. And that's \u2013 you've heard us talk a lot about growth and the growth of margins. The capital efficiency of our ability to grow going forward is tremendous. When you think about the fact that we have the freight car assets, the locomotives and the track assets to put more business across and leverage that investment that we've already made is a tremendous opportunity for us. So we look forward to taking advantage of it. Yeah. I mean, the less than 15% of revenue is where we would plan to be again for next year. And obviously, we'll talk more about that in January. I know we still have some siding projects that we plan to finish out some that, will finish out yet this year and a little bit more of that work. But we continue to have a robust plan. We'll modernize locomotives. We'll continue to make sure the infrastructure is in good shape. So I feel good about our ability to spend that capital to keep the railroad safe, efficient and add the capacity as needed for customers. No. Kenny do you want to...? I thought he asked..."

            "content": "Thank you, Jim and good morning. For the third quarter, our volume was down 4%, primarily due to declines in our industrial and bulk business groups. The decrease in volume coupled with a 7% decline in average revenue per car drove freight revenue to be down 11% in the quarter. Weak economic conditions related to the pandemic continue to impact multiple market segments but it was partially offset by stronger demand in the premium group. So, let's take a closer look at how the third quarter performed for each of our business groups. Starting with bulk, revenue for the quarter was down 12% on a 9% decrease in volume and a 3% decrease in average revenue per car. Coal and renewable carloads were down 21% as a result of weaker market conditions from low natural gas prices and soft export demand. Volume for grain and grain products was up 3% from an increased demand of export grain partially offset by pandemic-reduced demand for ethanol. Fertilizer and sulfur carloads were up 4% due to the stronger export potash, slightly offset by lower production of phosphate rock. Finally, food and refrigerated volume was flat and strong beverage shipments were offset by softer food service and restaurant demand. Moving on to industrial, industrial revenue declined 18% from a 16% decrease in volume. Average revenue per car also declined 2% due to a lower fuel surcharge and negative mix. Energy and specialized shipments decreased 20%, primarily driven by reduced petroleum shipments due to low oil prices coupled with weak demand. Forest products volume was flat. Growth in lumber shipment from improved housing starts and repair and remodels offset declines in paper shipments. Industrial chemicals and plastic shipments declined by 9% due to the pandemic-related impacts on both global and domestic demand. Industrial chemicals volume had the largest reduction as these carloads are closely tied to industrial production. Metals and minerals volumes decreased by 22% due to reduced sand shipments associated with the decline in oil prices and a surplus in local sand. Rock shipments were also reduced due to the pandemic-related impact on demand and project delays. Turning now to premium, revenue for the quarter was down 1% on a 5% increase in volume. Average revenue per car declined by 6%, reflecting a lower mix from increased intermodal shipments. Automotive volume was down 9% for the quarter. At the beginning of the quarter, most North American manufacturing plants have resumed production, but our run rates were about 15% below 2019. Production volumes steadily increased throughout the third quarter as dealers restocked inventory. Intermodal volume decreased by 9% year-over-year driven by strength in domestic truckload and parcel shipments as well as onboarding new international business. Despite the pandemic, sales for most retailers increased throughout the quarter. And not only did we see the footprint of e-commerce sales of total U.S. retail sales grow year-over-year, but more importantly, we saw our volume increase as a result of key business wins. As we enter the fourth quarter, you can see on slide 11 that our overall volume is currently up 4% year-over-year. Based on these run rates we'd expect year-over-year fourth quarter volumes to be up low single-digit. We expect premium volumes to remain strong similar to current run rates for the remainder of the year. Strength in e-commerce is likely to continue and volumes will be bolstered by inventory restocking as we enter peak holiday shopping season coupled with recent business development wins. For bulk, the coal market remains challenged as high inventory and weather conditions continue to be factors. However, we have a positive outlook for export grain due to China's continued purchases. Additionally, we expect to see continued strength in beer shipments and we could see modest growth in our food and refrigerated line if food service and restaurant demand improve. And lastly, for industrial, the potential for crew by rail remains largely uncertain. If oil prices remain depressed, then we anticipate continued year-over-year declines. But on a positive note, we are anticipating slow sequential quarterly improvements for most of our other markets. The outlook for housing starts remain positive and our improved service product is opening up new markets for us like some short-haul business that wouldn't have been so attractive to us in the past. This is just one example of how we're staying focused on things we can control. The team has done a fabulous job executing on our marketing initiatives to win new business and as Jim stated earlier, our service product continues to improve, which helps our customers compete in the marketplace. With that, I'll turn it over to Jennifer who's going to talk about our financial performance. Yes. So thanks for that question, Jason. First of all, I would just say that controlling what we can't control we're going to go out there and win as much business as we can in all those markets. And this year we've been able to do that. We've been able to grow our e-commerce business. We've got a great service product that Jim and the team has provided us. On the international side, we talked about an international win. And even on our domestic truckload side, we've been able to go out there and win new business. We have seen a little bit more of our international business transloaded into some of the West Coast ports. That just means that we have to compete on the domestic side, which I've said, we've been able to do. So regardless of how that product comes in, we've inserted a lot of technology with our customers to go out and win business, whether it's APIs that see the business coming from Asia, whether it's our ITR business to give great visibility to our customers on when their business will move. We feel like we've got a really strong domestic product to go out there and compete. And we've also won quite a bit on the international side. Yes. The only thing I'll add to that is, if you look at the data, the retail sales have actually improved sequentially. So there is a pull element to the demand. And the inventory that they sit today, they're lower than they were in 2019. So they're still lower inventory. And then you think about that e-commerce business, I believe that there is a structural change out there with the consumer preference that there's going to be more e-commerce there that fits very nicely with our service product. Yes. The only thing I'll add to that also is that the team has done a great job of inserting product into our supply chain. So whether it's matchbacks in Dallas, whether it's reloads out of the Midwest, we're doing everything we can to make it sticky for our customers. We've worked with the port to get some really strong standards to get out of the port, working with Jim's team. I talked about the technology on the API side where we're working with our largest international carriers, so that we can have visibility to when they come in and instill confidence and trust in our service. So we're taking a active, very proactive approach to winning in those markets. Yeah. I'll start that off. Jim, you jump in if you got any questions in. When we walked into the third quarter, the entire supply chain was constrained. It's not a rail issue. You got the terminals. You got the port. You got the dray careers. Everyone was constrained. What we did immediately was got together as a team would operate in and then concurrently engaged our customers. And we did a number of things. You brought up a few. We adjusted our rates -- the transactional rates and our surcharges to make sure that we could protect those customers that are with us year round. We also inserted some new processes in place. So we gave our customers new guidelines for when they could bring their containers in. We sat down and talk with our customers about container dwelling and chassis dwelling. I talked about this a little bit earlier. We inserted as much technology as we could, adjusting and getting a higher percentage of our customers to our ITR functions so that they could have greater visibility to when the containers would move. We work with our dray carriers and started technology there. So they have really crystal clear times on when they can drop off or pick up a container. So as we stand today real-time, we feel really good about where we are. Yes it was bumpy earlier in the quarter. I think our customers really appreciate how we have worked with them up to this point. What I would also tell you is that as we are working with them to insert more efficiency and rigor around those processes, it's opened up more opportunities for us. I feel very bullish about the fact that with what Jim is doing with the train service, what our terminals are doing we're handling as much as possible but we can still through efficiency and adding in a little bit more equipment get more volume out of it. So we're feeling pretty bullish about it. We're right there now. We -- I'll segment some of the commodities that you're talking about. We feel really good about grain and walking into this quarter the demand that's out there and the demand that should move in this quarter and I'll call it the near-term we should see more of that. If you look at the other industrial commodities I made the comment that they are improving sequentially. Now we can help with that we can go out and add business development wins on top of that. And that's what the team is focused on. Our marketing team has just done a great job of going out there with data analysis and looking at where we should be hunting, where we should look at prospect and where the leads are, where to reconnect with customers or smaller receivers that we've lost and the sales team has got a really good proactive look on how much business we're doing with them. So the markets are coming back slowly sequentially, which will help and we're going to accelerate that by going out there and win the business. Yeah. Thanks for that question. The short answer is yes. And that's not something new for us. I don't want you to think that we haven't done that. We've been assessing our land, looking at our land. I won't go into details of where we are and how we think about it longer term, but I can tell you that we would expect to take advantage of the resources near the port. Yes. So thanks for that question. I'll tell you we're encouraged by the recent numbers for housing starts here that came out earlier this week. What's more encouraging for us is the mix. So there's a stronger mix of single-family housing starts and the multi-family housing stars which works out well for us.  As a franchise, hey we enjoy some pretty long-haul shipments to Chicago down into Texas. And we feel good about our strategy and ability to compete along the I-5. I think what people fail to realize or sometimes miss is when we think about housing starts, we're just not thinking about the lumber. There's just so many other commodities that are behind it. You got cement, you've got PVC piping, you've got the rock, you've got plastic for the carpet. So housing starts just really fuel a lot of things. They got... Look I could go on. It really fuels a lot of things. So that's a very encouraging macroeconomic change for us. Yes. I think it's fair for us not to go in and try to arrange that out for you and just leave that the fact that, we like the fact that it's improving and we take advantage of moving not just that lumber of moving into the house, but everything associated with it. Yes. So I've got myself in trouble trying to size this grain market before. So what I will confirm for you is that you're right in line, it's going to be right in there with the highs over the last five years. It's going to be a really strong market. And so I can confirm that for you. I won't size it for you, but it's going to be a really strong market for us. We've seen significant growth in those three areas and I'm adding Mexico to it. And so the PNW, the Gulf and Mexico, we have seen significant emphasis on that significant growth and we've got high expectations for the quarter. Well let me start and then maybe Jennifer you want to talk about how we're handling it. But sure we've got lots of locomotives. I didn't even mention it this time. I think we've got 3,000 of them parked. So we won't be needing locomotives. If we could sell some of them and I'll leave that to Jennifer, but if we could do something and monetize them, I think we would but a pretty tough market. On the railcar side, it's depending on the mix of the traffic. We have cars, available cars parked, we've returned as many as we can to make us more efficient that way. So it's a mix on what we would have to add depending on the business. That's the way I look at it. If we were done operationally then you could say \"Boy if the business went up on one segment on the grain side, we'd have to go on and lease more cars to bring it in.\" We will not. We still have efficiency left to be able to \u2013 if the business goes up x, we're going to be half of that on the cars that we have to put in to be able to handle that business. And that's what I'm real comfortable with. Yes. And I want to add on this one Lance. So to Lance's point, you're right. We're thinking about it as what would we do if we're one railroad. And that's product development components associated with that not just service. It could be something a little bit more than that. It could be something \u2013 a physical footprint that's there. Obviously, the equipment efficiency plays a part of it. But on an analog basis how do we go out and win that truck traffic that's out there that we haven't been able to capture. No. I mean, the fact that we're sitting down with our customers, talking about these chassis, talking about the container dwell, giving them really good data points, managing with data. So yeah, that's good. Thank you. I don't have anything else. Yes. I mean parcel has been strong. We've gone out there -- the market has grown, but like I mentioned we've gone out there and had some pretty strong wins across the board on our parcel business. Expanding beyond parcel because parcel business is a pretty what I'll call service-sensitive business. I've been very proud of the team our loop teams our carry [indiscernible] team. We've been able to win some service-sensitive business with two large OEMs. All of this is truck traffic. One of them is a new entrant to rail so -- and the product is both short haul and long haul. So if you look at e-commerce and look at the service-sensitive markets the team and -- behind that service product has done a great job of growing it. Yes. So the two changes there is a strong reliable service product that we haven't had in some time. The other thing is a lower cost structure would also make piece of the business more attractive that we haven't seen. I made some comments around opening up new markets and gave some examples of long-haul business just a few minutes ago. But we're also seeing the same thing with some short-haul business -- short-haul carload business where again if we can add large pieces to existing train service or even small volume pieces to existing train service, it drops to the bottom line. But those two things alone have really enabled our sales team and our marketing team to be very pointed and deliberate in having conversations with our customers about truck conversions. We have. We certainly have room to grow. There's opportunity for us to grow. And we're excited and bullish on where we expect to be. But there's no part of this where we're ready to say that we've arrived or we're done. We've got a lot of room to grow here."

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Mr. Fritz, you may begin.\nLance Fritz: Thank you very much, Rob, and good morning, everybody, and welcome to Union Pacific's second quarter earnings conference call. With me today in Omaha practicing safe social distancing are Jim Vena, Chief Operating Officer; Kenny Rocker, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; and Jennifer Hamann, Chief Financial Officer.  Before discussing our second quarter results, I must first recognize the continued dedication of the women and men of Union Pacific. As we navigate the COVID-19 pandemic, our employees are protecting themselves and their coworkers in order to provide our customers with a service product that's fluid and uninterrupted. Our rail network continues to operate at a very high level as we provide a safer, more reliable and more efficient service product to our customers. As I reflect on what we dealt with and the results of the quarter, the true character of our organization was revealed, and it makes me very proud of the entire Union Pacific team.  Moving on to the second quarter results. This morning, Union Pacific is reporting 2020 second quarter net income of $1.1 billion or $1.67 per share. This compares to $1.6 billion or $2.22 per share in the second quarter of 2019, reflecting the economic impact of the pandemic and the challenge of overcoming a 24% decline in revenue, our quarterly operating ratio came in at 61%, a 1.4 percentage point increase compared to the second quarter of 2019. Despite the distractions created by the pandemic, our employees made progress on safety in the second quarter. For the first half of 2020, our employee safety results improved 5% versus 2019. I am very appreciative of our employees' continued focus on safety. Our second quarter results represent an achievement by the entire UP team as we dealt with a challenge unlike anything we've seen before. The women and men of Union Pacific answered the call to serve our customers, and the results provide further confirmation of the transformation our company has made through Unified Plan 2020.  So with that, I'll turn it over to Jim to provide an operations update.\nJim Vena: Thank you, Lance, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by echoing Lance's comments on how the UP team has performed throughout the pandemic. I'm extremely proud of the team's dedication to providing the safe and reliable service product to our customers. Our rail network remains fluid. I also want to commend the operating department on its performance over the past quarter, how the team managed through the rapid decline and eventual return of volume has been truly remarkable. The impact of all the changes we made is evident in our results this quarter. There remain many more opportunities ahead of us to further improve safety, asset utilization and network efficiency.  Turning to Slide 4. I'd like to update you on our key performance indicators, driven by continued improvement in asset utilization and fewer car classifications and car touches, freight car velocity improved at 11% compared to the second quarter of 2019. Freight car terminal dwell improved 16%, largely due to improved terminal processes and transportation plan changes to eliminate switches and touch points. We continue to implement changes in order to run a more efficient network that requires fewer locomotives. In the second quarter, we achieved a quarterly record in locomotive productivity, a 12% improvement versus last year. Workforce productivity, which includes all employees, was flat versus last year, reflecting the impact of the steep decline in volumes in April. As we've adjusted resources, realized productivity gains and seen volumes increase, this metric has rebounded strongly. In the quarter, the productivity improvements were boosted by reducing our train and engine workforce by 32%, which outpaced volume declines.  Trip plan compliance improved for both intermodal and manifest in autos during the quarter. This is a direct result of our focus on improving network efficiency and service reliability as part of our operating model. We had a strong first half of the year, and we expect to see continued improvements in our service product going forward.  Slide 5 highlights some of our recent network changes. Increasing train size remains 1 of our main areas of focus, and we are making excellent progress. Capital investments to extend sidings allow longer trains to run in both directions and reduce the number of train starts. There are around 40 projects included in the plan, and we have made good progress as 16,000, 15,000 foot sidings have now been completed through the first half of the year. We plan to have another 4 completed by the end of this month.  In addition, by putting more product on fewer trains, we have increased train length across our system by 23% to over 1,600 feet since the fourth quarter of 2018 to approximately 8,700 feet in the second quarter of 2020. This is a remarkable feat by the team to run longer trains with less volume while also making service gains. This indicates that we struck the right balance in prioritizing our actions during the quarter. We are continually modifying our transportation plan, including yard and local service to be more efficient. This contributed to our productivity gains by allowing us to reduce our daily crew starts while continuing to meet customer demands. We continue to make progress on our redesign of the intermodal network. As we've discussed before, we are completely redesigning our Chicago operations. In the second quarter, we closed Global 3, and additional changes will be completed by year-end. We are also redesigning the Houston area. Construction is underway at Settegast to consolidate our intermodal facilities into one location. In addition, we recently initiated construction at Houston Englewood Yard to expand switching capability and improve our ability to run longer trains out of that yard.  Let me wrap up. We remain committed to protecting our employees' health and safety and providing strong service to our customers. As customers have resumed operations and volume has been increasing over the past month or so, the operating team has done a great job of balancing our resources while also providing superior service to our customers. We stored locomotives and railcars strategically placed. We have had the resources available when and where we need them. In addition, we are recalling employees from furlough to meet crew demand. However, we are leveraging our efficiencies and not bringing back resources on a one-for-one basis with volume. We have made great progress to this point, and we will continue to transform our operations in order to further improve safety, service, asset utilization and network efficiency.  And with that, Kenny, it's all yours.\nKenyatta Rocker: Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the second quarter, our volume was down 20% as many of our market segments were negatively impacted from COVID pandemic effects on manufacturing and retail sectors. The decrease in volume, coupled with a 6% lower average revenue per car drove freight revenue to be down 24% in the quarter.  So let's take a closer look at how the second quarter played out for each of our business groups. Starting with bulk. Revenue for the quarter was down 17% on a 15% decrease in volume and a 3% decrease in average revenue per car.  Coal and renewable carloads were down 24% as a result of softer market conditions from historically low natural gas prices and soft export demand. Looking ahead, we expect continued challenges in coal as natural gas futures remain low. Also, weather conditions will continue to be a factor.  Volume from grain and grain products was down 6% as the pandemic reduced demand for ethanol and related products. This was partially offset by increased shipments of export feed grain. Looking forward, we continue to have a more positive outlook on grain exports due to purchases by China. In addition, we expect ethanol production to continue its recovery from historical lows in the second quarter.  Fertilizer and sulfur carloads were slightly down 2%, driven by a onetime shipment in 2019 related to tight barge capacity due to the [indiscernible]. Finally, food and beverage was down 21%, primarily driven by COVID related production challenges for import beer and supply chain shifts in other food products.  Industrial revenue declined 23% with an 18% decrease in volume. Average revenue per car also declined 6% due to negative mix and lower fuel store charge. Energy and specialized decreased 26%, primarily driven by reduced petroleum shipments due to low oil prices conversion with economic shutdown impact on demand. The second half of 2020 potential for crew by rail remains largely uncertain. If oil prices remain depressed, we anticipate continued year-over-year decline.  Forest product volume decreased by 11%. Fewer lumber shipments were driven by mill curtailments due to a reduction in housing starts. In addition, industrial chemicals and plastic shipments declined by 10% due to pandemic-related impacts on demand. Industrial chemicals volume had the largest reductions as these carloads are closely tied to industrial production.  Metals and minerals volumes decreased by 19% due primarily to reduced sand shipments from drilling budget reductions associated with the decline in oil prices and a surplus of local sand. We expect to see continued challenges in sand with oil prices, combined with the recent financial risk that frac sand producers are facing coupled with continued in-basin supply.  Turning to Premium. Revenue for the quarter was down 33% on a 23% decrease in volume. Average revenue per car declined 13% due to a negative mix in traffic. Automotive volume was down 64% for the quarter. Most North American plant productions were temporarily suspended during the first several weeks of the quarter, which depressed our automotive shipments of up to 90%, which was the lowest point during the quarter. The majority of the manufacturers resume production by mid-May, and our volume for the last week of the quarter recover within 15% and of 2019's volume.  Intermodal volume declined 12% year-over-year, driven largely by pandemic related items like shelter and place orders, which force retailers to temporarily close. Softer international and domestic truckload shipments were partially offset by strength in parcel shipments related to e-commerce. Weekly intermodal volumes bottomed in mid-April, down approximately 25% year-over-year, but our weekly run rates have been improving since that time.  Looking ahead, there still remains quite a bit of uncertainty as COVID evolves. As local economies reverse recent reopening, we remain watchful on their impact to supply chain. As we start off the third quarter, we are encouraged with the rebound in volume-driven by our premium business segment as automotive and intermodal supply chains restock inventory and adjust to evolving demand. E-commerce strength is likely to continue, and volumes will be bolstered by recent business wins. We will also be watching automotive demand and any potential downtime for auto plant retooling as it could pose challenges to our current run rates.  The U.S. light vehicle sales forecast for 2020 is at 13.2 million units, down 22% from 2019. In addition, we're closely watching unemployment levels and truck utilization rates as they have a direct impact on demand in a competitive landscape. While the macroeconomics for energy and industrial production are forecasted to be negative in the third quarter, we're focused on what we can control. In fact, the team has been able to win new business throughout our premium and manifest networks. Our car velocity improvements allow us to better compete with trucks and opens new markets for us.  And finally, I wanted to take an opportunity to thank our employees for the preventative measures they are using to stay safe and healthy. So we can keep operations running for our customers.  With that, I'll turn it over to Jennifer who's going to talk to you about our financial performance.\nJennifer Hamann: Thank you, Kenny, and good morning. As you heard from Lance earlier, Union Pacific is reporting second quarter earnings per share of $1.67 and a quarterly operating ratio of 61%. Looking a little deeper at our second quarter results compared to 2019, there are a couple of items I'd like to call out. Last year, we incurred higher weather-related expenses that negatively impacted the quarter. And in second quarter 2020, we received the final insurance recovery of $25 million related to 2019 weather. Together, these items favorably impacted our year-over-year operating ratio, 90 basis points and earnings per share by $0.05.  Additionally, you'll recall that we received a payroll tax refund in second quarter 2019 that added $0.04 to earnings per share and benefited the operating ratio by 70 basis points. Fuel provided a significant tailwind in the quarter as the year-over-year fuel price reduction favorably impacted our quarterly operating ratio 270 basis points and added $0.09 to earnings per share. While today's low fuel prices do provide a short term benefit, we prefer the trade-off of higher prices, coupled with increased business.  Looking at our core results, we took a step back on our operating ratio in the quarter, which deteriorated 430 basis points with the corresponding reduction in earnings per share of $0.72. Despite our swift and strong actions to cut costs and drive productivity, we could not fully offset the impact of the steep volume decline we experienced at the start of the second quarter.  Finally, our quarterly results include recognition of $69 million related to a real estate sale with the Illinois Tollway. While the sale does not impact our quarterly operating ratio, it added $0.07 to second quarter EPS. So all in, really solid results for our railroad despite some extraordinary circumstances.  Looking now at our second quarter income statement. 2020 operating revenue totaled $4.2 billion, down 24% versus last year on a 20% year-over-year volume decline. Demonstrating our ability to adjust cost with volume, operating expense decreased 22% to $2.6 billion. These results net to operating income of nearly $1.7 billion, a 27% decrease versus 2019. Other income of $131 million includes the real estate sale I just mentioned.  Interest expense increased 12% due to increased debt levels, while income tax expense was lower, down 25% as a result of lower pretax quarterly income. Net income of $1.1 billion declined 28% versus last year, which when combined with the impact of our share repurchase activity, led to a 25% decrease in earnings per share to $1.67.  Taking a more close look at second quarter revenue. Slide 15 provides a breakdown of our freight revenue, which totaled $4 billion, down 24% versus last year. Although the revenue decline was primarily driven by the 20% reduction in volume, the combination of price and mix negatively impacted revenue by about 2.25 points. The results of our pricing actions were positive in the quarter and continued to yield dollars in excess of inflation. However, those gains were more than offset by negative business mix related to steep declines in second quarter automotive, sand and crude volumes. In addition, a 43% decrease in diesel fuel prices in the quarter versus last year partially offset by the roughly 2 month lag in our fuel surcharge recovery programs impacted freight revenue by 2.25 points.  Now let's move to Slide 16, which provides a summary of our second quarter operating expenses. As you saw in Kenny's carloading chart, we experienced a pretty dramatic change in our business volumes through the quarter, dipping as low as 120,007 day carloads in April and then peaking near 150,000 to close the quarter. In the face of the volume decline, we reacted quickly to manage costs and adjust resources while still providing our customers with an excellent service product. As a result of these efforts, second quarter expenses were around 85% volume variable on a fuel adjusted basis, a strong achievement for the entire UP team, especially when you consider that we exited the quarter more rightsized than we entered it.  In terms of the different expense lines, compensation and benefits expense decreased 21% year-over-year, primarily as a result of workforce reductions and productivity initiatives. Second quarter workforce levels declined 22% or about 8,600 full-time equivalents versus last year and sequentially decreased 11%.  As Jim mentioned earlier, our train and engine workforce was more than volume-variable, down 32%, while management, engineering and mechanical workforces together decreased 17%. Fuel expense decreased 56% as a result of the significantly lower diesel fuel prices and lower volumes in the quarter, while our consumption rate was basically flat year-over-year. Purchase services and materials expense fell 23% in the quarter, as we used our locomotive fleet more productively, enabling us to store more locomotives and maintain a smaller active fleet. In addition, our loop subsidiary incurred less drayage expense as a result of auto plant shutdowns and lower intermodal volumes.  Equipment and other rents declined 19%, led by car higher savings and lower lease expense for both locomotives and freight cars. We are continuing to use freight cars more productively as evidenced by our gains in freight car velocity and terminal dwell. Other expense was only down 5% in the quarter, reflecting the somewhat fixed cost nature of this expense line. Although we benefited from running a safer railroad in the second quarter and saw reduced business travel expense, those savings were partially offset by lease impairments, lower equity income from our FXE investment and increases in state and local taxes, which makes up the majority of this cost category. The insurance recovery I mentioned earlier is also reflected in these results.  Looking now at productivity. We generated strong net productivity, totaling approximately $185 million in the second quarter. As Jim mentioned earlier, the operating department's continued progress on train length initiatives, balanced with an improved service product, was especially impressive this quarter, given the severe volume decline. And while we have already achieved the low end of the full year productivity range provided back in April, we do expect the pace of our productivity efforts to moderate some against a tougher second half comparison. We had a tailwind from weather events in the first half of 2019, which contrasts sharply with last year's strong second half productivity of $360 million. Nonetheless, our commitment to continued productivity is unwavering, and we now expect to exceed $500 million for full year 2020.  Moving on to cash and liquidity. As we've discussed previously, Union Pacific's strong balance sheet, our ability to generate cash and available liquidity enabled us to navigate the pandemic cost business fall off and remain in a position of strength.  Cash from operations in the first half of 2020 increased 13% versus 2019 to $4.4 billion. Free cash flow after capital investments totaled nearly $2.8 billion, resulting in a 107% cash conversion rate, which was helped a bit by first half income tax payment deferrals.  We finished the quarter at an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.9x as we continue to main strong investment-grade credit ratings from both Standard & Poor's and Moody's.  Cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $2.7 billion. Now this balance is more than we would typically hold and includes $300 million of short-term borrowing completed earlier in the second quarter to bolster our liquidity as well as the nearly $600 million in deferred tax payments I just referenced. Finally, in the second quarter, we returned value to our shareholders through our industry-leading quarterly dividend payout and remain committed to providing strong cash returns to our owners.  Turning now to our second half outlook. Although some items are more certain today than when we reported first quarter earnings back in April, there are still many unknowns. You just heard Kenny talk with some optimism about our second half 2020 business volumes, which are foundational to our guidance update. Assuming we maintain a consistent volume trend and we do not experience the second wave of economic shutdowns, we expect our full year volumes to be down 10% or so. As I pointed out earlier, we expect productivity to exceed $500 million for full year 2020. And with regard to pricing, our long-standing guidance is unchanged. We expect the total dollars generated from our pricing actions to exceed rail inflation costs. Although we are facing a very competitive marketplace today, we are committed to making sure each piece of business we move is earning an adequate return. Together, our expectations for volume, price and productivity should produce year-over-year operating ratio improvement on a full year basis in 2020.  While the year certainly isn't playing out the way we had earlier anticipated, we are very pleased by both our ability to manage costs in the downturn, as well as how we are now handling increased freight demand without adding back cost on a one-for-one basis.  In terms of cash generation and capital allocation, we are more bullish on both given our current outlook. Full year capital expenditures will likely come in a little more than $2.9 billion as we continue to make good progress on our renewal and productivity investments. We plan to maintain the dividend, but we are still paused as to share repurchases. We all see the news of COVID cases spiking in various parts of the U.S. and globally. So we plan to stay in a conservative posture for now. Longer term, our guidance of capital expenditures below 15% of revenue, a dividend payout ratio of 40% to 45% of earnings and ultimately, a 55% operating ratio remain intact.  Now before I turn it back to Lance, I would like to thank the exceptional employees of Union Pacific who continue to meet the service needs of our customers during this pandemic. They are leading the charge daily towards our collective goal of operating the safest, most efficient and most reliable railroad in North America.  So with that, I'll turn it back to Lance.\nLance Fritz: Thank you, Jennifer. Our first priority has been and will always be safety. We made good progress on safety in the first half of the year, and I expect continued improvement in the second half. From a service and efficiency perspective, we took another step forward toward our strategic priority of operational excellence. The experience of the past 3 to 6 months has validated why we are transforming our company through the Unified Plan 2020. Our ability to be nimble and flexible in adjusting our resources to a rapid, severe decline in volume, while also improving our service product demonstrates the strength of our service model. As we continue to navigate the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, our optimism for the future is unchanged. Union Pacific is well positioned for a future of long-term growth and excellent returns.  With that, let's open up the line for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And the first question is from Chris Wetherbee with Citi.\nChristian Wetherbee: Jim, maybe a sort of bigger picture question. When you think about you've been through in terms of a very rapid decline in volume and then kind of a bounce back as we've seen here, you clearly made some strong efforts to control costs and sort of rightsize the network to a degree. Do you think this sort of, I guess, improves the potential of the business as you look forward? Are there lessons learned from here structurally that I think will potentially benefit? And when you think out to 2021, if you'd allow me, I guess, maybe how should we be thinking about incremental margins? Is that changed? Is any of that math changed based on what you guys have done so far?\nJim Vena: Well, why don't I just start with the -- Chris, and I appreciate the question. So I think key to look at is you always learn something. And when you -- I've been in railroad for a long time. I've seen drop in business. This was a big drop. The good part about it was we were set up in the right way. We were productive before. We had already started in a lot of things, from engineering, mechanical, operations, local service, 5 hump yards shut down, touch points off. So we have done lots to be able to be ready for any action that was going to happen. And we took the right actions this quarter, and you can see it in the key performance metrics. Those are productivity numbers. Those are not against the -- so we were able to drop more than what the business level changed on us.  So what we learned was, and I knew it and the team knows it, there's more there. So what we figured out was we can do more with less and even more than we thought. So across the spectrum and how we look at it, we've always balanced, Chris, and this is really important, and you heard Kenny talk about this, it's about service, too. We did not take and make all the cuts just so that we could drop our cost down and impact our service because we want to win in the marketplace. And Kenny is optimistic that we're headed in the right way there.\nLance Fritz: And as regards your incremental margin question for next year, Chris, of course, we don't guide on incremental margin. But we do remain optimistic about in a world where we get volume growing. We're going to generate productivity. We've got a pricing structure that works that should generate improved margins.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.\nKenneth Hoexter: Lance or Jim, Jim you just mentioned kind of some increased competition and given the truck market is getting tighter and prices seem to be going up there. Are you referring more to rail to rail pricing competition? Maybe just give a little bit of thoughts on pricing. You mentioned kind of pricing moving above inflation. Maybe walk through a little bit more of the mix impact given the ARCs were down about 6% and give us some insight into the market.\nLance Fritz: Yes. Ken, let me start, and then I'm going to turn it over to Kenny to talk a little bit about what he sees in the pricing world. When we're talking about a very competitive market, it reflects both still a relatively loose, but tightening truck capacity market and strong competition from our rail competitors. So that's a level set we're talking both worlds. From the standpoint of mix, bear in mind, we mentioned it, but the automotive business is very good high ARC business. And in the first half of the quarter, it literally went to about zero. Kenny mentioned 90% off. But that all by itself is a significant mix impact. And Kenny, you want to talk about the pricing dynamics?\nKenyatta Rocker: Yes. Look, Ken, first of all, thanks for the question. And I just want to really iterate something that Jennifer mentioned, which is one, we have a positive pricing results and that we're going to exceed the cost of inflation. So it's critical we just kind of take that off the table. But as you look at the dynamics in the marketplace, I'll tell you, it was challenging to really price. What helps us is that we have a very strong service product. When you can walk in and talk to your customers about -- we're moving costs from their side, we're moving assets, delivering on time, getting the equipment on time, you're able to go in and have some really tough conversations to sell the price for the service that you're delivering on. So that's that.  To Lance's point, I do want to just talk about the automotive network coming back. If you look at the data points out there, the inventories are the lowest that they've been in the last 9 years. So we know the dealerships need to replenish. We've been talking to our OEM customers, and we'd expect retooling throughout the rest of the quarter, but maybe not as deep as what we thought it be or what we've seen in the past. We'll keep an eye on the fleet sales. But looking forward, we feel pretty optimistic. I feel pretty optimistic about how things are shaping up.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS.\nThomas Wadewitz: I wanted to see if you could talk a little bit more about some of the changes in the network. And how you think about, like, I guess, schedule and train starts and train length are kind of a good one to think about in terms of operating leverage. So I don't know, Jim, if you can offer some thoughts on like what was the reduction in train starts? And how much of the consolidation can persist as you go forward and you just show operating leverage in kind of longer trains as volume comes back?\nJim Vena: That's a great question. I love that question because that's exactly what we're trying to do. So we came in with productivity gains before the pandemic hit. So what we were able to do was we accelerated it. And if you take a look at the metrics underneath the productivity metrics, by having trains that are longer, we were able to have way less starts. So the starts are like 2 to 3x better than what they were on a flat basis. So that's important to us. The touches of the cars, the whole change in network of having less touch points was be able to take costs out. We spent a lot of time before the pandemic and then during the pandemic, we assigned the way we did local service, not the less on the amount of service we provide customers but be smart about how we service that. It was when they released the cars and we looked at our network, and that made a huge impact. So that's what we continue to do, Tom.  And the way I see it going forward, what's left, someone's going to ask me the question, and I will answer it, I'll save a question, is this, there is opportunity across the board in operations still. Is it as easy as walking in like I did the first day at Pine Bluff and said we're shutting it down and after I was here for two weeks? No. I don't think. But I've got my eye on a couple of yards that need to be tuned up. And if they don't tune up, they'll be gone. But other than that, I'm very happy with where we are, and we've got productivity across the board, as Jennifer said, on the $500 million. So hopefully, I answered your question, Tom.\nThomas Wadewitz: I guess, just to be clear, though, to the extent that you consolidate business differently with the train schedule than you did before, you don't have to change that as volume comes back. You can kind of keep that base and just run longer trains. Is that fair?\nJim Vena: Yes, sir. In fact, our trains, this morning, I look at it every morning or we're running over 9,000 feet. So we might have ended up at 87,000. But business is coming back, and we're putting more of that business on the same trains that we add out there running.\nOperator: The next question is coming from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski: And I guess, Jim or Lance, to follow-up from that question or that response, it's maybe not quite intuitive to us as we look from the outside end at train length going higher, it necessarily equates to better service for the customer. So can you help us understand how these structural changes and cost outcomes and efficiency actually result in better customer outcomes, too?\nLance Fritz: Yes. So let me start, and then I'll turn it over to Jim. One of the most astounding things to me, I've been with our railroad for 20 years now, and I was responsible for our operations for a bit of it. And if I look year-over-year, Jim mentioned this, our train starts -- the number of trains on our network at any given time are about 1/3 less, which is much more than what you see in volume. And how that translates into a service product is there's less network congestion on average anywhere you look, less meets passes, et cetera. So that allows each train, more free running time, and it really makes the network a little easier to dispatch, and that translates into a service product.\nJim Vena: You bet. And how does a -- how do you -- does the customer look at it? Service that we sell and we provide is what we sold to the customer. So if we agree that we're going to move x amount of tons in a month or we need to run and we have a service product our intermodal service product, our premium product is as good as anybody. We come out of that West Coast headed towards Texas, and we get in there faster than anybody. So that's what we measure ourselves against.  What is it that the customer wants? They want reliability. They want consistency and they want to save on their assets. A lot of them own their cars. And if we can turn them faster for them and not just over the road, but we turn them faster within the yard and are -- we're over 90% on our first-mile last-mile being able to spot the cars when we said that we were going to be there to give them service. So the customer wins, now what the longer trains do, we're not going to run longer trains just to run longer trains. You want to be more productive, but you also have to build the schedule so that the railcars move from origin to destination. And I'll give you an example. Instead of running 5 trains between L.A. and Chicago, we run 3.  We meet the schedules. We tell them what the engage is, and we build that in. Otherwise, I'll be honest, we could be running them even bigger if we did not take into account what the customer perspective was. But we're not done with that. I think -- and as we get closer -- I know this is a long answer, but this is important. As we get closer with the customer, we understand better and they understand what we can deliver, they'll work with us to say, when do you really need those containers when do you really need those railcars and there won't be as much buffer built into it and they trust that we're going to deliver, they'll be able to save even more costs on their side. So very excited about that. And that's the cool part about this is the time now, the next months as we transition into the next step of improving this place and making it the best operating railroad in North America. Long answer, I apologize, but I thought it was important to get it out.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.\nRavi Shanker: Lance, a question on nearshoring. Can you help us understand what kind of conversations you're having with your customers on this topic? Is this something that they think is like real and imminent? Or is something that's in very early stages and kind of take years to play out? And how is that likely to impact Union Pacific, both in terms of maybe some headwinds in international intermodal, but maybe tailwinds in other domestic moves?\nLance Fritz: Yes. Thank you for the question, Ravi. So let me start, and I want Kenny to help me with some of the detail. Many of our customers are discouraged by the impact to their supply chains during the COVID pandemic. It started with a hard shutdown in parts of China that really impacted inbound onto the West Coast and ended up with the United States taking shutdowns that impacted other parts of the supply chain and then some disconnects between ourselves and U.S. MCA countries. So without a doubt, most of our customers on the margin are at least thinking about what to do in their supply chains. And some of them are talking about readjusting to bring some of that back nearshore.  It's early innings, so I can't really point to any substantial investment that's occurred at this point in time in terms of executing on that. But I do know there's planning in place. And the net effect for us is going to be maybe an impact on inbound intermodal imports. But candidly, I would -- I think I would prefer having that manufacturing occur nearshore, gives us better opportunity for inbound and outbound and typically in a part of our commodities that are a bit higher ARC. Kenny?\nKenyatta Rocker: Yes. Lance, you're exactly right. Ravi, thanks for the question. We haven't seen any customers make any really concrete bets yet on their shoring. I will tell you, we feel good about the service product and the interchange points that we have coming out of Mexico. The one thing that a number of folks have really harped on the day is our premium and our intermodal network. And what I'll tell you is that our manifest network, our carload network benefits from a stronger service product. And so a lot of these short-term, short-haul lanes we're able to compete in because we do have a lower cost structure, and the car velocity is much longer now. And so as you think about nearshore, it becomes more of a sweet spot for us and we'll be prepared for it if it comes on.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\nScott Group: So I wanted to ask you, Jim, headcount's down about, I guess, 30% in 2 years. But that's -- if you look at it, it's pretty similar with other rails that have done PSR. And because volumes are down so much over that period, we haven't actually gotten much workforce productivity yet. So I guess my question is, do you think headcount needs to move up much at all as volumes are recovering here?\nJim Vena: Well, Scott, you're a little bit like Walter, a tough marker. I thought we'd be pretty good when we dropped 32% in TE&Y in the quarter versus the drop in business. But I understand what you're saying. I think...\nScott Group: Your slide says flat workforce productivity.\nJim Vena: Yes. And that's the entire company, and you'll see it improve as the business comes back. The numerator at the top when you drop that kind of miles sort of hurts you. But I'm not here to argue about what the stat is. This is the way I see it. I think we can be more productive in the entire company and meaning that we need less people. And as we transition, we're not hiring, okay? The normal attrition rate that goes out is going to go out. So our plan is in operations and the rest of the company, that we are going to be more productive. And I think in operations, you will continue to see us be more productive in pieces that we haven't even tackled yet as much as we should on our engineering side. And we've done a lot of work on the mechanical side. We've done a lot of work on the operations side, on the transportation side, but I think there's more there.  And listen, I see the same numbers you, Scott. I would have loved that number to be with the big drop in business, not be flat. Flat was a pretty tough thing for us to do. But as the business comes back, we're going to have less people to run -- operate the railroad and be still safe and efficient. So I'm looking forward to it.\nScott Group: Okay. And then, Jennifer, can I just ask you one real quick...\nJennifer Hamann: I was going to say, you can ask the follow-up, but let me just reiterate. We have said, I think, pretty clearly, Jim said it and so did I, we won't bring people back on a one-for-one with the business levels. And we're already doing that today.\nScott Group: Okay. Jennifer, I was just asking for any perspective on mix. So like yields of ex fuel have never been so bad this quarter. But last quarter, they were the best in 5 years. So the yields are obviously volatile quarter-to-quarter. Is there -- I know it's tough to forecast, but any thoughts on how to think about mix based on what you see so far in the third quarter?\nJennifer Hamann: No. I mean, you're right. It is very tough to forecast. I mean, we've tried to give everyone a little bit more information on that with the RTM data that we're now providing. And so hopefully, that's helpful. But you guys know where our business is -- has the highest ARC. I mean, autos, as you've heard us reference already today, was really a big factor in yields and in the mix impact in the second quarter. Certainly, that has come back here. In the third quarter. And so we'll continue to watch that. We don't see crude oil coming back. That was another impact to mix. Sand has been a headwind for us as well, and that's another one that's probably not going to change. So keep those things in mind and then just watch how the rest of the business plays out.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank.\nAmit Mehrotra: I just wanted to ask a quick question. There were some reports towards the end of June of equipment shortages on the West Coast because you are -- or the UP didn't have enough locomotives or cars in the context of kind of the surge of e-commerce volumes. I know those reports can sometimes not necessarily capture the whole story. So I wanted to ask you about it in terms of your readiness from an asset side to handle the sequential higher volumes.  And then I think, Kenny, I think you mentioned market share wins on the e-commerce side. I'm guessing that's with UPS. But I'm not sure, I'm sure you're not going to comment on that. But what hopefully you can comment on and just talk about as much as you can about the market share win and what the -- whether that's -- when we should see that? And what the context of that -- those wins were?\nLance Fritz: Thanks for the question. No, we do not have an equipment shortage. We had we have cars parked in places. I went for a train ride, and we had cars parked in places that I never thought that I would ever see cars park. They were parked everywhere, ready to go, and we had them close on hand. Locomotives, we had locomotives, we have more locomotives stored than we have operating. So we could double the business and -- well, not quite, we could probably triple the business and use the locomotives that we got stored. So we have lots of locomotives. People-wise, we were real smart about it. And the return, when we call people back, the people are returning. It's in the low 90s that people are accepting to come back to work, which is fantastic.  So we're not having to worry about having to retrain people, and we still have a lot of people furloughed. So given all that, what it is was some noise in 1 week, it's x, and then the next week, you want to do x plus 40% and somebody says, we're short of cars or short of people. Nobody can crank up our railroad running 2,000 different movements all over the place and in 1 week. So if somebody thought that was equipment shortage of people. The answer is no. It's just -- there was no way I was going to flow trains one way and have all the debt heads and extra costs. We took it on a systematic basis, and we're fluid now. The railroad is running smooth. And we're always going to have that a little bit of a lag. I mean that's the way to railroad. Somebody else might have done it differently. I would not have changed anything I did when we started back up and the business came back.\nKenyatta Rocker: So thanks a lot for that question, Amit. I just want to talk about the network first and just say what the rail site in extensions, it's made us more reliable. I reflect on our lane, call it, Southern California into the East Coast or Southeast. It's just a sweet spot for us. We put more and more volume on there. We've opened up the pie. When I talk about making the pie larger, I'm talking about trucks. And so yes, we have aligned ourselves with a number of e-commerce winners. We've been able to win business in those markets. We feel very bullish about the wins. They are coming on now. We're expecting more. We see that those wins in the parcel in the domestic, and we've got a nice win on the international intermodal side.  So I'll tell you, I haven't been as bullish about it as I am today, and we've got a great leader and Jason has leading up that area and Jim and his team are ready for it.\nAmit Mehrotra: Okay. That sounds really great. For my follow-up question very quickly, Jennifer, based on the volume guidance for this year, you're obviously assuming just higher absolute revenue levels versus the second quarter, which is not really that far, right, given how bad the second quarter was. But like some other rails, you also took kind of the opportunity of COVID to really accelerate some of the structural cost reductions. So if you're getting several, several, several hundred million dollars more of revenue in the third quarter and fourth quarter relative to the second quarter, I just -- I'm not going to ask the incremental margin question because I know the answer I'm going to get. But the question I'm going to ask is just help us qualitatively think about what the incremental costs need to come back to service that? Are we just talking about higher absolute fuel and some car hire? Are we talking about more people? Like what needs to happen to service $600 million, $700 million more of revenue in the next quarter or this quarter, rather?\nJennifer Hamann: Well, I think you kind of answered your own question there a little bit. I mean, again, we won't do things on a one-for-one basis. But at some point, you will need to add train starts as the volume grows, and there's people associated with that. There's locomotives, there's freight cars, car hire, and you're going to burn a little more fuel. So you're going to have all of those things we'll be part of it to move additional revenue. Our task and what we feel very confident about is that we will be able to do that in a more efficient way as the volumes come back, and we look forward to that because volume is definitely the friend of a railroad. So I think I'll leave it at that.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan.\nBrian Ossenbeck: This is one for Jim and Jennifer. Now that volumes are of the trough here, have you assessed the level of excess locomotives and cars on the network at this point? Can you rationalize that a bit. And in any significant way, are there leases to return, foreign cars to get rid of in more maintenance shops to consolidate?  And then I guess for Jennifer, when you go through that math, is it large enough to impair and dispose of them so you can pull out of group accounting and they'll get hit by those depreciation studies that we often see a couple of years down the road?\nJim Vena: Well, listen, I appreciate it, Brian. Nice to talk to you this morning. At the end of the day, we've identified what's excess. We always want to keep a buffer so we work very close hand-in-hand with Jennifer and our old group to say, these are excess, what can you do about it? So I'll let Jennifer answer the next question. I think if there was people that wanted to purchase locomotives, if at the right price, we're not going to give them away. But at the right price, we would be more than willing to do that.\nJennifer Hamann: Jennifer? Yes. I mean, I think we've had a bit of a for sale sign up for locomotives for a little while now, but there's not much of a market, particularly with the COVID impact of volumes. And then really the whole rail network going through similar activities with PSR. So we do look at what locomotives, we think are most likely to bring back into service and make adjustments as needed. That's kind of continual activity for the team. And if there's anything that we would do that is of a significant nature. We'd certainly talk to folks about it, but we feel pretty good where we're at right now.\nLance Fritz: And it's not just the whole rationalization of the railroad, what we've been able to identify, in Chicago when we consolidate and at the end of the year, we're going to have our new facility -- expanded facility at G2 opened up, we have a facility at G1 that's pretty close to Downtown Chicago that becomes excess, property on the South side excess, property also in other locations. So all those are available that Jennifer and her team to go out there and see we can monetize and bring some more value to this company. So I'm very excited.\nJennifer Hamann: Yes. And it's latent capacity to grow into as well.\nLance Fritz: Absolutely.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens.\nJustin Long: So I wanted to ask about the volume guidance for a decline of 10% in 2020. Can you talk about what that assumes for the pace of the recovery in the back half of the year just generally? And then thinking about the quarterly cadence of volumes, even if it's just directionally, I mean, is your expectation that we could remain in this down double-digit range in the third quarter and then see an improvement in the fourth as the comp fees? Or is there any color around that quarterly cadence you can provide?\nLance Fritz: Yes. Justin, thanks for the question. This is Lance. So our full year guidance of down 10%, if you do the math, that says the back half is going to be somewhere in the, call it, 9%, 10% down. How it breaks out quarter-to-quarter is something that is very difficult to estimate right now. Kenny has done a good job of sharing with you all the confidence he is growing and building as wins are starting to show up on the railroad. It's one thing to secure a domestic intermodal win in March. And then in the second quarter, nothing shipped. And now as retail is starting to restock, we'll start seeing some of those shipments occur. So it's a little bit difficult to parse it out exactly for you. So I won't attempt to do that. But your math broadly is right. In the second half, you're going to have to be in that down 9% or 10% to hit down 10%. And we're growing our optimism here in the near term.\nJustin Long: Okay. And just to clarify, that down 10%, is that a reference to RTMs or carloads?\nLance Fritz: That's a volume number. That's a carload number.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nAllison Landry: Jim, so I mean, clearly, it sounds like there's still a lot left to do in terms of reducing touch points and making structural changes to train design and just the overall network. But even with the changes that you've made so far, it would seem that you still haven't realized that the full margin benefit given the leap volumes for the last several quarters. So to the extent that the volume backdrop is cooperative in 2021 and maybe 2022, how quickly do you think you can get to the 55 long term OR target?\nJim Vena: Well, Allison, I appreciate the question. We have a goal of 55, and you never hear me say a number on purpose because I'm just not -- I like to deliver it. But you -- structurally, you are absolutely correct. Kenny and his team bring the business back, which we see some wins, and we see some optimism from Kenny. We grow this company, which I think we can with the service product we have. I've just stay tuned. I think it's going to look pretty good. So I appreciate the question.\nJennifer Hamann: I guess I can jump in here because...\nJim Vena: All I said was stay tuned, okay?\nJennifer Hamann: And you're spot on, Jim. I was just going to say, we need all 3 levers, and that's you've heard us say that very consistently we need Kenny and team to bring in the volume and the price. And then we've got the productivity that certainly, Jim and the operating group are responsible for a big portion of that, but it's a whole team effort in terms of driving productivity and building on that good service product. So it's all together.\nJim Vena: Yes, Alison, I think she was worried I was going to use the word blow by. And I promised her I did, I was not going to use that today, okay?\nLance Fritz: Not today.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna.\nBascome Majors: Just to follow-up on that, Jim. A year, 1.5 years ish into the job now, clearly, you didn't have to go back to work. It seems you took this because you saw a tremendous opportunity at UP among other rails. When all is said and done and the world is back to some similar of normal, do you think UP has the potential to have the best operating margin returns or any other North American railroads? Or is the jury still out on that one?\nJim Vena: Bascome, I appreciate it. You're absolutely right. I came because I thought it was a great company, great network, great group of people. And when Lance and I talked when I joined, the whole team wants to win. And I tell you, it's a great team. And it doesn't matter whether I'm here or not. I'll be honest. We're building it so we have strength in the long term. And yes, this railroad has the capability to be the best margin railroad in North America, lowest operating costs, bar none. So my job is to make sure that we get there and we deliver and have the right strength behind whenever I leave that the team -- they don't even miss me. In fact, they get better than when I was here, and I can watch them from my rocking chair when I'm 90 years old and enjoy it.\nLance Fritz: Bascome, this is Lance. I'll bring us back to something we've historically talked about all the time, and that is we're building this better operating model, this service excellence, operational excellence on a franchise that's the best in the industry. We've got the wonderful Gulf Coast franchise. We've got Great East West corridors. We've got a great I-5 corridor. We service Mexico better and to a greater extent than anyone else in the industry. We are set for a very bright future.\nBascome Majors: I appreciate that from both of you. Maybe to follow-up slightly on kind of the same thing. I know you've already been asked about a time line to 55. And I guess that's understandable. I think Rob rolled that out in 2016. So it's been out there for a while. But Lance, earlier this year, and clearly, a lot has changed since January. You suggested there might be some kind of investor event to sketch out kind of how you expect to get -- or where you expect to go over the next couple of years. Sometime later this year. Clearly, a lot has changed since then. But I'm curious, either Lance or Jim, when you think you might be in a position to kind of share what you're managing to over the next 2 to 3 years.\nLance Fritz: Yes, that's a great question, Bascome. And you got it exactly right. I think it's opportune time to start talking to or have a concentrated moment where we speak to our investors about the game plan looking forward in a holistic way. And we would have loved to have done that this fall. That's just not going to work with COVID. So stay tuned. We haven't announced anything, but I would imagine it will be sometime in the first half of next year, presuming that we can do it safely and in a manner that protects everybody's health.\nJennifer Hamann: Because we'd really like to do something like that in person and be able to get the team together. I think it's important for you all to see the UP team, the management team below who you normally talk to. And I think in person is the best way to do that.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen.\nJason Seidl: I trust you all or well. How are you thinking about sort of that post Labor Day peak season, especially as we've seen a much, much stronger July and a rebound, assuming that we don't have any more step backs in the reopening of our country? I'd love to hear your thoughts on that. And do you think it will be a strong enough environment to push through a PSS on surcharge?\nLance Fritz: Ken?\nKenyatta Rocker: Well, I'll start from the back first. I'd say premature right now to talk about a surcharge. Obviously, the demand is picking up. What I would tell you is that our volumes are really increasing each week. They're pretty strong. All the dynamics show that we're going to have a pretty solid peak season, the warehouses, warehouse inventory is normalized. So you don't have a lot of product in storage. E-commerce has been pretty strong. Retail has been improving sequentially each month. So it looks to me, barring any type of second wave that we're going to be in a really good position to have a really solid peak season.\nJason Seidl: I just knocked on wood for you there. My follow-up question, Kenny, I'm going to stick with you here. I think you mentioned that some of the beer shipments were down in the quarter. We were hearing there was a lot of sort of out of stocks, if you will, heading into July 4. Is that fixing itself on the beverage side as we move to sort of the next beverage holiday, if you will, and Labor Day?\nKenyatta Rocker: It is. Again, Jason, the run rate on our beer shipments are improving each week. What we saw in the second quarter was COVID-related downtime, production downtime, that's behind us now. And so we feel really good about those shipments heading into the holiday.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets.\nWalter Spracklin: So I was wondering if I could direct this question to Jim. And Jim, if you could go back and draw a parallel, if it exists, between how you're operating versus your competitor, PSR railroad versus a non-PSR? And how similar that was when you were operating CN versus CP before Hunter? I mean, obviously, CN had some structural advantages from a cost perspective that allowed it to win in the marketplace, more often than not. Do you see the same parallel here with Burlington Northern? And do you notice that the PSR versus non-PSR effect, particularly when you're competing for new business?\nJim Vena: Well, Walter, listen, that's a tricky question. I don't talk about how somebody else is operating. What I want to be able to do is operate -- be the best operator in the industry so we have a better chance to win. There are certain markets that are a competitor on a rail side is going to win because they have a better network in that piece and let them win that. And then we have a great network, and we're going to win. But bottom line is if you can have a lower cost structure, what it does is it opens you up for a new truck opportunity. It opens you up for more fluidity because the customer sees how you're able to move more product with less railcars for them. And you win on a head-to-head, and it gives you some pricing advantage in some areas. And Kenny has been real clear. We're all about making sure that we price ahead of what inflation is, rail cost inflation, and we're going to do that. So that's where you want to win. I think you win by having the most efficient railroad and you win in a number of lanes, not just one.\nKenyatta Rocker: Let me add on to that -- this is Kenny, real quick. First of all, we've got a really strong competitor in the West. And a lot of respect there. Our commercial team is really focused on opening up new markets and making the pie larger, and we've talked about that a little bit on the call today, talked about a lot of the business that we're winning that short-haul business that in the past, because we didn't have the car velocity or the reliability or the lower cost structure, we weren't able to compete with the trucks on. And then I've also talked about a lot of these long-haul lanes that we're opening up the markets on. So our team focus is really on expanding the pie. And when I say that, I'm clearly looking at the truck markets.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. It appears we lost David's line. Our next question then will come from the line of John Chappell with Evercore.\nJonathan Chappell: Good morning. As far as the average revenue per car is concerned, I mean, I understand the mix and the fuel surcharge. But if you look at these segment breakdown, there's some pretty big declines in like metals and coal and obviously food and refrigerated. So just as we think about the 10% carload guidance for the full year, in 1Q, revenue was better by 400 basis points versus carloads and 2Q, it was worse by 400 basis points. How do we think about the revenue versus the carload in the second half of the year with that 10% carload guidance?\nJim Vena: Yes. So let's talk a little bit more broadly. And then Jennifer, I'll bring it down to you for specific commentary on the guidance he's looking for. John, when we're thinking about the volume looking forward, there's still going to be weak spots for us. Kenny mentioned them. Frac sand is likely still to be weak. Coal is -- who knows what it will do, but it's not terribly strong. You probably got some weakness in some of the industrial products, areas that are oriented towards shale-related plays. But absent those, setting them aside, most everything else should be showing improvement certainly from the second quarter. And so when you think about it like that and you first and foremost take automotive, finished vehicles, high ARC business off the table is a substantial headwind, the big headwinds really come off the table. There's still a little bit of headwind in frac sand, maybe a few others. But to that point, there's tailwinds that are going to start showing up like in automotive.\nJennifer Hamann: Yes. And I would just add to that. I mean, so when you're talking about ARC, obviously, that's going to be driven by the business mix. And when you look at -- I'll take it up a step from where you were talking to it, through our 3 groups. You've got industrial, that is our highest ARC business. And then you've got the bulk, which is next and then the premium, which has the lowest ARC. And so if you think about it just in terms of kind of those broad segments, you're hearing us talk about being able to drive significant growth on the premium side of the business. Autos is just part of that. And then the industrial piece, that's where we're still seeing negative industrial production forecast for third quarter. So I would think about it in kind of those broad economic things. And don't forget about fuel. Obviously, fuel surcharge is part of ARC fuel prices were significantly a part of the impact there in terms of the second quarter. And we're not looking for fuel prices to increase or really change dramatically going from 2Q to 3Q. So that year-over-year impact is going to be there as well.\nOperator: The next question is coming from the line of David Ross with Stifel.\nDavid Ross: Just want to get a little bit dirty and talk about coal. Is it 50% lower from here in a few years? Is there a scenario you can see where it's higher? How do you structurally think about the coal business? And anything that you can do to mitigate the slide that we've seen?\nLance Fritz: Kenny?\nKenyatta Rocker: Yes. Thanks for the question, David. It's -- we're going to have challenges here in the near term and long term. It's in structural decline. Obviously, there are some ins and outs with what happens with low natural gas. We're staying very close to our customers and make sure we can stay competitive with them, with each deal that comes up. But overall, we're just trying to backfill where we can because we do know that over time, it's going to continue to leak.\nDavid Ross: And no scenario where it doesn't leak?\nKenyatta Rocker: We don't see that. I think there is a scenario where we try to slow down the slope so that it's not a steep slope. But I -- we'd expect that it will continue to just gradually decline.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein.\nDavid Vernon: Sorry about that, the joys of work from home and muted lines. So Lance, I wanted to ask you a question about big picture returns. If you look at the last couple of years, you guys have done a great job offsetting the headwinds from asset turnover through the margin expansion and a lower tax rate to kind of stabilize the return profile of the business. As we look ahead, what can you guys do to kind of fix that revenue asset turnover question?  And we talk a lot about service getting better and taking revenue from truck. Is that going to be enough to get the asset turnover moving in the right direction as you kind of get to whatever stable level are you're going to be at?\nLance Fritz: Yes, it's a great question, David. And I'll start by saying, we do believe that the new service product, the lower cost structure, opening up markets to us and Kenny's commercial team putting more of their posture on their front foot from a sales and business development perspective, all of that combines to definitely give us a better opportunity to get asset utilization up. I feel pretty good about that. I think there's plenty of opportunity. I look at our served markets, which are very broad. We touch a lot of the economy. And absent this immediate COVID impact and the behavioral changes that are in the near term, over the longer term, I think the argument for the United States and for North America is still pretty darn strong. That doesn't mean we're not looking at other things. We're always looking at ways to be more important to our customers, to serve them better, to play a different role in the supply chain, if it makes sense. But I think our core business has a really good opportunity to continue generating both good margin and good ROIC.\nDavid Vernon: Do you think you need to kind of invest more in some of that collaborative supply chain kind of resource within the company to unlock that potential? Or do you think you've got the right level of kind of commercial focus on that? I know if you look back and look at CN's transition from the Hunter's way or highway to the [indiscernible] world of [indiscernible], is that something that is in the path for the company? Is that something you think you're going to be putting some effort into in the coming years?\nLance Fritz: I think what we're focused on is making sure Kenny has got the right culture and team members so that business development happens at the pace and magnitude that we think we should be capable of I believe we're in process there. That might take some investments, and we've talked a little bit about it, and there are small cost investment, large impact, like Salesforce, Pros as a pricing tool, tableau is a analytical tool, others. We talk about our APIs and making customers see more value and be stickier with us, and that's a manifestation of our net control investment. We talk about product development and making sure that we're doing what we need to do to serve the parts of the market that are now open to us.  But in addition to that, kind of getting at your question, I wouldn't be surprised if there are other investments we make that look more like the activity Loop does, where you're providing ancillary services from the railroad, but they are primary services to a customer. And it makes us a more valuable supplier, it makes us stickier and opens up even more markets for us.  I think you're definitely onto something there, David. And it will be part of the conversation we talk about when we're at a moment in time having an Analyst Day.\nOperator: We have time for one additional question, which is coming from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs.\nJordan Alliger: A question is to intermodal question. With all the service improvements that you've made in intermodal and trip plan compliance going up, do you think the gap required to really accelerate truck conversions, the price gap between rail and truck has narrowed? And what do you think the gap needs to be to really push the truck conversion thesis forward?\nKenyatta Rocker: Yes. Thanks a lot, Jordan. First of all, we're nowhere near the levels that we enjoy in 2018, the back half of 2018, where there were some pretty large gaps. When we look at the forecast, we certainly expect that the truck utilization and those rates will improve monthly well into 2021, which will put us in a better position to not only win more business, but get a little bit more margin on that business. Having said that, we certainly aren't waiting around for something to happen. We're going after it right now. We feel good about the wins that we've made that we know will show up here in the near term. And it's broadly across the intermodal network. It's not just the international, it's not just the domestic, it's pretty broad, it's is the parcel also. So we feel like we're capturing those wins right now, and we're excited to see them come on and onboard over the next several weeks. And we expect to continue to grab more share.\nLance Fritz: Jordan, let me put a little exclamation point on that for Kenny. So during the past domestic intermodal bid season, which happened at, call it, starting late last year, but really at the heart of it was April, March, February this year, a little bit of May, that's right in the heart of the worst decline in volumes across the network, not just us but trucks. So trucks were loose, pricing was tough. In that environment, Kenny's team grew share of wins. Now it didn't ship. It's starting to ship now. That's why Kenny is confident in the manner is on our domestic intermodal product. But for me, that's a proof statement that we don't have to wait for the gap between rail and truck to get better. Our service product, our ability to price and earn a margin in today's environment is such where we have an ability to penetrate against truck right now.\nOperator: At this time, I'll now turn the floor back to Mr. Lance Fritz for closing comments.\nLance Fritz: And thank you, Rob, again, and thank you all for your questions and for joining us this morning on our call. We look forward to talking with you again in October to discuss our third quarter 2020 results. Until then, I wish you all good health. Take care and enjoy the rest of your day.\nOperator: Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Jim Vena",
            "content": "Thank you, Lance, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by echoing Lance's comments on how the UP team has performed throughout the pandemic. I'm extremely proud of the team's dedication to providing the safe and reliable service product to our customers. Our rail network remains fluid. I also want to commend the operating department on its performance over the past quarter, how the team managed through the rapid decline and eventual return of volume has been truly remarkable. The impact of all the changes we made is evident in our results this quarter. There remain many more opportunities ahead of us to further improve safety, asset utilization and network efficiency.  Turning to Slide 4. I'd like to update you on our key performance indicators, driven by continued improvement in asset utilization and fewer car classifications and car touches, freight car velocity improved at 11% compared to the second quarter of 2019. Freight car terminal dwell improved 16%, largely due to improved terminal processes and transportation plan changes to eliminate switches and touch points. We continue to implement changes in order to run a more efficient network that requires fewer locomotives. In the second quarter, we achieved a quarterly record in locomotive productivity, a 12% improvement versus last year. Workforce productivity, which includes all employees, was flat versus last year, reflecting the impact of the steep decline in volumes in April. As we've adjusted resources, realized productivity gains and seen volumes increase, this metric has rebounded strongly. In the quarter, the productivity improvements were boosted by reducing our train and engine workforce by 32%, which outpaced volume declines.  Trip plan compliance improved for both intermodal and manifest in autos during the quarter. This is a direct result of our focus on improving network efficiency and service reliability as part of our operating model. We had a strong first half of the year, and we expect to see continued improvements in our service product going forward.  Slide 5 highlights some of our recent network changes. Increasing train size remains 1 of our main areas of focus, and we are making excellent progress. Capital investments to extend sidings allow longer trains to run in both directions and reduce the number of train starts. There are around 40 projects included in the plan, and we have made good progress as 16,000, 15,000 foot sidings have now been completed through the first half of the year. We plan to have another 4 completed by the end of this month.  In addition, by putting more product on fewer trains, we have increased train length across our system by 23% to over 1,600 feet since the fourth quarter of 2018 to approximately 8,700 feet in the second quarter of 2020. This is a remarkable feat by the team to run longer trains with less volume while also making service gains. This indicates that we struck the right balance in prioritizing our actions during the quarter. We are continually modifying our transportation plan, including yard and local service to be more efficient. This contributed to our productivity gains by allowing us to reduce our daily crew starts while continuing to meet customer demands. We continue to make progress on our redesign of the intermodal network. As we've discussed before, we are completely redesigning our Chicago operations. In the second quarter, we closed Global 3, and additional changes will be completed by year-end. We are also redesigning the Houston area. Construction is underway at Settegast to consolidate our intermodal facilities into one location. In addition, we recently initiated construction at Houston Englewood Yard to expand switching capability and improve our ability to run longer trains out of that yard.  Let me wrap up. We remain committed to protecting our employees' health and safety and providing strong service to our customers. As customers have resumed operations and volume has been increasing over the past month or so, the operating team has done a great job of balancing our resources while also providing superior service to our customers. We stored locomotives and railcars strategically placed. We have had the resources available when and where we need them. In addition, we are recalling employees from furlough to meet crew demand. However, we are leveraging our efficiencies and not bringing back resources on a one-for-one basis with volume. We have made great progress to this point, and we will continue to transform our operations in order to further improve safety, service, asset utilization and network efficiency.  And with that, Kenny, it's all yours. Well, why don't I just start with the -- Chris, and I appreciate the question. So I think key to look at is you always learn something. And when you -- I've been in railroad for a long time. I've seen drop in business. This was a big drop. The good part about it was we were set up in the right way. We were productive before. We had already started in a lot of things, from engineering, mechanical, operations, local service, 5 hump yards shut down, touch points off. So we have done lots to be able to be ready for any action that was going to happen. And we took the right actions this quarter, and you can see it in the key performance metrics. Those are productivity numbers. Those are not against the -- so we were able to drop more than what the business level changed on us.  So what we learned was, and I knew it and the team knows it, there's more there. So what we figured out was we can do more with less and even more than we thought. So across the spectrum and how we look at it, we've always balanced, Chris, and this is really important, and you heard Kenny talk about this, it's about service, too. We did not take and make all the cuts just so that we could drop our cost down and impact our service because we want to win in the marketplace. And Kenny is optimistic that we're headed in the right way there. That's a great question. I love that question because that's exactly what we're trying to do. So we came in with productivity gains before the pandemic hit. So what we were able to do was we accelerated it. And if you take a look at the metrics underneath the productivity metrics, by having trains that are longer, we were able to have way less starts. So the starts are like 2 to 3x better than what they were on a flat basis. So that's important to us. The touches of the cars, the whole change in network of having less touch points was be able to take costs out. We spent a lot of time before the pandemic and then during the pandemic, we assigned the way we did local service, not the less on the amount of service we provide customers but be smart about how we service that. It was when they released the cars and we looked at our network, and that made a huge impact. So that's what we continue to do, Tom.  And the way I see it going forward, what's left, someone's going to ask me the question, and I will answer it, I'll save a question, is this, there is opportunity across the board in operations still. Is it as easy as walking in like I did the first day at Pine Bluff and said we're shutting it down and after I was here for two weeks? No. I don't think. But I've got my eye on a couple of yards that need to be tuned up. And if they don't tune up, they'll be gone. But other than that, I'm very happy with where we are, and we've got productivity across the board, as Jennifer said, on the $500 million. So hopefully, I answered your question, Tom. Yes, sir. In fact, our trains, this morning, I look at it every morning or we're running over 9,000 feet. So we might have ended up at 87,000. But business is coming back, and we're putting more of that business on the same trains that we add out there running. You bet. And how does a -- how do you -- does the customer look at it? Service that we sell and we provide is what we sold to the customer. So if we agree that we're going to move x amount of tons in a month or we need to run and we have a service product our intermodal service product, our premium product is as good as anybody. We come out of that West Coast headed towards Texas, and we get in there faster than anybody. So that's what we measure ourselves against.  What is it that the customer wants? They want reliability. They want consistency and they want to save on their assets. A lot of them own their cars. And if we can turn them faster for them and not just over the road, but we turn them faster within the yard and are -- we're over 90% on our first-mile last-mile being able to spot the cars when we said that we were going to be there to give them service. So the customer wins, now what the longer trains do, we're not going to run longer trains just to run longer trains. You want to be more productive, but you also have to build the schedule so that the railcars move from origin to destination. And I'll give you an example. Instead of running 5 trains between L.A. and Chicago, we run 3.  We meet the schedules. We tell them what the engage is, and we build that in. Otherwise, I'll be honest, we could be running them even bigger if we did not take into account what the customer perspective was. But we're not done with that. I think -- and as we get closer -- I know this is a long answer, but this is important. As we get closer with the customer, we understand better and they understand what we can deliver, they'll work with us to say, when do you really need those containers when do you really need those railcars and there won't be as much buffer built into it and they trust that we're going to deliver, they'll be able to save even more costs on their side. So very excited about that. And that's the cool part about this is the time now, the next months as we transition into the next step of improving this place and making it the best operating railroad in North America. Long answer, I apologize, but I thought it was important to get it out. Well, Scott, you're a little bit like Walter, a tough marker. I thought we'd be pretty good when we dropped 32% in TE&Y in the quarter versus the drop in business. But I understand what you're saying. I think... Yes. And that's the entire company, and you'll see it improve as the business comes back. The numerator at the top when you drop that kind of miles sort of hurts you. But I'm not here to argue about what the stat is. This is the way I see it. I think we can be more productive in the entire company and meaning that we need less people. And as we transition, we're not hiring, okay? The normal attrition rate that goes out is going to go out. So our plan is in operations and the rest of the company, that we are going to be more productive. And I think in operations, you will continue to see us be more productive in pieces that we haven't even tackled yet as much as we should on our engineering side. And we've done a lot of work on the mechanical side. We've done a lot of work on the operations side, on the transportation side, but I think there's more there.  And listen, I see the same numbers you, Scott. I would have loved that number to be with the big drop in business, not be flat. Flat was a pretty tough thing for us to do. But as the business comes back, we're going to have less people to run -- operate the railroad and be still safe and efficient. So I'm looking forward to it. Well, listen, I appreciate it, Brian. Nice to talk to you this morning. At the end of the day, we've identified what's excess. We always want to keep a buffer so we work very close hand-in-hand with Jennifer and our old group to say, these are excess, what can you do about it? So I'll let Jennifer answer the next question. I think if there was people that wanted to purchase locomotives, if at the right price, we're not going to give them away. But at the right price, we would be more than willing to do that. Well, Allison, I appreciate the question. We have a goal of 55, and you never hear me say a number on purpose because I'm just not -- I like to deliver it. But you -- structurally, you are absolutely correct. Kenny and his team bring the business back, which we see some wins, and we see some optimism from Kenny. We grow this company, which I think we can with the service product we have. I've just stay tuned. I think it's going to look pretty good. So I appreciate the question. All I said was stay tuned, okay? Yes, Alison, I think she was worried I was going to use the word blow by. And I promised her I did, I was not going to use that today, okay? Bascome, I appreciate it. You're absolutely right. I came because I thought it was a great company, great network, great group of people. And when Lance and I talked when I joined, the whole team wants to win. And I tell you, it's a great team. And it doesn't matter whether I'm here or not. I'll be honest. We're building it so we have strength in the long term. And yes, this railroad has the capability to be the best margin railroad in North America, lowest operating costs, bar none. So my job is to make sure that we get there and we deliver and have the right strength behind whenever I leave that the team -- they don't even miss me. In fact, they get better than when I was here, and I can watch them from my rocking chair when I'm 90 years old and enjoy it. Well, Walter, listen, that's a tricky question. I don't talk about how somebody else is operating. What I want to be able to do is operate -- be the best operator in the industry so we have a better chance to win. There are certain markets that are a competitor on a rail side is going to win because they have a better network in that piece and let them win that. And then we have a great network, and we're going to win. But bottom line is if you can have a lower cost structure, what it does is it opens you up for a new truck opportunity. It opens you up for more fluidity because the customer sees how you're able to move more product with less railcars for them. And you win on a head-to-head, and it gives you some pricing advantage in some areas. And Kenny has been real clear. We're all about making sure that we price ahead of what inflation is, rail cost inflation, and we're going to do that. So that's where you want to win. I think you win by having the most efficient railroad and you win in a number of lanes, not just one. Yes. So let's talk a little bit more broadly. And then Jennifer, I'll bring it down to you for specific commentary on the guidance he's looking for. John, when we're thinking about the volume looking forward, there's still going to be weak spots for us. Kenny mentioned them. Frac sand is likely still to be weak. Coal is -- who knows what it will do, but it's not terribly strong. You probably got some weakness in some of the industrial products, areas that are oriented towards shale-related plays. But absent those, setting them aside, most everything else should be showing improvement certainly from the second quarter. And so when you think about it like that and you first and foremost take automotive, finished vehicles, high ARC business off the table is a substantial headwind, the big headwinds really come off the table. There's still a little bit of headwind in frac sand, maybe a few others. But to that point, there's tailwinds that are going to start showing up like in automotive."

            "name": "Jennifer Hamann",
            "content": "Thank you, Kenny, and good morning. As you heard from Lance earlier, Union Pacific is reporting second quarter earnings per share of $1.67 and a quarterly operating ratio of 61%. Looking a little deeper at our second quarter results compared to 2019, there are a couple of items I'd like to call out. Last year, we incurred higher weather-related expenses that negatively impacted the quarter. And in second quarter 2020, we received the final insurance recovery of $25 million related to 2019 weather. Together, these items favorably impacted our year-over-year operating ratio, 90 basis points and earnings per share by $0.05.  Additionally, you'll recall that we received a payroll tax refund in second quarter 2019 that added $0.04 to earnings per share and benefited the operating ratio by 70 basis points. Fuel provided a significant tailwind in the quarter as the year-over-year fuel price reduction favorably impacted our quarterly operating ratio 270 basis points and added $0.09 to earnings per share. While today's low fuel prices do provide a short term benefit, we prefer the trade-off of higher prices, coupled with increased business.  Looking at our core results, we took a step back on our operating ratio in the quarter, which deteriorated 430 basis points with the corresponding reduction in earnings per share of $0.72. Despite our swift and strong actions to cut costs and drive productivity, we could not fully offset the impact of the steep volume decline we experienced at the start of the second quarter.  Finally, our quarterly results include recognition of $69 million related to a real estate sale with the Illinois Tollway. While the sale does not impact our quarterly operating ratio, it added $0.07 to second quarter EPS. So all in, really solid results for our railroad despite some extraordinary circumstances.  Looking now at our second quarter income statement. 2020 operating revenue totaled $4.2 billion, down 24% versus last year on a 20% year-over-year volume decline. Demonstrating our ability to adjust cost with volume, operating expense decreased 22% to $2.6 billion. These results net to operating income of nearly $1.7 billion, a 27% decrease versus 2019. Other income of $131 million includes the real estate sale I just mentioned.  Interest expense increased 12% due to increased debt levels, while income tax expense was lower, down 25% as a result of lower pretax quarterly income. Net income of $1.1 billion declined 28% versus last year, which when combined with the impact of our share repurchase activity, led to a 25% decrease in earnings per share to $1.67.  Taking a more close look at second quarter revenue. Slide 15 provides a breakdown of our freight revenue, which totaled $4 billion, down 24% versus last year. Although the revenue decline was primarily driven by the 20% reduction in volume, the combination of price and mix negatively impacted revenue by about 2.25 points. The results of our pricing actions were positive in the quarter and continued to yield dollars in excess of inflation. However, those gains were more than offset by negative business mix related to steep declines in second quarter automotive, sand and crude volumes. In addition, a 43% decrease in diesel fuel prices in the quarter versus last year partially offset by the roughly 2 month lag in our fuel surcharge recovery programs impacted freight revenue by 2.25 points.  Now let's move to Slide 16, which provides a summary of our second quarter operating expenses. As you saw in Kenny's carloading chart, we experienced a pretty dramatic change in our business volumes through the quarter, dipping as low as 120,007 day carloads in April and then peaking near 150,000 to close the quarter. In the face of the volume decline, we reacted quickly to manage costs and adjust resources while still providing our customers with an excellent service product. As a result of these efforts, second quarter expenses were around 85% volume variable on a fuel adjusted basis, a strong achievement for the entire UP team, especially when you consider that we exited the quarter more rightsized than we entered it.  In terms of the different expense lines, compensation and benefits expense decreased 21% year-over-year, primarily as a result of workforce reductions and productivity initiatives. Second quarter workforce levels declined 22% or about 8,600 full-time equivalents versus last year and sequentially decreased 11%.  As Jim mentioned earlier, our train and engine workforce was more than volume-variable, down 32%, while management, engineering and mechanical workforces together decreased 17%. Fuel expense decreased 56% as a result of the significantly lower diesel fuel prices and lower volumes in the quarter, while our consumption rate was basically flat year-over-year. Purchase services and materials expense fell 23% in the quarter, as we used our locomotive fleet more productively, enabling us to store more locomotives and maintain a smaller active fleet. In addition, our loop subsidiary incurred less drayage expense as a result of auto plant shutdowns and lower intermodal volumes.  Equipment and other rents declined 19%, led by car higher savings and lower lease expense for both locomotives and freight cars. We are continuing to use freight cars more productively as evidenced by our gains in freight car velocity and terminal dwell. Other expense was only down 5% in the quarter, reflecting the somewhat fixed cost nature of this expense line. Although we benefited from running a safer railroad in the second quarter and saw reduced business travel expense, those savings were partially offset by lease impairments, lower equity income from our FXE investment and increases in state and local taxes, which makes up the majority of this cost category. The insurance recovery I mentioned earlier is also reflected in these results.  Looking now at productivity. We generated strong net productivity, totaling approximately $185 million in the second quarter. As Jim mentioned earlier, the operating department's continued progress on train length initiatives, balanced with an improved service product, was especially impressive this quarter, given the severe volume decline. And while we have already achieved the low end of the full year productivity range provided back in April, we do expect the pace of our productivity efforts to moderate some against a tougher second half comparison. We had a tailwind from weather events in the first half of 2019, which contrasts sharply with last year's strong second half productivity of $360 million. Nonetheless, our commitment to continued productivity is unwavering, and we now expect to exceed $500 million for full year 2020.  Moving on to cash and liquidity. As we've discussed previously, Union Pacific's strong balance sheet, our ability to generate cash and available liquidity enabled us to navigate the pandemic cost business fall off and remain in a position of strength.  Cash from operations in the first half of 2020 increased 13% versus 2019 to $4.4 billion. Free cash flow after capital investments totaled nearly $2.8 billion, resulting in a 107% cash conversion rate, which was helped a bit by first half income tax payment deferrals.  We finished the quarter at an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.9x as we continue to main strong investment-grade credit ratings from both Standard & Poor's and Moody's.  Cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $2.7 billion. Now this balance is more than we would typically hold and includes $300 million of short-term borrowing completed earlier in the second quarter to bolster our liquidity as well as the nearly $600 million in deferred tax payments I just referenced. Finally, in the second quarter, we returned value to our shareholders through our industry-leading quarterly dividend payout and remain committed to providing strong cash returns to our owners.  Turning now to our second half outlook. Although some items are more certain today than when we reported first quarter earnings back in April, there are still many unknowns. You just heard Kenny talk with some optimism about our second half 2020 business volumes, which are foundational to our guidance update. Assuming we maintain a consistent volume trend and we do not experience the second wave of economic shutdowns, we expect our full year volumes to be down 10% or so. As I pointed out earlier, we expect productivity to exceed $500 million for full year 2020. And with regard to pricing, our long-standing guidance is unchanged. We expect the total dollars generated from our pricing actions to exceed rail inflation costs. Although we are facing a very competitive marketplace today, we are committed to making sure each piece of business we move is earning an adequate return. Together, our expectations for volume, price and productivity should produce year-over-year operating ratio improvement on a full year basis in 2020.  While the year certainly isn't playing out the way we had earlier anticipated, we are very pleased by both our ability to manage costs in the downturn, as well as how we are now handling increased freight demand without adding back cost on a one-for-one basis.  In terms of cash generation and capital allocation, we are more bullish on both given our current outlook. Full year capital expenditures will likely come in a little more than $2.9 billion as we continue to make good progress on our renewal and productivity investments. We plan to maintain the dividend, but we are still paused as to share repurchases. We all see the news of COVID cases spiking in various parts of the U.S. and globally. So we plan to stay in a conservative posture for now. Longer term, our guidance of capital expenditures below 15% of revenue, a dividend payout ratio of 40% to 45% of earnings and ultimately, a 55% operating ratio remain intact.  Now before I turn it back to Lance, I would like to thank the exceptional employees of Union Pacific who continue to meet the service needs of our customers during this pandemic. They are leading the charge daily towards our collective goal of operating the safest, most efficient and most reliable railroad in North America.  So with that, I'll turn it back to Lance. I was going to say, you can ask the follow-up, but let me just reiterate. We have said, I think, pretty clearly, Jim said it and so did I, we won't bring people back on a one-for-one with the business levels. And we're already doing that today. No. I mean, you're right. It is very tough to forecast. I mean, we've tried to give everyone a little bit more information on that with the RTM data that we're now providing. And so hopefully, that's helpful. But you guys know where our business is -- has the highest ARC. I mean, autos, as you've heard us reference already today, was really a big factor in yields and in the mix impact in the second quarter. Certainly, that has come back here. In the third quarter. And so we'll continue to watch that. We don't see crude oil coming back. That was another impact to mix. Sand has been a headwind for us as well, and that's another one that's probably not going to change. So keep those things in mind and then just watch how the rest of the business plays out. Well, I think you kind of answered your own question there a little bit. I mean, again, we won't do things on a one-for-one basis. But at some point, you will need to add train starts as the volume grows, and there's people associated with that. There's locomotives, there's freight cars, car hire, and you're going to burn a little more fuel. So you're going to have all of those things we'll be part of it to move additional revenue. Our task and what we feel very confident about is that we will be able to do that in a more efficient way as the volumes come back, and we look forward to that because volume is definitely the friend of a railroad. So I think I'll leave it at that. Jennifer? Yes. I mean, I think we've had a bit of a for sale sign up for locomotives for a little while now, but there's not much of a market, particularly with the COVID impact of volumes. And then really the whole rail network going through similar activities with PSR. So we do look at what locomotives, we think are most likely to bring back into service and make adjustments as needed. That's kind of continual activity for the team. And if there's anything that we would do that is of a significant nature. We'd certainly talk to folks about it, but we feel pretty good where we're at right now. Yes. And it's latent capacity to grow into as well. I guess I can jump in here because... And you're spot on, Jim. I was just going to say, we need all 3 levers, and that's you've heard us say that very consistently we need Kenny and team to bring in the volume and the price. And then we've got the productivity that certainly, Jim and the operating group are responsible for a big portion of that, but it's a whole team effort in terms of driving productivity and building on that good service product. So it's all together. Because we'd really like to do something like that in person and be able to get the team together. I think it's important for you all to see the UP team, the management team below who you normally talk to. And I think in person is the best way to do that. Yes. And I would just add to that. I mean, so when you're talking about ARC, obviously, that's going to be driven by the business mix. And when you look at -- I'll take it up a step from where you were talking to it, through our 3 groups. You've got industrial, that is our highest ARC business. And then you've got the bulk, which is next and then the premium, which has the lowest ARC. And so if you think about it just in terms of kind of those broad segments, you're hearing us talk about being able to drive significant growth on the premium side of the business. Autos is just part of that. And then the industrial piece, that's where we're still seeing negative industrial production forecast for third quarter. So I would think about it in kind of those broad economic things. And don't forget about fuel. Obviously, fuel surcharge is part of ARC fuel prices were significantly a part of the impact there in terms of the second quarter. And we're not looking for fuel prices to increase or really change dramatically going from 2Q to 3Q. So that year-over-year impact is going to be there as well."

            "name": "Kenyatta Rocker",
            "content": "Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the second quarter, our volume was down 20% as many of our market segments were negatively impacted from COVID pandemic effects on manufacturing and retail sectors. The decrease in volume, coupled with a 6% lower average revenue per car drove freight revenue to be down 24% in the quarter.  So let's take a closer look at how the second quarter played out for each of our business groups. Starting with bulk. Revenue for the quarter was down 17% on a 15% decrease in volume and a 3% decrease in average revenue per car.  Coal and renewable carloads were down 24% as a result of softer market conditions from historically low natural gas prices and soft export demand. Looking ahead, we expect continued challenges in coal as natural gas futures remain low. Also, weather conditions will continue to be a factor.  Volume from grain and grain products was down 6% as the pandemic reduced demand for ethanol and related products. This was partially offset by increased shipments of export feed grain. Looking forward, we continue to have a more positive outlook on grain exports due to purchases by China. In addition, we expect ethanol production to continue its recovery from historical lows in the second quarter.  Fertilizer and sulfur carloads were slightly down 2%, driven by a onetime shipment in 2019 related to tight barge capacity due to the [indiscernible]. Finally, food and beverage was down 21%, primarily driven by COVID related production challenges for import beer and supply chain shifts in other food products.  Industrial revenue declined 23% with an 18% decrease in volume. Average revenue per car also declined 6% due to negative mix and lower fuel store charge. Energy and specialized decreased 26%, primarily driven by reduced petroleum shipments due to low oil prices conversion with economic shutdown impact on demand. The second half of 2020 potential for crew by rail remains largely uncertain. If oil prices remain depressed, we anticipate continued year-over-year decline.  Forest product volume decreased by 11%. Fewer lumber shipments were driven by mill curtailments due to a reduction in housing starts. In addition, industrial chemicals and plastic shipments declined by 10% due to pandemic-related impacts on demand. Industrial chemicals volume had the largest reductions as these carloads are closely tied to industrial production.  Metals and minerals volumes decreased by 19% due primarily to reduced sand shipments from drilling budget reductions associated with the decline in oil prices and a surplus of local sand. We expect to see continued challenges in sand with oil prices, combined with the recent financial risk that frac sand producers are facing coupled with continued in-basin supply.  Turning to Premium. Revenue for the quarter was down 33% on a 23% decrease in volume. Average revenue per car declined 13% due to a negative mix in traffic. Automotive volume was down 64% for the quarter. Most North American plant productions were temporarily suspended during the first several weeks of the quarter, which depressed our automotive shipments of up to 90%, which was the lowest point during the quarter. The majority of the manufacturers resume production by mid-May, and our volume for the last week of the quarter recover within 15% and of 2019's volume.  Intermodal volume declined 12% year-over-year, driven largely by pandemic related items like shelter and place orders, which force retailers to temporarily close. Softer international and domestic truckload shipments were partially offset by strength in parcel shipments related to e-commerce. Weekly intermodal volumes bottomed in mid-April, down approximately 25% year-over-year, but our weekly run rates have been improving since that time.  Looking ahead, there still remains quite a bit of uncertainty as COVID evolves. As local economies reverse recent reopening, we remain watchful on their impact to supply chain. As we start off the third quarter, we are encouraged with the rebound in volume-driven by our premium business segment as automotive and intermodal supply chains restock inventory and adjust to evolving demand. E-commerce strength is likely to continue, and volumes will be bolstered by recent business wins. We will also be watching automotive demand and any potential downtime for auto plant retooling as it could pose challenges to our current run rates.  The U.S. light vehicle sales forecast for 2020 is at 13.2 million units, down 22% from 2019. In addition, we're closely watching unemployment levels and truck utilization rates as they have a direct impact on demand in a competitive landscape. While the macroeconomics for energy and industrial production are forecasted to be negative in the third quarter, we're focused on what we can control. In fact, the team has been able to win new business throughout our premium and manifest networks. Our car velocity improvements allow us to better compete with trucks and opens new markets for us.  And finally, I wanted to take an opportunity to thank our employees for the preventative measures they are using to stay safe and healthy. So we can keep operations running for our customers.  With that, I'll turn it over to Jennifer who's going to talk to you about our financial performance. Yes. Look, Ken, first of all, thanks for the question. And I just want to really iterate something that Jennifer mentioned, which is one, we have a positive pricing results and that we're going to exceed the cost of inflation. So it's critical we just kind of take that off the table. But as you look at the dynamics in the marketplace, I'll tell you, it was challenging to really price. What helps us is that we have a very strong service product. When you can walk in and talk to your customers about -- we're moving costs from their side, we're moving assets, delivering on time, getting the equipment on time, you're able to go in and have some really tough conversations to sell the price for the service that you're delivering on. So that's that.  To Lance's point, I do want to just talk about the automotive network coming back. If you look at the data points out there, the inventories are the lowest that they've been in the last 9 years. So we know the dealerships need to replenish. We've been talking to our OEM customers, and we'd expect retooling throughout the rest of the quarter, but maybe not as deep as what we thought it be or what we've seen in the past. We'll keep an eye on the fleet sales. But looking forward, we feel pretty optimistic. I feel pretty optimistic about how things are shaping up. Yes. Lance, you're exactly right. Ravi, thanks for the question. We haven't seen any customers make any really concrete bets yet on their shoring. I will tell you, we feel good about the service product and the interchange points that we have coming out of Mexico. The one thing that a number of folks have really harped on the day is our premium and our intermodal network. And what I'll tell you is that our manifest network, our carload network benefits from a stronger service product. And so a lot of these short-term, short-haul lanes we're able to compete in because we do have a lower cost structure, and the car velocity is much longer now. And so as you think about nearshore, it becomes more of a sweet spot for us and we'll be prepared for it if it comes on. So thanks a lot for that question, Amit. I just want to talk about the network first and just say what the rail site in extensions, it's made us more reliable. I reflect on our lane, call it, Southern California into the East Coast or Southeast. It's just a sweet spot for us. We put more and more volume on there. We've opened up the pie. When I talk about making the pie larger, I'm talking about trucks. And so yes, we have aligned ourselves with a number of e-commerce winners. We've been able to win business in those markets. We feel very bullish about the wins. They are coming on now. We're expecting more. We see that those wins in the parcel in the domestic, and we've got a nice win on the international intermodal side.  So I'll tell you, I haven't been as bullish about it as I am today, and we've got a great leader and Jason has leading up that area and Jim and his team are ready for it. Well, I'll start from the back first. I'd say premature right now to talk about a surcharge. Obviously, the demand is picking up. What I would tell you is that our volumes are really increasing each week. They're pretty strong. All the dynamics show that we're going to have a pretty solid peak season, the warehouses, warehouse inventory is normalized. So you don't have a lot of product in storage. E-commerce has been pretty strong. Retail has been improving sequentially each month. So it looks to me, barring any type of second wave that we're going to be in a really good position to have a really solid peak season. It is. Again, Jason, the run rate on our beer shipments are improving each week. What we saw in the second quarter was COVID-related downtime, production downtime, that's behind us now. And so we feel really good about those shipments heading into the holiday. Let me add on to that -- this is Kenny, real quick. First of all, we've got a really strong competitor in the West. And a lot of respect there. Our commercial team is really focused on opening up new markets and making the pie larger, and we've talked about that a little bit on the call today, talked about a lot of the business that we're winning that short-haul business that in the past, because we didn't have the car velocity or the reliability or the lower cost structure, we weren't able to compete with the trucks on. And then I've also talked about a lot of these long-haul lanes that we're opening up the markets on. So our team focus is really on expanding the pie. And when I say that, I'm clearly looking at the truck markets. Yes. Thanks for the question, David. It's -- we're going to have challenges here in the near term and long term. It's in structural decline. Obviously, there are some ins and outs with what happens with low natural gas. We're staying very close to our customers and make sure we can stay competitive with them, with each deal that comes up. But overall, we're just trying to backfill where we can because we do know that over time, it's going to continue to leak. We don't see that. I think there is a scenario where we try to slow down the slope so that it's not a steep slope. But I -- we'd expect that it will continue to just gradually decline. Yes. Thanks a lot, Jordan. First of all, we're nowhere near the levels that we enjoy in 2018, the back half of 2018, where there were some pretty large gaps. When we look at the forecast, we certainly expect that the truck utilization and those rates will improve monthly well into 2021, which will put us in a better position to not only win more business, but get a little bit more margin on that business. Having said that, we certainly aren't waiting around for something to happen. We're going after it right now. We feel good about the wins that we've made that we know will show up here in the near term. And it's broadly across the intermodal network. It's not just the international, it's not just the domestic, it's pretty broad, it's is the parcel also. So we feel like we're capturing those wins right now, and we're excited to see them come on and onboard over the next several weeks. And we expect to continue to grab more share."

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's Web site. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Mr. Fritz, you may begin.\nLance Fritz: Thank you, and good morning, everybody, and welcome to Union Pacific's first quarter earnings conference call. With me today, in Omaha, practicing safe social distancing are Jim Vena, Chief Operating Officer; Kenny Rocker, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sakes; and Jennifer Hamann, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we discuss our first quarter results, I want to acknowledge the dedication and hard work of our employees. During this COVID pandemic, the woman and men of Union Pacific continue to connect American businesses and communities to each other and to the world, whether it's stocking a home pantry, supplying essential goods to healthcare providers, or moving critical building blocks for U.S. industries, they're getting the job done and they're not missing a beat. Their spirit shows up in so many ways. I see it in our health and medical team, looking out for the safety of our employees. I see it in our operating team, moving the goods that make a difference in peoples' lives, and I see it in our leaders, helping us work together, staying on point and positioned for the future. Their dedication is inspirational and lays the foundation for better days ahead. Our rail network has never run better, and we continue to provide a safer, more reliable, and more efficient service product to our customers. I am so very proud of the entire Union Pacific team. Moving on to our first quarter results, this morning, Union Pacific's reporting 2020 first quarter net income of $1.5 billion or $2.15 a share. This compares to $1.4 billion or $1.93 per share in the first quarter of 2019. Our quarterly operating ratio came in at 59%, a 4.6 percentage point improvement compared to the first quarter of 2019, and an all-time best quarterly OR. In addition to improving the efficiency of the railroad, we also made improvements in our safety results, which is always our top priority. For the quarter, our employee safety results improved 11% versus 2019. We also made progress in fuel consumption rate during the quarter. This reduces our fuel expense while also reducing our carbon footprint and the carbon footprint of our customers, which is a step in our commitment to address global warming. As I turn it over to the rest of the team you're going to hear how our first quarter results have further strengthened the Union Pacific to navigate the uncertainties that lie ahead. We'll start with Jim, and an operations update.\nJim Vena: Thanks, Lance, and good morning everyone. As Lance mentioned, the railroad is healthy and operating smoothly as our customers have seen minimal rail service impact. We are taking every precaution to protect our employees. We are social distancing and using technology whenever possible to replace face-to-face interaction. Over the past few weeks, I've taken the opportunity to visit several field locations practicing good social distancing, to talk with our employees. I could not be more proud of how they remain dedicated to safely and reliably operating the railway without disruption as they recognize the critical role they play in delivering goods needed throughout our country. Their dedication is to be commended. Overall, the team had a very strong quarter. Really, the results speak for themselves. You see the impact of all the changes we've made at Union Pacific to become more efficient and provide a better service product to our customers. These changes drove an operating ratio of 59%, which was outstanding, and there are still many more opportunities ahead of us to further improve safety, asset utilization, and network efficiency. Now turning to slide four, I'd like to update you on our key performance metrics. For the first time, we are seeing improvement across all of our metrics, and as a result, we are seeing a better service product for our customers. This is a direct result of our focus on improving network efficiency and service reliability as part of our operating model. Compared to the first quarter of 2019, freight car velocity improved 8% driven by continued improvement in asset utilization and fewer car classifications. Freight car terminal dwell improved 11% largely due to improved terminal processes, transportation plan changes to eliminate car touches, and a decrease in freight car inventory levels. Building off our progress in 2019, we continue to implement changes in order to run a more efficient network that requires fewer locomotives, which has led to an 18% improvement in locomotive productivity this quarter versus last year. As demonstrated by crew starts being down 13% in the quarter, which outpaced the 7% decline in carloads, we continue to take steps to deliver positive workforce productivity. Trip plan compliances, where our customers feel the benefit of our transformed operating model, the improvement in intermodal speaks for itself. With manifest and autos, we are holding ourselves to our higher standard as we tighten schedules, and we'll see improvements as we move forward. We are off to a great start this year, and we expect to see continued improvement in our service products going forward. Starting next week, we will provide some additional operating statistics, in particular, freight car velocity, which you have heard me say a number of times as my favorite one that I look at every morning on our Investors Web site on a weekly basis to provide more insight to how our operations are running. Let's turn to slide five. It highlights some of our recent network changes. As a part of our continued implementation of position-scheduled railroading, we consolidated mechanical shops in the L.A. Basin and Houston areas. In the L.A. Basin, we've consolidated from three shops to one; while in Houston we've gone from two shops to operating just one as well. Increasing train size remains one of our main areas of focus and we are making excellent progress. At our recently completed Santa Teresa block swop facility, we are consolidating intermodal traffic from our eastern ramps destined to port terminals in Los Angeles Long Beach area. This allows us to operate longer more efficient trains across the Sunset Route, and provide a better more consistent service product to our customers. We also completed eight 15,000 foot sidings as a part of our 2020 capital plan to extend sidings in targeted locations. These sidings support our efficiency initiatives by increasing the number of long trains we can operate in each direction, thus reducing demand for crew starts. By putting more products on fewer trains we have increased train length across our system by 19% or over 1,300 feet since the fourth quarter of 2019, to approximately 8,400 feet in the first quarter of 2020. The capital we are investing to improve productivity as well as to maintain the safe efficient network is critical to the long-term health of our railroad. Given the current business levels and uncertain economic environment, we are planning to trim back our 2020 spend by $150 million to $200 million. To wrap up, we are committed to protecting our employees' health and safety while providing uninterrupted critical service to support the nation's supply chain. While we're early in the second quarter, so far we have been able to hold steady and maintain train length gains as volumes have dropped. We continue to evaluate our transportation plan, including yard and local schedules, in order to meet customers' demands while balancing our resources and assets to meet current volumes. Since the latter half of March, as volumes decline more steeply, we stored additional locomotives and railcars. However those locomotives remain in at-the-ready status and both assets are available to add back quickly as volumes return. We have also furloughed additional employees. However, we are increasing our auxiliary work and training status force to be prepared should volumes come back quickly or in the event of an outbreak within a group of the employees. We have made great progress at this point; however we will continue to transform our operations in order to further improve safety, asset utilization and network efficiency. With that, I'll turn it over to Kenny to provide an update on our business environment. Kenny?\nKenny Rocker: Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the first quarter, our volume was down 7%, primarily due to declines in our Premium and Bulk business groups. The decrease in volume was partially offset by a 5% improvement in the average revenue per car, and drove freight revenue to be down 3% in the quarter. So, let's take a closer look at how the first quarter played out for each of our business groups. Starting with Bulk, revenue for the quarter was down 5% on a 7% decrease in volume, partially offset by a 2% improvement in average revenue per car. Coal and renewable carloads were down 19% as a result of softer market conditions from historically low natural gas prices and a mild winter. Looking ahead, we expect continued challenges in coal as natural gas futures remain low and customer stockpile stay at high level. Weather conditions will also continue to be a factor. Volume for grain and grain products was up 4% primarily driven by strong export ethanol volume. This was partially offset by reduced shipments of export wheat. Fertilizer and sulfur carloads were up 7% predominantly due to strong domestic fertilizer shipments. Finally, food and beverage was up 2% in unit as we saw strength in beer shipments become slightly offset by reduced refrigerated and dry food which were impacted by a challenging truck environment. Industrial revenue was up 3% with a 3% increase in volume and flat average revenue per car due to mix. Energy and specialized increased 10% primarily driven by strength in petroleum as favorable Canadian spread facilitated stronger crude oil shipment to the Gulf earlier in the quarter. However, with the reduction of oil prices in the past week, we expect crude oil shipment to be impacted in the near term. Forest products volume was flat. Reduced paper shipments were offset by increased lumber shipments due to strong housing start and a mild winter during the quarter. Industrial chemicals and plastic shipments grew by 4% due to the strength in domestic and export plastic shipments along with strong demand of detergents and chemicals. Metals and minerals volume decreased by 3%, reduced sand shipments from the impact of local sand and drilling decline were partially offset by continued strength in rock shipments in the South coupled with increased metal shipment. We expect to see continued challenges in sand with oil prices remaining at lower level. Turning to Premium, revenue for the quarter was down 6% on a 12% decrease in volume while average revenue per car improved by 6%. Automotive shipments were strong for the most of the first quarter until the pandemic shut down OEM in North America in the last few weeks of March, resulting in a 1% decline in volume year-over-year. Domestic intermodal volume declined 5%, driven by soft market demand and surplus truck capacity coupled with weakness related to the pandemic later in the quarter. International intermodal volume was down 24% during the quarter. Weakness early in the quarter was related to challenging comparisons with 2019 driven by accelerated shipments related to the tariff policy implementation. Further weakness was driven by pandemic-related supply chain disruption that began in China had slowly impacted much of Asia. Looking ahead, there remains quite a bit of uncertainty surrounding this global pandemic that we are facing. With the freefall in economic indicators over the past few weeks and uncertainty about when we will see the COVID pandemic curve starts to flatten out, an accurate assessment of 2020 is hard to pinpoint at this time. As you can see, our volume in the second quarter has started off slowing with the volume down 22% so far driven by auto production shutdowns and retail closure as U.S. demand is constrained by the pandemic-related social distancing and quarantine. Many of the auto manufacturing plants are scheduled to be shutdown until at least early May. Already our auto shipments have been down around 80% in the second quarter so far. Likewise, the recent projections in Mexico indicate that some manufacturing sectors like auto will be shut down for similar time periods as well. However, the CARES Act that was recently signed offers some upside to open the economy for business and improve unemployment for America plus it also encouraging to see that much of Asia is restarting production along with China's recent purchases of U.S. grains. More importantly, I like to make this point clear, we are not letting the uncertainty of the economy hold us back. We are staying focused on what we can control. The good news is that the lower cost structure combined with the improved service products that we've achieved with Unified Plan 2020 is a competitive advantage for us, customers are recognizing it, and awarding us new business. As Lance and Jim mentioned before, the railroad has never run better. I want to thank our employees as they are taking the necessary precautions to stay safe and healthy, so we can keep the operations running for our customers. We will continue to stay in close contact with our customers, and we are ready when the supply chains recover. As demand improves, we expect our strongest service products will place us in a great position to win incremental opportunity. With that, I'll turn it over to Jennifer who's going to talk about our financial performance.\nJennifer Hamann: Thanks, Kenny, and good morning. As you heard from Lance earlier Union Pacific is reporting first quarter earnings per share of $2.15, and an all-time best quarterly operating ratio of 59%. Our fourth consecutive quarter starting with a five comparing our first quarter results to 2019 there are a few puts and takes. Last year, we incurred higher weather-related expenses, and you may also recall that we received a payroll tax refund that benefited both our operating ratio and earnings per share. As shown on slide 13, these two items had an offsetting impact in our 2020 results. Fuel was an unexpected tailwind in the quarter and likely will be for much of 2020 as the year-over-year fuel production -- fuel price reductions favorably impacted our quarterly operating ratio by 80 basis points and added $0.04 earnings per share. Setting inside those items, core margin improvement for the quarter was a remarkable 3.8 points, and added $0.18 earnings per share, as we continue to demonstrate the power of our operating model, as well as the ability to flex our cost structure in the face of volume challenges. Thanks to the dedication and results of the entire Union Pacific team. We took another significant step forward to our goal of operating the most efficient reliable and consistent railroad in North America. Looking now at our first quarter income statement, 2020 operating revenue totaled $5.2 billion, down 3% versus last year on a 7% year-over-year volume decrease, demonstrating our ability to be more than volume variable, operating expense decreased 10% to $3.1 billion. These results net to operating income of $2.1 billion, a 9% increase versus 2019. Below the line, other income decreased compared to 2019 as the payroll tax refund I referenced on the prior slide included $27 million of interest income. Interest expense increase 13% due to increased debt levels, while income tax expense also was higher up 11% due to higher pre-tax income in the quarter. Net income of $1.5 billion was up 6% versus last year, which when combined with our share repurchase activity led to an 11% increase in earnings per share to $2.15. Looking at revenue for the first quarter Slide 15 provides a breakdown of our freight revenue, which totaled $4.9 billion down 2.5% versus last year. While not able to offset the impact of the 7% lower volumes, the combination of favorable business mix, and our pricing actions had nearly a five-point positive impact on our quarterly freight revenue. Positive mix in the quarter was driven by lower intermodal shipments, partially offset by lower sand volume. In addition, fuel surcharge revenue declined $47 million in the quarter to $351 million, and impacted freight revenue by 25 basis points. Drivers of the decline were lower volume and fuel prices. Now, let's move to slide 16, which provide a summary of our first quarter operating expenses. Through our Unified Plan 2020, and G55 + 0 initiatives, we drove improvement across all cost categories. Compensation and benefits expense decreased 12% year-over-year, primarily as a result of our workforce and productivity initiatives. Total first quarter workforce declined 15%, or about 6200 full-time equivalent versus last year. Sequentially, our workforce is down 2%. Breaking the year-over-year, reduction is down a little more, we saw a 19% decrease in our train and engine workforce, while management engineering and mechanical workforces together decreased 13%. This expense category also benefited from last year-over-year weather-related cost offset by the payroll tax refund I referenced earlier. Fuel expense decreased 18% as a result of lower diesel fuel prices and fewer gallons consumed with a more efficient operations. Our consumption rates for the quarter improved 5% versus last year to a first quarter best level. Decreased costs associated with maintaining smaller active locomotive fleet as well as lower weather-related costs were key drivers of the 10% reduction in purchase services and materials expense. In addition, as we use both our locomotive and car fleet more efficiently, we've been able to lower lease expense, which largely contributed to the 12% decline in equipment and other rents. With regard to other expense, which was down 2% in the quarter, we recorded an adjustment to our bad debt reserve to recognize uncertainty related to certain customer receivables due to the potential impact of COVID-19. That expense increase was offset by running a safer railroad, which lower destroyed equipment costs as well as freight loss and damage expense. Finally, for full-year 2020, we now expect year-over-year depreciation expense to be flat. Looking at productivity and our cost structure, net productivity totaled approximately $220 million in the first quarter. As Jim detailed earlier, with our improved key performance indicators, the successful implementation and enhancement of our operating plan is increasing efficiency while at the same time providing a superior service product for our customers. As we've discussed in the past, we view productivity as a volume neutral measure. In other words, we're reporting only that part of our cost savings attributable to the actions we are taking, but as we enter this recessionary period sparked by COVID-19 I'd like to make a couple of comments about volume variability, in particular as it relates to prior recessions. First and most importantly, Union Pacific is running at efficiency levels that we've never experienced before as a company. For example, we were more than volume variable on a fuel adjusted basis in the first quarter of 2020 as a result of the strong productivity focus embedded in unified plan 2020. We've also taken more than 1500 basis points off of our operating ratio since the great financial crisis in 2008, 2009. That further strengthens our ability to manage through today's challenges and emerged stronger on the other side. Moving to cash generation, as we face these fluid and uncertain times, we recognize the need to maintain ample liquidity with the strength of our balance sheet and our strong cash generation, I can confidently say that we are well positioned for the challenges we are facing. Cash from operations in the first quarter increased 10% versus 2019 to $2.2 billion. Free cash flow after dividend and after capital investments totaled over $1.3 billion, resulting in a 91% cash conversion rate. We also returned $3.6 billion to shareholders during the first quarter through the continued payment of an industry leading dividend and the repurchase of 14 million shares of our common stock. Share purchases were funded in part from our January debt issuance. Union Pacific strong investment grade credit rating and a very attractive interest rate market allowed us to issue $3 billion of new debt. A portion of that issuance funded the $2 billion accelerated share repurchase program we entered into in February and the rest is for 2020 debt maturities. We finished the quarter at an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.7 times, in line with our previously stated goal of maintaining strong investment grade credit ratings no lower than BBB plus and BAA1. Although COVID-19 was not contemplated when we originally set our leverage targets back in 2018, the decision to manage our balance sheet in line with a strong investment grade credit rating was clearly the right one. We maintain an active dialogue with our rating agencies and at this time they are comfortable with our current leveraged position. We finished the first quarter with $1.1 billion of cash on hand. However, in an abundance of caution, we issued $750 million of 30 year notes in early April to further increase liquidity. As of yesterday, our cash balance was around $2 billion and we have additional levers available if needed. The current bond market is open to us as evidenced by our April issuance. We also have $2 billion of credit available under our undrawn credit revolver and up to an additional $400 million available under our receivable securitization facility, which is 50% drawn at this time. As we sit here today, we do not believe it will be necessary to tap those additional sources, but we view them as a prudent backstop to have at the ready. Turning now to our 2020 outlook, we are formally withdrawing much of our previous guidance in light of the current economic uncertainties. In particular, we are no longer providing guidance for the full-year 2020 volume, headcount, operating ratio, or share repurchases. To date, we have repurchased roughly $17 billion of the targeted $20 billion three year program that is set to conclude at the end of this year. We will continue to monitor business conditions and adjust this activity as we see prudent, but with share repurchases currently paused, completion of the full $20 billion seems less likely today. As you heard from Kenny a moment ago, our second quarter car loadings are currently down 22%, and our current view is that volumes for the full quarter could be down around 25% or so. With volumes declines of that magnitude we are taking actions across the board to right-size our resources and manage expenses. Even with aggressive action however, it is unlikely we can improve our second quarter operating ratio on a year-over-year basis with that level of volumes loss. Unchanging for 2020 is our long-standing guidance around pricing. We still expect the total dollars generated from our pricing actions to exceed rail inflation costs. With regard to productivity we are widening our range of expectations for full-year 2020 to $400 million to $500 million. We clearly got off to a very strong start in the first quarter, and our commitment to productivity is unwavering. However, we also recognize that the loss of volume leverage is a challenge. In terms of cash generation and cash allocation we've modeled a number of different down volume scenarios. In each we plan to maintain the dividend but with the capital modifications Jim mentioned, and a suspension of share repurchases. The outcome of that exercise is a strong confidence in our ability to generate significant free cash flow after dividends in some pretty dire economic conditions. This is a testament to the earnings power of our franchise, as demonstrated by our first quarter results. Although frustrated by current conditions, the potential is clearly there. Longer-term, our guidance of capital expenditures of less than 15% of revenue, a dividend payout ratio of 40% to 45% of earnings, and ultimately that 55% operating ratio remain intact. As you have heard from the entire leadership team today, we are unwavering in our commitment to improving safety, efficiency, and service as well all firmly believe in the strong long-term prospects of our company. So with that, I'll turn it back to Lance.\nLance Fritz: Thank you, Jennifer. Our first priority has been and will always be safety. We made good progress on safety in the first quarter, and I expect continued improvement. From a service and efficiency perspective I am so thankful that we went through the tough process of implementing the Unified Plan 2020 over the last 18 months. That work has put us in a position of great strength to deal with the future. When the time arrives, where COVID-19 is largely behind us, Union Pacific will be well positioned for long-term growth and excellent returns. With that, let's open up the line for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse.\nAllison Landry: Thanks. Good morning. Jim, as you think about the persistent reduction in coal tonnage and the GTM intensity of that network, do you see opportunity for, or are you considering making any structural changes that might reduce maintenance capital requirements, probably any thoughts you could share about how you're thinking about the coal network going forward?\nJim Vena: Listen, the coal network was built to handle way more trains than we're handling. So, it starts off on a separate piece of the railroad, so there's no if, ands or buts that we're going to -- we're looking at that. We've got plans to be able to take advantage and use some of that, both in maintenance and some of the capital that we've put on the ground in there. On some of the other network, a little more difficult because if the -- it just mixes up with the rest of the trains we run, but absolutely, Allison, we've got a plan of when some segment of the railroad sees a downturn in traffic that we fix it. The big challenge for Kenny is this: I want him to fill it up. So I think he's got a great service product, and we get out there and fill out those pieces that are [technical difficulty] -- running with less traffic right now.\nAllison Landry: Okay, and then could you give us a sense for how much train starts are down in April? And then in terms of just headcount declines, do you think you can continue to outpace volume declines in the next quarter too? And if there's any way to sort of parse out what percentage you think would be the structural takeout versus how much would likely come back with a recovery in demand? Thank you.\nLance Fritz: Okay. So, so far, I'll tell you the team has done a spectacular job. We are -- actually our train size has grown in April, not come down. So are full-bore, everyone is on looking at how we make this place with what the traffic that's offered to us and make it the most efficient. So it's actually gone up in size, train size in April. You'll see that when -- as we report next or you'll see it from how we talk at different conferences. As far as people, I think we've done a great job of staying ahead of the game. There would come a point where it's difficult to stay ahead of the drop in business, but so far, even up to this point right now with the traffic that we see in April, we've been able to stay ahead and be productive in that we are dropping more than the adjustment in business, but I'll tell you I'm no -- there's a certain point when it's impossible to do, so we're not there yet.\nAllison Landry: Okay, excellent. Thank you.\nLance Fritz: Thanks for the questions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks, operator. Hi, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. Jennifer, I didn't fully touch your comment around the OR for the second quarter. Did you say it was going to be down year-over-year or were you preparing it sequentially, I wasn't exactly -- I don't think I understood exactly what you were saying there?\nJennifer Hamann: Thanks, Amit. No, my comment was on a year-over-year basis, and saying that with volumes declines that we're expecting of this magnitude, so down 25% or so, it's unlikely that we would be able to improve our operating ratio in the quarter. It was a quarter-only comment on a year-over-year -- \nAmit Mehrotra: Right, okay, got it. Okay, that makes sense. Thanks for the clarification, and then Jim, I just want to come back to Allison's question really quickly. Obviously the 25% decline in volume, it's a bit unique I guess in the quarter because the decline in revenue is so significant but also kind of short-lived, which introduces a whole host of other dynamics in terms of how you manage the labor and other costs of the business that might need to ramp back up. So if you could just talk to us how you manage that, I mean, basically PSR is important, but -- and thank god you guys did it in the context of what's happening currently, but is the second quarter just going to like reflect more of a normal kind of 50%, 60% decremental margin quarter because a lot of those costs that you would normally have to structurally kind of move away has to remain because you have to prepare for the -- the hopefully V-shaped recovery on the other side. Just help us think about how you manage through this dynamic that's a little bit unique?\nJim Vena: Well, listen, that was a multi-person answer question. I think Jennifer wants to jump in, but let me just start with what I see. You can see that we're high double-digit drop in the number of employees already versus where the business dropped, and so, it gives us a chance to be able to be there, and that's why in the comment the way I answered Allison's question. I'm very comfortable that at this place, I don't know what's going to happen to the business, I'm open for a big V coming back, but who knows. So we are prepared and preparing to make sure that we do not set ourselves up. That if the business comes back in quicker than some people think that we're prepared for it. So that's why the way we parked our locomotives. We've got lots of locomotives. I don't even want to talk about how many we've got parked right now, it's so many. I worry more about the productivity number that's out there, that's what's real key is how many -- so we've got locomotives ready to go. The business comes back, if it comes back slow or fast we're ready for it, and people, we have been smart about how we manage all the labor that we have. So we are purposefully, at this point, because of the substantial drop over a short period of time that we have put people in places so that we can recall them. They cost us a little bit of less money, but they're available real quick to return to the railroad so we don't impact. Service is key for us, you know, you can't be running an efficient railroad, and I've always said that, and I know some people mix this whole thing up, PSR and service. So you can't have a good operating railroad that will operate safely if you don't have customers that want to come on it, and that's what we're building. I think we're there. Kenny should be able to go out and sell it, but at the end of the day that's what we're all about. Jennifer?\nJennifer Hamann: Yes, I mean, so we're obviously not going to give guidance on decremental margins. Again, you look at our first quarter performance, very strong. We were more than 100% volume variable, but I think when you thinking about how we look at the second quarter, I mean obviously 25% down volumes, and you -- your earlier questioner was asking around the operating ratio. It's tough to keep up in terms of your cost cutting when you have volumes come out that fast. We are going to be very aggressive and do everything we can, but we are not going to give specific guidance relative to headcount for second quarter or relative to the margins, but just know we're going to pull every lever available to us.\nAmit Mehrotra: Okay. Okay, I'll keep it at two, guys. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nLance Fritz: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe one for Kenny, can you just go through the impacts of energy across the portfolio, specifically look, you mentioned crude before, but want to hear a little bit more about perhaps natural gas, what that does to the plastics producers in the Gulf Coast, and is it -- I hear your comments on coal, but is it too early to think about some potential upside in coal, if we were to see an improvement as production gets shut down?\nKenny Rocker: Yes, I'll walk you across pretty quickly here. The coal prices have just dropped here even over the last few months. There are some levels that we haven't seen in a while. I'm sure you see the same for curve forecast, and we'll see what happens there, but there is nothing that leads us to believe there is going to be large upside with coal, but we'll keep working with Jim's team to get the productivity that we can get out of it. The other part of the energy side of course is the oil prices, and you've seen what has happened there on the petroleum side with crude oil. We'll see what happens with those prices. Those prices also have an impact on our sand business in terms of drilling and then to a lesser degree the drilling pipe segments also. As you look at our plastics business, there is going to be an impact on our plastics business. I will tell you that there is more production that has come off, and there's more production that will come on. That is a positive for us. We're hearing that the -- or we know that the operating rates, where a number of our plastics producers has taken a step down, but that's still a very positive segment for us. I will say this, and I want to end it all with this, at the end of the day, our service product has been as good as it has been as we continue to see other pieces of carload business come up for us to bid on and compete for. I really like the position that the service product has put us in.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Thanks, Kenny. So, a follow-up for maybe Jennifer and Jim, I believe last time we talked, you are targeting $500 million plus productivity gain, which is more volume neutral and looks like now you're taking it down a little bit at least from how we see it here. So, maybe you can just give us a little bit of context to that if included the volume environment is different, but this is a volume neutral sort of metric, maybe you can help bridge the gap there between the two numbers?\nJennifer Hamann: Sure. So, you're right, we do take out the volume variability part of the cost. So, if we're going to have fewer train starts because of lower costs, we don't count that in the number, but if we have reduced train starts, like through Jim's long train productivity initiatives, those are things that we put into our productivity number. My comment was meant to say is that when you have less volume, it's harder to leverage that, and so, when we were putting together our plan for 2020, recall, we originally said we were looking for a little bit of positive volume growth when we gave the guidance of $500 million or so productivity. We've obviously taken that volume growth off the table in terms of what we're seeing today, and so, that's why we feel like we need to widen that range a little bit in the $400 million to $500 million range. So that's how you should think about that, but Jim, you might want to add a little more?\nJim Vena: So, Jennifer, and Brian, listen, $220 million first quarter starts us off real well to be able to deliver what we said, I think it's prudent that we look at it because if you drop volume, you have less chance to reduce, and just the way we measure cost takeout, it's true cost, there isn't anything, volume doesn't help us, but I'll tell you this, there's a list of things that I still want to get done, and with that, the way we operate our locals, the way we're handling our intermodal terminals to make them more efficient, the train size is still there, we can be more fluid with how we handle the railcars. You've seen us shut down a couple of diesel shops. So, all those things are still out there, and unless really the markets changed for us even more, I'm very comfortable with where Jennifer's got us guidance for this year. I'm very comfortable. I won't use the word go by, otherwise Jennifer will get excited, but I'm very comfortable with where we are.\nLance Fritz: Brian, this is Lance. I just want to add. It's really simple to think about, if in this quarter as we anticipate volumes are off something like 25%, you got to take something like 25% of your activity out of the railroad to match before we start talking about incremental productivity. So, the basis for which you're going to create productivity gets very, very difficult when you take an order of magnitude change like that. On the opposite side, if you're growing 3%, 4%, 5% gives you all the opportunity not to add resources in and you can count that all as productivity.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Great, it sounds like there's a calculation aspect to the kind of like your core pricing, so just wanted to make sure that was clear. Thank you.\nLance Fritz: Okay.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Wetherbee: Hey, thanks, good morning. I wanted to talk a little bit about volume if we could. The 25% decline in the second quarter is not too far off of where we're running kind of currently here, which would suggest that maybe we're getting closer to the bottom. I want to get a sense maybe Kenny for you discussions with your customers or maybe each individual business line, can you walk us through sort of what are the puts and takes to kind of get you comfort with that 25 number, we appreciate you given it but kind of curious what's the sort of drivers behind that?\nKenny Rocker: Yes, so first of all, I believe you all see some of the information that we see publicly in terms of where the automotive OEMs are and they appear to be coming back sometime next month, call that the first-half of May. Clearly, there is going to be some ramp-up issues with that maybe they wouldn't start at 100%. We'll keep an eye on where that is as we look across our industrial customers. There are some customers that we're still seeing produce at a pretty strong clip. Rail network is still working pretty well. On the grain side, we're pretty optimistic there. We'll see what happens over the next few months. We do know that China has come in and purchase some grain during the back half of the year. We would expect that we should see some benefit from the Phase 1 deal, and then as you look at how as we're talking to our customers on the consumer side, I'll call those international intermodal and our domestic customers, I'll tell you, they still don't have that line of sight and what's going to happen. So we're not in a position, I'm not in a position even though we're talking to him every day to tell you what will happen there.\nLance Fritz: So Chris, this is Lance, let me step that back up and come up to a higher level of depth and length of our downturn. So we're learning every week a little bit more about the dynamics of how deep it might be and how long it might be. It's still very unclear and the goalposts are pretty broad that you can hear very well educated, deeply experienced economists that still think about a V-recovery. You hear about W-recoveries, U-recoveries, a slow hockey stick ramp-up. I think our collective belief at this point is it's sharp and deep, it's going to last for a while, and recovery is going to be some kind of ramp but probably not terribly steep, and so, we're looking for those markers and nothing would please me more than to be wrong about this 25 percent-ish, and see some time in the second quarter that we're starting to see demand firm and our supply chains reflected, but there's a lot that needs to happen between here and there.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay, that's very helpful. I appreciate that, and maybe coming back to the productivity comment and maybe this is for you Lance or Jim or Jennifer, I guess when you think about that sort of dynamic of volumes coming out of that that was very helpful to give us some of that perspective about sort of the base kind of going away in terms of generating productivity. So, is it reasonable to think that sort of 2Q is going to be there very much challenging sort of quarter to get that productivity and that maybe that sort of remainder of the 400 to 500 is more back end weighted to be for 3Q and 4Q when the volume dynamic is hopefully a little bit more stable?\nLance Fritz: No, I don't think we're saying that specifically. I think what we're saying is, with such an abrupt downturn and the depth of it, productivity is going to be harder to come by. So for instance it's very unlikely, and it would be unreasonable to think about the second quarter in the $200 million order of magnitude like we saw in the first quarter, but I don't think a reasonable expectation is no productivity. I wouldn't expect that from us.\nKenny Rocker: Listen, we are spending capital and we have the sidings that I mentioned earlier on in place. We expect the train size to go up and have less train starts for the business that we have. So, that's productivity. We expect to be more productive with our local assignments and local operations. We expect to be more productive on our intermodal facilities and how we handle the traffic that we have. So as much as volume does make some of it harder, I'd love to have the whole time. Love to have a quarter with 2% or 3% volume growth hang on. I'd love to see where that number is, but it is not there because I'm not real worried about not having productivity this quarter.\nJennifer Hamann: And just a quick reminder, I mean, our comparisons on a year -over-year basis relative to productivity get harder through the course of the year. We closed out the year with close to $200 million, $215 million of productivity. So, take all of those comments kind of into your mosaic of how you think about it, Chris.\nChris Wetherbee: Got it, that's very helpful. Appreciate the time. Thank you.\nLance Fritz: Thanks, Chris.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Hoexter: Great. Good morning. Just a follow-up on that on your volume outlook there, Lance, I guess if you're running it down kind of 20, 22 now, and you're targeting down 25% for the quarter, are you expecting things to get worse from here or are you not anticipating things reopening I mean, I guess just thinking about this only in the third, fourth week of April. You still have two months left and with things maybe apparently starting to reopen, are you expecting things to deteriorate from here?\nLance Fritz: Well, part of what we're making that commentary on is reflective of how we're planning for the second quarter. So, we tend to be pretty conservative. There is a lot of unknowns. I don't think we know enough yet to know what's left to deteriorate in the demand economy versus how that's going to be offset by recovery. So there's just a lot of moving parts and I think above 25%-ish is a good marker for us to plan our activity around. We've mentioned it to you as a result, and we'll hope for better. Kenny?\nKenny Rocker: I want to just give you a view from my seat when our commercial teams go then and we talk to our customers, we're talking about -- after we go through our safety side, the second thing we talk about is the service product and Jim is exactly right. We've got a very strong service product to sell. We talked about the car velocity improving to make us more competitive with truck light services, as we entered into the year, what I would tell you is that on a carload basis, we felt really good about some of the wins in some key markets and we felt really good about opening up new markets that we hadn't touched. On our domestic intermodal side, we're about two-thirds along the way through our big season. We felt very good. I mean we felt very good about what we won in that area. So we need the market to help us there. Even in our international intermodal business towards the back half of the year, there have been some jump ball opportunities that we feel really good about that we've won that you should see so. Coming into the year, we felt really good about our opportunity to compete. The service product is something that we're going to use to make the pie larger to compete against truck, but we felt really confident wants the market comes back.\nKen Hoexter: Thanks, Kenny. Thanks, Lance. I guess if I could just switch over to Jim or Jen from my follow -up, you talked about trimming CapEx that's contrasting a little bit what we've heard from some of the others who look to take advantage of the downturn, maybe to get some cheaper build out capabilities. Can you maybe talk about that, and Jim can you clarify the status on the locomotive fleet and the park capacity? Thanks.\nJim Vena: Well, listen to Ken. It's a good question in that, usually the way I like to look at it is if you have a downturn of business and you know it's going to come back why adjust your capital program at all. We went through it and it's more like a timing that rolls into next year. This is not anything that everything that we had in the capital plan was built for to make this railroad better, more productive, safer and sustainable over the long-term. So we're not changing that, but we thought it was prudent with where the revenues are at this point in the business level to just slide some of it into an early part of next year, and because we give a guidance on a year-to-year basis, that's what's happening. So we are not -- absolutely there is some areas where we're going to spend money faster and we can see that. So if we have some opportunity even after we make the adjustment in the capital to be able to use some of that cash because we're more efficient, we'll spend it this year at this point, but stay tuned, and we'll adjust it as we see what's happened to the business. Jennifer, anything else?\nJennifer Hamann: No, I think you summed it up, Jim.\nJim Vena: Okay, nice. Thanks again.\nKen Hoexter: Thanks guys, and just the local fleet numbers.\nKenny Rocker: I appreciate the thought.\nJim Vena: I'm sorry, Ken, you broke up.\nKen Hoexter: Oh, just the local fleet, Jim mentioned.\nJim Vena: Oh. Listen, we've got so many locomotives part that I'm just about embarrassed to say how many we have parked, okay. So, there's some noise in it right now because of the business drop, but this is a number I look at, Ken, and I gave it to you at 18% improvement and locomotive productivity is the key number. We have lots of locomotives part. We're good if the business comes back, we're good if the business grows. We are being smart; we're putting all the technology, we've got the best locomotives and you can see the fuel efficiency that we said five, but you could take some of the noise out but a true 4% betterment. So there are some locomotors, we have a lot of them parked and we continue to park them every day right now with where we are with the business levels.\nKenny Rocker: Hi, Jim. There's something we don't talk a lot about. There's two ways to look at our stored locomotives. There's locomotives that are stored and intended to be stored for a while. That is we don't anticipate their need in the next week to month, and then, Jim's got other locomotives that we store in a low -- in a status called at the ready, and at the ready, are literally ready to be pulled out and put back into service on a moment's notice, and so, that mix is changing every day, but the at the readies allow us to react to business upturn, which we hope we see, and we hope it's a strong week, that'd be great.\nKen Hoexter: Thanks for the time guys there. I appreciate it.\nKenny Rocker: Thanks, Ken.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. So I wanted to just follow-up on something I heard earlier, Jim and the answer to the first question. Were you suggesting that April headcount is down more than volume, so down sort of more than 20%? And then, Jennifer I totally get second quarter or commentary. You've got some cushion with the strength of the first quarter, any thoughts at all about the ability to improve for a full-year basis?\nLance Fritz: You are going to start, Jim\u2026\nJim Vena: Sure, sure. Listen, I'll start real quick, just to clear up the whole discussion about people, we have -- we started at 19% drop that we've announced over the first quarter year-over-year, and we think that we will continue to drop that down as the business comes down and with some productivity. I'm not sure where we're going to end up exactly, but stay tuned. I think we've got a great story moving ahead.\nJennifer Hamann: Yes, and just to clarify on Jim's comment that 19% is our train and engine crew.\nJim Vena: Right.\nJennifer Hamann: So that's the part of our workforce, not the whole workforce. So to your question, Scott then about full-year or no you know we pulled that guidance off the table and it really is going to be dependent on what happens in the marketplace, the commentary that you've heard us have here today. Again, we would love to see volumes come back and in that environment. You know, we feel very, very good about our potential and when you saw what we did was down 7% volumes in the first quarter, making very strong improvements in our operating ratio and that's the kind of call that the proof statement test case whatever for words you want to put around that. In terms of what we're capable of, so we're just not going to give any guidance right now because we don't have great visibility to what volumes are going to be, other than where we think second quarter is going to end out, but let's stay tuned on that and if that changes and starts to turn around a little bit. You bet; I mean we think we've got great long-term opportunities.\nJim Vena: Absolutely, we're looking forward to when our markets start returning to normal, because to Jennifer's point the first quarter is an absolute proof statement of what we're capable of doing.\nScott Group: So I guess that's actually my follow-up, if I can like so. A 59 in the first quarter to me is a full-year run rate, somewhere in the mid-50s range, whenever, not this year, obviously, but whenever things normalize. Is there anything about that 59 and 1Q that you feel is sort of not sustainable that we shouldn't think about sort of what the earnings power is in a couple of years, when things\u2026\nJim Vena: Not making a commentary on your math on what it translates into for the full-year. That 59 in the first quarter was clean.\nScott Group: Right, thank you.\nJim Vena: Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.\nTom Wadewitz: Yes. Good morning, and impressive performance against the tough backdrop, clearly. I wanted to ask you what Jim, if you could offer some thoughts on the kind of the PSR process it's like, sometimes you say well like, a softer volume environment a little bit easier to make some big structural changes. I think it'd be fair to say this is more than a soft volume environment. So, how do you think about the PSR changes the pace of change, and whether you can take another look at structural position, so you say, we had 14 carload terminals we now have whatever your number is. Maybe we -- it doesn't need to be nine; it could be five or six. How do you think about that just in terms of I'm thinking of the intermodal and carload terminal network, and whether you have now a chance to say oh, we can ratchet that down even further? Or maybe it's outside the terminal networks, it's something else?\nJim Vena: Tom, by now, I don't like to get away ahead and guess on what we're going to do next, and a lot of it is driven by car flow. So I think we have. We shut and idled five hump yards already, and there's probably possibility for more depending on how the traffic flows are, and we'll do that at the right time. Fort Worth cost us a little noise for a while, in the first quarter operationally and so you need to make sure you bet these things down well you don't impact the operation, but we see opportunities still and it doesn't matter where the volume is, it -- whether the volume is down or up, I see productivity, that we can and efficiency that we can get out of the place, and it's across the board. It's how we manage the number of people that we have that need to manage the processes we put in place for intermodal. Later on this year we're going to have consolidation in Chicago, down to three intermodal facilities from six. So I think that's great for us. We are looking at what we're doing down in the LA basin to see how we can give a better service product and be able to see -- touch the customer in a better way and the whole LA basin. So Tom, there's still lots out there. I see lots of opportunity but I'm being rolled. Hopefully I'm being smart, and I'll let Lance and Jennifer and Kenny give me the feedback, but we're trying to do this, or I'm trying to do it in a systematic manner where we don't impact the customer to the point where we lose business because of what we're doing, and we're able to do it and I think, and I've been here just over a year. I think it's been successful, great leadership from everybody at the table here with me. This is a team effort. So, I'm real happy and I -- there's lots of opportunity left, I must have just answered it, someone's going to ask me what any I mean, it's not football season anymore, it's not baseball season and I hope it was baseball season, but it's still like I got half of the game to go yet. Okay.\nLance Fritz: Hey, Tom. Part of your question also kind of is contemplating again depth and length of this downturn, and that's what makes our decisions the most difficult right now. So right now what we've got is decisions that we've made about resources like our exports, so that some part of our furloughed crews are more accessible to us quickly we've talked about at the ready locomotives. We've taken an action here on our non-agreement workforce and instead of taking a large scale of permanent force reduction. We thought for this period of time it's more prudent to ask our non-agreement workforce to take required unpaid leave of absence, so a week a month for four months. All of those actions are with an eye towards recovery is going to occur. We need to be ready for it, we need to be ready for whatever shape it takes, and still do what's prudent in the current environment, we think we got that balance.\nTom Wadewitz: Right, okay, that makes a lot of sense. For my second question, just wanted to -- I guess, ask a question about the kind of price versus volume, calculate, I guess is the truck market is, there's obviously a lot of excess capacity out there. So probably in the near-term trucks compete a bit harder and maybe they can even compete on longer length of haul that might affect whereas we normally think Eastern rails are more affected by truck, kind of how do you manage the pricing approach? It's great to be really disciplined on price but that could cause some further share loss to truck in certain segments on a near-term basis. I don't know Kenny or Lance, if you want to offer thoughts on the kind of view versus truck and price versus volume approach?\nLance Fritz: Sure. Let me start and Kenny will give it some fine points. Parts of our pricing philosophy, the core pricing philosophy is unchanged and that's about having to generate a return on whatever piece of business we secure and making sure that our price reflects our value. What is cool about having fundamentally shifted our cost structure is that it opens up more markets to us. Clearly, trucks are very competitive in a loose market like what we've got right now. There is going to be elements of truck competitive business that makes no sense for us to pursue because somebody in the trucking world is willing to take it just to generate enough cash to survive, but our cost structure opens up a broader segment of that market to compete and win and generate an attractive return and we're doing that.\nKenny Rocker: Yes, the only thing I'll mention is that again just to go back to the car velocity number and that's an average number, there is some mark areas where that car velocity number is much greater, and it has given us the ability to go out there and get the pricing that we believe we should be receiving or the service product that we're providing our customers. There is tremendous value that we're talking about when we talk to our customers and we're renewing business and going after new business and asking them to open up their truck lines for us.\nTom Wadewitz: Right. Okay, thank you for the time.\nLance Fritz: Thank you,Tom.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I'm sorry, but just to follow-up on the productivity targets again a little bit confused because in a based on the commentary about the changing range, it does sound like the productivity target is somewhat related to volume growth. So is it fair to say that you are now at the stage of PSR a lot of the cost side like the fat and the company has been taken out, and it's mostly going to be an efficiency/volume driven or improvement story from here?\nLance Fritz: Okay. I'll start, Ravi. This is Lance. So the short answer is it's always easier for us to get productivity in a growing environment than in a shrinking environment. We've proven we can get it in a shrinking environment. When you shrink at 25%, it gets really, really difficult. It doesn't go to zero, but it just gets pretty difficult. In terms of PSR and fat clearly at 59 operating ratio, there is a less easy opportunity than there was at 69 operating ratio, but there is still opportunity in Jim's outlined many of them.\nKenny Rocker: Well, Lance, I think you hit that perfect unless there's a follow-up on it.\nRavi Shanker: Yes. That's maybe, Lance, I have a follow-up for you, kind of just thinking big picture. Do you think a situation like this going to be unprecedented shutdowns you're seeing right now, again going back to the adage of never waste a good crisis. I mean, do you see some of your customers making permanent changes in their domestic or global supply chains, and does that mean some of that is at risk for you, some of that as an opportunity kind of what do you see are some of the kinds of permanent changes coming to supply chain in the future?\nLance Fritz: That's a great question, Ravi, and for sure there are going to be some opportunities that grow out of this crisis. One is we do hear our customers talking about evaluating their supply chains with an eye towards reliability being valued a little bit higher. That means near shoring or on-shoring some of those supply chains, and that would be a good thing for us generally speaking, we haven't necessarily seen that happen. I think it's way too early. I don't think you're going to see wholesale investment happen until suppliers. The industry starts becoming more confident in the demand side, but clearly I think we're going to see that, and that'll benefit, Mexico it'll benefit our, to and from Mexico business, and it will probably benefit our inside the United States businesses as well.\nRavi Shanker: Great, thank you.\nLance Fritz: Yep. Thanks, Ravi.\nOperator: And next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.\nJustin Long: Thanks and good morning. So I wanted to follow up on some of the intermodal commentary. Obviously we've seen a substantial decline in fuel prices, and it doesn't sound like the energy market is coming back anytime soon. Does that change the way you think about long-term growth in your domestic intermodal business, or with the service improvements that you've seen and continue to see, do you think this is still a GDP plus business when the economy bounces back given if the energy market doesn't bounce back?\nLance Fritz: Yes. There is no change in how we look at the business plus changes that are service product is much, much stronger now and much more reliable and gives an opportunity to compete and win out there, and as I mentioned we are in two-thirds into the bid season. On the domestic side, we feel really good about the wins that are out there. I can't predict what's going to happen with GDP when it -- where those numbers are going to go, but I can predict that the service product is going to allow us to compete and win, and I feel just as confident and feel just as committed to what our commercial team is doing on the international intermodal side too.\nJustin Long: Okay, and maybe as a follow-up on mix, obviously, it was positive here in the first quarter, but going forward, how are you thinking about general merchandize versus intermodal on a relative basis as we kind of think about the magnitude of the volume decline that we could see in the near term? And also just the timing of the recovery between those two segments? Just wanted to get your high level thoughts on how those businesses perform on a relative basis if we think about the implications of mix?\nJim Vena: Well, if you are thinking about relative basis and for that you are talking about margin by commodity or product line, we like them all, and we have talked about how we've done a lot of work to fundamentally improve the intermodal margins to a point where we would love to see that grow like anything else, but this mix that you saw here has a lot to do with the fact we are getting 1200 bucks a box for every move of intermodal versus 25 or 3000 bucks for a carload box. Jennifer?\nJennifer Hamann: Yes. I mean in the first quarter obviously just look at it on an average revenue per car basis of our three business teams, the group that has the highest average revenue per car is our industrial team, and that's the group that has a little bit of growth for us here in the first quarter. So, those are the lines we have sort of given you guys the revenue ton per mile information on a broader segment of business, and so, I would just continue to watch that. We don't know what business is going to come back first, and so, that's really going to be the driver in terms of how the economy restarts and where that comes through. If it comes through in the manufacturing sector, that might be a positive for us. If it comes through more in the consumer goods and we are seeing more intermodal move, you see it there. I am less worried about mix and more concerned about what absolute volume is going to do, and that's where we want to see the market come back to us.\nJustin Long: Okay, I will leave it there. Thanks for the time.\nLance Fritz: Thanks, Justin.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good morning everyone, and thanks for taking my question. Jennifer, you did say that you have solid free cash flow expectation after dividend under various scenarios. So, I am going to sneak in there and ask if you are going to share some of those scenarios with us even hypothetically, but more importantly, I guess that continuing - you know, maybe lesser demand environment you can still protect your dividend. I guess would you be looking at leverage as that first source of liquidity, or would be capital spending? I guess where are the priorities in a weaker environment?\nJennifer Hamann: So, I appreciate the question about sharing the scenarios, but obviously you know that I am not going to do that. In terms of our cash priorities, I mean you have heard us consistently talk about we are going to invest in the business for the long-term that's what we are in this world to do is run a railroad and serve our customers, and grow the business, and so, Jim laid out very well for you how we are prioritizing that, and so, the first dollar goes to the capital investment, and we have our dividend which we very much committed to. We view that as an important part of our return to shareholders, and then, the excess free cash we have been using for share repurchases and that priority in terms of our spend is unchanged at this point.\nJim Vena: Yes. The first claim goes to keeping the railroad running and running well.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Seidl: Well, thank you, Operator. Most are asked and answered at this point, but wanted to circle back to remark that two-thirds of your domestic intermodal business has been sort of re-priced, so you have gotten through that. Just wanted to see if you guys can give a little bit more color on that commentary and how you think that pricing markets going to shape out going forward? And what are your plans as you approach that particularly since you are improving your service product? So, what you're offering now is a lot different than you were, what you were offering, let's say three, four years ago?\nLance Fritz: Thanks for that question. You've got a number of things going on. We've got a much stronger service product, which is going to help us as we're competing against all the modes call it barge, rail or truck, but we also have a lower cost structure which helps us get into some of these newer markets. What I will tell you is that because our service product has been so strong, I think that's been the change X factor for us to go out and win this new business. We are able to get a longer haul or compete more closely with the truck fleet. So we're going to continue to price as a service product. We expect to be over inflation. There's nothing that shows me we wouldn't be able to do that even though right now, there's a lot of truck capacity out there.\nJason Seidl: Okay, so you said that other two-thirds that you priced, that's been over inflation and you expect the remaining third to be priced over inflation as well, even in this difficult market?\nLance Fritz: That's true. That's correct. That's an excellent way to think about it.\nJason Seidl: Fantastic, appreciate the time as always and everyone please be safe out there.\nLance Fritz: Thank you, Jason.\nJennifer Hamann: Thanks, you too.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC. Please proceed with your question.\nWalter Spracklin: Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. So I want to focus my questions on the rebound, not so much when it's going to happen, but how you're going to handle the different potential shapes of that rebound that you alluded to and I guess the first question perhaps for Jim, I mean, there's a lot of complexity out there with regards to non-essential goods kind of being filling warehouses and essential goods having run. I think when things start to clear out, is there any concern that a sharp recovery is going to be aggravated by the complexity of cleaning out the system, so to speak. How are you preparing for, if we do see a faster rebound, how you handle that without being bogged down?\nJim Vena: Walter, listen, this is a great question. This is an extraordinary event. It's affecting the economy in a completely different way than I think anything, we've ever seen. So, we don't know whether it's going to be a quick up or it's going to be a slow up, but this is what we've done, we have prepared ourselves with the key ingredients you need to operate the railroad and rebound. So it's locomotives, people, we are out there every day and I give everybody at Union Pacific and all the people that are out there working that are still out there working every day, not just the Union Pacific accolades because our employees have come to work, and we have had no major issues with being able to move any of our trains, but what we're doing to get ready is the railroads in a safe manner. We're out there putting capital in, we have locomotives ready to go, like we've got enough locomotives that it could go back to where we were before. They are in a state where within hours, we can turn them back on and put them out in the fleet if we need to. We have people instead of following them completely, we're carrying a few extra and not just a few but we decided that it was a smart thing to do that be able to put the people back on to be able to operate the train. So we've done everything we can to handle whether it's a V, whether it's a U or it's and I'm hoping for a sharp turn. I hope the economy personally turns and everybody can get back to work and live the life that we had before, but if not we're set up to be ready for it, Walter.\nWalter Spracklin: And the second question here is related to a prior question, and Lance answered the question by the opportunity being near-shoring. Two other opportunities, I wanted you to ask, wanting you to comment on? First of all, does this give you, I guess on Jim side, the ability to bring people back at lower resource levels and easier to do than cutting them down to that level? If this didn't happen, and secondly, how would you, how would rail fit into the e-commerce trend in a world where e-commerce is ramping-up far faster than previously anticipated? How does rail provide a solution if this new world sees a lot more e-commerce purchases? Thanks.\nLance Fritz: Let me start Jim and then I'll turn it over to you. So, on the e-commerce question, clearly we're seeing e-commerce continue to penetrate in retail. We think that changes the opportunity, we don't think it decreases the opportunity. It changes supply chains, we still have a need to get from both to distribution site. Clearly, we're not part of hours or one-day delivery, but we don't have to be. What we have to be as part of the supply chain that gets product to the forward distribution sites that can fulfill like that, and we are and we continue to do that. So what it really says is we need to have our eyes wide open on the winners in that world and align well with them, and then I'll let Jim answer the question on resources and bringing them back.\nJim Vena: Walter, when we have whatever starting point we're at and we're at this point, absolutely because we see productivity gains, so we will not recall the same number of people back to work as we adjusted down. So, no if ands or buts, whether it was, whether we were for workforce when we have productivity gains that would have brought it down or now as it comes back, we just won't need quite as many people as we had before. Train size is one, we've got, if we can keep the train size up, we're going to need less people. So that's a good way to think about it, Walter.\nWalter Spracklin: I appreciate the time.\nJim Vena: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your questions.\nBascome Majors: Yes, thanks for taking my question, Jennifer, you understand the desire not to guide headcount in a very volume uncertain environment, but I was hoping you could kind of give us $1 framework for the executive pay temporary reductions and the sort of rotating leave of absences you've got with the Management workforce. Thanks.\nJennifer Hamann: Thanks Bascome. I'm going to decline that opportunity. It's part of everything that we're doing to manage our cost structure and pulling all the levers across the board, and you've heard us talk about that before, and you saw it in the first quarter where we were able to make improvement in every one of our cost categories, and so, this is part of certainly the comp and benefits line, but we've got work going on across the board, and that's really the way that we look at it is in that context.\nBascome Majors: Thank you.\nJennifer Hamann: Thanks, Bascome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJordan Alliger: Yes, hi. Just a quick question, obviously, had a pretty good degree of variable costs in the first quarter, when you think about it the expenses, total expenses now as you look out over a full-year basis. How would you describe or ascribe variable costs versus fixed costs or semi-variable on sort of the whole cost base? Thanks.\nLance Fritz: Yes, let me get started, and I know Jennifer has been thinking about this a lot. We did look backwards into the last recession, the Great Recession, and looked at our variable versus fixed at that time, what we communicated to the world and what we actually executed, and we did a better job through the recession than we thought based on what we thought was variable and fixed at that time. I can tell you in going into this downturn, we're even more agile and flexible than we were in the last downturn.\nJennifer Hamann: Yes, I mean, when we went back and did some of that, that work that Lance referenced, I think by the time we got through the recession, kind of call it end of 2009, we would have said we were maybe 80% volume variable or so adjusted for fuel. We said we were more than 100% already here in first quarter of 2020. So again, we have already been taken and that's the blessing of what we embarked with PSR and unified plan 2020 is we have already made significant changes in our cost structure, and when you think about yard closures, increasing train length, all of those things and the locomotive productivity we're seeing, that's given us great, much greater volume variability. Obviously, in the short-term, those areas that are the most volume variable for us are going to be on the comp and benefits line, fuel is almost 100% volume variable for us. Equipment rents is also pretty, pretty volume variable, and then everything else is something that over time, we'll continue to work through, but that's where I again, I think we're just in a very good position or in a different position than we were in the last recession because of all the work that we had already undertaken and have in the pipeline because of our unified plan 2020 efforts.\nLance Fritz: And Jordan, Jennifer, I think the critical difference is speed of decision making and speed of implementation, that that's fundamentally different today and a benefit.\nJordan Alliger: Great, thank you for those thoughts.\nLance Fritz: Yes, sure.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Vernon: Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the time. Jennifer, I wanted to ask on the -- or Ken maybe, I wanted to ask you the step up in the mix price benefit from fourth quarter to first quarter. How much of that extra tailwind is from the mix side versus the price side? And if you think about within the commodity groups is there any one particular driver of commodities that led to a better mix from the price utilization standpoint?\nJennifer Hamann: Well, thanks for the question, David. But we're not giving specific pricing guidance any longer. I think we made that statement a couple of quarters ago, so I'm not going to break that out for you, but I think consistent with my commentary, the less intermodal was certainly a part of that mix when you think that that is our lowest arc business that we have on the railroad, and that was offset somewhat by the fact that we also had sand lower, but net-net it was still a positive. Again, if you really look at that Industrial line, that's where we had some good growth in the quarter, and that's where we have some strong arc.\nDavid Vernon: Okay. And then I guess as you think about the separate line on fuel, the fuel surcharge headwind sort of moderated a little bit into lower oil price. Does that also have like a mix component in it or like what are we looking at there in terms of the sequential step-down in that fuel headwind into a lower fuel price environment?\nJennifer Hamann: Well, I think as I said, fuel was actually a tailwind for us in the quarter. And that's kind of an all-in view in terms of the price, the surcharge, all taken together in terms of how we view that. There is a little bit of a lag year-over-year as we move into the second quarter as fuel prices have come down so steeply. But we don't see that as being a significant driver relative to the -- how we look at things on a mix basis.\nDavid Vernon: But is there a reason why the surcharge headwind to revenue would moderate into lower fuel, just wanted to -- I'm just trying to understand how that number.\nJennifer Hamann: Oh, the headwind to revenue?\nDavid Vernon: Yes.\nJennifer Hamann: No. I mean it is a factor in the overall arcs. As you see less fuel surcharge that's going to be reflected in the arcs we have. But as I mentioned, it does lag a little bit in terms of how fuel price comes down and how our surcharge comes down.\nDavid Vernon: All right, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore. Please proceed with your questions.\nJon Chappell: Thank you. Good morning everyone. Just one for me, Jennifer, the buyback cause completely prudent, trimming the CapEx also makes a ton of sense. I assume you talked with the credit agencies around the time of your debt issuance earlier this month. So just any change of tone from that perspective around leveraged targets and do you feel you're kind of bumping up against the top end of 2.7 times, and how that impacts your decisions to take on some of the additional liquidity, which you said you don't need right now, but just in case 2Q bleeds into 3Q at these levels? \nJennifer Hamann: Sure. So we've used the 2.7 as just kind of a shorthand math for you all in terms of expressing where we view that within kind of the context of our credit rating. To your point, we did have dialogue with the credit agency around the time of our $750 million issuance. We share with them kind of our best thinking, some of our scenarios. And as I mentioned in my comments, they're comfortable with where we're at. Certainly if we had a need to go back into the markets we would have that dialogue again, but we feel very good where we're at. We believe we've got good access to credit if we need that. And we've obviously got some other things in terms of our revolver and the receivables facility if we need to, but those are, I would call, more of a belts-than-suspenders approach, but we feel good about it. I have no concerns there, and I believe the rating agency feel good with us as well.\nJon Chappell: All right, thanks, Jen.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of David Ross with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Ross: Thank you. Good morning everyone. Jim, wanted to talk about that first slide you put up regarding service level goals, specifically around manifest and auto trip plan compliance. Is there anything you guys have articulated as to where you want that to go, from 64 today?\nJim Vena: History tells me that with different customers the manifest business is a little bit different. This tried to reflect what we have committed to the customer, and we are measuring ourselves harder than what we actually committed to the customer as far as what their trip plan is on the individual railcar. So, you never get this number to a 100 just the same as the intermodal never gets to a 100. It's impossible to get there, but I think I would like to see it another double digit improvement, and I think if we do another double digit improvement the way we measure it, we remove most of the noise or a lot of the noise on how the interaction is of us living up to what we have committed to the customer. So, that's the way I look at it, David.\nLance Fritz: Hey, Jim, a little bit of whatever the number was 64-65 in the first quarter was self-inflected. You mentioned on the call that we had a little noise around our change in Fort Worth at Davidson Yard, where you stopped humping at Davidson, and that impacted that to a degree for probably six weeks. So, I would expect to your point, we are growing that number to start with a seven.\nKenny Rocker: What's was not reflected in that number is that the transit times have gotten better. That's one thing, and I can tell you that our customers are acknowledging that the service on the carload side has gotten better.\nJim Vena: Yes.\nDavid Ross: And are there any commodities that are harder to handle that would reduce the productivity with the manifest network, so if you have more of X than Y, it slows it down?\nLance Fritz: Absolutely, if you have cars that you don't touch as often, makes it easier for you to be able to handle. So, we are bulk railroad. Some people are bulk railroads more than we are at this point then you will load them up at one place and you haul them to the other. I am going to say is my mother could do that. So, it's a lot easier to get a number of it, so yes, but other traffic we have to handle in multiple and more steps. You have a better chance to have a failure somewhere in the process.\nJim Vena: And we love that business.\nLance Fritz: I love it all.\nJim Vena: We love that.\nLance Fritz: We got a railroad that can fill up, so I love it all.\nDavid Ross: I am sure your mom is glad you are following in family footstep.\nJim Vena: Well, we have to finish this call with a little humor, [multiple speakers] and David, and to everybody, I should have mentioned even more, and I know Lance will, but listen, I am really proud of everybody and also everybody out there that is working to keep this country going from people at the frontline everywhere. So, thank you very much.\nDavid Ross: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Lance Fritz for closing comments.\nLance Fritz: Thank you very much, Rob, and thank you all for your questions. Thank you participating with us this morning and for doing what you need to keep yourselves and your families, your loved ones safe and healthy. We look forward to talking with you again in July to discuss our second quarter 2020 results. Until then, I wish you all good health. Take care.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jim Vena",
            "content": "Thanks, Lance, and good morning everyone. As Lance mentioned, the railroad is healthy and operating smoothly as our customers have seen minimal rail service impact. We are taking every precaution to protect our employees. We are social distancing and using technology whenever possible to replace face-to-face interaction. Over the past few weeks, I've taken the opportunity to visit several field locations practicing good social distancing, to talk with our employees. I could not be more proud of how they remain dedicated to safely and reliably operating the railway without disruption as they recognize the critical role they play in delivering goods needed throughout our country. Their dedication is to be commended. Overall, the team had a very strong quarter. Really, the results speak for themselves. You see the impact of all the changes we've made at Union Pacific to become more efficient and provide a better service product to our customers. These changes drove an operating ratio of 59%, which was outstanding, and there are still many more opportunities ahead of us to further improve safety, asset utilization, and network efficiency. Now turning to slide four, I'd like to update you on our key performance metrics. For the first time, we are seeing improvement across all of our metrics, and as a result, we are seeing a better service product for our customers. This is a direct result of our focus on improving network efficiency and service reliability as part of our operating model. Compared to the first quarter of 2019, freight car velocity improved 8% driven by continued improvement in asset utilization and fewer car classifications. Freight car terminal dwell improved 11% largely due to improved terminal processes, transportation plan changes to eliminate car touches, and a decrease in freight car inventory levels. Building off our progress in 2019, we continue to implement changes in order to run a more efficient network that requires fewer locomotives, which has led to an 18% improvement in locomotive productivity this quarter versus last year. As demonstrated by crew starts being down 13% in the quarter, which outpaced the 7% decline in carloads, we continue to take steps to deliver positive workforce productivity. Trip plan compliances, where our customers feel the benefit of our transformed operating model, the improvement in intermodal speaks for itself. With manifest and autos, we are holding ourselves to our higher standard as we tighten schedules, and we'll see improvements as we move forward. We are off to a great start this year, and we expect to see continued improvement in our service products going forward. Starting next week, we will provide some additional operating statistics, in particular, freight car velocity, which you have heard me say a number of times as my favorite one that I look at every morning on our Investors Web site on a weekly basis to provide more insight to how our operations are running. Let's turn to slide five. It highlights some of our recent network changes. As a part of our continued implementation of position-scheduled railroading, we consolidated mechanical shops in the L.A. Basin and Houston areas. In the L.A. Basin, we've consolidated from three shops to one; while in Houston we've gone from two shops to operating just one as well. Increasing train size remains one of our main areas of focus and we are making excellent progress. At our recently completed Santa Teresa block swop facility, we are consolidating intermodal traffic from our eastern ramps destined to port terminals in Los Angeles Long Beach area. This allows us to operate longer more efficient trains across the Sunset Route, and provide a better more consistent service product to our customers. We also completed eight 15,000 foot sidings as a part of our 2020 capital plan to extend sidings in targeted locations. These sidings support our efficiency initiatives by increasing the number of long trains we can operate in each direction, thus reducing demand for crew starts. By putting more products on fewer trains we have increased train length across our system by 19% or over 1,300 feet since the fourth quarter of 2019, to approximately 8,400 feet in the first quarter of 2020. The capital we are investing to improve productivity as well as to maintain the safe efficient network is critical to the long-term health of our railroad. Given the current business levels and uncertain economic environment, we are planning to trim back our 2020 spend by $150 million to $200 million. To wrap up, we are committed to protecting our employees' health and safety while providing uninterrupted critical service to support the nation's supply chain. While we're early in the second quarter, so far we have been able to hold steady and maintain train length gains as volumes have dropped. We continue to evaluate our transportation plan, including yard and local schedules, in order to meet customers' demands while balancing our resources and assets to meet current volumes. Since the latter half of March, as volumes decline more steeply, we stored additional locomotives and railcars. However those locomotives remain in at-the-ready status and both assets are available to add back quickly as volumes return. We have also furloughed additional employees. However, we are increasing our auxiliary work and training status force to be prepared should volumes come back quickly or in the event of an outbreak within a group of the employees. We have made great progress at this point; however we will continue to transform our operations in order to further improve safety, asset utilization and network efficiency. With that, I'll turn it over to Kenny to provide an update on our business environment. Kenny? Listen, the coal network was built to handle way more trains than we're handling. So, it starts off on a separate piece of the railroad, so there's no if, ands or buts that we're going to -- we're looking at that. We've got plans to be able to take advantage and use some of that, both in maintenance and some of the capital that we've put on the ground in there. On some of the other network, a little more difficult because if the -- it just mixes up with the rest of the trains we run, but absolutely, Allison, we've got a plan of when some segment of the railroad sees a downturn in traffic that we fix it. The big challenge for Kenny is this: I want him to fill it up. So I think he's got a great service product, and we get out there and fill out those pieces that are [technical difficulty] -- running with less traffic right now. Well, listen, that was a multi-person answer question. I think Jennifer wants to jump in, but let me just start with what I see. You can see that we're high double-digit drop in the number of employees already versus where the business dropped, and so, it gives us a chance to be able to be there, and that's why in the comment the way I answered Allison's question. I'm very comfortable that at this place, I don't know what's going to happen to the business, I'm open for a big V coming back, but who knows. So we are prepared and preparing to make sure that we do not set ourselves up. That if the business comes back in quicker than some people think that we're prepared for it. So that's why the way we parked our locomotives. We've got lots of locomotives. I don't even want to talk about how many we've got parked right now, it's so many. I worry more about the productivity number that's out there, that's what's real key is how many -- so we've got locomotives ready to go. The business comes back, if it comes back slow or fast we're ready for it, and people, we have been smart about how we manage all the labor that we have. So we are purposefully, at this point, because of the substantial drop over a short period of time that we have put people in places so that we can recall them. They cost us a little bit of less money, but they're available real quick to return to the railroad so we don't impact. Service is key for us, you know, you can't be running an efficient railroad, and I've always said that, and I know some people mix this whole thing up, PSR and service. So you can't have a good operating railroad that will operate safely if you don't have customers that want to come on it, and that's what we're building. I think we're there. Kenny should be able to go out and sell it, but at the end of the day that's what we're all about. Jennifer? So, Jennifer, and Brian, listen, $220 million first quarter starts us off real well to be able to deliver what we said, I think it's prudent that we look at it because if you drop volume, you have less chance to reduce, and just the way we measure cost takeout, it's true cost, there isn't anything, volume doesn't help us, but I'll tell you this, there's a list of things that I still want to get done, and with that, the way we operate our locals, the way we're handling our intermodal terminals to make them more efficient, the train size is still there, we can be more fluid with how we handle the railcars. You've seen us shut down a couple of diesel shops. So, all those things are still out there, and unless really the markets changed for us even more, I'm very comfortable with where Jennifer's got us guidance for this year. I'm very comfortable. I won't use the word go by, otherwise Jennifer will get excited, but I'm very comfortable with where we are. Well, listen to Ken. It's a good question in that, usually the way I like to look at it is if you have a downturn of business and you know it's going to come back why adjust your capital program at all. We went through it and it's more like a timing that rolls into next year. This is not anything that everything that we had in the capital plan was built for to make this railroad better, more productive, safer and sustainable over the long-term. So we're not changing that, but we thought it was prudent with where the revenues are at this point in the business level to just slide some of it into an early part of next year, and because we give a guidance on a year-to-year basis, that's what's happening. So we are not -- absolutely there is some areas where we're going to spend money faster and we can see that. So if we have some opportunity even after we make the adjustment in the capital to be able to use some of that cash because we're more efficient, we'll spend it this year at this point, but stay tuned, and we'll adjust it as we see what's happened to the business. Jennifer, anything else? Okay, nice. Thanks again. I'm sorry, Ken, you broke up. Oh. Listen, we've got so many locomotives part that I'm just about embarrassed to say how many we have parked, okay. So, there's some noise in it right now because of the business drop, but this is a number I look at, Ken, and I gave it to you at 18% improvement and locomotive productivity is the key number. We have lots of locomotives part. We're good if the business comes back, we're good if the business grows. We are being smart; we're putting all the technology, we've got the best locomotives and you can see the fuel efficiency that we said five, but you could take some of the noise out but a true 4% betterment. So there are some locomotors, we have a lot of them parked and we continue to park them every day right now with where we are with the business levels. Sure, sure. Listen, I'll start real quick, just to clear up the whole discussion about people, we have -- we started at 19% drop that we've announced over the first quarter year-over-year, and we think that we will continue to drop that down as the business comes down and with some productivity. I'm not sure where we're going to end up exactly, but stay tuned. I think we've got a great story moving ahead. Right. Absolutely, we're looking forward to when our markets start returning to normal, because to Jennifer's point the first quarter is an absolute proof statement of what we're capable of doing. Not making a commentary on your math on what it translates into for the full-year. That 59 in the first quarter was clean. Thanks, Scott. Tom, by now, I don't like to get away ahead and guess on what we're going to do next, and a lot of it is driven by car flow. So I think we have. We shut and idled five hump yards already, and there's probably possibility for more depending on how the traffic flows are, and we'll do that at the right time. Fort Worth cost us a little noise for a while, in the first quarter operationally and so you need to make sure you bet these things down well you don't impact the operation, but we see opportunities still and it doesn't matter where the volume is, it -- whether the volume is down or up, I see productivity, that we can and efficiency that we can get out of the place, and it's across the board. It's how we manage the number of people that we have that need to manage the processes we put in place for intermodal. Later on this year we're going to have consolidation in Chicago, down to three intermodal facilities from six. So I think that's great for us. We are looking at what we're doing down in the LA basin to see how we can give a better service product and be able to see -- touch the customer in a better way and the whole LA basin. So Tom, there's still lots out there. I see lots of opportunity but I'm being rolled. Hopefully I'm being smart, and I'll let Lance and Jennifer and Kenny give me the feedback, but we're trying to do this, or I'm trying to do it in a systematic manner where we don't impact the customer to the point where we lose business because of what we're doing, and we're able to do it and I think, and I've been here just over a year. I think it's been successful, great leadership from everybody at the table here with me. This is a team effort. So, I'm real happy and I -- there's lots of opportunity left, I must have just answered it, someone's going to ask me what any I mean, it's not football season anymore, it's not baseball season and I hope it was baseball season, but it's still like I got half of the game to go yet. Okay. Well, if you are thinking about relative basis and for that you are talking about margin by commodity or product line, we like them all, and we have talked about how we've done a lot of work to fundamentally improve the intermodal margins to a point where we would love to see that grow like anything else, but this mix that you saw here has a lot to do with the fact we are getting 1200 bucks a box for every move of intermodal versus 25 or 3000 bucks for a carload box. Jennifer? Yes. The first claim goes to keeping the railroad running and running well. Walter, listen, this is a great question. This is an extraordinary event. It's affecting the economy in a completely different way than I think anything, we've ever seen. So, we don't know whether it's going to be a quick up or it's going to be a slow up, but this is what we've done, we have prepared ourselves with the key ingredients you need to operate the railroad and rebound. So it's locomotives, people, we are out there every day and I give everybody at Union Pacific and all the people that are out there working that are still out there working every day, not just the Union Pacific accolades because our employees have come to work, and we have had no major issues with being able to move any of our trains, but what we're doing to get ready is the railroads in a safe manner. We're out there putting capital in, we have locomotives ready to go, like we've got enough locomotives that it could go back to where we were before. They are in a state where within hours, we can turn them back on and put them out in the fleet if we need to. We have people instead of following them completely, we're carrying a few extra and not just a few but we decided that it was a smart thing to do that be able to put the people back on to be able to operate the train. So we've done everything we can to handle whether it's a V, whether it's a U or it's and I'm hoping for a sharp turn. I hope the economy personally turns and everybody can get back to work and live the life that we had before, but if not we're set up to be ready for it, Walter. Walter, when we have whatever starting point we're at and we're at this point, absolutely because we see productivity gains, so we will not recall the same number of people back to work as we adjusted down. So, no if ands or buts, whether it was, whether we were for workforce when we have productivity gains that would have brought it down or now as it comes back, we just won't need quite as many people as we had before. Train size is one, we've got, if we can keep the train size up, we're going to need less people. So that's a good way to think about it, Walter. Thank you. History tells me that with different customers the manifest business is a little bit different. This tried to reflect what we have committed to the customer, and we are measuring ourselves harder than what we actually committed to the customer as far as what their trip plan is on the individual railcar. So, you never get this number to a 100 just the same as the intermodal never gets to a 100. It's impossible to get there, but I think I would like to see it another double digit improvement, and I think if we do another double digit improvement the way we measure it, we remove most of the noise or a lot of the noise on how the interaction is of us living up to what we have committed to the customer. So, that's the way I look at it, David. Yes. And we love that business. We love that. Well, we have to finish this call with a little humor, [multiple speakers] and David, and to everybody, I should have mentioned even more, and I know Lance will, but listen, I am really proud of everybody and also everybody out there that is working to keep this country going from people at the frontline everywhere. So, thank you very much."

            "name": "Jennifer Hamann",
            "content": "Thanks, Kenny, and good morning. As you heard from Lance earlier Union Pacific is reporting first quarter earnings per share of $2.15, and an all-time best quarterly operating ratio of 59%. Our fourth consecutive quarter starting with a five comparing our first quarter results to 2019 there are a few puts and takes. Last year, we incurred higher weather-related expenses, and you may also recall that we received a payroll tax refund that benefited both our operating ratio and earnings per share. As shown on slide 13, these two items had an offsetting impact in our 2020 results. Fuel was an unexpected tailwind in the quarter and likely will be for much of 2020 as the year-over-year fuel production -- fuel price reductions favorably impacted our quarterly operating ratio by 80 basis points and added $0.04 earnings per share. Setting inside those items, core margin improvement for the quarter was a remarkable 3.8 points, and added $0.18 earnings per share, as we continue to demonstrate the power of our operating model, as well as the ability to flex our cost structure in the face of volume challenges. Thanks to the dedication and results of the entire Union Pacific team. We took another significant step forward to our goal of operating the most efficient reliable and consistent railroad in North America. Looking now at our first quarter income statement, 2020 operating revenue totaled $5.2 billion, down 3% versus last year on a 7% year-over-year volume decrease, demonstrating our ability to be more than volume variable, operating expense decreased 10% to $3.1 billion. These results net to operating income of $2.1 billion, a 9% increase versus 2019. Below the line, other income decreased compared to 2019 as the payroll tax refund I referenced on the prior slide included $27 million of interest income. Interest expense increase 13% due to increased debt levels, while income tax expense also was higher up 11% due to higher pre-tax income in the quarter. Net income of $1.5 billion was up 6% versus last year, which when combined with our share repurchase activity led to an 11% increase in earnings per share to $2.15. Looking at revenue for the first quarter Slide 15 provides a breakdown of our freight revenue, which totaled $4.9 billion down 2.5% versus last year. While not able to offset the impact of the 7% lower volumes, the combination of favorable business mix, and our pricing actions had nearly a five-point positive impact on our quarterly freight revenue. Positive mix in the quarter was driven by lower intermodal shipments, partially offset by lower sand volume. In addition, fuel surcharge revenue declined $47 million in the quarter to $351 million, and impacted freight revenue by 25 basis points. Drivers of the decline were lower volume and fuel prices. Now, let's move to slide 16, which provide a summary of our first quarter operating expenses. Through our Unified Plan 2020, and G55 + 0 initiatives, we drove improvement across all cost categories. Compensation and benefits expense decreased 12% year-over-year, primarily as a result of our workforce and productivity initiatives. Total first quarter workforce declined 15%, or about 6200 full-time equivalent versus last year. Sequentially, our workforce is down 2%. Breaking the year-over-year, reduction is down a little more, we saw a 19% decrease in our train and engine workforce, while management engineering and mechanical workforces together decreased 13%. This expense category also benefited from last year-over-year weather-related cost offset by the payroll tax refund I referenced earlier. Fuel expense decreased 18% as a result of lower diesel fuel prices and fewer gallons consumed with a more efficient operations. Our consumption rates for the quarter improved 5% versus last year to a first quarter best level. Decreased costs associated with maintaining smaller active locomotive fleet as well as lower weather-related costs were key drivers of the 10% reduction in purchase services and materials expense. In addition, as we use both our locomotive and car fleet more efficiently, we've been able to lower lease expense, which largely contributed to the 12% decline in equipment and other rents. With regard to other expense, which was down 2% in the quarter, we recorded an adjustment to our bad debt reserve to recognize uncertainty related to certain customer receivables due to the potential impact of COVID-19. That expense increase was offset by running a safer railroad, which lower destroyed equipment costs as well as freight loss and damage expense. Finally, for full-year 2020, we now expect year-over-year depreciation expense to be flat. Looking at productivity and our cost structure, net productivity totaled approximately $220 million in the first quarter. As Jim detailed earlier, with our improved key performance indicators, the successful implementation and enhancement of our operating plan is increasing efficiency while at the same time providing a superior service product for our customers. As we've discussed in the past, we view productivity as a volume neutral measure. In other words, we're reporting only that part of our cost savings attributable to the actions we are taking, but as we enter this recessionary period sparked by COVID-19 I'd like to make a couple of comments about volume variability, in particular as it relates to prior recessions. First and most importantly, Union Pacific is running at efficiency levels that we've never experienced before as a company. For example, we were more than volume variable on a fuel adjusted basis in the first quarter of 2020 as a result of the strong productivity focus embedded in unified plan 2020. We've also taken more than 1500 basis points off of our operating ratio since the great financial crisis in 2008, 2009. That further strengthens our ability to manage through today's challenges and emerged stronger on the other side. Moving to cash generation, as we face these fluid and uncertain times, we recognize the need to maintain ample liquidity with the strength of our balance sheet and our strong cash generation, I can confidently say that we are well positioned for the challenges we are facing. Cash from operations in the first quarter increased 10% versus 2019 to $2.2 billion. Free cash flow after dividend and after capital investments totaled over $1.3 billion, resulting in a 91% cash conversion rate. We also returned $3.6 billion to shareholders during the first quarter through the continued payment of an industry leading dividend and the repurchase of 14 million shares of our common stock. Share purchases were funded in part from our January debt issuance. Union Pacific strong investment grade credit rating and a very attractive interest rate market allowed us to issue $3 billion of new debt. A portion of that issuance funded the $2 billion accelerated share repurchase program we entered into in February and the rest is for 2020 debt maturities. We finished the quarter at an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.7 times, in line with our previously stated goal of maintaining strong investment grade credit ratings no lower than BBB plus and BAA1. Although COVID-19 was not contemplated when we originally set our leverage targets back in 2018, the decision to manage our balance sheet in line with a strong investment grade credit rating was clearly the right one. We maintain an active dialogue with our rating agencies and at this time they are comfortable with our current leveraged position. We finished the first quarter with $1.1 billion of cash on hand. However, in an abundance of caution, we issued $750 million of 30 year notes in early April to further increase liquidity. As of yesterday, our cash balance was around $2 billion and we have additional levers available if needed. The current bond market is open to us as evidenced by our April issuance. We also have $2 billion of credit available under our undrawn credit revolver and up to an additional $400 million available under our receivable securitization facility, which is 50% drawn at this time. As we sit here today, we do not believe it will be necessary to tap those additional sources, but we view them as a prudent backstop to have at the ready. Turning now to our 2020 outlook, we are formally withdrawing much of our previous guidance in light of the current economic uncertainties. In particular, we are no longer providing guidance for the full-year 2020 volume, headcount, operating ratio, or share repurchases. To date, we have repurchased roughly $17 billion of the targeted $20 billion three year program that is set to conclude at the end of this year. We will continue to monitor business conditions and adjust this activity as we see prudent, but with share repurchases currently paused, completion of the full $20 billion seems less likely today. As you heard from Kenny a moment ago, our second quarter car loadings are currently down 22%, and our current view is that volumes for the full quarter could be down around 25% or so. With volumes declines of that magnitude we are taking actions across the board to right-size our resources and manage expenses. Even with aggressive action however, it is unlikely we can improve our second quarter operating ratio on a year-over-year basis with that level of volumes loss. Unchanging for 2020 is our long-standing guidance around pricing. We still expect the total dollars generated from our pricing actions to exceed rail inflation costs. With regard to productivity we are widening our range of expectations for full-year 2020 to $400 million to $500 million. We clearly got off to a very strong start in the first quarter, and our commitment to productivity is unwavering. However, we also recognize that the loss of volume leverage is a challenge. In terms of cash generation and cash allocation we've modeled a number of different down volume scenarios. In each we plan to maintain the dividend but with the capital modifications Jim mentioned, and a suspension of share repurchases. The outcome of that exercise is a strong confidence in our ability to generate significant free cash flow after dividends in some pretty dire economic conditions. This is a testament to the earnings power of our franchise, as demonstrated by our first quarter results. Although frustrated by current conditions, the potential is clearly there. Longer-term, our guidance of capital expenditures of less than 15% of revenue, a dividend payout ratio of 40% to 45% of earnings, and ultimately that 55% operating ratio remain intact. As you have heard from the entire leadership team today, we are unwavering in our commitment to improving safety, efficiency, and service as well all firmly believe in the strong long-term prospects of our company. So with that, I'll turn it back to Lance. Thanks, Amit. No, my comment was on a year-over-year basis, and saying that with volumes declines that we're expecting of this magnitude, so down 25% or so, it's unlikely that we would be able to improve our operating ratio in the quarter. It was a quarter-only comment on a year-over-year -- Yes, I mean, so we're obviously not going to give guidance on decremental margins. Again, you look at our first quarter performance, very strong. We were more than 100% volume variable, but I think when you thinking about how we look at the second quarter, I mean obviously 25% down volumes, and you -- your earlier questioner was asking around the operating ratio. It's tough to keep up in terms of your cost cutting when you have volumes come out that fast. We are going to be very aggressive and do everything we can, but we are not going to give specific guidance relative to headcount for second quarter or relative to the margins, but just know we're going to pull every lever available to us. Sure. So, you're right, we do take out the volume variability part of the cost. So, if we're going to have fewer train starts because of lower costs, we don't count that in the number, but if we have reduced train starts, like through Jim's long train productivity initiatives, those are things that we put into our productivity number. My comment was meant to say is that when you have less volume, it's harder to leverage that, and so, when we were putting together our plan for 2020, recall, we originally said we were looking for a little bit of positive volume growth when we gave the guidance of $500 million or so productivity. We've obviously taken that volume growth off the table in terms of what we're seeing today, and so, that's why we feel like we need to widen that range a little bit in the $400 million to $500 million range. So that's how you should think about that, but Jim, you might want to add a little more? And just a quick reminder, I mean, our comparisons on a year -over-year basis relative to productivity get harder through the course of the year. We closed out the year with close to $200 million, $215 million of productivity. So, take all of those comments kind of into your mosaic of how you think about it, Chris. No, I think you summed it up, Jim. Yes, and just to clarify on Jim's comment that 19% is our train and engine crew. So that's the part of our workforce, not the whole workforce. So to your question, Scott then about full-year or no you know we pulled that guidance off the table and it really is going to be dependent on what happens in the marketplace, the commentary that you've heard us have here today. Again, we would love to see volumes come back and in that environment. You know, we feel very, very good about our potential and when you saw what we did was down 7% volumes in the first quarter, making very strong improvements in our operating ratio and that's the kind of call that the proof statement test case whatever for words you want to put around that. In terms of what we're capable of, so we're just not going to give any guidance right now because we don't have great visibility to what volumes are going to be, other than where we think second quarter is going to end out, but let's stay tuned on that and if that changes and starts to turn around a little bit. You bet; I mean we think we've got great long-term opportunities. Yes. I mean in the first quarter obviously just look at it on an average revenue per car basis of our three business teams, the group that has the highest average revenue per car is our industrial team, and that's the group that has a little bit of growth for us here in the first quarter. So, those are the lines we have sort of given you guys the revenue ton per mile information on a broader segment of business, and so, I would just continue to watch that. We don't know what business is going to come back first, and so, that's really going to be the driver in terms of how the economy restarts and where that comes through. If it comes through in the manufacturing sector, that might be a positive for us. If it comes through more in the consumer goods and we are seeing more intermodal move, you see it there. I am less worried about mix and more concerned about what absolute volume is going to do, and that's where we want to see the market come back to us. So, I appreciate the question about sharing the scenarios, but obviously you know that I am not going to do that. In terms of our cash priorities, I mean you have heard us consistently talk about we are going to invest in the business for the long-term that's what we are in this world to do is run a railroad and serve our customers, and grow the business, and so, Jim laid out very well for you how we are prioritizing that, and so, the first dollar goes to the capital investment, and we have our dividend which we very much committed to. We view that as an important part of our return to shareholders, and then, the excess free cash we have been using for share repurchases and that priority in terms of our spend is unchanged at this point. Thanks, you too. Thanks Bascome. I'm going to decline that opportunity. It's part of everything that we're doing to manage our cost structure and pulling all the levers across the board, and you've heard us talk about that before, and you saw it in the first quarter where we were able to make improvement in every one of our cost categories, and so, this is part of certainly the comp and benefits line, but we've got work going on across the board, and that's really the way that we look at it is in that context. Thanks, Bascome. Yes, I mean, when we went back and did some of that, that work that Lance referenced, I think by the time we got through the recession, kind of call it end of 2009, we would have said we were maybe 80% volume variable or so adjusted for fuel. We said we were more than 100% already here in first quarter of 2020. So again, we have already been taken and that's the blessing of what we embarked with PSR and unified plan 2020 is we have already made significant changes in our cost structure, and when you think about yard closures, increasing train length, all of those things and the locomotive productivity we're seeing, that's given us great, much greater volume variability. Obviously, in the short-term, those areas that are the most volume variable for us are going to be on the comp and benefits line, fuel is almost 100% volume variable for us. Equipment rents is also pretty, pretty volume variable, and then everything else is something that over time, we'll continue to work through, but that's where I again, I think we're just in a very good position or in a different position than we were in the last recession because of all the work that we had already undertaken and have in the pipeline because of our unified plan 2020 efforts. Well, thanks for the question, David. But we're not giving specific pricing guidance any longer. I think we made that statement a couple of quarters ago, so I'm not going to break that out for you, but I think consistent with my commentary, the less intermodal was certainly a part of that mix when you think that that is our lowest arc business that we have on the railroad, and that was offset somewhat by the fact that we also had sand lower, but net-net it was still a positive. Again, if you really look at that Industrial line, that's where we had some good growth in the quarter, and that's where we have some strong arc. Well, I think as I said, fuel was actually a tailwind for us in the quarter. And that's kind of an all-in view in terms of the price, the surcharge, all taken together in terms of how we view that. There is a little bit of a lag year-over-year as we move into the second quarter as fuel prices have come down so steeply. But we don't see that as being a significant driver relative to the -- how we look at things on a mix basis. Oh, the headwind to revenue? No. I mean it is a factor in the overall arcs. As you see less fuel surcharge that's going to be reflected in the arcs we have. But as I mentioned, it does lag a little bit in terms of how fuel price comes down and how our surcharge comes down. Sure. So we've used the 2.7 as just kind of a shorthand math for you all in terms of expressing where we view that within kind of the context of our credit rating. To your point, we did have dialogue with the credit agency around the time of our $750 million issuance. We share with them kind of our best thinking, some of our scenarios. And as I mentioned in my comments, they're comfortable with where we're at. Certainly if we had a need to go back into the markets we would have that dialogue again, but we feel very good where we're at. We believe we've got good access to credit if we need that. And we've obviously got some other things in terms of our revolver and the receivables facility if we need to, but those are, I would call, more of a belts-than-suspenders approach, but we feel good about it. I have no concerns there, and I believe the rating agency feel good with us as well."

            "name": "Kenny Rocker",
            "content": "Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the first quarter, our volume was down 7%, primarily due to declines in our Premium and Bulk business groups. The decrease in volume was partially offset by a 5% improvement in the average revenue per car, and drove freight revenue to be down 3% in the quarter. So, let's take a closer look at how the first quarter played out for each of our business groups. Starting with Bulk, revenue for the quarter was down 5% on a 7% decrease in volume, partially offset by a 2% improvement in average revenue per car. Coal and renewable carloads were down 19% as a result of softer market conditions from historically low natural gas prices and a mild winter. Looking ahead, we expect continued challenges in coal as natural gas futures remain low and customer stockpile stay at high level. Weather conditions will also continue to be a factor. Volume for grain and grain products was up 4% primarily driven by strong export ethanol volume. This was partially offset by reduced shipments of export wheat. Fertilizer and sulfur carloads were up 7% predominantly due to strong domestic fertilizer shipments. Finally, food and beverage was up 2% in unit as we saw strength in beer shipments become slightly offset by reduced refrigerated and dry food which were impacted by a challenging truck environment. Industrial revenue was up 3% with a 3% increase in volume and flat average revenue per car due to mix. Energy and specialized increased 10% primarily driven by strength in petroleum as favorable Canadian spread facilitated stronger crude oil shipment to the Gulf earlier in the quarter. However, with the reduction of oil prices in the past week, we expect crude oil shipment to be impacted in the near term. Forest products volume was flat. Reduced paper shipments were offset by increased lumber shipments due to strong housing start and a mild winter during the quarter. Industrial chemicals and plastic shipments grew by 4% due to the strength in domestic and export plastic shipments along with strong demand of detergents and chemicals. Metals and minerals volume decreased by 3%, reduced sand shipments from the impact of local sand and drilling decline were partially offset by continued strength in rock shipments in the South coupled with increased metal shipment. We expect to see continued challenges in sand with oil prices remaining at lower level. Turning to Premium, revenue for the quarter was down 6% on a 12% decrease in volume while average revenue per car improved by 6%. Automotive shipments were strong for the most of the first quarter until the pandemic shut down OEM in North America in the last few weeks of March, resulting in a 1% decline in volume year-over-year. Domestic intermodal volume declined 5%, driven by soft market demand and surplus truck capacity coupled with weakness related to the pandemic later in the quarter. International intermodal volume was down 24% during the quarter. Weakness early in the quarter was related to challenging comparisons with 2019 driven by accelerated shipments related to the tariff policy implementation. Further weakness was driven by pandemic-related supply chain disruption that began in China had slowly impacted much of Asia. Looking ahead, there remains quite a bit of uncertainty surrounding this global pandemic that we are facing. With the freefall in economic indicators over the past few weeks and uncertainty about when we will see the COVID pandemic curve starts to flatten out, an accurate assessment of 2020 is hard to pinpoint at this time. As you can see, our volume in the second quarter has started off slowing with the volume down 22% so far driven by auto production shutdowns and retail closure as U.S. demand is constrained by the pandemic-related social distancing and quarantine. Many of the auto manufacturing plants are scheduled to be shutdown until at least early May. Already our auto shipments have been down around 80% in the second quarter so far. Likewise, the recent projections in Mexico indicate that some manufacturing sectors like auto will be shut down for similar time periods as well. However, the CARES Act that was recently signed offers some upside to open the economy for business and improve unemployment for America plus it also encouraging to see that much of Asia is restarting production along with China's recent purchases of U.S. grains. More importantly, I like to make this point clear, we are not letting the uncertainty of the economy hold us back. We are staying focused on what we can control. The good news is that the lower cost structure combined with the improved service products that we've achieved with Unified Plan 2020 is a competitive advantage for us, customers are recognizing it, and awarding us new business. As Lance and Jim mentioned before, the railroad has never run better. I want to thank our employees as they are taking the necessary precautions to stay safe and healthy, so we can keep the operations running for our customers. We will continue to stay in close contact with our customers, and we are ready when the supply chains recover. As demand improves, we expect our strongest service products will place us in a great position to win incremental opportunity. With that, I'll turn it over to Jennifer who's going to talk about our financial performance. Yes, I'll walk you across pretty quickly here. The coal prices have just dropped here even over the last few months. There are some levels that we haven't seen in a while. I'm sure you see the same for curve forecast, and we'll see what happens there, but there is nothing that leads us to believe there is going to be large upside with coal, but we'll keep working with Jim's team to get the productivity that we can get out of it. The other part of the energy side of course is the oil prices, and you've seen what has happened there on the petroleum side with crude oil. We'll see what happens with those prices. Those prices also have an impact on our sand business in terms of drilling and then to a lesser degree the drilling pipe segments also. As you look at our plastics business, there is going to be an impact on our plastics business. I will tell you that there is more production that has come off, and there's more production that will come on. That is a positive for us. We're hearing that the -- or we know that the operating rates, where a number of our plastics producers has taken a step down, but that's still a very positive segment for us. I will say this, and I want to end it all with this, at the end of the day, our service product has been as good as it has been as we continue to see other pieces of carload business come up for us to bid on and compete for. I really like the position that the service product has put us in. Yes, so first of all, I believe you all see some of the information that we see publicly in terms of where the automotive OEMs are and they appear to be coming back sometime next month, call that the first-half of May. Clearly, there is going to be some ramp-up issues with that maybe they wouldn't start at 100%. We'll keep an eye on where that is as we look across our industrial customers. There are some customers that we're still seeing produce at a pretty strong clip. Rail network is still working pretty well. On the grain side, we're pretty optimistic there. We'll see what happens over the next few months. We do know that China has come in and purchase some grain during the back half of the year. We would expect that we should see some benefit from the Phase 1 deal, and then as you look at how as we're talking to our customers on the consumer side, I'll call those international intermodal and our domestic customers, I'll tell you, they still don't have that line of sight and what's going to happen. So we're not in a position, I'm not in a position even though we're talking to him every day to tell you what will happen there. Listen, we are spending capital and we have the sidings that I mentioned earlier on in place. We expect the train size to go up and have less train starts for the business that we have. So, that's productivity. We expect to be more productive with our local assignments and local operations. We expect to be more productive on our intermodal facilities and how we handle the traffic that we have. So as much as volume does make some of it harder, I'd love to have the whole time. Love to have a quarter with 2% or 3% volume growth hang on. I'd love to see where that number is, but it is not there because I'm not real worried about not having productivity this quarter. I want to just give you a view from my seat when our commercial teams go then and we talk to our customers, we're talking about -- after we go through our safety side, the second thing we talk about is the service product and Jim is exactly right. We've got a very strong service product to sell. We talked about the car velocity improving to make us more competitive with truck light services, as we entered into the year, what I would tell you is that on a carload basis, we felt really good about some of the wins in some key markets and we felt really good about opening up new markets that we hadn't touched. On our domestic intermodal side, we're about two-thirds along the way through our big season. We felt very good. I mean we felt very good about what we won in that area. So we need the market to help us there. Even in our international intermodal business towards the back half of the year, there have been some jump ball opportunities that we feel really good about that we've won that you should see so. Coming into the year, we felt really good about our opportunity to compete. The service product is something that we're going to use to make the pie larger to compete against truck, but we felt really confident wants the market comes back. I appreciate the thought. Hi, Jim. There's something we don't talk a lot about. There's two ways to look at our stored locomotives. There's locomotives that are stored and intended to be stored for a while. That is we don't anticipate their need in the next week to month, and then, Jim's got other locomotives that we store in a low -- in a status called at the ready, and at the ready, are literally ready to be pulled out and put back into service on a moment's notice, and so, that mix is changing every day, but the at the readies allow us to react to business upturn, which we hope we see, and we hope it's a strong week, that'd be great. Thanks, Ken. Yes, the only thing I'll mention is that again just to go back to the car velocity number and that's an average number, there is some mark areas where that car velocity number is much greater, and it has given us the ability to go out there and get the pricing that we believe we should be receiving or the service product that we're providing our customers. There is tremendous value that we're talking about when we talk to our customers and we're renewing business and going after new business and asking them to open up their truck lines for us. Well, Lance, I think you hit that perfect unless there's a follow-up on it. What's was not reflected in that number is that the transit times have gotten better. That's one thing, and I can tell you that our customers are acknowledging that the service on the carload side has gotten better."

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz. Thank you. Mr. Fritz, you may begin.\nLance Fritz: Thank you, Rob, and good morning. With me today in Omaha are Kenny Rocker, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Eric Gehringer, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Jennifer Hamann, our Chief Financial Officer. As we wrap-up 2021, I want to start with a thank you to the Union Pacific team. This past year has been anything but easy as we dealt with massive weather events, wildfires, supply chain congestion, and continued impacts from the pandemic. Through all of those challenges, our employees did the hard work necessary to deliver a record financial year. I am so grateful for our team's strength and their determination. They give me confidence that our best days truly lie ahead. Turning to our fourth quarter results, this morning Union Pacific is reporting 2021 fourth quarter net income of $1.7 billion or $2.66 per share. This compares to adjusted fourth quarter 2020 results of $1.6 billion or $2.36 per share. You'll note that 2020 reported results included an impairment charge related to our Brazos Yard investment. Our fourth quarter operating ratio of 57.4% deteriorated 180 basis points versus 2020's adjusted OR largely driven by the headwind from fuel prices. For the full year, we achieved a record 57.2% operating ratio, an improvement of 130 basis points versus 2020 adjusted results, and as Jennifer will lay out in a few minutes, we're on track to achieve a full year operating ratio that starts with a 55 in 2022. Even with the challenges of the past year, we set fourth quarter and full year records for operating income and net income. A comparison to 2019 further demonstrates the achievements of the team over the past two years. As you'll hear in greater detail from Eric, our fourth quarter safety and service performance did not meet expectations. I am pleased, however, that as we exit the year, our network is healing. Reflecting back, 2021 was a difficult year in many ways, but through our commitment to PSR and delivering for our customers, we navigated each obstacle and are now better for having dealt with them. During 2021, we took significant steps to advance our ESG efforts, capped off by the release of our initial Climate Action Plan in December. This plan lays out a framework to achieve our 2030 greenhouse gas emission reduction targets and includes a commitment to net zero by 2050, and we are the only U.S. railroad to do so. One element of our plan is to reduce overall fuel consumption, and we made continued progress last year. Our full year fuel consumption rate improved 1% for a new record low. This represents the third consecutive year we improved our fuel consumption rate on a year-over-year basis, and it helped our customers eliminate 22.9 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions by using rail versus truck. So, let's get started with Kenny for an update on the business environment.\nKenyatta Rocker: Thank you, Lance, and good morning. Fourth quarter volume was down 4% compared to a year ago. Gains in our Industrial and Bulk segments were more than offset by declines in our Premium business group from continued global supply chain disruptions. However, Freight revenue was up 10% driven by higher fuel surcharges, positive mix, and strong pricing gains. Let's take a closer look at each of these business groups. Starting with Bulk, revenue for the quarter was up 16% compared to 2020 driven by a 5% increase in volume and a 10% increase in average revenue per car, reflecting higher fuel surcharges, positive mix, and strong core pricing gains. Coal and renewable carloads grew 13% year-over-year. Our efforts to switch customers to index-based contracts are supporting domestic coal demand as a result of higher natural gas prices. The sequential decline was due in part to softer demand from milder weather in the fourth quarter. The harvest for grain and grain products drove the 15% sequential improvement. However, shipments were down 1% compared to 2020 due to reduced grain export shipments to the Gulf. Weaker grain shipments were partially offset by our business development efforts and strong demand for biofuels. Fertilizer carloads were up 9% year-over-year due to strong agricultural demand and increased export potash shipments. Moving on to Industrial, Industrial revenue was improved by 14% for the quarter driven by an 8% increase in volume. Average revenue per car also improved 6% primarily driven by higher fuel surcharges and core pricing gains. Energy and specialized shipments were flat compared to 2020. Higher demand for LPG and soda ash was offset by fewer project-related waste shipments and petroleum products. Volume for forest products grew 7% year-over-year primarily driven by demand for brown paper used in corrugated boxes and scrap paper. Industrial chemicals and plastic shipments were up 6% year-over-year due to strengthening demand and business plans. Metals and minerals volumes continue to be a bright spot. Volume was up 18% compared to 2020 primarily driven by our business development efforts along with strong steel demand. In addition, demand recovery for construction materials and favorable comps for frac sand contributed to strong year-over-year growth. Turning to Premium, revenue for the quarter was up 1% on a 14% decrease in volume versus 2020. Average revenue per car increased by 17% due to higher fuel surcharge, core pricing gains, and a positive mix of traffic. Automotive volume was down 10% in the quarter due to semiconductor-related part shortages and associated plant shutdowns. However, sequentially we saw a 10% increase versus the third quarter due to improved semiconductor availability. Intermodal volume was down 15% driven by continued international intermodal supply chain disruptions impacting the quarter as ocean carriers and BTO shifted more freight port to port. Sequentially, intermodal volume was down 10% versus the third quarter, as global supply chains remain challenged. Now, looking ahead to 2022, here are the economic indicators that correlate closely with our business. You see that Industrial production is currently forecasted to grow at 4.8% in 2022. We also recognize that we will face continued challenges in our energy-related markets, but despite those hurdles we continue to build upon our solid strategy to serve, grow, win, together. This strategy enables us to outperform the markets with our reliable service and continued focus on enhancing the customer experience. So as we begin 2022, I'm excited and bullish for the opportunities we have in front of us. For our Bulk commodities, we are optimistic about the growth in most of our markets due to favorable market conditions and business development wins. For fertilizer, we anticipate incremental growth with strong market demand and the long term deal with Canpotex where we have expanded terminal capacity to handle more volume with longer trains. Coal should see year-over-year growth based on the expectations of continued favorable natural gas prices. Additionally, plant retirements forecasted in 2022 will be offset by two new contract wins that started on January 1. For grain, we have tough comps versus 2021 as exports have been strong for the last couple of years. However, in grain products we are leading the market in biofuels development by securing opportunities on both sides of the house, the inbound feedstocks and the outbound finished biofuels. Moving to our Industrial markets, we continue to be encouraged by the strength of the forecast for industrial production. This will positively impact many of our markets like metal. Customer expansions and business development wins will drive growth in our Industrial chemicals and plastics commodity groups. However, as we move through the year, we expect lumber shipments to be adversely impacted by the current forecast for housing starts. And lastly, for Premium, we expect strong uplift for both our automotive and intermodal businesses. Automotive sales are forecasted to increase from 15 million units in 2021 to 15.4 million in 2022 due to the vehicle inventory re-stocking effort. Plus, wins to convert finished vehicles and auto parts shipments from over-the-road will further strengthen UP's automotive business. Domestic intermodal will benefit from retail inventory re-stocking, continued strength in retail sales, and tight truck supply. We're seeing slow improvement on our international volumes, but we also remain cognizant of the continued labor shortages that are impacting the global supply chain. Setting aside those forces outside of our control, we continue to create our own opportunities to grow. We are focused on expanding our reach into new markets in the industry. We're growing our footprint in the Twin Cities and Inland Empire Intermodal Terminal. This quarter we will also have a new product offering with our ag transload site at Global IV, and a nice swift business win that started this month positions us for robust growth in 2022. But just to be clear, we're not only investing on the intermodal side. We're making significant investment to support growth on the car load side, too. We've recently purchased two transload sites in strong economic growth areas like the Inland Empire and Phoenix. As we forge ahead with our aggressive commercial strategy, we're accelerating growth beyond this year. The future looks bright heading into 2023 as we just announced that UP will be the primary intermodal rail carrier in the West for Schneider. This new business will start up in January 2023. I'm proud of our commercial team. They are intensely focused on working with our customers to find creative solutions to win in the marketplace. We are anxious to build upon this momentum and grow with our customers. With that, I'll turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance.\nEric Gehringer: Thanks, Kenny, and good morning. 2021 proved to be a challenging year operationally as we saw a wide range of events impact the network from wildfires to supply chain congestion. The team leveraged their collective strength to find solutions to keep trains moving. We exited the year in a more fluid state recognizing additional improvement is still imperative. Taking a look at our key performance metrics for the quarter on slide 10, compared to fourth quarter 2020, our operating metrics deteriorated, although we improved most of our metrics sequentially from third quarter. Freight car velocity was impacted by reduced crew availability due to an increase in COVID infections and providing time off for vaccinations. Through reducing our re-crew rate, recalling remaining furloughed employees, streamlining processes to on-board crews, and increasing crew vaccination rates, our crew availability improved throughout the quarter. Our intermodal trip plan compliance of 78% is a decline from last year, however is a 12 point sequential improvement from third quarter results. This sequential improvement is evidence that our intermodal assets are balanced and we are poised for growth. Our manifest in auto trip plan compliance results of 58% represented a decline both year-over-year and sequentially. Crew availability had a greater impact on our manifest network. The December manifest and auto trip plan compliance results of 62% indicate we are trending in a positive direction, and we are building on these gains to start the year. Efforts during the quarter focused on the Southeastern portion of our network, and we successfully returned manifest operations to a fluid state. Our bulk operations, however, are not currently to a level that meets expectations. We are focused on driving improvement to this network as we did to the manifest network. Turning to slide 11, our efficiency metrics remain strong in the quarter, although some results were muted by the crew availability and lower volumes. Locomotive productivity declined 9% compared to fourth quarter 2020 due to higher locomotive resources to assist with recovery efforts in the southeastern portion of the network. Fourth quarter record workforce productivity improved 1% to 1,046 daily miles per FTE. Recognizing the importance of balancing strong crew utilization and planning for the future, we are focused on effectively managing crew levels. We're in the marketplace hiring, although we have been challenged in certain locations. Working with our partners and workforce resources to expand our reach, we are developing creative programs and campaigns like our Second Chance program to attract new employees to Union Pacific. Train length increased 2% from a year ago to over 9,300 feet enabled by the completion of 15 sightings during the year. Although our ability to grow train length in the fourth quarter was impeded by lower volumes in the intermodal business, we did deliver train length improvement in other business lines, including a 4% improvement in our manifest train length. Utilizing the strong foundation built with the adoption of PSR, the team is ready to handle the expected growth in this and future years. Turning to slide 12, with respect to our capital spending, PSR allows us to efficiently operate the railroad in a less capital-intensive manner. We continue to exercise discipline while still delivering value to our shareholders. Capital spending will remain in line with our long term guidance of less than 15% of revenue. For 2022, we are targeting capital spending of $3.3 billion pending final approval by our Board of Directors. The increase in capital spending is driven by targeted freight car acquisitions, investments in growth-related capital projects to drive more carloads to the network, and finally, slightly higher material and labor inflation cost. Approximately 80% of our planned capital spending will go towards replacement of our existing infrastructure. This spending will renew older assets, harden our infrastructure, and allow us to continue to operate safely. We are continuing to support intermodal volume growth starting with investments in certain ramps to efficiently handle volumes from new and existing intermodal customers including the Schneider business win that Kenny highlighted. We are also expanding the Twin Cities from a pop-up to a full-scale intermodal terminal and adding additional capacity to the Inland Empire pop-up intermodal terminal. Finally, we will wrap up the multiyear project to install wide span Gantry cranes at our G4 intermodal terminal in Chicago, bringing additional capacity to a key intermodal market. We will also continue modernizing our locomotive fleet by upgrading approximately 120 older assets. These modernizations not only improve the reliability of the asset, but each unit is a 5% more fuel efficient and emits approximately 53% less carbon emissions. Lastly, we will continue to invest in capacity projects that drive productivity and improve our network efficiency. We plan to complete approximately 20 sightings this year focused in the southern portion of our network to further support our train length initiative. Wrapping up on slide 13, entering 2022 we are enhancing our safety programs. We've engaged an external safety partner to focus on advanced risk identification and mitigation, coupled with enriched behavioral safety programs. Our goal is to be the first railroad to reach world-class safety performance, as there is nothing more important than making sure every employee returns home safely. With the robust market demand and strong volume outlook Kenny described, I have complete confidence that the operating team will be able to safely meet the growth needs of our customers. The operating team is focused on continuous performance improvement of the railroad to drive customer-centric growth while remaining judicious in our allocation of resources. While 2021 did not always bring optimal operating conditions, by working together and remaining agile, we entered each challenge and laid a foundation for continued success this year and beyond. With that, I will turn it over to Jennifer to review our financial performance.\nJennifer Hamann: Thanks, Eric, and good morning. Starting off with the income statement on slide 15; whereas Lance mentioned earlier we've adjusted 2020 results to exclude the Brazos impairment charge, throughout my remarks today I will be comparing 2021 to 2020 adjusted results. Operating revenue in the quarter totalled $5.7 billion, up 12% versus 2020 despite a 4% year-over-year volume decline. Operating expense increased 15% to $3.3 billion. I'll provide more detail in a moment, but excluding the impact of higher fuel prices, expenses were up 7% in the quarter. Together, we are reporting record fourth quarter operating income of $2.4 billion, a 7% increase versus 2020. Other income of $83 million is up 26% driven by a $36 million gain on the sale of a technology investment. Interest expense was up 6% as increased average debt levels were partially offset by a lower effective interest rate. Net income of $1.7 billion increased 8% which, when combined with our strong share repurchase program, led to a 13% increase in earnings per share to $2.66. Our 57.4% fourth quarter operating ratio increased 180 basis points, reflecting 100 basis point negative impact of higher fuel prices as well as reduced operational efficiency. As we did throughout 2021, we're also comparing our results to 2019. Against that fourth quarter comparison, we generated 16% higher operating income on 1% less volume, clearly demonstrating that ongoing price discipline and operational efficiency we've achieved over the past two years. Looking more closely at fourth quarter revenue, slide 16 provides a breakdown of our Freight revenue, which totals $5.3 billion in the fourth quarter, up 10% compared to 2020. Volume was down 400 basis points driven by the factors Kenny described earlier. Positive business mix coupled with a strong pricing actions that yielded dollars exceeding our inflation drove 725 basis points in total improvement. Lower intermodal volume combined with higher Industrial shipments drove the positive mix. Fuel surcharge revenue of $522 million increased Freight revenue 700 basis points as our fuel surcharge programs continued to chase rising fuel prices. Now let's move on to slide 17 which provides a summary of our fourth quarter operating expenses. As I just mentioned, the primary driver of the increase was fuel expense, up 80% as a result of a 74% increase in fuel prices. Our fuel consumption rate was flat compared to 2020 as a favorable business mix was offset by negative productivity. Looking further at the expense lines, compensation and benefits expense was up 5% versus 2020. Fourth quarter workforce levels increased 1% as flat management, engineering, and mechanical workforces were offset by 3% growth in our train and engine crews. This increase reflects our actions to recall furloughed employees as well as bring on new hires to manage utilization challenges and, importantly, in preparation for growth. Costs per employee increased 4% as a result of wage inflation, as well was higher recrew, overtime, and borrow-out costs partially offset by last year's $37 million employee COVID bonus. Purchase services and materials expense was up 9%, in part due to the comparison to favorable inner line settlements in 2020 as well as increased locomotive maintenance, crew van usage, and purchase transportation. Equipment and other rents was up 5% driven by lower TTX equity income. Other expense increased 29% in the quarter driven by higher personal injury expense associated primarily with two adverse outcomes as well as increased freight loss and damage and state and local taxes. As we look to 2022, overall workforce levels are expected to increase with volume although not one for one as we continued to drive productivity. Costs per employee in 2022 should increase in the low-single digits as productivity partially offsets inflation. Depreciation expense will be up around 2% versus 2021 while we expect the other expense line to be relatively flat year-over-year. Purchase services and materials expense is a bit more of a wild card but will be impacted by inflationary pressure as well as the expected recovery in auto volumes. Finally, we expect our annual effective tax rate to be around 24%. Looking now at our efficiency results on slide 18, we took a step back in the quarter and did not meet our original or revised productivity targets, finishing the year with $195 million of net productivity. Higher casualty expenses, increased costs associated with network operations, and reduced volume leverage cumulatively drove the productivity loss. For the full year, we achieved improvements in all areas, led by locomotive and workforce productivity initiatives. These gains were partially offset by roughly $55 million of weather and incident-related headwinds in 2021. While these results are clearly not what we expect of ourselves, we view the productivity as deferred, not lost. Similarly, fourth quarter incremental margins were muted at 27%. For the full year, our 77% incremental margins are more indicative of our capabilities, particularly given the positive business mix in 2021. The ability to efficiently add volume to our network is the foundation for delivering strong shareholder value going forward. Moving to slide 19, we'll review full year 2021 with earnings per share of $9.95, a 21% increase versus adjusted 2020 results. Revenue was up 12% on 4% volume growth, increased fuel surcharges, strong pricing gains, and a positive business mix. Record operating income increased 15% to $9.3 billion. Even with a 140 basis point headwind from rising fuel prices, our full year operating ratio of 57.2% improved 130 basis points versus adjusted 2020. Our improvement in 2021 marks the fifth consecutive year of operating ratio gains for Union Pacific, demonstrating our ability to drive efficiency even during a difficult year, and a further comparison of our results to 2019 shows that the hurdles of the past two years has not slowed our momentum. Turning now to cash and returns on slide 20, full year cash from operations increased approximately $500 million to $9 billion, a 6% increase from 2020. The first priority for our cash is our capital investment which finished 2021 just over $3 billion or roughly 14% of revenue. Our cash flow conversion rate was a strong 93%, and free cash flow after dividends increased $285 million or 9% compared to 2020. Our dividend payout ratio for 2021 was 43%, in line with our 45% target, as we rewarded shareholders with two 10% dividend increases during the year, distributing a total of $2.8 billion to shareholders. We also returned cash to our owners through strong share repurchases, buying back a total of 33 million common shares or 3% at an all-in cost of $7.3 billion, which includes $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter. In total, between dividends and share repurchases, we returned $10.1 billion to our owners in 2021, demonstrating our ongoing commitment to deliver significant shareholder value. Now, looking at the strength of our balance sheet on slide 21, we finished the year at an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.7 times, consistent with our resolve to maintain strong investment-grade credit ratings. At year-end, our Moody's rating was Baa1 and A minus from both S&P and Fitch. Our all-in adjusted debt balance on December 31 of $31 billion increased over $2 billion from year-end 2020 as we continue to utilize our strong balance sheet and earnings growth to reward shareholders. Finally, our return on invested capital came in at a record 16.4%, bouncing back more than 2 points from a challenging 2020 and increased 1.4 points from 2019. The reduced capital intensity associated with running a PSR operation is seen clearly in this performance and positions us for growth in the years ahead. So wrapping up with a look to 2022 on slide 22, let me start by pointing you back to our May Investor Day and the three-year targets we laid out. Those targets remain intact and are the building blocks of our view to 2022. With volumes we stated, we would outpace Industrial production through our business development efforts which are going strong, as Kenny mentioned. The current forecast for 2022 Industrial production is 4.8%. To outperform that forecast, we have new business wins like Knight-Swift as well as anticipated recovery of autos and international. We also expect to have the added benefit of coal volume growth. As you'll recall, we originally anticipated coal to be a half-point headwind over the next three years, but with current natural gas prices and recent business wins, that business should actually provide a tailwind in 2022. Looking at the cadence of volumes through the year, the first half should be led by Bulk and Industrial. In the second half, we'd look for stronger year-over-year gains and for it to be more Premium-driven as supply chains and chip shortages improve. For first quarter volumes specifically, we're anticipating carloads will track below full year 2022 growth expectations as we experience a muted post-holiday rebound likely impacted by rising COVID infection rates plus continued soft international intermodal volumes. With a strong overall demand environment and our disciplined pricing approach, we expect to yield pricing dollars in excess of inflation dollars. Embedded in that guidance is our expectation that all-in inflation for the year will be elevated a little north of 3%. At our Investor Day, we targeted incremental margins in the mid to upper-60% range. For 2022, we would expect to be at the low end of that range given the significant mix shift to intermodal growth. The combination of growing volumes, pricing above inflation, and strong incremental margins should lead to the achievement of our long term goal of a 55% operating ratio. Putting a little finer point to it, we would expect to achieve around a 55.5% operating ratio for full year 2022. Turning to cash and capital, you heard our plan to invest around $3.3 billion of capital for the year, well within our long term guidance of less than 15% of revenue. Strong top line growth, increasing profitability, and ongoing capital discipline should result in a cash conversion rate near 100%. This strong cash generation allows us to continue rewarding our owners with an industry-leading dividend payout and strong share repurchases which we expect will be in line with 2021 levels. Before I turn it back to Lance to wrap up, I'd like to express my appreciation to the Union Pacific team. What they achieved over the past year is truly remarkable. Union Pacific success begins and ends with our people. So with that, I'll turn it back to Lance.\nLance Fritz: Thank you, Jennifer. Wrapping up on slide 24 with a look at our drivers for success in 2022, as you heard from Eric, it's imperative that we make progress on safety. While there are positive signs in the underlying metrics, the overall results need to improve. Safety is at the center of everything we do at Union Pacific as we strive toward our goal of world-class performance. Overall, the network's improving but with work to be done. We have work streams aimed at keeping a healthy pipeline of crews in place, and we're in the marketplace hiring for growth. In addition, we have numerous initiatives to improve the quality of our service. Our long term growth opportunities are dependent on a reliable service product. As you heard from Kenny, our growth outlook for 2022 is terrific. The growth mentality we're instilling on the entire team is manifesting itself in new customer wins while we continue to build stronger books with our long term partners. We have an opportunity to offer enhanced customer experience and new transportation solutions for our customers while helping them achieve their sustainability goals. 2021 represented another milestone in our company's history, and 2022's poised to be even better. We'll be celebrating our 160th anniversary with what we expect to be our best financial year ever and take further steps on ESG journey. We have great momentum as we strive for operational excellence, grow with our customers, and as we win together with all of our stakeholders. So with that, let's open up the line for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup\nChris Wetherbee: Hey. Thanks, and good morning, guys. Maybe we can start on the volume outlook and I think the expectation to grow above industry all production. I guess, Jennifer, you talked a little bit about the cadence maybe being a little bit softer in the first half and accelerating into the second half. I guess maybe a couple questions here. First, first quarter, do you think you can end up having volumes up in the quarter? And then in terms of some of the business wins and the other opportunities out there, do you think that there is enough to be able to see that acceleration? I think over the last couple of quarters we've been a little bit disappointed in general across the rail industry of the ability to grow volume at a more accelerated pace. Just want to get a little more color on sort of how you think about the building blocks to get to that 4.8 or better for the full year.\nJennifer Hamann: Yeah. I'll start and then turn it over to Kenny, but you're thinking of it right, Chris. And we do expect our volumes to grow in the first quarter. But again, we see it kind of -- and you laid it out, first half, second half. First half is going to be led by Bulk and Industrial. We certainly embedded in the expectation for stronger growth in the second half is the recovery in the supply chains, and that includes the chip shortages. So that is our expectation for the year, and we feel very bullish about that. And I'll let Kenny talk to you about that a little bit more.\nKenyatta Rocker: Yeah, Chris. We're seeing -- and this is pretty slow here. We're seeing slow marginal growth from where we were in the fourth quarter to now on our international intermodal volumes. So we're looking at that every day. I'll tell you that. Same is true about the automotive business. And I talked about the fact that sequentially from third to fourth quarter, we saw that 10% improvement. We're expecting that to increase, and that's what you're seeing in the back half of the year. We also feel good about a couple business wins on the coal side that'll help us from a car load perspective.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Seidl: Yes. Hey. Thanks, guys. Appreciate the time, wanted to focus a little bit on the outlook and the supply chain congestion. What happens if the congestion doesn't recover as quickly as possible? Where should we see some of the impacts? And sort of what markers are you looking for on the supply chain as you go to adjust the outlook potentially and move throughout the year?\nLance Fritz: Yeah, Jason. This is Lance. We've built the 2022 plan not on perfection. So we've kind of built into the plan an expectation that, for instance, in the international intermodal supply chain, there's slow but steady recovery. Some of the mark Justin Long with Stephens ers that we're looking at that need to recover to be back to normal and fluid still involve street time for things like chassis and boxes. Our intermodal ramps are fluid right now. They're in great shape. We need to see our international intermodal customers go back to more IPI business. That is allowing the international box to go inland and then turn back around preferably with an export. I'll turn it over to Kenny and Eric for a little more detail.\nKenyatta Rocker: Yeah, Lance. You hit it right on the head. We're talking to our customers daily about that conversion from port to port. The inland ramps that we have, we have seen that, that is slowly occurring. Now, remember, we've got a backlog of ships out there on the water, so that's got to get sorted out. The same thing we're going to be keeping an eye on is at a lot of these inland ramps how the warehouses are doing and are they able to process a lot of that business that's coming on. So it's going to be a slow, gradual increase to us, but we're talking to our customers. And we expect more improvement as we go throughout the year.\nEric Gehringer: Just reflect on this year and what happened with Premium volumes in the second half of the year. They were softer, and so we're certainly looking for that to be stronger in the back half of 2022.\nJason Seidl: I've got my fingers crossed for you guys. My follow-up is going to be on pricing. You mentioned, Jennifer, I think you're going to be above inflation, which you're putting around 3%. Talk to me a little bit about the contracts that you're repricing now. And sort of how well above your cost inflation are the new contracts versus your base business?\nKenyatta Rocker: Yeah. I'll take that, Jennifer. We've got a favorable pricing environment. I'm going to talk about, call it, our domestic intermodal business. We're about 10%, 15% in on a lot of the bids that we're looking at. And again, it's a favorable pricing environment. We'll have to see how that plays out in the second half of the year. Right now it looks good, but we're going to be looking at it quarter by quarter. But great environment to be repricing.\nJennifer Hamann: Clarification there, Kenny. When you said we're 10% or 15% in, you're talking about the total number of bids?\nKenyatta Rocker: Total number of bids that we're looking at.\nJennifer Hamann: Then just to clarify -- and, Jason, I know you know this -- but when we talk about pricing above inflation, it's in dollars. So we expect to yield pricing dollars in excess of our inflation dollars.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Kenny, wanted to ask about some of these new business wins in intermodal, which is obviously a credit to you and the whole team. I know this has been a focus for you guys for a while now. These new IMCs that are coming online obviously have assets behind them, and I'm just trying to understand if that represents a mix-up opportunity for the company within intermodal. And obviously you participate in pools, and as a result I think you guys have a higher degree of asset-like channel partners than your direct competitor. So if you could just talk about the mix within intermodal as this new business comes online over the next couple-years this year and next year?\nKenyatta Rocker: Yeah. First of all, before I get to the new players, we feel really good about our long term partner, and we look at them as an industry leader. Clearly, we're bringing on Knight-Swift this year. They are a strong industry leader. And then in the future, we'll bring on Schneider. We look at that as a great value to the BCO. We believe that that's going to give us and them a lot of optionality to grow. Clearly, that's the impetus there to offer more options. It's going to also give Eric an opportunity to densify a lot of networks and execute on a lot of intermodal excellence initiatives that he has. As we look at our own IMCs that we have out there and our own equipment, you know that we're doubling down on investing there. So we invested in almost 6,000 chassis. We're bringing on GPS. So we feel like we've got a great mixture to offer those private asset players that are on our network and also the ones that will be utilizing our equipment.\nAmit Mehrotra: Okay. And then just for my follow-up, Jennifer, you haven't got a incremental margin or OR question yet, so I know you're waiting for that. I wanted to circle back on the 55.5% OR guidance for this year. I'm just trying to understand the puts and takes there. Because on one hand you've got a great pricing opportunity ahead of you. It's showing up in the yield, and I would assume moreso over the course of 2022. But you also have some of these large new business wins on the intermodal side which has less revenue intensity attached to it. So I am just trying to understand if you could talk about some of the puts and takes that underlie the margin guidance for 2022 in which you kind of characterized it as conservative given the pricing opportunity. Or is it kind of well balanced between pricing and mix as you see the year playing out?\nJennifer Hamann: Yeah, Amit. Thanks for that. And I knew I could count on you for the margin question. But we feel very bullish about our opportunities in 2022 and feel very good about being able to hit that long-established operating ratio target of the 55%. And 55.5% obviously is right smack dab in the middle of that fairway. There will be cost pressures. We know that. Higher inflationary environment. We know that we need to bring on some more employees, and so you're going to see our headcount go up a little bit. Not at a one-for-one with volume, but we will be bringing on new employees. So there's hiring and training costs and then just running the network more fluidly which we're off to a great start here as we come into 2022. So feel good about it. I'm not going to give a characterization one way or the other, but we're very excited about the long term potential, and 2022 is just going to be another building block on that progression as we become more and more profitable and provide a better service product to more and more customers.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Hoexter: Hey. Great. Good morning. Great job on the quarter. Kenny, you noted some significant wins here, two coal plant wins. You won Knight and Schneider's business. Do we normally see a tipping point of Burlington Northern chasing to win back business when it gets out of flack? I think back to the middle of the 2000s when there were coal contracts that they would always go back and forth. So I just want to understand what kind of competitive marks that you have when you have consistent sizable wins that we should expect.\nKenyatta Rocker: Yeah. Thanks for that, Ken. Good to hear from you. So pointing back to May, that Investor Day, we set out our targets, and we want to execute on those targets first of all. At the end of the day, truck is our true competition, and so we're exhausting all efforts to go out and win against truck. Now we've talked quite a bit about that intermodal piece. We're doing the same thing on the car load side. There's still a lot of opportunity there. So we view the competition as truck, and we're going to be pretty dogged. The team is all over this about trying to convert as much truck business as we can.\nLance Fritz: Yeah, Kenny. What I'm really excited about 2022 and beyond isn't the one-time conversion of business from somebody else to us. It's the fact that those businesses are very well run, and our existing long term partner is exceptionally well run in Hub, and they're growth engines in and of themselves for years to come. That's what really turns me on.\nKen Hoexter: So just a quick follow-up. Kenny, you mentioned you're seeing some slowing domestic movement. I just want to understand if you can clarify what you were talking about within that. And then, Lance, any thoughts? I mean, obviously a lot of press on security on the yard. Is this something that's just more press? Is it something you're getting increasingly concerned about, given your boxes are sitting on storage?\nKenyatta Rocker: Yeah. Let me start on the security side, and then Kenny will turn it back over to you. So, there's been a lot of coverage about some thefts that are occurring in the LA basin specifically. That is a -- I'll call that a relatively unique situation where something that used to be a nuisance, call it, two years ago, members in a neighborhood would see a train not moving and might take advantage of trying to pop open a box and see what's inside. Today that's more organized, and we have our arms around it. We've increased our own police presence. We're working with the LAPD in that area. We're working with the State, whose also getting involved. We're actively working to get the district attorney in the area spooled up and interested prosecuting the cases. So I think at this point we've got our arms around it. We've cleaned up the area, and we're going to be enhancing security in the area, to your point. We're going to put physical security barriers in place. It's unfortunate because they won't be necessarily pretty, but it will protect our property. And more importantly, it'll protect our employees. That's probably the biggest concern I've had throughout this whole time frame. We hate impacting our customers. We really can't stomach putting our employees at risk.\nLance Fritz: Yeah. On the international intermodal side again, we're seeing a slow uptick as those units come on to our network. On the domestic intermodal side, we typically see a little bit of a, I'll call it, lull, pause after the Christmas break. We saw it last year, and it happened a little bit later because of the parcel. Nothing that's concerning us. You heard in my comments around the business that we're competing for early on and the price environment there. So fundamentally, we still feel optimistic about domestic intermodal.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just one more on the inter-modal for you, Kenny. We talked about this port-to-port for a little while now. What's the driver behind that? And I guess what gets that unstuck and back to your network? Is that why you feel you need to add a little bit more transload? It just seems like the economics are pretty good for the liners to make the quick turns, and that might be a headwind here on your international intermodal for a little while. I guess just to get my other follow-up maybe for Eric, can you just talk about what's left to improve on the network? You mentioned some of the challenges in the Southeast and a little bit of improvements, but still Bulk needs to get back on track. What are the few factors you're looking to put in place there? And how far are you along in permitting those right now?\nLance Fritz: Kenny, that first question was about port-to-port.\nKenyatta Rocker: Yeah. I talked about it a little bit. We are seeing more customers each week that are turning on more business to go inland to the ramp. That's going to take a while. I talked about the fact that we've got a lot of shift still out on the water. It's encouraging to see that both they're talking about doing it, but we're also seeing it show up in our carloads. We're looking at that on a week-to-week basis. Eric's ramps are clean. We've got the equipment. We've got the capacity. We're prepared for it. So we want our customers to bring it on.\nLance Fritz: You got good match-back programs, too. That takes some of the expense of moving an empty container back West and turning it into a revenue stream.\nEric Gehringer: We're excited about the ag program that we have at Global IV coming on, and we've seen uplift from Dallas, Dallas to dock. So a number of products that are out there that are going to be of value to those international customers.\nKenyatta Rocker: Then, Brian, on your question around career availability, you mentioned the Southeastern portion of the railroad. That's exactly right. When we walked into the quarter, that was one of the challenges that lied ahead of us was to be able to recover the manifest network in the southeast portion. From my comments, we've done that. We've brought back the fluidity that we expect, which reduces the stress in our crew base. Now as I think about it as a whole system though and you think about crew availability, really got three components to that. The first one is COVID, and as we think about COVID, it's not just people who unfortunately are at home because they are either positive or they have been quarantined but also people who have to be vaccinated. And if you think about the fourth quarter relative to earlier in the year, the fourth quarter was significantly more impactful to us in that way than earlier in the year. The next part is the utilization of our crew base, and as I look back over the third quarter and coming into the fourth quarter, completing the fourth quarter, we've reduced our re-crew rate by one-third. And that's incredibly important because that provides us flexibility in our crew base to continue to meet growth demands. Then finally as I talked a little bit about, the other part of crew availability is ensuring that we're out in the marketplace hiring for attrition and for growth. And as you heard Jennifer mention, we're not hiring one-for-one. We're hiring for that growth. It's a challenging market in certain geographic locations, but what we have is a workforce resource department that has certainly stretched themselves into all sorts of different campaigns and initiatives to help us continue to hire to our demand. And I'm very encouraged for it.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of John Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Chappell: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Eric, sticking with you, it sounds like a lot of the issues with the KPIs and the productivity are somewhat anomalous. These labor availability things are hopefully very temporary and more related to short term sickness and structural and hopes that the supply chain eases as well. When we spoke in October, you were very optimistic that the deferred productivity gains from 2021 would fall into 2022 in addition to what you'd already had planned for 2022. As you think about it now, given a still kind of challenging port, are you confident you can get all of the deferrals into 2022? And is that early 2022 or late 2022? Or does some of the plan for 2022 slip into 2023 as well?\nEric Gehringer: John, thanks for that question. It's an excellent question, and I want to be really clear. I believe all of it is just deferred. I believe we've set ourselves up coming out of 2021 and the beginning of 2022 to be able to capitalize on exactly what we said. And to your point, some of those events that impact us were transitory. Some of them, like COVID, we may still see that impact. Here is a team that's committed to being able to capture that deferred, and that's exactly what we're poised to do in 2022.\nJohn Chappell: Does it slip at all, maybe first half versus second half, what you thought in October, because of the Omicron variant that's made things a little bit more choppy?\nEric Gehringer: I think if my crystal ball was that clear I'd tell you that, but probably like you, John, we have to go through and plan for those contingencies. If the impact comes down, we've got to make sure we're ready to capitalize on the potential from our productivity. If the impact of COVID goes up, you'll see us flex to that as best as we possibly can. Our goal is first to ensure that our employees are safe, and they are taking the time off if they are positive, followed by making sure when they are here, collectively we're being as productive as we possibly can while we're also being excessively safe.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Group: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Kenny, when I take the contract wins with Knight and Coal, and I don't know if Canpotex is new or not, how much volume from those contracts is there? Is that a point of volume? Two points of volume? Any color there? And then, Jennifer, any just any thoughts on mix for the year? I'm guessing based on your volume comments positive first half but negative second half, but would you think full year mix is positive-negative based on the volume outlook?\nKenyatta Rocker: Yeah. Hey. Good morning, Scott. Thanks for the question. Unfortunately, I'm not going to size the volume for you. I can tell you that we're excited about it, and Eric is prepared to handle that business. And we think that there is long term strategic value in having Hub and Knight-Swift on our line this year. And then eventually long term we'll be able to provide our BCO with a lot of options. And it gives us the opportunity to really build up our network and go after that truck business. So we're pretty excited about it.\nJennifer Hamann: Bottom line, it fundamentally supports the guidance we gave at the Investor Day in May which is something like 3% growth for averaging for the next three years, above industry all production. So you're well positioned to be able to deliver that.\nKenyatta Rocker: And now that number is like 4.8%.\nJennifer Hamann: We knew that, again, continuing to come out of the pandemic, you were going to have stronger Industrial production in the earlier part of that three-year range. So the business wins and just Kenny's team going out and hustling is what gives us that upside to Industrial production. To your mix question, Scott, I do believe based on our expectations, particularly with the Premium business being stronger in the second half that we will have on a full year basis a mix headwind. But I think you're looking at it correctly when I look at the drivers for growth in the first half being more Industrial and Bulk-loaded. It should look a little different in the first half than the full year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So there's been some renewed commentary at the federal level about whether fairly or not kind of pointing the finger a little bit at the rails and shipping companies for kind of the lack of competition there kind of being drivers of the congestion and inflation and everything else. Kind of irrespective of whether that's true or not, can you just share what are your conversations with the STB like nowadays? Do you see any progress towards switching possible? Or where do you think the outcome of that perception might be? And just a follow-up. Jennifer, thanks for the detail on the driver of 2022 volume growth between end-markets. I'm not sure you mentioned domestic intermodal as one of the drivers of the upside to Industrial production growth. So just to tie up all of the intermodal commentary on the call so far, do you expect domestic intermodal to see a snap-back? And if when congestion eases and the truck market continues to get tighter? Thank you.\nJennifer Hamann: I'll do the clean-up first. Then you can talk on the regulatory side, Lance. I did reference the Knight-Swift business. When that's domestic intermodal, that's part of what's driving the plus for us relative to Industrial production. And then just when you look at again some of the supply chain issues which impacted both international and domestic being intermodal, as we see those resolving themselves more in the back half of the year, we would look to see strong performance there.\nLance Fritz: Yeah. And, Ravi, in regards to our conversation with the STB, notwithstanding whatever perception is held at a federal level regarding our participation in the current supply chain congestion, factually, we are open and ready for business. We talked openly on this call about some of the operating challenges we faced in the fourth quarter. Exiting the year, we're on better footing, and you will see that better footing demonstrated in our public numbers. You've already seen some of that at the very beginning of the year, and that continues to improve. In terms of the regulatory environment, we are actively engaged with the STB. The workload from our perspective is probably in this order. There's the CP KCS transaction that we need to be engaged in. We've got a fundamental concern there to make sure that our customers continue to enjoy direct unfettered access to the commercial markets in Mexico, and the Industrial base in Mexico enjoys the access that we provide to the United States market. We enjoy about two-thirds to 70% of that cross-border traffic today, and in the context of this transaction, we want to make sure our customers continue to have that competitive option available to them. Probably the second biggest item on our horizon at the STB is forced access or open access. There's a hearing on that coming up in March. We continue to work with the STB to help them understand our perspective of the dynamics of the rail industry and how to look at that possible regulation from a perspective that allows us to continue to serve our customers exceptionally well and continue to invest in our railroad so that, that service lasts for years to come. Then, finally, there's been work on final offer rate review at the STB. We've offered up with peer railroads an alternative to that and alternative dispute resolution mechanism. It looks like it's a nice simplification for small rate cases, small shipper rate cases, and it satisfies some of what we consider the big legal hair on the STBs proposal to have somebody else take on the role of rate mediation. Other than that, our job at the STB is to provide an excellent, reliable service product and stay engaged so that they understand the industry from our perspective. We do those two things, I think we can navigate the docket that's in front of us in the coming year.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nTom Wadewitz: Yeah. Good morning. I'll give you both the questions upfront. I guess, one, you've got a question earlier on kind of the momentum in contract wins, which is great to see you executing on your strategy that you laid out at the Analyst meeting, so kudos on that. I wonder if you can offer some kind of high-level thoughts on price versus volume. Presumably some of these bigger contract wins, price is a consideration. So how do you think about the kind of price versus volume focus maybe this year, next year? And is it a bit less on price and more on volume? Or just how do you think about that? Then the second question would be you're anticipating ramp in volume. You're ready to go at the terminals. But in July 2021, you had this issue where there just wasn't enough drainage capacity so you had a build-up of containers. Do you have visibility to drayage capacity or control over that, such that you wouldn't run into that issue again in 2022? Thank you.\nLance Fritz: Kenny, you're probably good to handle maybe even both of those.\nKenyatta Rocker : Yeah. We're certainly pricing to the market, and that's an exchange in our overall approach to the market. We're selling a very strong, reliable service product. We're also backing that up with a lot of the capital that Eric and his team will be putting in to create a value proposition. So that's our approach to the market. That's how we're going to win. That's how we're going to grow. That's how we talk to our BCOs and all the customers on our network. To the second question about drayage capacity, yeah. We certainly see offline time. We see how much time the chassis are off, how much time the containers are gone. It's still not a very efficient network. It needs to come down, and as it comes down, it's going to create more volume growth, more efficiency for us. It'll be overall positive. So we're looking at that on a daily basis.\nTom Wadewitz: Yeah. Eric, that looks better, but there's clearly still some work to be done there, right?\nEric Gehringer: There still is work to be done there. And as we talked nearly a year ago Investor Day about intermodal being such an important growth engine for us, we also at the same time rolled out intermodal excellence. And if you look at many of those initiatives, they are focused on assisting our customers, on helping with the ability to be able to get quicker turns. So as I think about the work we're doing at nearly every intermodal ramp around our gate system and reducing the amount of time to get in and get out, that's helping them in that generating capacity. The work we've done on changing our UPGo app, whether it's for our existing customers or our new customers, we're making sure we continue to do our part to assist our customers to be able to generate that capacity. Now, to Lance's point, there's opportunity on the other side, but together I think we'll work our way through it.\nLance Fritz: The only thing I'd add is that the congestion issues that you're referencing in particular, Tom, were really around the international intermodal side, and a lack of international chassis and dray drivers and some of our recent wins have been with on the domestic side with asset owners who come with their own chassis and driver fleets.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.\nBascome Majors: Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions here. Just one clarification. And you've been reporting RTMs weekly for some time now. Are your volume comments focused on RTMs or car load intermodal units? And on the volume outlook, a little more strategically, can you talk about any particular places where the gap between your bottoms-up conversations with your customers and sort of the tops-down anchoring that you gave today seem to either diverge in magnitude or maybe conviction? Thank you.\nLance Fritz: So I'll start with that, Bascome. When we talk about volume and give you the volume guidance, we're talking about it on a carload basis. So that's consistent with how we had talked about it at the Analyst Day. And so we're talking carloads. Kenny, you want to talk about...\nKenyatta Rocker: Let me chime in on the second question, the bottoms-up versus tops-down. Kenny, you have unique relationships with the commercial side and the buying side of a lot of our customers. At the CEO level, I'll tell you what my counterparts tend to be focused on is consumers are flush. Balance sheets for consumers are good, and they're financially healthy. So as long as their confidence isn't rattled, they seem to be postured to continue to purchase through the year. And the industrial economy, a lot of my industrial peers feel pretty confident that their marketplaces look pretty good to them, whether you're in the housing market, you're in the construction market, you're in some other aspect of our industrial economy. So at the very highest level, Kenny, that's what I hear.\nEric Gehringer: Lance, you're spot on. And the only thing I would add is that we're not waiting around to think strategically about these growth areas from a geo perspective. And that's what you're seeing now with all the work that we're doing with Eric's team in terms of Inland Empire and the growth there and investments there, the Twin Cities, the growth there and investments there. You're going to see a little bit more volume in those areas than you did last year. That's intermodal. Also on the carload side we're also thinking very strategically about areas that you can call it high-growth population, you can call it high warehousing. When we see areas that are under-penetrated from a rail perspective, we're going to be opportunistic and really invest towards those areas. And that's what you're seeing with the train load facilities and the Inland Empire.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.\nJustin Long: Thanks, and good morning. I was wondering if you could share how much of a tailwind you're assuming from coal within the full year volume guidance and then also wanted to ask about labor availability. On a sequential basis, is it getting any better? Is it getting worse? And maybe you could just speak to your confidence in growing headcount to support that 5%-plus volume growth outlook.\nLance Fritz: Yeah. Thanks, Justin, for the question. We're not going to get into that level of granularity, but we did think it was important to acknowledge that coal is changing the posture from what we thought it was when we talked to you back in May from a tailwind to a headwind. And we're going to leverage that absolutely as long as we can, and the new business wins certainly help with that. You want to talk about the crew availability?\nEric Gehringer: Yeah. Building off the previous conversation, we're in the market. It's certainly in some points, some locations just is a challenging market. As I think about looking throughout the year, some of the different activities we've taken on are meant to really differentiate us from other companies that are in the market as well. I think about not only employee referral programs that get the word out more in our social media campaigns. But I also think about the efforts we've taken in the last year where we're now talking to perspective employees that the day they come to the railroad is also the first day they can start college with us, that we offer that free of charge to them. So we're in the market. We're going to continue to put out what we feel is a very strong value proposition to join Union Pacific.\nLance Fritz: And, Eric, you mentioned some self-help on crew availability, your strong move on reducing the re-crew rate by one-third or more. That in essence frees up some amount of our crew boards, and you're just generally more productive now with unproductive crew starts like held away from home terminal. And we also saw in the fourth quarter, starting to see the benefits of a high vaccination rate across the company and being able to have people be healthy.\nEric Gehringer: We should talk about that, Justin. It's pretty much invisible to the outside world, but over three quarters of our workforce is fully vaccinated. And that's because we started early on complying with the federal vaccine mandate. Now, we paused because of the pause mandated by a court, but we think that our employee population, because of that high vaccination rate, lasted through Omicron a little better than the communities that we serve. We saw a spike in the number of our employees who had to quarantine, presumed positive or exposed, but it was nothing like the spike that we saw in the communities that we serve.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJordan Alliger: Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Just a question just thinking about the trip plan compliance around the manifest business, which obviously has been under pressure. Although, as you say, things perhaps moving forward on that front. But just from a sensitivity standpoint, how critical is something like that metric to getting closer to a normal level to producing the operating ratio that you guys are targeting? I'm just trying to get a sense for how important is that for us to watch moving up in the thinking of relation to your targets for margin? Thanks.\nJennifer Hamann: Yeah. I'll maybe start, and others may want to weigh in. But when we look at the key metrics that are driving the cost profile, which relates to certainly the operating ratio, I'd look more at freight car velocity and the terminal dwell numbers in terms of how efficiently we're handling the freight on the railroad. And that also has an impact on the number of turns that we're getting on the cars that we can put up against the customers to get that next revenue load. So I see trip plan compliance and intermodal trip plan compliance more as the outcome of these other things that we're doing in terms of moving the car and operating the network more fluidly being more directly impactful to the OR.\nLance Fritz: Yeah. Jennifer, those trip plan compliance numbers are really about, can we serve customers in a manner that's consistent with our commitment? So that's about over the period of time that needs to be reliable so that we can continue to secure business and have happy customers. But in terms of hitting a high margin or a margin target, that's about car velocity, terminal dwell, locomotive productivity, and workforce productivity. And train life I'd throw in there as well.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nWalter Spracklin: Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. So I just wanted to go back to the business wins, and certainly that's a positive and I think will certainly be viewed as such. But just wanted to ask the question. We did see a railroad, one of your northern peers, a number of years ago growing quite substantially, winning share, but when faced with some capacity constraints it kind of led to a significant gridlock that kind of prevailed for a couple years. So given the capacity constraints that we have right now, you're taking on new business, what comfort level do you have that you're not going to run into some of those issues over the next couple of years, even as global supply chain problems ease hopefully in the coming months and quarters?\nLance Fritz: Walter, we are highly confident we have a plan in place and an existing network to be able to absorb the growth that we've been talking about this morning and not be gridlocked. Couple of cases in point. One, we've just onboarded Knight-Swift over the course of the last five weeks, four weeks, six weeks, and it's been flawless. That was on the strength of a lot of coordination and planning between ourselves and that customer in order to make sure their drivers were well prepared, that our ramps were efficient for their drivers, that we had good signage and our UPGo app to make it virtually seamless to get on and off. S I know we're going to be able to plan and execute in the same way for future onboarding.  The other thing to note is we've upticked our capital. There are some areas we need to invest in. There's that $600 million or so of commercial facilities and capacity. Historically, a lot of that spend would be targeted on productivity enhancement. As we look into this year, a fair amount of that spend is being targeted towards enabling growth. So we've got a game plan and the capital to be able to do it. We're well in advance of needing to put the capital in the ground, and so it's happening.\nKenyatta Rocker: And that's where some of those investments that Lance referenced that were proud investments initially when you think about extensions become investments that support the growth of the network, and that's capacity that's not being utilized in that manner to date. And then think about our locomotives, which we still have a significant portion of our locomotive fleet that is stored today. So that's capacity that we have to bring to bear, and will be.\nWalter Spracklin: That's great. That's excellent color. I appreciate that. And then my follow-up is more on a technology question. I'm sure you've seen that parallel systems initiative for autonomous electric vehicles that would maximize the use of existing rail networks. Your competitor weighed in on it. Just curious, is that something we should even keep an eye on? Is it a real initiative? And do you see it as possibly have it moving the needle for Union Pacific, if it were applied going forward? Or are there challenges associated with its implementation that are likely not going to bring it to bear?\nKenyatta Rocker: Walter, we are interested the parallel systems technology. We are familiar with it, and it is of interest. It's of keen interest. Candidly, there's a lot of hurdles in front of that technology for deployment. Having said that, it could potentially be a game changer if it proves out to be effective and workable. So I'd say keep your eye on it, and we're keeping our eye on it. And I don't think it's going to impact 2022 or 2023 or 2024, but at some point it could be a technology that has utility for the U.S. rail network.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Ben Nolan with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions.\nBen Nolan: Thank. Appreciate you guys working me in. So my first question I guess relates to just thinking about the Schneider win that you guys had. When you're out pitching for new business like that, just curious how you are positioning the value proposition for you guys. Is it more about the economics, or is it service-oriented? Or sort of how do you pitch the competitive advantage that you're providing to your customers?\nLance Fritz: Kenny, you're the one.\nKenyatta Rocker: Yeah. Again, I'm really proud of the team. We've got a strong leadership team and the premium laid in that, but you know what we're doing is we're working as a team. And the first thing we do is we talk about our service products. We talk about where our network is and the capacity. Clearly, we had to put up some capital against that and some investments against that to help those carriers, those customers get into and get out of our ramps. We're very fluid. We're selling all those things. There's no part of it where we're changing our pricing strategy or approach to the market. We'll let the players really fight it out on the field and let their own efficiencies win out. So we're just selling our network. We've got a beautiful network that we've invested in, and that's what we're selling.\nBen Nolan: Perfect. Thanks, Kenny. And for my follow-up quickly, Jennifer, when you talk about the 3% inflation, was just curious how you're factoring fuel cost into that.\nJennifer Hamann: Great question, Ben. We don't factor fuel cost into that because of our fuel surcharge programs. And, yes. There's a lag, but we don't include fuel. And we're talking about our core inflation.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nCherilyn Radbourne: Thanks very much, and good morning. Just a couple of questions on the operating side. Was wondering whether you could talk about if you've seen an uptick in your labor attrition rate if some of your peers have and how you're coping with that. And then just at a higher level, with regard to productivity to provide a partial offset to inflation, can you talk about how you're keeping the PSR mindset sort of alive and well throughout the company, particularly as you bring on new employees?\nEric Gehringer: Yeah. Thank you for those questions, Cherilyn, and the first answer is actually really straightforward. If you look at a five-year average, we are not seeing increased attrition in our agreement professionals. Regarding your second question, there's a lot of ways that we continue to reinforce PSR, but really our flagship method is really the one we've employed for the last, this will be the third year in a row, which is our operating excellence classes. This is an opportunity for frontline leaders in the operating department all the way through executives that are in the front lines to be not only with one another in groups of 60 to 80 but also to be with me and the leadership team as we continue to define our PSR initiatives as we continue to evolve the railroad with more PSR initiatives. And they are hearing it directly from us. Most importantly, they're getting the chance to ask questions and ensure that we have alignment and also present their opportunities back to us. So we'll continue to use communication as our single best tool, followed by just a relentless focus on execution.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey. Good morning. And sorry. I missed the first part of the call, so I don't mean to seem duplicative in my question. But Lance or Eric, your care plan compliance is down quite a bit, and I realize there's a lot of other outside factors right now during the pandemic. But for better or worse, this industry has a reputation when demand goes up or the economy heats up, volume goes up and service goes down. So I guess how do you think about that in the longer term context? Have we just cut too far under these PSR plans? Do we need to rethink labor and workforce levels? And is the CapEx level today the right level, or does that even potentially need to be reevaluated looking forward? Thank you.\nLance Fritz: Yeah, Brandon. This is Lance. I'm going to start because I've been crystal clear on this point with other audiences when I'm out talking. If you look at our historic record over the past handful of years, through our transformation we've improved our operating metrics when volume went down, particularly last year, and we improved them last year when volumes snapped back. So there's no reason for us to think empirically on Union Pacific volumes going to tank our ability to run the railroad. Having said that, what hurt us in crew availability primarily in the second-half of the year was, I think, we did not adequately address in our planning the reality of COVID and a third and a fourth way. Our planning profile said COVID is going to be around, but we're going to get used to it. It's going to have a diminishing impact, and we've got the resources necessary in that environment. What we did not plan for was a vaccine mandate where we have to give people time off to get vaccinated and waves where we had hundreds of UP employees unavailable to us on any given day because of quarantine. And I look at that and I think shame on us. That's a risk factor that we did not adequately plan for. And when I look into the future, we're going to just be a whole lot more relentless about and deliberate about the assumptions that we're building into our plans. Having said that, we're on the back side of getting that remedied, in part through being relentless on how we utilize crews that are available to us, and on the front side in making sure that we've got our boards staffed in a way that supports our crew consumption. And at some point in the future, COVID is going to go away, or it's going to be much less impactful. And I think at that point, that's going to be a wonderful day. But until then, we have to plan for it as a contingency, and that's what we've got built in. And I think we're going to be demonstrating that to you early on in this year. I see it in the statistics, and you will see it in the operating statistics as well.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Vernon: Hey. Good morning, guys. So Kenny or Eric, I guess, the question for you. On the intermodal growth you're putting out there, is this something that we should be estimating at 100% incremental to the current base and whatever growth forecast you're going to put in there? Or are there some customer losses, some remixing of the business that you're planning to do? I'm just wondering if we should be sort of thinking that this business comes in and the intermodal network is going to expand? Or are we going to be looking at this as only partially incremental growth? : No. This is clearly incremental growth for us. There's not a bait and switch or we change something or lost something. No. This is all incremental growth, and we're working very closely with Eric. Our team, Eric and I spend quite a bit of time talking about the intermodal network.\nDavid Vernon: All right. And then maybe just as a quick follow-up, the volume outlook slide has a question mark for international intermodal. I'm just wondering is that a commentary on the congestion at the ports and the shipper preferences for expediting off the West Coast? Or is that a commentary that says, hey, look, ask me as the volume comes in. Warehouses are going to be full, and we should see import growth start to slow. I'm just wondering what is the meaning behind that question mark on the volume outlook page for international intermodal?\nLance Fritz: Thanks for asking that clarifying question, and you're right. It's all about as we're slowly coming out of the Christmas holiday, I clearly believe that there is some natural timing to this, that we should see things work out. I've said that during the last part of the year, sometime in the middle of the year, but it's just going to be a gradual and slow increase to carloads on the international and intermodal side. But the short answer is that's what you're seeing.\nDavid Vernon: So that's more congestion than a macro comment?\nLance Fritz: Port congestion for sure, as customers are now sending more to inland versus port-to-port.\nLance Fritz: Yeah. I think where you're going with that, David, is there's nothing about in-market demand that we're building into the plan that says there's a collapse of the American consumer buying imports.\nDavid Vernon: Okay. Good. Thanks. I wanted to make sure that wasn't a macro thing. Thanks a lot, guys. And thanks for the time.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jairam Nathan with Daiwa. Please proceed with your question.\nJairam Nathan: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just following up on the system, so we have seen a lot of innovation especially on the truck side, and it's coming not only from within the industry but from outside the industry as well. So I'm just wondering. We haven't seen as much. How do you cultivate that? How do you kind of finance or fund it to bringing that outside innovation in the industry?\nLance Fritz: Yeah, Jairam. This is Lance. Maybe we're just not doing an adequate job of talking about it, but our new CIO in Rahul Jalali, he is a exceptionally talented tech executive. And what he's got us doing is amplifying our internal development by speeding it up through minimally viable product, by being product and platform-centric and by deep and clear partnership with his internal customers so that we can tease out more rapidly and more fulsomely what's the next step in our tech investment and how quickly can we bring it to market. There are so many examples of that. We've talked a bit about some this morning, the UPGo app for drivers on our ramps, Intermodal Vision, the mobile apps for our crew base, UP Vision, just on and on and on. The second way that that's happening is through becoming much more open and embracing of external tech expertise, whether that's partnering up with Google, whether that's partnering up with somebody like TuSimple. There's any number of ways that we're exercising those kinds of partnerships so that we can learn from and absorb their expertise into our business. Tech is touching every aspect of our business right now in an accelerated and accelerating manner, and we're really, really excited about that.\nJairam Nathan: Okay. Thank you. And just as a follow-up, Jennifer, so if I go back to the quarters where you hit the 55% operating target, the volumes were about 5%, 6%, about, let's say, 4Q levels. But it looks like there are other things that is happening margins this year, right? Like productivity and pricing to some extent. So I'm kind of trying to understand how much is the volume impact in that 55.5% OR target, and how much other initiatives help?\nLance Fritz: Let me start, Jennifer, with the mantra that you and I talk about all the time. Our ability to generate attractive margins is built on a three-legged stool. We look for volume growth, which we get to leverage. We look for productivity which we can leverage through volume growth and we can find in other ways. And we've got to have pricing that supports it as well. In 2022, we're going to see benefit from all three.\nJennifer Hamann: I think that's part of why we're talking about incremental margins as well because that focus on growth, the new business opportunities that's coming to us, being able to move that really efficiently, pricing it well, and then dropping that to the bottom line.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question today comes from the line of Jeffrey Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nJeffrey Kauffman: Thank you very much. Thanks for squeezing me in at the end here. Jennifer and Lance, you addressed the question, what if congestion doesn't get better and the system doesn't get more fluid? And you mentioned that's part of your contingency. I'm going to ask it the other way. What if it actually does? Because, you know, sometimes when growth bounces back too quickly, the system can be challenged. You talked about the hiring of crews. You talked about how your crew boards are going to ease up as you move through this. But can you talk about it takes six to nine-months to train a new T&E crew? What kind of planning do you have to put in place if the volumes come in a couple percentage points above what you're looking for? And what kind of constraints would you be running into on the network?\nLance Fritz: That's a great question, Jeff, and it's one that we scenario plan out for ourselves periodically as we go through our planning cycles within the year. First thing I would note is we worked really hard to reduce the amount of time it takes to get somebody off the street and to be qualified as a conductor. I think we've got that knocked down to something like 14 weeks, and so that's a substantial move in the right direction. Item number two is if we see volume overwhelming our ability to satisfy it, we've always got price as a lever that we can use that discourages some amount of that volume and helps it find a different home. And then we've got a lot of levers that we pull when it comes to managing the inventory, which is really the mechanism that bogs down the network. It's not the fact that more volume wants to move through the network. It's as if that volume doesn't move fluidly and it builds up inventory and now we're using our capacity in a really unproductive way. We've got a ton of mechanisms that we've developed over the past three years to make sure that inventory, if it comes on us, it moves through. And if there's too much coming on us for any one individual customer, we work directly with that customer to get them back in the box.\nJennifer Hamann: Yeah, Lance. You hit all the key points. The only thing I'd add is it's less about the absolute volume number and it's also about where the volume comes on and in what products. And so that's where I think the team did a great job in 2021 being agile around that. We weren't expecting the chip shortages. We didn't expect the supply chain congestion, and the coal volumes were a blessing that came to us as well as increase on the grain side. So to be able to pivot quickly and be agile, that's why it's so critical that Kenny and Eric are linked at the hip in terms of talking about the trends, talking about the plan, and then executing to that.\nJeffrey Kauffman: And just a follow-up to that. I heard Kenny recently talk about the great resignation and the challenge with bringing back from the furlough board. So have you worked your way through most of the furlough boards and have your arms around your ability to bring back employees? Or is that something that we're still probably going to be dealing within the coming quarters as volume begins to come back?\nKenyatta Rocker: No, Jeff. We've largely depleted those furlough boards. The folks that we have called back are in training classes now, and we're really focusing. In terms of incremental adds to our network from a crew base, it's going to be on the new hire side.\nOperator: Thank you, everyone. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Lance Fritz for closing comments.\nLance Fritz: Rob, thank you very much. You did a wonderful job for us today again. And thank you, all, for joining us today and for your questions. We're looking forward to talking with you again in April when we discuss our first quarter results. Until then, I wish you all good health. Please take care. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Fritz. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Eric Gehringer",
            "content": "Thanks, Kenny, and good morning. 2021 proved to be a challenging year operationally as we saw a wide range of events impact the network from wildfires to supply chain congestion. The team leveraged their collective strength to find solutions to keep trains moving. We exited the year in a more fluid state recognizing additional improvement is still imperative. Taking a look at our key performance metrics for the quarter on slide 10, compared to fourth quarter 2020, our operating metrics deteriorated, although we improved most of our metrics sequentially from third quarter. Freight car velocity was impacted by reduced crew availability due to an increase in COVID infections and providing time off for vaccinations. Through reducing our re-crew rate, recalling remaining furloughed employees, streamlining processes to on-board crews, and increasing crew vaccination rates, our crew availability improved throughout the quarter. Our intermodal trip plan compliance of 78% is a decline from last year, however is a 12 point sequential improvement from third quarter results. This sequential improvement is evidence that our intermodal assets are balanced and we are poised for growth. Our manifest in auto trip plan compliance results of 58% represented a decline both year-over-year and sequentially. Crew availability had a greater impact on our manifest network. The December manifest and auto trip plan compliance results of 62% indicate we are trending in a positive direction, and we are building on these gains to start the year. Efforts during the quarter focused on the Southeastern portion of our network, and we successfully returned manifest operations to a fluid state. Our bulk operations, however, are not currently to a level that meets expectations. We are focused on driving improvement to this network as we did to the manifest network. Turning to slide 11, our efficiency metrics remain strong in the quarter, although some results were muted by the crew availability and lower volumes. Locomotive productivity declined 9% compared to fourth quarter 2020 due to higher locomotive resources to assist with recovery efforts in the southeastern portion of the network. Fourth quarter record workforce productivity improved 1% to 1,046 daily miles per FTE. Recognizing the importance of balancing strong crew utilization and planning for the future, we are focused on effectively managing crew levels. We're in the marketplace hiring, although we have been challenged in certain locations. Working with our partners and workforce resources to expand our reach, we are developing creative programs and campaigns like our Second Chance program to attract new employees to Union Pacific. Train length increased 2% from a year ago to over 9,300 feet enabled by the completion of 15 sightings during the year. Although our ability to grow train length in the fourth quarter was impeded by lower volumes in the intermodal business, we did deliver train length improvement in other business lines, including a 4% improvement in our manifest train length. Utilizing the strong foundation built with the adoption of PSR, the team is ready to handle the expected growth in this and future years. Turning to slide 12, with respect to our capital spending, PSR allows us to efficiently operate the railroad in a less capital-intensive manner. We continue to exercise discipline while still delivering value to our shareholders. Capital spending will remain in line with our long term guidance of less than 15% of revenue. For 2022, we are targeting capital spending of $3.3 billion pending final approval by our Board of Directors. The increase in capital spending is driven by targeted freight car acquisitions, investments in growth-related capital projects to drive more carloads to the network, and finally, slightly higher material and labor inflation cost. Approximately 80% of our planned capital spending will go towards replacement of our existing infrastructure. This spending will renew older assets, harden our infrastructure, and allow us to continue to operate safely. We are continuing to support intermodal volume growth starting with investments in certain ramps to efficiently handle volumes from new and existing intermodal customers including the Schneider business win that Kenny highlighted. We are also expanding the Twin Cities from a pop-up to a full-scale intermodal terminal and adding additional capacity to the Inland Empire pop-up intermodal terminal. Finally, we will wrap up the multiyear project to install wide span Gantry cranes at our G4 intermodal terminal in Chicago, bringing additional capacity to a key intermodal market. We will also continue modernizing our locomotive fleet by upgrading approximately 120 older assets. These modernizations not only improve the reliability of the asset, but each unit is a 5% more fuel efficient and emits approximately 53% less carbon emissions. Lastly, we will continue to invest in capacity projects that drive productivity and improve our network efficiency. We plan to complete approximately 20 sightings this year focused in the southern portion of our network to further support our train length initiative. Wrapping up on slide 13, entering 2022 we are enhancing our safety programs. We've engaged an external safety partner to focus on advanced risk identification and mitigation, coupled with enriched behavioral safety programs. Our goal is to be the first railroad to reach world-class safety performance, as there is nothing more important than making sure every employee returns home safely. With the robust market demand and strong volume outlook Kenny described, I have complete confidence that the operating team will be able to safely meet the growth needs of our customers. The operating team is focused on continuous performance improvement of the railroad to drive customer-centric growth while remaining judicious in our allocation of resources. While 2021 did not always bring optimal operating conditions, by working together and remaining agile, we entered each challenge and laid a foundation for continued success this year and beyond. With that, I will turn it over to Jennifer to review our financial performance. Just reflect on this year and what happened with Premium volumes in the second half of the year. They were softer, and so we're certainly looking for that to be stronger in the back half of 2022. We're excited about the ag program that we have at Global IV coming on, and we've seen uplift from Dallas, Dallas to dock. So a number of products that are out there that are going to be of value to those international customers. John, thanks for that question. It's an excellent question, and I want to be really clear. I believe all of it is just deferred. I believe we've set ourselves up coming out of 2021 and the beginning of 2022 to be able to capitalize on exactly what we said. And to your point, some of those events that impact us were transitory. Some of them, like COVID, we may still see that impact. Here is a team that's committed to being able to capture that deferred, and that's exactly what we're poised to do in 2022. I think if my crystal ball was that clear I'd tell you that, but probably like you, John, we have to go through and plan for those contingencies. If the impact comes down, we've got to make sure we're ready to capitalize on the potential from our productivity. If the impact of COVID goes up, you'll see us flex to that as best as we possibly can. Our goal is first to ensure that our employees are safe, and they are taking the time off if they are positive, followed by making sure when they are here, collectively we're being as productive as we possibly can while we're also being excessively safe. There still is work to be done there. And as we talked nearly a year ago Investor Day about intermodal being such an important growth engine for us, we also at the same time rolled out intermodal excellence. And if you look at many of those initiatives, they are focused on assisting our customers, on helping with the ability to be able to get quicker turns. So as I think about the work we're doing at nearly every intermodal ramp around our gate system and reducing the amount of time to get in and get out, that's helping them in that generating capacity. The work we've done on changing our UPGo app, whether it's for our existing customers or our new customers, we're making sure we continue to do our part to assist our customers to be able to generate that capacity. Now, to Lance's point, there's opportunity on the other side, but together I think we'll work our way through it. Lance, you're spot on. And the only thing I would add is that we're not waiting around to think strategically about these growth areas from a geo perspective. And that's what you're seeing now with all the work that we're doing with Eric's team in terms of Inland Empire and the growth there and investments there, the Twin Cities, the growth there and investments there. You're going to see a little bit more volume in those areas than you did last year. That's intermodal. Also on the carload side we're also thinking very strategically about areas that you can call it high-growth population, you can call it high warehousing. When we see areas that are under-penetrated from a rail perspective, we're going to be opportunistic and really invest towards those areas. And that's what you're seeing with the train load facilities and the Inland Empire. Yeah. Building off the previous conversation, we're in the market. It's certainly in some points, some locations just is a challenging market. As I think about looking throughout the year, some of the different activities we've taken on are meant to really differentiate us from other companies that are in the market as well. I think about not only employee referral programs that get the word out more in our social media campaigns. But I also think about the efforts we've taken in the last year where we're now talking to perspective employees that the day they come to the railroad is also the first day they can start college with us, that we offer that free of charge to them. So we're in the market. We're going to continue to put out what we feel is a very strong value proposition to join Union Pacific. We should talk about that, Justin. It's pretty much invisible to the outside world, but over three quarters of our workforce is fully vaccinated. And that's because we started early on complying with the federal vaccine mandate. Now, we paused because of the pause mandated by a court, but we think that our employee population, because of that high vaccination rate, lasted through Omicron a little better than the communities that we serve. We saw a spike in the number of our employees who had to quarantine, presumed positive or exposed, but it was nothing like the spike that we saw in the communities that we serve. Yeah. Thank you for those questions, Cherilyn, and the first answer is actually really straightforward. If you look at a five-year average, we are not seeing increased attrition in our agreement professionals. Regarding your second question, there's a lot of ways that we continue to reinforce PSR, but really our flagship method is really the one we've employed for the last, this will be the third year in a row, which is our operating excellence classes. This is an opportunity for frontline leaders in the operating department all the way through executives that are in the front lines to be not only with one another in groups of 60 to 80 but also to be with me and the leadership team as we continue to define our PSR initiatives as we continue to evolve the railroad with more PSR initiatives. And they are hearing it directly from us. Most importantly, they're getting the chance to ask questions and ensure that we have alignment and also present their opportunities back to us. So we'll continue to use communication as our single best tool, followed by just a relentless focus on execution."

            "name": "Jennifer Hamann",
            "content": "Thanks, Eric, and good morning. Starting off with the income statement on slide 15; whereas Lance mentioned earlier we've adjusted 2020 results to exclude the Brazos impairment charge, throughout my remarks today I will be comparing 2021 to 2020 adjusted results. Operating revenue in the quarter totalled $5.7 billion, up 12% versus 2020 despite a 4% year-over-year volume decline. Operating expense increased 15% to $3.3 billion. I'll provide more detail in a moment, but excluding the impact of higher fuel prices, expenses were up 7% in the quarter. Together, we are reporting record fourth quarter operating income of $2.4 billion, a 7% increase versus 2020. Other income of $83 million is up 26% driven by a $36 million gain on the sale of a technology investment. Interest expense was up 6% as increased average debt levels were partially offset by a lower effective interest rate. Net income of $1.7 billion increased 8% which, when combined with our strong share repurchase program, led to a 13% increase in earnings per share to $2.66. Our 57.4% fourth quarter operating ratio increased 180 basis points, reflecting 100 basis point negative impact of higher fuel prices as well as reduced operational efficiency. As we did throughout 2021, we're also comparing our results to 2019. Against that fourth quarter comparison, we generated 16% higher operating income on 1% less volume, clearly demonstrating that ongoing price discipline and operational efficiency we've achieved over the past two years. Looking more closely at fourth quarter revenue, slide 16 provides a breakdown of our Freight revenue, which totals $5.3 billion in the fourth quarter, up 10% compared to 2020. Volume was down 400 basis points driven by the factors Kenny described earlier. Positive business mix coupled with a strong pricing actions that yielded dollars exceeding our inflation drove 725 basis points in total improvement. Lower intermodal volume combined with higher Industrial shipments drove the positive mix. Fuel surcharge revenue of $522 million increased Freight revenue 700 basis points as our fuel surcharge programs continued to chase rising fuel prices. Now let's move on to slide 17 which provides a summary of our fourth quarter operating expenses. As I just mentioned, the primary driver of the increase was fuel expense, up 80% as a result of a 74% increase in fuel prices. Our fuel consumption rate was flat compared to 2020 as a favorable business mix was offset by negative productivity. Looking further at the expense lines, compensation and benefits expense was up 5% versus 2020. Fourth quarter workforce levels increased 1% as flat management, engineering, and mechanical workforces were offset by 3% growth in our train and engine crews. This increase reflects our actions to recall furloughed employees as well as bring on new hires to manage utilization challenges and, importantly, in preparation for growth. Costs per employee increased 4% as a result of wage inflation, as well was higher recrew, overtime, and borrow-out costs partially offset by last year's $37 million employee COVID bonus. Purchase services and materials expense was up 9%, in part due to the comparison to favorable inner line settlements in 2020 as well as increased locomotive maintenance, crew van usage, and purchase transportation. Equipment and other rents was up 5% driven by lower TTX equity income. Other expense increased 29% in the quarter driven by higher personal injury expense associated primarily with two adverse outcomes as well as increased freight loss and damage and state and local taxes. As we look to 2022, overall workforce levels are expected to increase with volume although not one for one as we continued to drive productivity. Costs per employee in 2022 should increase in the low-single digits as productivity partially offsets inflation. Depreciation expense will be up around 2% versus 2021 while we expect the other expense line to be relatively flat year-over-year. Purchase services and materials expense is a bit more of a wild card but will be impacted by inflationary pressure as well as the expected recovery in auto volumes. Finally, we expect our annual effective tax rate to be around 24%. Looking now at our efficiency results on slide 18, we took a step back in the quarter and did not meet our original or revised productivity targets, finishing the year with $195 million of net productivity. Higher casualty expenses, increased costs associated with network operations, and reduced volume leverage cumulatively drove the productivity loss. For the full year, we achieved improvements in all areas, led by locomotive and workforce productivity initiatives. These gains were partially offset by roughly $55 million of weather and incident-related headwinds in 2021. While these results are clearly not what we expect of ourselves, we view the productivity as deferred, not lost. Similarly, fourth quarter incremental margins were muted at 27%. For the full year, our 77% incremental margins are more indicative of our capabilities, particularly given the positive business mix in 2021. The ability to efficiently add volume to our network is the foundation for delivering strong shareholder value going forward. Moving to slide 19, we'll review full year 2021 with earnings per share of $9.95, a 21% increase versus adjusted 2020 results. Revenue was up 12% on 4% volume growth, increased fuel surcharges, strong pricing gains, and a positive business mix. Record operating income increased 15% to $9.3 billion. Even with a 140 basis point headwind from rising fuel prices, our full year operating ratio of 57.2% improved 130 basis points versus adjusted 2020. Our improvement in 2021 marks the fifth consecutive year of operating ratio gains for Union Pacific, demonstrating our ability to drive efficiency even during a difficult year, and a further comparison of our results to 2019 shows that the hurdles of the past two years has not slowed our momentum. Turning now to cash and returns on slide 20, full year cash from operations increased approximately $500 million to $9 billion, a 6% increase from 2020. The first priority for our cash is our capital investment which finished 2021 just over $3 billion or roughly 14% of revenue. Our cash flow conversion rate was a strong 93%, and free cash flow after dividends increased $285 million or 9% compared to 2020. Our dividend payout ratio for 2021 was 43%, in line with our 45% target, as we rewarded shareholders with two 10% dividend increases during the year, distributing a total of $2.8 billion to shareholders. We also returned cash to our owners through strong share repurchases, buying back a total of 33 million common shares or 3% at an all-in cost of $7.3 billion, which includes $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter. In total, between dividends and share repurchases, we returned $10.1 billion to our owners in 2021, demonstrating our ongoing commitment to deliver significant shareholder value. Now, looking at the strength of our balance sheet on slide 21, we finished the year at an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.7 times, consistent with our resolve to maintain strong investment-grade credit ratings. At year-end, our Moody's rating was Baa1 and A minus from both S&P and Fitch. Our all-in adjusted debt balance on December 31 of $31 billion increased over $2 billion from year-end 2020 as we continue to utilize our strong balance sheet and earnings growth to reward shareholders. Finally, our return on invested capital came in at a record 16.4%, bouncing back more than 2 points from a challenging 2020 and increased 1.4 points from 2019. The reduced capital intensity associated with running a PSR operation is seen clearly in this performance and positions us for growth in the years ahead. So wrapping up with a look to 2022 on slide 22, let me start by pointing you back to our May Investor Day and the three-year targets we laid out. Those targets remain intact and are the building blocks of our view to 2022. With volumes we stated, we would outpace Industrial production through our business development efforts which are going strong, as Kenny mentioned. The current forecast for 2022 Industrial production is 4.8%. To outperform that forecast, we have new business wins like Knight-Swift as well as anticipated recovery of autos and international. We also expect to have the added benefit of coal volume growth. As you'll recall, we originally anticipated coal to be a half-point headwind over the next three years, but with current natural gas prices and recent business wins, that business should actually provide a tailwind in 2022. Looking at the cadence of volumes through the year, the first half should be led by Bulk and Industrial. In the second half, we'd look for stronger year-over-year gains and for it to be more Premium-driven as supply chains and chip shortages improve. For first quarter volumes specifically, we're anticipating carloads will track below full year 2022 growth expectations as we experience a muted post-holiday rebound likely impacted by rising COVID infection rates plus continued soft international intermodal volumes. With a strong overall demand environment and our disciplined pricing approach, we expect to yield pricing dollars in excess of inflation dollars. Embedded in that guidance is our expectation that all-in inflation for the year will be elevated a little north of 3%. At our Investor Day, we targeted incremental margins in the mid to upper-60% range. For 2022, we would expect to be at the low end of that range given the significant mix shift to intermodal growth. The combination of growing volumes, pricing above inflation, and strong incremental margins should lead to the achievement of our long term goal of a 55% operating ratio. Putting a little finer point to it, we would expect to achieve around a 55.5% operating ratio for full year 2022. Turning to cash and capital, you heard our plan to invest around $3.3 billion of capital for the year, well within our long term guidance of less than 15% of revenue. Strong top line growth, increasing profitability, and ongoing capital discipline should result in a cash conversion rate near 100%. This strong cash generation allows us to continue rewarding our owners with an industry-leading dividend payout and strong share repurchases which we expect will be in line with 2021 levels. Before I turn it back to Lance to wrap up, I'd like to express my appreciation to the Union Pacific team. What they achieved over the past year is truly remarkable. Union Pacific success begins and ends with our people. So with that, I'll turn it back to Lance. Yeah. I'll start and then turn it over to Kenny, but you're thinking of it right, Chris. And we do expect our volumes to grow in the first quarter. But again, we see it kind of -- and you laid it out, first half, second half. First half is going to be led by Bulk and Industrial. We certainly embedded in the expectation for stronger growth in the second half is the recovery in the supply chains, and that includes the chip shortages. So that is our expectation for the year, and we feel very bullish about that. And I'll let Kenny talk to you about that a little bit more. Clarification there, Kenny. When you said we're 10% or 15% in, you're talking about the total number of bids? Then just to clarify -- and, Jason, I know you know this -- but when we talk about pricing above inflation, it's in dollars. So we expect to yield pricing dollars in excess of our inflation dollars. Yeah, Amit. Thanks for that. And I knew I could count on you for the margin question. But we feel very bullish about our opportunities in 2022 and feel very good about being able to hit that long-established operating ratio target of the 55%. And 55.5% obviously is right smack dab in the middle of that fairway. There will be cost pressures. We know that. Higher inflationary environment. We know that we need to bring on some more employees, and so you're going to see our headcount go up a little bit. Not at a one-for-one with volume, but we will be bringing on new employees. So there's hiring and training costs and then just running the network more fluidly which we're off to a great start here as we come into 2022. So feel good about it. I'm not going to give a characterization one way or the other, but we're very excited about the long term potential, and 2022 is just going to be another building block on that progression as we become more and more profitable and provide a better service product to more and more customers. Bottom line, it fundamentally supports the guidance we gave at the Investor Day in May which is something like 3% growth for averaging for the next three years, above industry all production. So you're well positioned to be able to deliver that. We knew that, again, continuing to come out of the pandemic, you were going to have stronger Industrial production in the earlier part of that three-year range. So the business wins and just Kenny's team going out and hustling is what gives us that upside to Industrial production. To your mix question, Scott, I do believe based on our expectations, particularly with the Premium business being stronger in the second half that we will have on a full year basis a mix headwind. But I think you're looking at it correctly when I look at the drivers for growth in the first half being more Industrial and Bulk-loaded. It should look a little different in the first half than the full year. I'll do the clean-up first. Then you can talk on the regulatory side, Lance. I did reference the Knight-Swift business. When that's domestic intermodal, that's part of what's driving the plus for us relative to Industrial production. And then just when you look at again some of the supply chain issues which impacted both international and domestic being intermodal, as we see those resolving themselves more in the back half of the year, we would look to see strong performance there. Yeah. I'll maybe start, and others may want to weigh in. But when we look at the key metrics that are driving the cost profile, which relates to certainly the operating ratio, I'd look more at freight car velocity and the terminal dwell numbers in terms of how efficiently we're handling the freight on the railroad. And that also has an impact on the number of turns that we're getting on the cars that we can put up against the customers to get that next revenue load. So I see trip plan compliance and intermodal trip plan compliance more as the outcome of these other things that we're doing in terms of moving the car and operating the network more fluidly being more directly impactful to the OR. Great question, Ben. We don't factor fuel cost into that because of our fuel surcharge programs. And, yes. There's a lag, but we don't include fuel. And we're talking about our core inflation. I think that's part of why we're talking about incremental margins as well because that focus on growth, the new business opportunities that's coming to us, being able to move that really efficiently, pricing it well, and then dropping that to the bottom line. Yeah, Lance. You hit all the key points. The only thing I'd add is it's less about the absolute volume number and it's also about where the volume comes on and in what products. And so that's where I think the team did a great job in 2021 being agile around that. We weren't expecting the chip shortages. We didn't expect the supply chain congestion, and the coal volumes were a blessing that came to us as well as increase on the grain side. So to be able to pivot quickly and be agile, that's why it's so critical that Kenny and Eric are linked at the hip in terms of talking about the trends, talking about the plan, and then executing to that."

            "content": "Thank you, Lance, and good morning. Fourth quarter volume was down 4% compared to a year ago. Gains in our Industrial and Bulk segments were more than offset by declines in our Premium business group from continued global supply chain disruptions. However, Freight revenue was up 10% driven by higher fuel surcharges, positive mix, and strong pricing gains. Let's take a closer look at each of these business groups. Starting with Bulk, revenue for the quarter was up 16% compared to 2020 driven by a 5% increase in volume and a 10% increase in average revenue per car, reflecting higher fuel surcharges, positive mix, and strong core pricing gains. Coal and renewable carloads grew 13% year-over-year. Our efforts to switch customers to index-based contracts are supporting domestic coal demand as a result of higher natural gas prices. The sequential decline was due in part to softer demand from milder weather in the fourth quarter. The harvest for grain and grain products drove the 15% sequential improvement. However, shipments were down 1% compared to 2020 due to reduced grain export shipments to the Gulf. Weaker grain shipments were partially offset by our business development efforts and strong demand for biofuels. Fertilizer carloads were up 9% year-over-year due to strong agricultural demand and increased export potash shipments. Moving on to Industrial, Industrial revenue was improved by 14% for the quarter driven by an 8% increase in volume. Average revenue per car also improved 6% primarily driven by higher fuel surcharges and core pricing gains. Energy and specialized shipments were flat compared to 2020. Higher demand for LPG and soda ash was offset by fewer project-related waste shipments and petroleum products. Volume for forest products grew 7% year-over-year primarily driven by demand for brown paper used in corrugated boxes and scrap paper. Industrial chemicals and plastic shipments were up 6% year-over-year due to strengthening demand and business plans. Metals and minerals volumes continue to be a bright spot. Volume was up 18% compared to 2020 primarily driven by our business development efforts along with strong steel demand. In addition, demand recovery for construction materials and favorable comps for frac sand contributed to strong year-over-year growth. Turning to Premium, revenue for the quarter was up 1% on a 14% decrease in volume versus 2020. Average revenue per car increased by 17% due to higher fuel surcharge, core pricing gains, and a positive mix of traffic. Automotive volume was down 10% in the quarter due to semiconductor-related part shortages and associated plant shutdowns. However, sequentially we saw a 10% increase versus the third quarter due to improved semiconductor availability. Intermodal volume was down 15% driven by continued international intermodal supply chain disruptions impacting the quarter as ocean carriers and BTO shifted more freight port to port. Sequentially, intermodal volume was down 10% versus the third quarter, as global supply chains remain challenged. Now, looking ahead to 2022, here are the economic indicators that correlate closely with our business. You see that Industrial production is currently forecasted to grow at 4.8% in 2022. We also recognize that we will face continued challenges in our energy-related markets, but despite those hurdles we continue to build upon our solid strategy to serve, grow, win, together. This strategy enables us to outperform the markets with our reliable service and continued focus on enhancing the customer experience. So as we begin 2022, I'm excited and bullish for the opportunities we have in front of us. For our Bulk commodities, we are optimistic about the growth in most of our markets due to favorable market conditions and business development wins. For fertilizer, we anticipate incremental growth with strong market demand and the long term deal with Canpotex where we have expanded terminal capacity to handle more volume with longer trains. Coal should see year-over-year growth based on the expectations of continued favorable natural gas prices. Additionally, plant retirements forecasted in 2022 will be offset by two new contract wins that started on January 1. For grain, we have tough comps versus 2021 as exports have been strong for the last couple of years. However, in grain products we are leading the market in biofuels development by securing opportunities on both sides of the house, the inbound feedstocks and the outbound finished biofuels. Moving to our Industrial markets, we continue to be encouraged by the strength of the forecast for industrial production. This will positively impact many of our markets like metal. Customer expansions and business development wins will drive growth in our Industrial chemicals and plastics commodity groups. However, as we move through the year, we expect lumber shipments to be adversely impacted by the current forecast for housing starts. And lastly, for Premium, we expect strong uplift for both our automotive and intermodal businesses. Automotive sales are forecasted to increase from 15 million units in 2021 to 15.4 million in 2022 due to the vehicle inventory re-stocking effort. Plus, wins to convert finished vehicles and auto parts shipments from over-the-road will further strengthen UP's automotive business. Domestic intermodal will benefit from retail inventory re-stocking, continued strength in retail sales, and tight truck supply. We're seeing slow improvement on our international volumes, but we also remain cognizant of the continued labor shortages that are impacting the global supply chain. Setting aside those forces outside of our control, we continue to create our own opportunities to grow. We are focused on expanding our reach into new markets in the industry. We're growing our footprint in the Twin Cities and Inland Empire Intermodal Terminal. This quarter we will also have a new product offering with our ag transload site at Global IV, and a nice swift business win that started this month positions us for robust growth in 2022. But just to be clear, we're not only investing on the intermodal side. We're making significant investment to support growth on the car load side, too. We've recently purchased two transload sites in strong economic growth areas like the Inland Empire and Phoenix. As we forge ahead with our aggressive commercial strategy, we're accelerating growth beyond this year. The future looks bright heading into 2023 as we just announced that UP will be the primary intermodal rail carrier in the West for Schneider. This new business will start up in January 2023. I'm proud of our commercial team. They are intensely focused on working with our customers to find creative solutions to win in the marketplace. We are anxious to build upon this momentum and grow with our customers. With that, I'll turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance. Yeah, Chris. We're seeing -- and this is pretty slow here. We're seeing slow marginal growth from where we were in the fourth quarter to now on our international intermodal volumes. So we're looking at that every day. I'll tell you that. Same is true about the automotive business. And I talked about the fact that sequentially from third to fourth quarter, we saw that 10% improvement. We're expecting that to increase, and that's what you're seeing in the back half of the year. We also feel good about a couple business wins on the coal side that'll help us from a car load perspective. Yeah, Lance. You hit it right on the head. We're talking to our customers daily about that conversion from port to port. The inland ramps that we have, we have seen that, that is slowly occurring. Now, remember, we've got a backlog of ships out there on the water, so that's got to get sorted out. The same thing we're going to be keeping an eye on is at a lot of these inland ramps how the warehouses are doing and are they able to process a lot of that business that's coming on. So it's going to be a slow, gradual increase to us, but we're talking to our customers. And we expect more improvement as we go throughout the year. Yeah. I'll take that, Jennifer. We've got a favorable pricing environment. I'm going to talk about, call it, our domestic intermodal business. We're about 10%, 15% in on a lot of the bids that we're looking at. And again, it's a favorable pricing environment. We'll have to see how that plays out in the second half of the year. Right now it looks good, but we're going to be looking at it quarter by quarter. But great environment to be repricing. Total number of bids that we're looking at. Yeah. First of all, before I get to the new players, we feel really good about our long term partner, and we look at them as an industry leader. Clearly, we're bringing on Knight-Swift this year. They are a strong industry leader. And then in the future, we'll bring on Schneider. We look at that as a great value to the BCO. We believe that that's going to give us and them a lot of optionality to grow. Clearly, that's the impetus there to offer more options. It's going to also give Eric an opportunity to densify a lot of networks and execute on a lot of intermodal excellence initiatives that he has. As we look at our own IMCs that we have out there and our own equipment, you know that we're doubling down on investing there. So we invested in almost 6,000 chassis. We're bringing on GPS. So we feel like we've got a great mixture to offer those private asset players that are on our network and also the ones that will be utilizing our equipment. Yeah. Thanks for that, Ken. Good to hear from you. So pointing back to May, that Investor Day, we set out our targets, and we want to execute on those targets first of all. At the end of the day, truck is our true competition, and so we're exhausting all efforts to go out and win against truck. Now we've talked quite a bit about that intermodal piece. We're doing the same thing on the car load side. There's still a lot of opportunity there. So we view the competition as truck, and we're going to be pretty dogged. The team is all over this about trying to convert as much truck business as we can. Yeah. Let me start on the security side, and then Kenny will turn it back over to you. So, there's been a lot of coverage about some thefts that are occurring in the LA basin specifically. That is a -- I'll call that a relatively unique situation where something that used to be a nuisance, call it, two years ago, members in a neighborhood would see a train not moving and might take advantage of trying to pop open a box and see what's inside. Today that's more organized, and we have our arms around it. We've increased our own police presence. We're working with the LAPD in that area. We're working with the State, whose also getting involved. We're actively working to get the district attorney in the area spooled up and interested prosecuting the cases. So I think at this point we've got our arms around it. We've cleaned up the area, and we're going to be enhancing security in the area, to your point. We're going to put physical security barriers in place. It's unfortunate because they won't be necessarily pretty, but it will protect our property. And more importantly, it'll protect our employees. That's probably the biggest concern I've had throughout this whole time frame. We hate impacting our customers. We really can't stomach putting our employees at risk. Yeah. I talked about it a little bit. We are seeing more customers each week that are turning on more business to go inland to the ramp. That's going to take a while. I talked about the fact that we've got a lot of shift still out on the water. It's encouraging to see that both they're talking about doing it, but we're also seeing it show up in our carloads. We're looking at that on a week-to-week basis. Eric's ramps are clean. We've got the equipment. We've got the capacity. We're prepared for it. So we want our customers to bring it on. Then, Brian, on your question around career availability, you mentioned the Southeastern portion of the railroad. That's exactly right. When we walked into the quarter, that was one of the challenges that lied ahead of us was to be able to recover the manifest network in the southeast portion. From my comments, we've done that. We've brought back the fluidity that we expect, which reduces the stress in our crew base. Now as I think about it as a whole system though and you think about crew availability, really got three components to that. The first one is COVID, and as we think about COVID, it's not just people who unfortunately are at home because they are either positive or they have been quarantined but also people who have to be vaccinated. And if you think about the fourth quarter relative to earlier in the year, the fourth quarter was significantly more impactful to us in that way than earlier in the year. The next part is the utilization of our crew base, and as I look back over the third quarter and coming into the fourth quarter, completing the fourth quarter, we've reduced our re-crew rate by one-third. And that's incredibly important because that provides us flexibility in our crew base to continue to meet growth demands. Then finally as I talked a little bit about, the other part of crew availability is ensuring that we're out in the marketplace hiring for attrition and for growth. And as you heard Jennifer mention, we're not hiring one-for-one. We're hiring for that growth. It's a challenging market in certain geographic locations, but what we have is a workforce resource department that has certainly stretched themselves into all sorts of different campaigns and initiatives to help us continue to hire to our demand. And I'm very encouraged for it. Yeah. Hey. Good morning, Scott. Thanks for the question. Unfortunately, I'm not going to size the volume for you. I can tell you that we're excited about it, and Eric is prepared to handle that business. And we think that there is long term strategic value in having Hub and Knight-Swift on our line this year. And then eventually long term we'll be able to provide our BCO with a lot of options. And it gives us the opportunity to really build up our network and go after that truck business. So we're pretty excited about it. And now that number is like 4.8%. Yeah. We're certainly pricing to the market, and that's an exchange in our overall approach to the market. We're selling a very strong, reliable service product. We're also backing that up with a lot of the capital that Eric and his team will be putting in to create a value proposition. So that's our approach to the market. That's how we're going to win. That's how we're going to grow. That's how we talk to our BCOs and all the customers on our network. To the second question about drayage capacity, yeah. We certainly see offline time. We see how much time the chassis are off, how much time the containers are gone. It's still not a very efficient network. It needs to come down, and as it comes down, it's going to create more volume growth, more efficiency for us. It'll be overall positive. So we're looking at that on a daily basis. Let me chime in on the second question, the bottoms-up versus tops-down. Kenny, you have unique relationships with the commercial side and the buying side of a lot of our customers. At the CEO level, I'll tell you what my counterparts tend to be focused on is consumers are flush. Balance sheets for consumers are good, and they're financially healthy. So as long as their confidence isn't rattled, they seem to be postured to continue to purchase through the year. And the industrial economy, a lot of my industrial peers feel pretty confident that their marketplaces look pretty good to them, whether you're in the housing market, you're in the construction market, you're in some other aspect of our industrial economy. So at the very highest level, Kenny, that's what I hear. And that's where some of those investments that Lance referenced that were proud investments initially when you think about extensions become investments that support the growth of the network, and that's capacity that's not being utilized in that manner to date. And then think about our locomotives, which we still have a significant portion of our locomotive fleet that is stored today. So that's capacity that we have to bring to bear, and will be. Walter, we are interested the parallel systems technology. We are familiar with it, and it is of interest. It's of keen interest. Candidly, there's a lot of hurdles in front of that technology for deployment. Having said that, it could potentially be a game changer if it proves out to be effective and workable. So I'd say keep your eye on it, and we're keeping our eye on it. And I don't think it's going to impact 2022 or 2023 or 2024, but at some point it could be a technology that has utility for the U.S. rail network. Yeah. Again, I'm really proud of the team. We've got a strong leadership team and the premium laid in that, but you know what we're doing is we're working as a team. And the first thing we do is we talk about our service products. We talk about where our network is and the capacity. Clearly, we had to put up some capital against that and some investments against that to help those carriers, those customers get into and get out of our ramps. We're very fluid. We're selling all those things. There's no part of it where we're changing our pricing strategy or approach to the market. We'll let the players really fight it out on the field and let their own efficiencies win out. So we're just selling our network. We've got a beautiful network that we've invested in, and that's what we're selling. No, Jeff. We've largely depleted those furlough boards. The folks that we have called back are in training classes now, and we're really focusing. In terms of incremental adds to our network from a crew base, it's going to be on the new hire side."

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific 's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Mr. Fritz, you may begin.\nLance Fritz : Thank you, Rob. And good morning, everybody. Welcome to Union Pacific 's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me today in Omaha are Kenny Rocker, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Eric Gehringer, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Jennifer Hamann, our Chief Financial Officer. During the quarter, the Union Pacific team dealt with multiple network disruptions that required us to rebuild bridges, reroute trains, and connect more closely with other links in the supply chain to support and to serve our customers. While we still have work ahead, our employees' dedication is a critical success factor in navigating all of those challenges.  Turning to our third quarter results, this morning, Union Pacific is reporting 2021 third quarter net income of $1.7 billion or $2.57 per share. This compares to $1.4 billion or $2.01 per share in the third quarter of 2020. Despite the network and global supply chain challenges, our quarterly operating ratio of 56.3% improved 240 basis points versus last year and represents a third quarter record. We also set third quarter records in Operating income, net income, and earnings per share. The team did an excellent job of managing the business to produce strong results.  A comparison to 2019, a period with higher volumes, further highlights our performance and demonstrates our focus on driving productivity and network efficiency to overcome external factors. We also continue to make progress on our goal to reduce our carbon footprint. The team achieved strong productivity to brew some all-time quarterly record low fuel consumption rate. This represented a 1% improvement versus 2020 and helped our customers eliminate 5.7 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions in the quarter by using Union Pacific versus truck. Momentum is building. And before the end of the year, we plan the detail our emissions reduction plan with the release of our initial climate action plan. So let's start the morning with Kenny for an update on the business environment.\nKenny Rocker : Thank you, Lance and good morning. Before I talk about our market performance, I want to thank our operating team for their tireless efforts this past summer to recover the network from the devastating forest fires in California. Focusing back on our review of the business, our Third Quarter volume was flat compared to a year-ago. Gains in our bulk and industrial segments were driven by market strength and our business development efforts. Those gains were offset by declines in our premium business group, as our served markets continue to be impacted by semiconductor chip shortages and global supply chain disruptions.  However, freight revenue was up 12% driven by higher fuel surcharges, strong pricing gains, and a positive mix. Let's take a closer look at each of these business groups. Starting out with our bulk commodities, revenue for the quarter was up 14% compared to last year, driven by a 4% increase in volume and a 9% increase in average revenue per car, reflecting strong core pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenue. Coal and renewable carloads grew 9% year-over-year, and 17% from the second quarter. Our efforts to switch customers to index-based contracts are supporting domestic coal demand, as a result of higher natural gas prices, coupled with increased coal exports.  Grain and grain products were down 1% compared to last year, and down 9% from the Second Quarter due primarily to lower U.S. grain stocks. However, this was partially offset by our business development efforts and strong demand for bio-fuels. Fertilizer carloads were up 10% year-over-year due to strong agricultural demand and increased export potash shipments. And finally, food and refrigerated volume was flat year-over-year and sequentially from the Second Quarter. Moving on to Industrial. Industrial revenue improved 22% for the quarter, driven by our 14% increase in volume. Average revenue per car also improved 6% driven by higher fuel surcharge, core pricing gains, and positive mix. Energy and specialized shipments were up 16% compared to last year, and up 5% versus the Second Quarter.  The gains were due to an increase in petroleum products as demand recovers from this time last year, and new business wins from Mexico Energy Reform. Volume from Forest Products grew 15% year-over-year, primarily driven by demand for brown paper using corrugated boxes, along with strong housing starts, driving lumber shipments. However, compared to the Second Quarter, volume was down 2% due to the impact of the Lapa fire in Northern California. Industrial chemicals and plastic shipments were up 6% year-over-year due to strengthening demand and business wins as production rate for plastics improved from 2020. Metals and minerals volume was up 21% compared to 2020 and up 3% versus the second quarter, primarily driven by our business development efforts, along with strong steel demand.  As industrial markets recover, coupled with favorable comps for frac sand. Turning now with premium, revenue for the quarter was up 1% as the 9% decrease in volume was more than offset by higher average revenue per car. ARC increased by 11% from higher fuel surcharges and core pricing gains. Automotive volume was down 18% compared to last year and down 4% versus the Second Quarter, semiconductor shortages had an adverse impact to both our finished vehicles and auto parts business segments. Inter-modal volume decreased 6% year-over-year and 8% compared to the second quarter. International volumes continue to face challenges from global supply chain disruption. With regards to domestic, strong demand and new business wins were also hampered by supply chain disruptions. Plus e-commerce business saw tough comps versus last year. Now, looking ahead to the Fourth Quarter of 2021, starting out with our bulk commodities, we're optimistic about grain business due to another strong harvest and grain export demand. Also, grain products will continue to benefit from growth of the bio-fuel markets. Food and refrigerated volumes should be positive with increased consumer demand, post-pandemic restaurant re-openings, and truck penetration growth. Lastly, we expect coal to remain strong for the remainder of the year based on our current natural gas futures, inventory replenishment, as well as export demand. Looking at our industrial markets, we continue to be encouraged by the strength of the forecast for industrial production for the rest of 2021, which will positively impact many bar markets, like metals and florin (ph). The year-over-year comp for our energy markets are favorable. However, we expect narrow spreads will negatively impact crude by rail shipments. But on a positive note, we expect to mitigate the lower crude shipments with strength and other petroleum and LPG products. And lastly, for premiums, we anticipate continued challenges in automotive related to semiconductor shortages for the fourth quarter. In regards to intermodal, limited truck capacity, inventory, restocking, and strength in retail sales will continue to drive intermodal demand in the fourth quarter. However, we expect international volumes to be constrained as ocean carriers have recently taken additional actions to speed up their container returns as challenges in labor, port capacity, warehouses, and in drayage persist. And on the domestic side, opportunities will face continued supply chain challenges with limited hallway capacity and floor chassis turn time. Overall, I'm encouraged by the opportunities in front of us for the rest of 2021. But more importantly, I want to recognize the commercial team as they continue to focus on providing solutions for our customers to win in the marketplace. As we head into 2022, our commercial team is driving growth through new business wins. Most notably, we're taking more trucks off the road in all three of our business groups. And with that, I'll turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance.\nEric Gehringer: Thanks, Kenny. And good morning. I'd like to begin by thanking the entire operating department for their dedication and hard work to manage through the challenges we've faced during the quarter. From wildfires to mudslides and hurricanes, the team demonstrated perseverance to restore our network and deliver strong financial results. In addition, as Kenny just described, the demand picture is turned out differently than we expected at the beginning of the year. Working closely with marketing, the operating team has adjusted transportation plans and added resources into the network for surging demand in coal, metals, lumber, and green.  These actions demonstrate the agility and strength of our franchise. Take a look at our key performance metrics for the quarter on Slide 9, driven by wildfires and weather events during the quarter, our freight car velocity and trip plant compliance metrics deteriorated compared to 2020. Freight car velocity decreased due to increased terminal dwell and higher operating inventory levels, which led to lower trip planned compliance results. Our entire team has been fully engaged on restoring network fluidity and the recovery is progressing. We are seeing improvement in our metrics with reduced operating car inventory and improved freight car velocity. Our reported weekly metrics showed the time required to recover the network from these events. While we made improvements from our freight car velocity, weekly low of 184 in August to 210 miles per day in the last two weeks of September, our goal remains to return freight car velocity towards 220 miles per day. Our intermodal trip plan compliance results improved an August low of 61% to gain 12 points in September to 73%. Our manifest and auto TripLink compliance results improved from 57% in August to 61% in September. We recognize improving TripLink compliance is critical to support our customers and our long-term growth strategy.  We have maintained higher crew and locomotive resources in the short-term to assist in reducing excess car inventories to drive increased fluidity. As Operating car inventory declines, we will quickly adjust resources to current volume levels. Our cooperation and work with partners at the West Coast ports have reduced rail container dwell back to more normal levels. And with the Biden administration's efforts to expand operations at the ports to ease congestion, we stand ready to move more rail containers, provided that points further along the supply chain can handle increased volume. While there's still work to be done, the team is confident in our ability to restore service to the levels our customers expect and deserve. Turning to Slide 6, we continue to make good progress on our efficiency initiatives. However, disruptions during the quarter impacted these results as well. Locomotive productivity declined 8% compared to a year-ago as we deployed additional resources to handle traffic reroutes. Our record third quarter workforce productivity was driven by efficiencies and our engineering, mechanical and management work forces, and offset slightly by increases in train and engine workforce to address our network recovery. We continued our focus on increasing train length, achieving a 4% improvement since third quarter 2020 to approximately 9,360 feet. Now that the bridge has been restored, the team has again, driving productivity through increasing Train Link, as evidenced in our September train linked growth to over 9,500 feet. Turning to slide 11, our ability to grow Train Link has also enabled by the completion of 9 sidings to date in 2021 with an additional 26 under construction or in the final planning stages. These investments will enable a more reliable and efficient service product for future growth. We also produced a record quarterly fuel consumption rate, improving 1% compared to last year.  Through productivity initiatives and technology improvements, we were able to offset most of the inefficiencies stemming from the wildfires. The operating department understands the importance we play in achieving our long-term greenhouse gas emission goals and have more work underway. Our approach is multi-pronged, with the primary emphasis around our locomotive fleet, both looking at alternative energies as well as biofuels. As we drive productivity and manage the various network challenges in 2021, the health and safety of our workforce is paramount. Although our year-to-date employee safety results have not shown improvement in 2020, recent monthly trends provide positive momentum for the team to build upon. Again, our approach is across a number of fronts, including employee engagement, broader deployment of technology, as well as looking externally for best practices. Additionally, we reduced cost of rail equipment incidents during the quarter. We are encouraged by the improvement, but know that we must maintain focus on promoting a safe working environment to reduce employee injuries so everyone goes home safe each day. Safe operations also have a direct impact on our service product, so this work will benefit all stakeholders. Wrapping up on slide 12, as we look to close out 2021, I have the utmost confidence that we will continue to improve safety, increased network fluidity, improve our service product, and drive productivity as we support business growth with our customers. With that, I will turn it over to Jennifer to review our financial performance.\nJennifer Hamann: Thanks, Eric, and good morning. As you heard from Lance, Union Pacific achieved strong third quarter financial results with earnings per share of $2.57, and an operating ratio of 56.3%. As noted in an 8-K last month, we incurred additional expenses this quarter related to wildfires and weather. The full impact of those events, including lost revenue, negatively impacted our operating ratio 50 basis points and earnings per share by $0.05. Rising fuel prices throughout the quarter negatively impacted operating ratio by a 140 basis points.  However, the Year-over-year impact of our fuel surcharge programs added $0.05 to EPS. Setting aside these exogenous issues, UPS core operational performance drove operating ratio improvement of 430 basis points and added $0.56 to EPS. Our performance demonstrates the resiliency and efficiency built into our franchise through PSR, even when operating in less-than-ideal conditions. Looking now at our third quarter income statement on Slide 15, where we're showing the comparisons to both Third Quarter 2020 as well as Third Quarter 2019. The comparison of 2021 to 2019 most clearly illustrates the efficiency we've achieved over the past two years as we generated 9% higher Operating income on 4% less volumes. For third quarter 2021, operating revenue up 13% and operating expense only up 9%.  We generated a third quarter record operating income of $2.4 billion. Net income of $1.7 billion, and earnings per share also were third quarter records. Looking more closely at third quarter revenue, Slide 16 provides a breakdown of our freight revenue. Both year-over-year and sequentially versus the second quarter. Freight revenue totaled $5.2 billion in the third quarter, up 12% compared to 2020 and 1% compared to the second quarter. Looking first at the year-over-year analysis, although volume was flat, the overall demand environment remains strong and supports pricing actions that yield dollars exceeding inflation. On a year-over-year basis, those gains were further supplemented by a positive business mix driving 650 basis points in total improvement.  For Intermodal shipments combined with higher industrial shipments, drove that positive mix. Fuel surcharges increased freight revenues 600 basis points compared to last year as our fuel surcharge programs continue to chase rising fuel prices. Looking at freight revenue sequentially, lower volume versus the Second Quarter, decreased rate revenue 250 basis points highlighted by the factors that Kenny highlighted. Continued core pricing gains and a more positive business mix, increased freight revenue, 175 basis points on a sequential basis, driven by that same combination of higher industrial carloads and lower intermodal shipments.  Finally, rising fuel prices and the resulting uptick in sequential fuel surcharges increased freight revenue, 125 basis points. Now let's move onto Slide 17, which provides a summary of our Third Quarter operating expenses, which increased 9% in total versus 2020. The primary driver of the increase was fuel expense, up 81% as a result of a 74% increase in fuel prices. A small offset to the higher prices was a 1% improvement in our fuel consumption rate. Better efficiency was a product of both our business mix and productivity initiatives, which offset inefficiencies associated with wildfires in the quarter. Looking further at the other expense lines, compensation and benefits expense was up 3% versus 2020. Third Quarter workforce levels were down 1% compared to last year, despite our trained and engine workforce growing 3%. This increase reflects the additional crews needed to navigate the network impact from bridge outages and weather. Management, engineering, and mechanical work forces together decreased 3%. Wage inflation along with higher re-crew and overtime costs associated with our network issues, increased cost per employee 4%, while still a tad elevated, this level of per employee compensation increase is more in line with future expectations. Purchased services and materials expense was flat as higher locomotive and freight car maintenance associated with the larger access fleet was offset by reduced contractor expense. And with automotive shipments forecasted to remain soft for at least the balance of the year. We now expect purchase services and material expense to only be up low-single-digits for full-year versus 2021. Equipment and other flat consistent with volumes. Other expense decreased 10% or $29 million this quarter, driven primarily by lower write-offs of in-progress capital projects in 2021. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, recall that last year we incurred a one-time $278 million non-cash impairment charge in this expense category. Looking now at our efficiency results on Slide 18, operating challenges during the quarter again impacted our productivity, which totaled $45 million. In total for 2021, productivity is at $280 million, led by our Train Link improvements and locomotive productivity offset by roughly $55 million of weather and incident-related headwinds. Our incremental margins in the quarter were very strong, 94% driven by solid pricing gains, positive business mix, as well as continued efficiency. PSR clearly gives us a platform to add volumes to our network in an extremely efficient manner. Turning to slide 19, year-to-date cash from operations increased to $6.5 billion from $6 billion in 2020, a 9% increase. Our cash flow conversion rate was a strong 95% and year-to-date free cash flow increased $728 million or 38% driven by higher net income and lighter year-to-date capital spend compared to last year.  Supported by our strong cash generation and cash balances, we've returned $7.9 billion to shareholders year-to-date through dividends and share repurchases. Actions taken during the year include, increasing our industry-leading dividend by 10% in May and repurchasing 27.5 million shares totaling $5.9 billion. We finished the Third Quarter with a comparable adjusted debt-to - EBITDA ratio of 2.8 times, which is on par with Second Quarter. We remain committed to returning great value to our owners and are demonstrating that again this year. Wrapping things up on slide 20, as you heard from Kenny, the overall economic environment remains positive and provides confidence for the future growth of our Company. Bulk is driven by strong gear -- grain volumes and coal continue to exceed expectations.  Industrial volumes remain consistent and strong across many sectors like forest products, metals, and plastics. So we are bullish on several fronts. But as you are also well aware, headwinds in autos and intermodal persists. Global supply chain disruptions, semiconductor shortages, and the additional pressure with international intermodal volumes that Kenny just described, continued to constrain our premium volumes. So balancing these variables, and with just over two months left in the year, we now expect volume to be up closer to 5% for full year 2021. We are also adjusting our productivity guidance for the year down to $350 million as the weather impact and related network challenges impede the progress, we expect to make with our efficiency in 2021.  To put that in context, however, at the end of this year, we will have generated almost $1.8 billion of productivity since our implementation of PSR in late 2018, so great work overall by the team. And more importantly, this lower cost structure and improved service product provides Union Pacific the foundation for future growth and strong incremental margins. Lower expectations for volume and productivity are headwinds to our 2021 operating goal. In addition, we've seen fuel prices continue to rise in pressure margins. In fact, over the last 30 days, barrel prices have increased around $10 with spot diesel prices up over $0.25 per gallon. Offsetting some of this margin pressure is a positive business mix and strong pricing environment. So all-in, we now expect our full-year operating ratio improvement to be in the neighborhood of a 175 basis points.  While not quite to the high end of the guidance range we established back in January, we view that level of improvement as another great milestone on our journey to 55.x operating ratio in 2022, especially in light of the unexpected headwinds we've had to overcome to get here. Wrapping it up, it was a tough quarter operationally, yet we made great strides to strengthen our franchise and achieved solid results. In fact, we stand poised to finish 2021 as Union Pacific s most profitable year ever. That achievement would not be possible without our tremendous employees who are on the frontline every day serving our customers safely and efficiently while producing these record results. My thanks go out to team UP. So with that, I'll turn it back to Lance.\nLance Fritz : Thank you, Jennifer. One area of continued focus by the team, as you've heard us talk about this morning, is safety. While our Safety metrics lagged 2020, there are some positive signs including strong September results that indicate we're taking the right actions to produce desired long-term results. The entire team understands that safety is foundational to everything we do at Union Pacific. Our service product has shown improvement over the past 60 days, but there's still work to be done.  With increasing volumes related to the grain harvest and intermodal peak season approaching, we understand the importance of delivering for our customers. The opportunity to provide freight solutions to our customers is strong and gives us confidence that our long-term goals for growth remain intact. And as you heard from Kenny, even with macroeconomic headwinds, we're winning with our customers. While supply chain disruptions will likely persist into next year, we see our third quarter and year-to-date results as proof of our team's ability to perform in the face of significant challenges. As headwinds turn to tailwinds, we're well-positioned to build off our success and deliver even more value to our stakeholders. So with that, let's open up the line for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. In the interest of time so that we can accommodate as many analysts as possible, we would ask everyone to please limit themselves to one question. Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please, proceed with your question.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks, morning guys. So Jennifer, you've been highlighting strong incremental margins year-to-date, I guess I'm wondering why that doesn't continue in the Fourth Quarter if the guidance implies a flattish OR despite some really good pricing, anything 4Q, had some onetime bonuses a year ago. So maybe just some thoughts on why the incremental aren't better in Fourth Quarter? And does this in any way change the outlook on the 55 OR for 2022?\nJennifer Hamann: Well, let me start with that second part Scott, because it in no way changes how we're looking at 2022. We absolutely believe we will still achieve those targets in 2022, consistent with what we talked about in our May Analyst Meeting. In terms of some of the pressures year-over-year. I mean, it really is a lot driven by fuel. The cost per gallon and if I'm looking at it year-over-year is going to be up anywhere from call it 75 to 80%.  And that's just very tough to overcome, especially with flat volumes, because that's essentially how we're looking at things and you think about our volume guidance in the 5% for full year. So while we're still expecting to be efficient, as we're continuing to resource in the network fluidity that's going to have some pressure on that. And that's what's being reflected in the guidance that we provided there.\nScott Group: And just on that's a pressure to the operating ratio, but not necessarily earnings pressure?\nJennifer Hamann: Operating ratio pressure, yes. Got it. Thank you.\nScott Group: Alright. Thank you.\nLance Fritz : Alright. Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America, please proceed with your question.\nKen Hoexter: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Maybe just a little bit of following up, but Kenny, as you think about that deceleration of 5% growth from 7, which I guess Jen said it's flat, seems like it's 1% growth and maybe a little acceleration in the Fourth Quarter, you maybe talk about puts and takes on that, and more specifically, the Port of L.A. noted, they're seeing some significant rail improvement. Can you talk about if you're able to move the freight, how's the supply chain? Can you get the boxes inland and is there anything improving inland that the warehouses or chassis shortages, especially as we are at peak or moving past peak, are you seeing any improvement in the fluidity there? Thanks.\nLance Fritz : All right that's a few questions, a little bit hard. And Eric, you'll help me out a little bit here. So first of all, just walking on our business if you look at it. We expect our coal business to have the same run rates that they have this quarter. You see where the future numbers are. We'll see where that takes us into the first part of 2022. On the grain side, we'd be really happy if we can get to a flattish year-over-year look, we'll see how that plays out. Maybe we get there, if we don't get there, maybe we're up a point or so off. Looking at our Industrial business forward is a lot of opportunities in front of us. I've been really excited about the fact that the commercial team there has been able to win business.  We're seeing it show up on the [indiscernible] on side, as the production rates are going up from earlier in the year. On the metal side also, lot of strong wins, business development wins that we're seeing. It's also showing up. So we're really creating a lot of good things to move in our way. On the forest side, same thing wins from truck -- from paper, wins from truck on the lumber side. We'll see how that plays out. That should really be a positive area for us. But then the wildcard here is on the premium side. You look at auto, I'd tell you, I've forecast this thing wrong in a couple of quarters, I think that -- I believe that we're certainly in the trough. I don't see it really improving in the quarter. We'll see what happens in the next year, maybe some gradual improvement.  And then on the international -- intermodal side, Eric and his team have done a great job of really reacting and engaging the terminals at the port and the port. I'm really proud of the fact that we got a product that we've created and Inland Empire can actually capture some of that business that might spill over. You know about the products that we've created up in the 20 cities and we've got our grain facility coming on at G4 to make it just more attractive for customers that really come in and move on the international side and on the domestic side, I'd expect the same run rate that we're seeing today. And we're expecting a tougher comp on our e-commerce businesses we'll have more of a normal Christmas.\nEric Gehringer: And Ken, regarding the ports themselves and thinking about our system fluidity, first, it's important that we applaud the same efforts that you did with the effort on both of the ports to move to a 24 by 7 operations. As you think about our fluidity and how we support the middle part and the entire supply chain. You're really thinking about four specific things. The first one is Cardwell, we're back in our 23-to-25-hour historical average, which is 24% better than our peak in July. So we have cars, they're available. From a velocity perspective, how fluid are we from getting point A to point B? We're at 488 miles per day yesterday, which is the best we've been in 9 months. So we have the fluidity to move from A to B.  Where you still see the constraints is in our box slot, we see currently a 40% increase in that dwell versus earlier this year. And then, also on the chassis street time, which is just a measure of how long is a chassis from the time it leaves, to the time it comes back to us. And that's up 20%. So what's critically important as we've identified before, we can take the volume, we can handle the volume efficiently. we need the back end of the supply chain with warehouse capacity, warehouse labor, dray capacity and dray labor to be there to answer that call. We're not doing that, and putting that entirely on the back-end though, we've taken actions even in the last 6 months.  You've heard me talk before about, we know, we've opened G3. We've gone deeper. We've got 5,000 cars now strategically placed. We've extended hours and selected ramps. Most notably, our recent extension to 24-hours in ICTF in L.A. We've also expanded hours for road ability, which is. Matter of expanding hours for the inspection and maintenance of chassis, were being partners with our customers to ensure that anything they can do to continue to improve supply chain fluidity were supported.\nKen Hoexter: Great. Thanks, Kenny and Eric. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC, please proceed with your question.\nWalter Spracklin: Thanks very much. I guess this question is for Lance and it's a little bit conceptual and it's regarding the supply chain and supply chain issues and whether they are structural or temporary. Effectively, if this is temporary, and we work through the next quarter or two, we don't need to worry about anything, but it seems a little bit more structural. You add in the -- while wildfires can be one-offs, they do recur and can aggravate the supply chain situation.  My question is, if they are structural, Lance, do you look at anything that you can do that, outside of what you're doing for your Company and the things that you can control? There are a lot of aspects with the supply train you can't and you're starting to see your competitors dip into other aspects of non-rail operations. Is this something that even if indeed it is structural and you want to have more handle and the ability to bring other operations in line with your rail operation, could you start looking at acquisitions that are outside of your core rail assets?\nLance Fritz : That's a great question, Walter. Let start with structural or temporary. I'm still of the belief that most of what we see is temporary, but that doesn't mean the fundamental basis for your question isn't still appropriate, right? So if we just focus in on the international intermodal supply chain, let's use that as a marker. From a temporary perspective, clearly, COVID and the impacts on labor from many different directions related to the COVID pandemic and reaction to the pandemic over the last 18 months has impacted the labor ability to fill jobs either on the back-end warehouse dray, over in the origin, shutting down factories, ports. And I don't think that lasts forever, right? That certainly strikes me as something that we, the U.S. and the world are going to get our arms around either through mass vaccination, therapeutics, combination of both. So I think ultimately, the way the supply chain is disrupted right now doesn't last.  That doesn't mean that we shouldn't continue to keep our eyes open on opportunities to basically be better for customers. Step one in that, has a lot to do with transparency and visibility in the existing supply chain across partners. We're working very hard in that space with each of the supply chain partners that we have. whether it's a technology platform that we can all use to see everybody's KPIs and current status, or something more.  And to your point, from an inorganic growth opportunity perspective, there are probably opportunities in there. And we have talked about that being a juice and augment to our fundamental growth for the railroad and bringing more cars onto the railroad. So I think there are opportunities, they are Walter and we've got our eyes wide open and are looking for them, as we continue to work on the overall supply chain.\nWalter Spracklin: Really helpful perspective. Thanks, Lance.\nLance Fritz : Yep, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens, please proceed with your question.\nJustin Long: Thanks, and good morning. I guess, building on that last question with the CP KCS merger moving forward, I wanted to get your updated thoughts on how this could impact your business. Could you talk about the risks that this deal could pose to either your business or Fairmex's business, given your ownership stake there and how you could potentially mitigate some of those risks?\nLance Fritz : Yeah. Great question, Justin. Thank you. So we've been crystal-clear all along that there are a number of concerns we have in terms of maintaining and enhancing competition with this proposed merger. The primary one is making sure that our customers continue to have good commercial access with businesses in Mexico. Today, we appreciate and enjoy about two-thirds or more of all the cross-border rail traffic to and from Mexico. The reason that is, we have the best franchise to both act as an origination for business in Mexico and act as a marketplace for businesses and Mexico. We just want. And to make sure that in the combination of the CP and the KCS, our customers aren't locked out from that access, so we are active in the process right now, to make sure that that concern is known and that it gets addressed in some kind of remedy. I think there are bonafide risks to our business to and from Mexico to maybe the FXE's business. But I think we've got a pretty good beat on them. We understand them and we're actively already working to address them.\nJustin Long: Okay, thanks. I appreciate the time.\nLance Fritz : Yeah. Thank you, Justin.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to get your perspective on what innings you think we're in with respect to the pricing opportunity. I think that's an appropriate question given we're baseball playoff season. But I really asked that question because, we saw a nice sequential uplift in intermodal and coal yields. But everything else I would say was a bit muted. I know there's mix within mix that can impact that, but maybe just as a summary, just talk about what inning you think we're in, where you think the biggest opportunities are to see yield improvements from where we are today.  And then just intermodal and coal just took a big step up, is that sustainable in 4Q and as you look at in 2022? Thank you.\nLance Fritz : Kenny, you want to take that?\nKenny Rocker : Yeah. Thanks, Amit, for that question. First, I'll start off by saying that I feel much better about where we are today in terms of our ability to price the product and even earlier in this year, we're looking at the Fourth Quarter. We're going to start bid season here with a small amount of a bid out there, call it 10-15% on a lot of our Intermodal business. Clearly on a lot of our carload business. We're stepping into that. I's a strong environment for us. It's a favorable environment for us. We're going to price to the marketplace. We're in the tight truck capacity. Not just on the Intermodal side, we also see it on the carload side. So we'll have a lot more clarity on it, but I will tell you right now, as I sit here today, it's a favorable environment for us to be pricing in.\nAmit Mehrotra: So Kenny, you're not going to fight on the inning questions in terms of giving us a number?\nKenny Rocker : Well, I'm a college football fan, first of all. But the bottom line is that, hey, look, this is -- it's better than I've seen it in a while. I haven't seen it this strong since the last part of '18. We feel good about the products that we have out there. I've talked about all the new products with Inland Empire in Twin Cities and the network that we have and what Eric is doing to improve the service that you're seeing. It's a favorable environment for us and we feel good about our ability to price into it.\nAmit Mehrotra: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you very much. Appreciate the time.\nLance Fritz : And thank you, Amit.\nOperator: And our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup, please proceed with your question.\nChris Wetherbee : Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Maybe I can ask a pricing question would be a little bit differently or come at it from a bit of a different perspective You just mentioned, sir not -- if this is probably as good as you've seen since the tail end of 2018, I guess that was really kind of what I was interested if maybe you could put into perspective what we're seeing now from a pricing opportunity to maybe what we saw in 2018. Or maybe going back to 2014 when we had the big uplifts in the pricing dynamic, particularly coming off the back of a very strong truckload market. So do you think that what we're seeing now is sort of commensurate to what we saw back in those other periods? Could this potentially be a little bit better, just given what we're seeing from a supply chain perspective? Any perspective is on -- on that relative to history might be really helpful for us.\nKenny Rocker : Yeah, you know, it's totally different reasons. I mean, 2018 was -- the supply chain challenges weren't as holds up as they are today. There are still many things that -- that come into play when you look at what's on the water, what's at the port, street well, and some of the chassis turns. This is a little bit different. In terms of the price and opportunity, I'd say it's still there. I still, again, pretty strong about the opportunities that we have. We get the test awarded here like I mentioned. In the fourth quarter, we've got some large pieces of business that are coming on. We'll see how it plays out, but we're pretty optimistic about what's in front of us.\nChris Wetherbee : That's helpful. I appreciate the time guys. Thank you.\nLance Fritz : Yeah. Thank you, Chris.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen, please, proceed with your question.\nJason Seidl : Thank you, Operator. And good morning, everyone. I wanted to focus a little bit more on the supply chain disruptions as you seem to be one of the main carriers impacted, given your exposure to L.A. and Long Beach. Could you tell us what do you think are the most recent plan by the administration to sort of get through this backlog. I think there's something like $22 billion worth of freight sitting off the shores. And then also, once we do get through that, do you think there could be a lull of freight for short period of time? Thank you.\nLance Fritz : Well, yeah, those are great questions, Jason. So the way we think about recovery of current supply chain from my perspective, it really fundamentally boils down to putting people in jobs in order to increase the capacity for handling throughput. And that's both dray drivers, whether you're in the L.A. basin or out in the destination markets and certainly in warehousing and distribution center labor. There might be an opportunity with port labor in terms of being able to maximize throughput through the port, and I know they are talking about that. And so I believe the Biden administration has identified basically increasing the throughput capability and the capacity capability, and understands the need to help put labor that's available into those jobs and make more labor available for the jobs.  Now, in terms of -- once the current supply chain is fixed -- there's some really good-looking markers that tell us the economy is in pretty strong place. And maybe we'll stay there for a while. There's a lot of cash on deposit accounts that people are sitting on. And that is dry powder yet to be deployed in spending. As long as consumers continue to spend on things, That's really good for the goods economy, which of course is the part of the economy that we participate in. And there's also generally -- consumers are generally optimistic.  They're fragile because of the impacts that the COVID pandemic have had on all of us. But they're generally pretty optimistic. And we just need to see, I think, the COVID pandemic get under control and get continued signs of normalcy. And I think consumers will spend that money and the low inventory to sales ratio is going to drive a need for continued stocking. So I feel pretty good about it, certainly as we head into 2022, it looks like a strong environment.\nJason Seidl : Lance, I appreciate the color and the believing my kids are trying to support the economy the best they can in spending my money.\nLance Fritz : Keep it up.\nJason Seidl : I wanted to just follow-up. You talked about labor shortages between dray warehouses and ports. I mean, if you had to rank them, what order would you put them, in terms of what's the biggest problem?\nLance Fritz : Yes. Jason, by far, if I could - if we could snap our fingers on the back-end, we would love to see more dray and warehouse distribution capacity. That's the first thing that we would love to see. I think that would fundamentally change street time for chassis and boxes.\nJason Seidl : Fantastic. Appreciate the time as always.\nLance Fritz : Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nCherilyn Radbourne: Thanks very much. And good morning. Kenny, I think this is for you. At the beginning you mentioned moving coal customers to index-based contracts. And I was just hoping you could elaborate a little bit more on how that creates a win-win for Union Pacific and customers.\nKenny Rocker : Yeah, it really just keeps them in the market. It keeps them competitive. Especially, when you have natural gas prices as high as they are. It puts them in the money and we have a really strong service product to support it. We feel good about where that is in the fourth quarter. Probably feel good about where it is in the first quarter and we need to reassess it on a quarterly basis.\nCherilyn Radbourne: Maybe just as a quick follow-up. Does that imply that revenue per unit will follow global benchmark prices in some way. Is that how we should think about it?\nKenny Rocker : I think that's a safe bet to think that way.\nLance Fritz : To a degree, right?\nCherilyn Radbourne: Thank you.\nLance Fritz : There's only - Cherilyn to a degree, right. Because there's only a portion of the book of business that's priced that way, but that portion is definitely going to follow that.\nCherilyn Radbourne: Fair enough. Thank you.\nLance Fritz : Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays, please proceed with your question.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good morning, everyone. And thank you for taking my question. Kenny, you spoke about some business development efforts in your prepared remarks, I think on the AG side Industrial, maybe even Mexico Energy. Can you speak more to that? And I mean, I know you have a pandemic comp this year, but as you look into 2022 and beyond, these the types of things are giving you confidence in that +3% volume outlook long term?\nKenny Rocker : Yes, absolutely. I mean, we teamed up at Investor Day, how we thought about the bio-fuel market. One of the things that I'm proud of that vaulting for it, that they develop that market. I mean, you look at the Midwest and some of these central states, we've got a unique opportunity where we originate that business. And then we have another unique opportunity in some cases where we might be able to move some of that product to the end market. So we're going out from a business development standpoint and just developing that business.  As you look at our industrial side, same thing too. If you look at Mexico Energy Reform, team has just done a fabulous job of just walking down that portfolio and growing that business. We have clear line of sight to the players that can get in those markets, and we're helping them grow. On the premium side, We've got [indiscernible] to upcoming in January 1st and we're fired up about it. There are some other areas again, that we have just gone out and created those markets, and so we're excited about it. We do feel -- I'm bullish. We feel very strong going into next year.\nLance Fritz : Brandon, I want to brag on not just Kenny and the commercial team, but the cooperation between Kenny and the operating team and all the other internal support mechanisms that make that business development efforts happen. They're going after business in so many different ways, whether it's campaigns to fill out, shorter trains on the network or to attack a particular marketplace that looks like it's growing. And we want to be a bigger part of it. Or where there's customers that have a real problem with their cost structure and we know bringing some of that business onto the rail will enhance their ability to compete in their marketplace. All of the above is generating business development. It's happening mostly in singles and doubles. But I'll take lots of singles and doubles in a team that's oriented towards making that happen.\nJennifer Hamann: Well, we saw that show up in the industrial space this quarter, talking about being able to really capitalize and jump in where we saw some hot markets. Kenny and the team did it and then Eric and team moved it.\nLance Fritz : Yeah.\nBrandon Oglenski: All right, guys. Thank you.\nLance Fritz : Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan, please, proceed with your question.\nBrian Ossenbeck : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to ask Eric about the operations side and maybe about steps getting productivity and service consistency back on track. And what's still sounds like it's going to be a pretty volatile volume in potentially operating environment. So train lengths were down for the first time that we can really find on record, but they were improving in September.  So maybe you can touch on that in terms of how you can maintain that momentum, even if volumes are flat. And then, just if you can also touch on what else is in your control, the sea rate on fuels, obviously moving in the right direction. Is there anything else specifically on the initiative side you're looking at on labor as well? Thank you.\nEric Gehringer: Sure. It's a great question, Brian. So I'll start in the beginning there. To your point, coming out of the recovery, so the actual events that started the recovery. Yes, service performance, our velocity, and then looking at them now, strong moves in the right direction. As you properly said, we're not to where we need to be. As I look at that over the fourth quarter, our biggest opportunities are down in our Southern and specifically the Southeast region of our system. The teams absolutely focused on ensuring that we can continue to get those terminals operating at a historical dwell level or better.  And that's the focus right now. As we increase velocity, you see a direct correlation to our improvement in service and I expect that out of the team. Now, as far as the broader productivity, you hit on the fuel efficiency, and I want to take a minute to recognize the team on that and stress that because our Third Quarter best-ever record in a 1% improvement against a quarter that was dramatically challenging in a lot of different ways, specifically in how many trains we had to reroute, that's a massive accomplishment. But as you look at fuel efficiency, much like the rest of our pipelines, there's strong initiatives in each one of those.  So I think about, we still have the opportunity to modernize another 100 locomotives next year as part of our plan, that's on top of the 100 we're modernizing this year. And those modernizations will get locomotives that can be operating as DPU units, which provide fuel conservation as we can run more of those. As we think about EMS, I told you earlier in the year, we're going to install 800 units. We're installing 800 units this year and we'll continue with that investment next year. So I could continue to go on and on. The point is the pipelines are full. It has been a challenging quarter. There's nothing that stands in front of us to get back on track in Q4.\nLance Fritz : Well, and Brian didn't ask it specifically. But you've got a path towards 10,000-foot average train length.\nEric Gehringer: We with our September performance for the 9,500, we are absolutely on that path. And with the construction of our [indiscernible] that I mentioned, nine being already completed, 26 in the pipeline. We absolutely have that passive.\nJennifer Hamann: And that's impacted by this modal supply chain issues.\nEric Gehringer: For sure.\nBrian Ossenbeck : Right. Just a follow-up really quick, I was going to ask on that if the Train Link impact in the quarter really was from the bridge or would you see more volatility on that if the Intermodal Supply Chain doesn't recover as expected, or at least stabilize a bit?\nEric Gehringer: Let's start with the bridge. So if you think about when the bridge went out, what that really did was it severed an artery where we were able to run trains longer than 8,300 feet. When we had to reroute the trains from Northern California over to Salt Lake and back up to Portland, we're restricted to that 8300 feet for a number of different reasons. So the fall-off and Train Link prior to September was absolutely related to the bridge outage. Now, to your point, as we see intermodal volumes grow, that's always a huge lever for us to grow Train Link, especially across our sunset corridor up to Chicago.\nBrian Ossenbeck : All right, great. Thank you for all the color I appreciate it.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nJon Chappell: Good morning. Eric, sticking with you. Maybe a bit of a quantitative follow-up to the last question and answers, the 150 million in reduced productivity expectations for this year is completely understandable given everything you've just laid out, whether it's macro or the bridge and the wildfires. Is that lost productivity though from the network as you think about a multiyear plan, or can you make that up at some point next year incrementally to what you were already budgeting for '22 productivity gains?\nEric Gehringer: Yes, Jon, that's an exceptionally good question and I want to be very clear. That is not lost and it's expected that we make that up in next year.\nJon Chappell: Okay. Great, and can it be within a six-month period or is it spread over the course of the year?\nEric Gehringer: Now we're getting into those ending questions again. Jon, rest assured, the entire team understands we have to get that back. As you would imagine, as we think through the 2022 and what is going to present. Those plans are still under works, but it's all with an eye towards capturing back that $150 million.\nJon Chappell: Okay. Great. Thanks, Eric.\nEric Gehringer: Yup. Thank you, Jon.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS, please proceed with your question.\nTom Wadewitz: Yes. Good morning. I know you've had quite a few questions on capacity. But I guess wanted to get your thoughts on 2022 and how capacity and volume -- how we might think of that? I think there's positive thesis out there on rail that says, we've seen temporary weakness in volume, but you look to 2022 and there's pretty good chance volume improves. And I think that is probably linked to capacity coming online. Lance, do you think that's a reasonable view to have that UNP volume growth can accelerate nicely in 2022. And do you think you have good visibility to that capacity supporting that growth?\nLance Fritz : Tom, thanks for the question. So absolutely it's a reasonable thesis to say we are going to grow in 2022. Our commitments that we made at Investor Day is over the three-year period, we're going to grow better than industrial production. And we believe that we're going to be able to do that. There is a couple of things that I'll point to. We've got Knight-Swift coming on board, that will be a growth engine, we've got the headwinds in the automotive industry and the overall supply chain mostly impacting the Intermodal business.  In my viewpoint, it's very unlikely that carries all the way through next year, that there is capacity coming on for semiconductor manufacturing. The supply chain is going to have enough capacity to handle the throughput necessary. And so I think those get remedied and that's a growth engine. And then Kenny 's team, as we just outlined in bulk, industrial and in the premium side on business development, keep adding opportunity into the bucket, so it's absolutely a decent thesis to say we are growing and we're growing better than industrial production next year. Now, the other side of that is, capacity. We've got plenty of capacity. Our fixed capacity, our railroad can definitely handle the growth. as we go into next year. And we're poised to add the fungible resources that the employees necessary to handle it. Not on a one-for-one basis because we are generating productivity. but I see no issue with the thesis you just laid out.\nTom Wadewitz: Can you talk a little bit about the specific resources you're adding? Are you adding more people at intermodal terminals, are you adding more chassis, are there areas you need to add more cars to support that in '22?\nLance Fritz : There are always rifle shots from a capital spending perspective, Tom that we have to take care of. Eric identified some in terms of siding extensions. We've got some capacity spending that's going on in our new intermodal ramps, whether it's the Inland Empire or up in the Twin Cities. But I consider those rifle shots. Those are very specific little pieces of the network that we'll have a very positive generating ROI to them. In terms of manpower, resources, employees, we've got needs here and there.  And again, those tend to be pockets and they're driven by growth or they're driven by normal attrition. And we're right now in the process of hiring in a few areas around the network. We've got a training pipeline that's both representative of people we've hired and people we've called back from furlough. But I don't consider those numbers anything kind of worth commenting other than normal course of business.\nTom Wadewitz: Okay, great. Thank you for the time.\nLance Fritz : Thanks, Tom.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Vernon : Thanks, operator and good morning, guys. So Lance in getting I will kind of want to present the bear case and some of the arguments you are putting out there, right? I mean, we're in the tightest truck market, we've been in in sort of ever, right? This is a done conference game for Alabama as opposed to a college football playoff game, if you will. Now, and we're still seeing in modal volume down 6%. So when I get asked that question, how would you respond to the fact that in this really super tight market where demand for intermodal should be off the charts, you're not growing. So what's going to change between now and the next few years that will help you grow?\nLance Fritz : Absolutely. David, you just outlined the connection. Our volume in intermodal is down because of tight dray market. We don't have enough dray capacity to support the overall supply chain on the intermodal product. That is going to be remedied, right?\nLance Fritz : Supply and demand in our market economy gets remedied. Truck driver wages are going up, dray wages are going up. It's all looking good. So I feel very good about overcoming the bear case that you just outlined because they're intimately connected.\nDavid Vernon : First of all, I'm a Georgia fan and not Alabama.\nLance Fritz : I took a shot.\nKenny Rocker : First of all, yeah. We've got an investment here that's coming on in the first half of the year of chassis. We feel good about that. We've got ample container -- work on improve our competitiveness, here in the first half of the year. We've got GPS that we're investing in. I can't say enough about how much capacity opportunities are there in an Inland Empire. And we're working very closely what Eric's team on that. And we still have room to grow in the 2030. So yeah, there are some macroeconomic and supply chain challenges out there, but what you're hearing me say, and what you're hearing Lance say, is that boy as a team, we're really going after it and being very deliberate and specific about how to grow the business.\nDavid Vernon : Okay. And just as a quick follow-up, is it right to think that the on-boarding of that night business will be easier because it's coming with the drayage and the chassis is and the stuff that Nate's going to bring along with it.\nKenny Rocker : We don't see any issue bringing on that business.\nLance Fritz : Yeah. We are committed. We're well-planned. There's a detailed executing plan already in place. And we're really looking forward to having them on as a partner there. They're running an outstanding business. They'll be a great partner to have.\nDavid Vernon : All right. Thanks a lot for the time guys.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley, please proceed with your question.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks, Miami One. If I can discuss being on the same team, Kenny, you highlighted in your prepared remarks some of the challenges forecasting the auto as business in the last few months. At the risk of asking you to judge somebody else's crystal ball, we have heard from some of the industry kind of data providers that their outlook for auto production recovery through 2022 is really slow. So is there a risk that an auto production is definitely going to ramp next year, but the ramp is not nearly as much as people think and be -- when the production does ramp, is there a risk that some of those finished products get put on truck to try and expedite their [indiscernible] dealers? Or are you quite fin about maintaining share in the RSS?\nKenny Rocker : That's interesting question. It really depends on what you believe and what you've heard us say is that we believe the run rates will continue to move in the fourth quarter. And then it'll be up low, gradual ramp up in the first half by late spring, summer. We can get to where the forecast [indiscernible]. That be an excellent position for us. We expect to really have a strong product that is competitive with truck, but we don't see where we would lose any of that business. And we also would anticipate that some of the auto part business will show up a little bit before the finished vehicles product.\nRavi Shanker: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you.\nLance Fritz : Thank you, Ravi.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research, please proceed with your question.\nJeff Kauffman: Thank you very much and congratulations in a tough quarter. Kenny, I'm going to stick with the football analogies here. When I go out, and I talk to shippers, they all tell me we'd love to use a lot more Intermodal than we're able to right now. In fact, if we had our druthers, we'd put another five or 6% of our spend and Intermodal. How many points are we'll leave it on the Board due to these turnovers, so to speak, from the environment? And if you were able to get that great capacity and run the network the way you'd like to, what do you think Intermodal would look like now?\nKenny Rocker : That's also an interesting question. What I'll tell you what we're doing is going out and inserting solutions where we can. So Eric and his team has done a really good job with keeping in contact with the terminals from a technology side, we've been surrogate APIs at the Port from an investment perspective. We're going out and really owning our own destiny in terms of expansion. We're creating solutions for our customers. Clearly, Eric talked about what we've done in our G3 facility.  We also opened up temporarily another facility down in the Houston area our loops subsidiary is going out and working with the BCO, expedite drayage. We're pulling everything we can in our control to not just accept what the supply chain challenges are out there. We're trying to own it. And so you've heard about the investments that we're making on the chassis and GPS side. So what you're hearing from me is we're doing everything we can to control our destiny, to maximize.\nLance Fritz : Kenny, another way to answer Jeff's question, Jeff, if you recall when we came into the year, we had a guidance that said 4 to 6% growth. And coming out of the second quarter, the lay of the land look ed pretty strong and we up that to 7%. And now because in part of the Intermodal Supply chain disruptions, along with the continued issues on semiconductors for automotive, we've dropped that back to 5%. So right there you see 2% points of growth on the whole business that is connected to supply chains being screwed up.\nJeff Kauffman: Could I go a little further out on that, though. I guess what I'm reaching for here is, I understand the current environment. But you're doing about, let's call it $4.5 billion in intermodal revenue. We got a truck industry that's capacity constrained. We got prices going through the roofs. We got a lot of people that want to use intermodal but just can't right now, for a variety of reasons or not as much as they want to right now. If these factors were to mitigate over the next two years. Three years, what do you think that Intermodal business could look like? I mean, do your customers say, geez, we'd love to give you another 5% of our transportation budget on intermodal it's the network can handle it. I mean, what kind of conversations you have with folk\u2019s kind of beyond the short-term fix?\nLance Fritz : Hey, Jeff, this is Lance, your thesis is spot on. Our customers tell us that they'd love to use more intermodal product. And that's a great place to be. We're not going to try to guess exactly what that looks like. We'll build next year's budget. We've got a long-range plan we'll continue to tweak and build on. But your thesis is spot on. There are tons of opportunity out there.\nJeff Kauffman: Okay. Thank you very much and congratulations.\nLance Fritz : Yeah. Thank you.\nOperator: Our final question is from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJordan Alliger: Hi, just a quick question on coal. I know the domestic opportunity should be good for EP with gas prices, but I think Kenny, you mentioned export too. I didn't think that was as big or important part of your franchise, I'm curious how much of an opportunity export can be? Thanks.\nKenny Rocker : Every carload matters and we've been able to grow our export business. But to your point, it's a smaller part of our overall portfolio.\nJordan Alliger: But there is opportunity set there and in this environment?\nKenny Rocker : Absolutely. We've seen a handful of wins that we're really excited about.\nLance Fritz : Putting a little bow on that Jordan, you know the eastern railroads, and their export business is substantial and big and our export business doesn't really look anything like that.\nJordan Alliger: Got it. Thank you.\nLance Fritz : Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Lance Fritz for closing comments.\nA - Lance Fritz : Well, thank you, Rob. And thank you all for being engaged with us this morning and your questions. We really appreciate getting into those discussions. We look forward to talking with you again in January when we discuss our fourth quarter and full-year results. And until then, I wish you all a very good health. Thank you. Take care.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Eric Gehringer",
            "content": "Thanks, Kenny. And good morning. I'd like to begin by thanking the entire operating department for their dedication and hard work to manage through the challenges we've faced during the quarter. From wildfires to mudslides and hurricanes, the team demonstrated perseverance to restore our network and deliver strong financial results. In addition, as Kenny just described, the demand picture is turned out differently than we expected at the beginning of the year. Working closely with marketing, the operating team has adjusted transportation plans and added resources into the network for surging demand in coal, metals, lumber, and green.  These actions demonstrate the agility and strength of our franchise. Take a look at our key performance metrics for the quarter on Slide 9, driven by wildfires and weather events during the quarter, our freight car velocity and trip plant compliance metrics deteriorated compared to 2020. Freight car velocity decreased due to increased terminal dwell and higher operating inventory levels, which led to lower trip planned compliance results. Our entire team has been fully engaged on restoring network fluidity and the recovery is progressing. We are seeing improvement in our metrics with reduced operating car inventory and improved freight car velocity. Our reported weekly metrics showed the time required to recover the network from these events. While we made improvements from our freight car velocity, weekly low of 184 in August to 210 miles per day in the last two weeks of September, our goal remains to return freight car velocity towards 220 miles per day. Our intermodal trip plan compliance results improved an August low of 61% to gain 12 points in September to 73%. Our manifest and auto TripLink compliance results improved from 57% in August to 61% in September. We recognize improving TripLink compliance is critical to support our customers and our long-term growth strategy.  We have maintained higher crew and locomotive resources in the short-term to assist in reducing excess car inventories to drive increased fluidity. As Operating car inventory declines, we will quickly adjust resources to current volume levels. Our cooperation and work with partners at the West Coast ports have reduced rail container dwell back to more normal levels. And with the Biden administration's efforts to expand operations at the ports to ease congestion, we stand ready to move more rail containers, provided that points further along the supply chain can handle increased volume. While there's still work to be done, the team is confident in our ability to restore service to the levels our customers expect and deserve. Turning to Slide 6, we continue to make good progress on our efficiency initiatives. However, disruptions during the quarter impacted these results as well. Locomotive productivity declined 8% compared to a year-ago as we deployed additional resources to handle traffic reroutes. Our record third quarter workforce productivity was driven by efficiencies and our engineering, mechanical and management work forces, and offset slightly by increases in train and engine workforce to address our network recovery. We continued our focus on increasing train length, achieving a 4% improvement since third quarter 2020 to approximately 9,360 feet. Now that the bridge has been restored, the team has again, driving productivity through increasing Train Link, as evidenced in our September train linked growth to over 9,500 feet. Turning to slide 11, our ability to grow Train Link has also enabled by the completion of 9 sidings to date in 2021 with an additional 26 under construction or in the final planning stages. These investments will enable a more reliable and efficient service product for future growth. We also produced a record quarterly fuel consumption rate, improving 1% compared to last year.  Through productivity initiatives and technology improvements, we were able to offset most of the inefficiencies stemming from the wildfires. The operating department understands the importance we play in achieving our long-term greenhouse gas emission goals and have more work underway. Our approach is multi-pronged, with the primary emphasis around our locomotive fleet, both looking at alternative energies as well as biofuels. As we drive productivity and manage the various network challenges in 2021, the health and safety of our workforce is paramount. Although our year-to-date employee safety results have not shown improvement in 2020, recent monthly trends provide positive momentum for the team to build upon. Again, our approach is across a number of fronts, including employee engagement, broader deployment of technology, as well as looking externally for best practices. Additionally, we reduced cost of rail equipment incidents during the quarter. We are encouraged by the improvement, but know that we must maintain focus on promoting a safe working environment to reduce employee injuries so everyone goes home safe each day. Safe operations also have a direct impact on our service product, so this work will benefit all stakeholders. Wrapping up on slide 12, as we look to close out 2021, I have the utmost confidence that we will continue to improve safety, increased network fluidity, improve our service product, and drive productivity as we support business growth with our customers. With that, I will turn it over to Jennifer to review our financial performance. And Ken, regarding the ports themselves and thinking about our system fluidity, first, it's important that we applaud the same efforts that you did with the effort on both of the ports to move to a 24 by 7 operations. As you think about our fluidity and how we support the middle part and the entire supply chain. You're really thinking about four specific things. The first one is Cardwell, we're back in our 23-to-25-hour historical average, which is 24% better than our peak in July. So we have cars, they're available. From a velocity perspective, how fluid are we from getting point A to point B? We're at 488 miles per day yesterday, which is the best we've been in 9 months. So we have the fluidity to move from A to B.  Where you still see the constraints is in our box slot, we see currently a 40% increase in that dwell versus earlier this year. And then, also on the chassis street time, which is just a measure of how long is a chassis from the time it leaves, to the time it comes back to us. And that's up 20%. So what's critically important as we've identified before, we can take the volume, we can handle the volume efficiently. we need the back end of the supply chain with warehouse capacity, warehouse labor, dray capacity and dray labor to be there to answer that call. We're not doing that, and putting that entirely on the back-end though, we've taken actions even in the last 6 months.  You've heard me talk before about, we know, we've opened G3. We've gone deeper. We've got 5,000 cars now strategically placed. We've extended hours and selected ramps. Most notably, our recent extension to 24-hours in ICTF in L.A. We've also expanded hours for road ability, which is. Matter of expanding hours for the inspection and maintenance of chassis, were being partners with our customers to ensure that anything they can do to continue to improve supply chain fluidity were supported. Sure. It's a great question, Brian. So I'll start in the beginning there. To your point, coming out of the recovery, so the actual events that started the recovery. Yes, service performance, our velocity, and then looking at them now, strong moves in the right direction. As you properly said, we're not to where we need to be. As I look at that over the fourth quarter, our biggest opportunities are down in our Southern and specifically the Southeast region of our system. The teams absolutely focused on ensuring that we can continue to get those terminals operating at a historical dwell level or better.  And that's the focus right now. As we increase velocity, you see a direct correlation to our improvement in service and I expect that out of the team. Now, as far as the broader productivity, you hit on the fuel efficiency, and I want to take a minute to recognize the team on that and stress that because our Third Quarter best-ever record in a 1% improvement against a quarter that was dramatically challenging in a lot of different ways, specifically in how many trains we had to reroute, that's a massive accomplishment. But as you look at fuel efficiency, much like the rest of our pipelines, there's strong initiatives in each one of those.  So I think about, we still have the opportunity to modernize another 100 locomotives next year as part of our plan, that's on top of the 100 we're modernizing this year. And those modernizations will get locomotives that can be operating as DPU units, which provide fuel conservation as we can run more of those. As we think about EMS, I told you earlier in the year, we're going to install 800 units. We're installing 800 units this year and we'll continue with that investment next year. So I could continue to go on and on. The point is the pipelines are full. It has been a challenging quarter. There's nothing that stands in front of us to get back on track in Q4. We with our September performance for the 9,500, we are absolutely on that path. And with the construction of our [indiscernible] that I mentioned, nine being already completed, 26 in the pipeline. We absolutely have that passive. For sure. Let's start with the bridge. So if you think about when the bridge went out, what that really did was it severed an artery where we were able to run trains longer than 8,300 feet. When we had to reroute the trains from Northern California over to Salt Lake and back up to Portland, we're restricted to that 8300 feet for a number of different reasons. So the fall-off and Train Link prior to September was absolutely related to the bridge outage. Now, to your point, as we see intermodal volumes grow, that's always a huge lever for us to grow Train Link, especially across our sunset corridor up to Chicago. Yes, Jon, that's an exceptionally good question and I want to be very clear. That is not lost and it's expected that we make that up in next year. Now we're getting into those ending questions again. Jon, rest assured, the entire team understands we have to get that back. As you would imagine, as we think through the 2022 and what is going to present. Those plans are still under works, but it's all with an eye towards capturing back that $150 million. Yup. Thank you, Jon."

            "name": "Jennifer Hamann",
            "content": "Thanks, Eric, and good morning. As you heard from Lance, Union Pacific achieved strong third quarter financial results with earnings per share of $2.57, and an operating ratio of 56.3%. As noted in an 8-K last month, we incurred additional expenses this quarter related to wildfires and weather. The full impact of those events, including lost revenue, negatively impacted our operating ratio 50 basis points and earnings per share by $0.05. Rising fuel prices throughout the quarter negatively impacted operating ratio by a 140 basis points.  However, the Year-over-year impact of our fuel surcharge programs added $0.05 to EPS. Setting aside these exogenous issues, UPS core operational performance drove operating ratio improvement of 430 basis points and added $0.56 to EPS. Our performance demonstrates the resiliency and efficiency built into our franchise through PSR, even when operating in less-than-ideal conditions. Looking now at our third quarter income statement on Slide 15, where we're showing the comparisons to both Third Quarter 2020 as well as Third Quarter 2019. The comparison of 2021 to 2019 most clearly illustrates the efficiency we've achieved over the past two years as we generated 9% higher Operating income on 4% less volumes. For third quarter 2021, operating revenue up 13% and operating expense only up 9%.  We generated a third quarter record operating income of $2.4 billion. Net income of $1.7 billion, and earnings per share also were third quarter records. Looking more closely at third quarter revenue, Slide 16 provides a breakdown of our freight revenue. Both year-over-year and sequentially versus the second quarter. Freight revenue totaled $5.2 billion in the third quarter, up 12% compared to 2020 and 1% compared to the second quarter. Looking first at the year-over-year analysis, although volume was flat, the overall demand environment remains strong and supports pricing actions that yield dollars exceeding inflation. On a year-over-year basis, those gains were further supplemented by a positive business mix driving 650 basis points in total improvement.  For Intermodal shipments combined with higher industrial shipments, drove that positive mix. Fuel surcharges increased freight revenues 600 basis points compared to last year as our fuel surcharge programs continue to chase rising fuel prices. Looking at freight revenue sequentially, lower volume versus the Second Quarter, decreased rate revenue 250 basis points highlighted by the factors that Kenny highlighted. Continued core pricing gains and a more positive business mix, increased freight revenue, 175 basis points on a sequential basis, driven by that same combination of higher industrial carloads and lower intermodal shipments.  Finally, rising fuel prices and the resulting uptick in sequential fuel surcharges increased freight revenue, 125 basis points. Now let's move onto Slide 17, which provides a summary of our Third Quarter operating expenses, which increased 9% in total versus 2020. The primary driver of the increase was fuel expense, up 81% as a result of a 74% increase in fuel prices. A small offset to the higher prices was a 1% improvement in our fuel consumption rate. Better efficiency was a product of both our business mix and productivity initiatives, which offset inefficiencies associated with wildfires in the quarter. Looking further at the other expense lines, compensation and benefits expense was up 3% versus 2020. Third Quarter workforce levels were down 1% compared to last year, despite our trained and engine workforce growing 3%. This increase reflects the additional crews needed to navigate the network impact from bridge outages and weather. Management, engineering, and mechanical work forces together decreased 3%. Wage inflation along with higher re-crew and overtime costs associated with our network issues, increased cost per employee 4%, while still a tad elevated, this level of per employee compensation increase is more in line with future expectations. Purchased services and materials expense was flat as higher locomotive and freight car maintenance associated with the larger access fleet was offset by reduced contractor expense. And with automotive shipments forecasted to remain soft for at least the balance of the year. We now expect purchase services and material expense to only be up low-single-digits for full-year versus 2021. Equipment and other flat consistent with volumes. Other expense decreased 10% or $29 million this quarter, driven primarily by lower write-offs of in-progress capital projects in 2021. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, recall that last year we incurred a one-time $278 million non-cash impairment charge in this expense category. Looking now at our efficiency results on Slide 18, operating challenges during the quarter again impacted our productivity, which totaled $45 million. In total for 2021, productivity is at $280 million, led by our Train Link improvements and locomotive productivity offset by roughly $55 million of weather and incident-related headwinds. Our incremental margins in the quarter were very strong, 94% driven by solid pricing gains, positive business mix, as well as continued efficiency. PSR clearly gives us a platform to add volumes to our network in an extremely efficient manner. Turning to slide 19, year-to-date cash from operations increased to $6.5 billion from $6 billion in 2020, a 9% increase. Our cash flow conversion rate was a strong 95% and year-to-date free cash flow increased $728 million or 38% driven by higher net income and lighter year-to-date capital spend compared to last year.  Supported by our strong cash generation and cash balances, we've returned $7.9 billion to shareholders year-to-date through dividends and share repurchases. Actions taken during the year include, increasing our industry-leading dividend by 10% in May and repurchasing 27.5 million shares totaling $5.9 billion. We finished the Third Quarter with a comparable adjusted debt-to - EBITDA ratio of 2.8 times, which is on par with Second Quarter. We remain committed to returning great value to our owners and are demonstrating that again this year. Wrapping things up on slide 20, as you heard from Kenny, the overall economic environment remains positive and provides confidence for the future growth of our Company. Bulk is driven by strong gear -- grain volumes and coal continue to exceed expectations.  Industrial volumes remain consistent and strong across many sectors like forest products, metals, and plastics. So we are bullish on several fronts. But as you are also well aware, headwinds in autos and intermodal persists. Global supply chain disruptions, semiconductor shortages, and the additional pressure with international intermodal volumes that Kenny just described, continued to constrain our premium volumes. So balancing these variables, and with just over two months left in the year, we now expect volume to be up closer to 5% for full year 2021. We are also adjusting our productivity guidance for the year down to $350 million as the weather impact and related network challenges impede the progress, we expect to make with our efficiency in 2021.  To put that in context, however, at the end of this year, we will have generated almost $1.8 billion of productivity since our implementation of PSR in late 2018, so great work overall by the team. And more importantly, this lower cost structure and improved service product provides Union Pacific the foundation for future growth and strong incremental margins. Lower expectations for volume and productivity are headwinds to our 2021 operating goal. In addition, we've seen fuel prices continue to rise in pressure margins. In fact, over the last 30 days, barrel prices have increased around $10 with spot diesel prices up over $0.25 per gallon. Offsetting some of this margin pressure is a positive business mix and strong pricing environment. So all-in, we now expect our full-year operating ratio improvement to be in the neighborhood of a 175 basis points.  While not quite to the high end of the guidance range we established back in January, we view that level of improvement as another great milestone on our journey to 55.x operating ratio in 2022, especially in light of the unexpected headwinds we've had to overcome to get here. Wrapping it up, it was a tough quarter operationally, yet we made great strides to strengthen our franchise and achieved solid results. In fact, we stand poised to finish 2021 as Union Pacific s most profitable year ever. That achievement would not be possible without our tremendous employees who are on the frontline every day serving our customers safely and efficiently while producing these record results. My thanks go out to team UP. So with that, I'll turn it back to Lance. Well, let me start with that second part Scott, because it in no way changes how we're looking at 2022. We absolutely believe we will still achieve those targets in 2022, consistent with what we talked about in our May Analyst Meeting. In terms of some of the pressures year-over-year. I mean, it really is a lot driven by fuel. The cost per gallon and if I'm looking at it year-over-year is going to be up anywhere from call it 75 to 80%.  And that's just very tough to overcome, especially with flat volumes, because that's essentially how we're looking at things and you think about our volume guidance in the 5% for full year. So while we're still expecting to be efficient, as we're continuing to resource in the network fluidity that's going to have some pressure on that. And that's what's being reflected in the guidance that we provided there. Operating ratio pressure, yes. Got it. Thank you. Well, we saw that show up in the industrial space this quarter, talking about being able to really capitalize and jump in where we saw some hot markets. Kenny and the team did it and then Eric and team moved it. And that's impacted by this modal supply chain issues."

            "name": "Kenny Rocker",
            "content": "Thank you, Lance and good morning. Before I talk about our market performance, I want to thank our operating team for their tireless efforts this past summer to recover the network from the devastating forest fires in California. Focusing back on our review of the business, our Third Quarter volume was flat compared to a year-ago. Gains in our bulk and industrial segments were driven by market strength and our business development efforts. Those gains were offset by declines in our premium business group, as our served markets continue to be impacted by semiconductor chip shortages and global supply chain disruptions.  However, freight revenue was up 12% driven by higher fuel surcharges, strong pricing gains, and a positive mix. Let's take a closer look at each of these business groups. Starting out with our bulk commodities, revenue for the quarter was up 14% compared to last year, driven by a 4% increase in volume and a 9% increase in average revenue per car, reflecting strong core pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenue. Coal and renewable carloads grew 9% year-over-year, and 17% from the second quarter. Our efforts to switch customers to index-based contracts are supporting domestic coal demand, as a result of higher natural gas prices, coupled with increased coal exports.  Grain and grain products were down 1% compared to last year, and down 9% from the Second Quarter due primarily to lower U.S. grain stocks. However, this was partially offset by our business development efforts and strong demand for bio-fuels. Fertilizer carloads were up 10% year-over-year due to strong agricultural demand and increased export potash shipments. And finally, food and refrigerated volume was flat year-over-year and sequentially from the Second Quarter. Moving on to Industrial. Industrial revenue improved 22% for the quarter, driven by our 14% increase in volume. Average revenue per car also improved 6% driven by higher fuel surcharge, core pricing gains, and positive mix. Energy and specialized shipments were up 16% compared to last year, and up 5% versus the Second Quarter.  The gains were due to an increase in petroleum products as demand recovers from this time last year, and new business wins from Mexico Energy Reform. Volume from Forest Products grew 15% year-over-year, primarily driven by demand for brown paper using corrugated boxes, along with strong housing starts, driving lumber shipments. However, compared to the Second Quarter, volume was down 2% due to the impact of the Lapa fire in Northern California. Industrial chemicals and plastic shipments were up 6% year-over-year due to strengthening demand and business wins as production rate for plastics improved from 2020. Metals and minerals volume was up 21% compared to 2020 and up 3% versus the second quarter, primarily driven by our business development efforts, along with strong steel demand.  As industrial markets recover, coupled with favorable comps for frac sand. Turning now with premium, revenue for the quarter was up 1% as the 9% decrease in volume was more than offset by higher average revenue per car. ARC increased by 11% from higher fuel surcharges and core pricing gains. Automotive volume was down 18% compared to last year and down 4% versus the Second Quarter, semiconductor shortages had an adverse impact to both our finished vehicles and auto parts business segments. Inter-modal volume decreased 6% year-over-year and 8% compared to the second quarter. International volumes continue to face challenges from global supply chain disruption. With regards to domestic, strong demand and new business wins were also hampered by supply chain disruptions. Plus e-commerce business saw tough comps versus last year. Now, looking ahead to the Fourth Quarter of 2021, starting out with our bulk commodities, we're optimistic about grain business due to another strong harvest and grain export demand. Also, grain products will continue to benefit from growth of the bio-fuel markets. Food and refrigerated volumes should be positive with increased consumer demand, post-pandemic restaurant re-openings, and truck penetration growth. Lastly, we expect coal to remain strong for the remainder of the year based on our current natural gas futures, inventory replenishment, as well as export demand. Looking at our industrial markets, we continue to be encouraged by the strength of the forecast for industrial production for the rest of 2021, which will positively impact many bar markets, like metals and florin (ph). The year-over-year comp for our energy markets are favorable. However, we expect narrow spreads will negatively impact crude by rail shipments. But on a positive note, we expect to mitigate the lower crude shipments with strength and other petroleum and LPG products. And lastly, for premiums, we anticipate continued challenges in automotive related to semiconductor shortages for the fourth quarter. In regards to intermodal, limited truck capacity, inventory, restocking, and strength in retail sales will continue to drive intermodal demand in the fourth quarter. However, we expect international volumes to be constrained as ocean carriers have recently taken additional actions to speed up their container returns as challenges in labor, port capacity, warehouses, and in drayage persist. And on the domestic side, opportunities will face continued supply chain challenges with limited hallway capacity and floor chassis turn time. Overall, I'm encouraged by the opportunities in front of us for the rest of 2021. But more importantly, I want to recognize the commercial team as they continue to focus on providing solutions for our customers to win in the marketplace. As we head into 2022, our commercial team is driving growth through new business wins. Most notably, we're taking more trucks off the road in all three of our business groups. And with that, I'll turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance. Yeah. Thanks, Amit, for that question. First, I'll start off by saying that I feel much better about where we are today in terms of our ability to price the product and even earlier in this year, we're looking at the Fourth Quarter. We're going to start bid season here with a small amount of a bid out there, call it 10-15% on a lot of our Intermodal business. Clearly on a lot of our carload business. We're stepping into that. I's a strong environment for us. It's a favorable environment for us. We're going to price to the marketplace. We're in the tight truck capacity. Not just on the Intermodal side, we also see it on the carload side. So we'll have a lot more clarity on it, but I will tell you right now, as I sit here today, it's a favorable environment for us to be pricing in. Well, I'm a college football fan, first of all. But the bottom line is that, hey, look, this is -- it's better than I've seen it in a while. I haven't seen it this strong since the last part of '18. We feel good about the products that we have out there. I've talked about all the new products with Inland Empire in Twin Cities and the network that we have and what Eric is doing to improve the service that you're seeing. It's a favorable environment for us and we feel good about our ability to price into it. Yeah, you know, it's totally different reasons. I mean, 2018 was -- the supply chain challenges weren't as holds up as they are today. There are still many things that -- that come into play when you look at what's on the water, what's at the port, street well, and some of the chassis turns. This is a little bit different. In terms of the price and opportunity, I'd say it's still there. I still, again, pretty strong about the opportunities that we have. We get the test awarded here like I mentioned. In the fourth quarter, we've got some large pieces of business that are coming on. We'll see how it plays out, but we're pretty optimistic about what's in front of us. Yeah, it really just keeps them in the market. It keeps them competitive. Especially, when you have natural gas prices as high as they are. It puts them in the money and we have a really strong service product to support it. We feel good about where that is in the fourth quarter. Probably feel good about where it is in the first quarter and we need to reassess it on a quarterly basis. I think that's a safe bet to think that way. Yes, absolutely. I mean, we teamed up at Investor Day, how we thought about the bio-fuel market. One of the things that I'm proud of that vaulting for it, that they develop that market. I mean, you look at the Midwest and some of these central states, we've got a unique opportunity where we originate that business. And then we have another unique opportunity in some cases where we might be able to move some of that product to the end market. So we're going out from a business development standpoint and just developing that business.  As you look at our industrial side, same thing too. If you look at Mexico Energy Reform, team has just done a fabulous job of just walking down that portfolio and growing that business. We have clear line of sight to the players that can get in those markets, and we're helping them grow. On the premium side, We've got [indiscernible] to upcoming in January 1st and we're fired up about it. There are some other areas again, that we have just gone out and created those markets, and so we're excited about it. We do feel -- I'm bullish. We feel very strong going into next year. First of all, yeah. We've got an investment here that's coming on in the first half of the year of chassis. We feel good about that. We've got ample container -- work on improve our competitiveness, here in the first half of the year. We've got GPS that we're investing in. I can't say enough about how much capacity opportunities are there in an Inland Empire. And we're working very closely what Eric's team on that. And we still have room to grow in the 2030. So yeah, there are some macroeconomic and supply chain challenges out there, but what you're hearing me say, and what you're hearing Lance say, is that boy as a team, we're really going after it and being very deliberate and specific about how to grow the business. We don't see any issue bringing on that business. That's interesting question. It really depends on what you believe and what you've heard us say is that we believe the run rates will continue to move in the fourth quarter. And then it'll be up low, gradual ramp up in the first half by late spring, summer. We can get to where the forecast [indiscernible]. That be an excellent position for us. We expect to really have a strong product that is competitive with truck, but we don't see where we would lose any of that business. And we also would anticipate that some of the auto part business will show up a little bit before the finished vehicles product. That's also an interesting question. What I'll tell you what we're doing is going out and inserting solutions where we can. So Eric and his team has done a really good job with keeping in contact with the terminals from a technology side, we've been surrogate APIs at the Port from an investment perspective. We're going out and really owning our own destiny in terms of expansion. We're creating solutions for our customers. Clearly, Eric talked about what we've done in our G3 facility.  We also opened up temporarily another facility down in the Houston area our loops subsidiary is going out and working with the BCO, expedite drayage. We're pulling everything we can in our control to not just accept what the supply chain challenges are out there. We're trying to own it. And so you've heard about the investments that we're making on the chassis and GPS side. So what you're hearing from me is we're doing everything we can to control our destiny, to maximize. Every carload matters and we've been able to grow our export business. But to your point, it's a smaller part of our overall portfolio. Absolutely. We've seen a handful of wins that we're really excited about."

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Mr. Fritz, you may begin.\nLance Fritz: Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Union Pacific's second quarter earnings conference call. With me today in Omaha are Eric Gehringer, Executive Vice President of Operations; Kenny Rocker, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; and Jennifer Hamann, our Chief Financial Officer. The team at Union Pacific continued to demonstrate their capability, as we moved increasing volumes while dealing with challenging capacity constraints in some of our important supply chains. The result was the team delivered all-time record financial results. Our employees are making good on our strategy to serve, grow and win together. Regarding our second quarter results, this morning, Union Pacific is reporting 2021 second quarter net income of $1.8 billion, or $2.72 per share. This compares to $1.1 billion, or $1.67 per share in the second quarter of 2020. While comparisons to the second quarter of last year are skewed by the COVID impact, a comparison to 2019 further demonstrates the impressive results we achieved during the quarter. Our quarterly operating ratio of 55.1% is an all-time record. In addition, we set quarterly records for operating income, net income and earnings per share. These records highlight how the team is running the Union Pacific franchise to deliver results, as we pulled all three profitability levers simultaneously, volume price and productivity. The second quarter also marked an important milestone in our quest to reduce our carbon footprint, as we achieved a second quarter best fuel consumption rate. Locomotive fuel efficiency is the critical element to achieving our goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. And we're helping our customers achieve their ESG goals, too, as they eliminated 5.7 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions in the quarter by using rail versus truck. While our financial results were impressive in the second quarter, our customers felt the impact of intermodal supply chain disruptions and costly rail equipment incidents. Within the intermodal space, we've taken numerous actions to mitigate the customer impact, and are actively working with all parties in the supply chain. Even so, it's likely these issues will persist through the end of the year, as the capacity to move boxes from our ramp to the final destination falls short of demand. Relative to rail equipment incidents, while the number and rate improved their impact on the network was notable. We're redoubling our efforts to utilize best-in-class technology, training, and root cause analysis to keep our crews, our customers and our communities safe. To that end, we'll start with Eric and an update on our operations.\nEric Gehringer: Thanks, Lance, and good morning. I'd like to begin by thanking the entire operating department for their support, our customers through the many transitory challenges we\u2019ve faced during the first-half of this year. While we don't see these events impacting us long-term, there's real work to be done to get past them. Moving to Slide 4. Taking a look at our key performance metrics for the quarter. It's important to note that year-over-year comparisons are a little skewed. 2020 included a couple historically low volume months at the start of the pandemic. So as Lance said, we've provided a 2019 comparison to give a little more context to more normal, seasonal volumes. Freight car velocity improved from 2019 due to the execution of PSR principles that reduced freight car terminal dwell and improved train speeds. However, we still have work to do to return to running a more fluid network, with the goal to return this metric back to the 220 miles per day range to 230 miles per day range we achieved earlier this year. As you can see, our service reliability as measured by trip plan compliance has improved over the time in both service categories. However, current quarterly metrics do not meet our expectations or that of our customers. Disruptions in the international supply chains, especially in the intermodal space, have impacted our network significantly. At the expense of our own service metrics, we chose to help reduce port congestion by moving more assets into dock operations. But that West Coast port congestion has now moved East, and is affecting some of our inland terminals, most notably in Chicago. We are working proactively with our commercial team and ocean carrier customers to address the congestion, while continuing to sustain shipment volumes, to and from the ports. To help alleviate the congestion and maintain fluidity, we also temporarily reopened Global III in Chicago for use as an inland storage. We are also working with our customers to develop additional storage and transportation options. We will continue to work with all members of the supply chain, our ocean carrier customers, beneficial cargo owners, port operators, chassis providers, and dray carriers to mean the fluidity of international freight flows. During the first-half, our network has been impacted by weather and costly rail equipment incidents as well. We have made good progress on reducing the frequency of rail incidents. However, the location of a couple of the incidents occurring on our East West main corridor and our sunset route had a notable effect on both intermodal and manifest auto trip plan compliance measures. Ultimately, we recognize the importance of improving these metrics to support our customers and our long-term growth strategy. Turning to Slide 5. We continue to make good progress in our efficiency measures, as both locomotive and workforce productivity improved in the quarter. Improvement in locomotive productivity was the result of running an efficient transportation plan that requires fewer locomotives. Workforce productivity was an all-time quarterly record, driven by an increase in daily car miles of more than 20%, while workforce levels remained flat. These improvements were also driven by our continued focus on growing train linked, which has grown by 9% since the second quarter 2020 to just over 9,400 feet. Increasing and more consistent volumes provide the team with more optionality to adjust transportation plans. We will continue to focus on train length to run a more efficient and reliable railroad for our customers. Turning to Slide 6. One driver of the continued increase in train length is our siding extension program. Through the first-half of the year, we've completed seven sidings and began construction or the bidding process on more than 20 additional sidings. Through growing train size, other productivity initiatives and technology, our fuel consumption rate was a second quarter record, improving 3% compared to last year. The operating department understands the important role we play in achieving our long-term greenhouse gas emission goals. Wrapping up on Slide 7. The entire team is focused on performing our work safer every day. Year-to-date, our safety results have been mixed. Real equipment incidents have decreased, but personal injuries increased. To address personal injuries, we are maturing our peer-to-peer safety programs, which is a continuation and next level of our Courage-to-Care program. Recently, our network has been impacted by wildfires in Northern California. Our Dry Canyon Bridge north of Redding, California sustained significant structural damage. The team is working around the clock to repair the bridge. Current projections have a reopening in late August. We are actively rerouting traffic in that area, which requires additional crew and locomotive resources, as well as adding transit time to those customer shipments. Ultimately, I have the utmost confidence that we will guide our network through these transitory challenges, and return our service product to the level our customers expect and deserve. The team did an excellent job during the quarter and how efficiently we added volume to our network. PSR remains our guiding principle and the improvements you've seen, and our productivity and operating efficiency speaks to that commitment. Our ability to be far more volume variable with our cost structure is a testament to our employees who execute the plan every day. With that, I will turn it over to Kenny to provide an update on the business environment. \nKenny Rocker: Thank you, Eric, and good morning. Our second quarter volume was up 22% from a year ago, as all of our major markets improved from the economic shutdown that we saw from the onset of the pandemic. Freight revenue was up 29%, due to the volume increase coupled with a higher fuel surcharge and core pricing gains. We clearly have easy comp this quarter versus last year. In order to provide a little more color into the current business, I will also share our sequential comparison to the first quarter, as I walk through each of the business groups. So, let's get started with our bulk commodity. Revenue for the quarter was up 19% compared to last year, driven by a 13% increase in volume, and a 5% increase in average revenue per car, reflecting core pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenue. Coal and renewable carloads grew 6% year-over-year and 14% from the first quarter, due to higher natural gas prices supporting domestic coal demand, Winter Storm Uri in the first quarter, as well as increased coal exports. Grain and grain products were up 22% year-over-year due to the strength in both domestic and export grain. Ethanol shipments also continue to improve as production recovers from COVID-related shutdown. Fertilizer carloads were up 2% year-over-year and 23% from the first quarter, due to strong agricultural demand and seasonality of fertilizer applications. And finally, food and refrigerated volume was up 17% year-over-year and 7% from the first quarter, driven primarily by higher consumer demand, as the economy recovers from COVID, along with increased growth from truck penetration. Moving on to industrial, industrial revenue improved 24% for the quarter, driven by a 15% increase in volume, coupled with an 8% increase in average revenue per car from a positive mix of traffic, core pricing gains and a higher fuel surcharge. Energy and specialized shipments were up 20% year-over-year, but we're down 1% compared to the first quarter, as strength in specialized shipments were offset by fewer crude oil shipments, and seasonal LPG demand. Forest products continues to be a bright spot, as second quarter volumes grew 28% year-over-year and 7% over the first quarter. Lumber drove this increase from strong housing start, repairing remodels, along with further penetration from product moving over the road. Industrial chemicals and plastics shipments were up 11% for both year-over-year and the first quarter comparison. The sequential growth was driven by the recovery of the Gulf Coast production rates from the February storm and improved demand. Metals and minerals volumes was up 12% year-over-year and 25% from the first quarter, driven by increased rock shipments and stronger steel demand, as the industrial sectors recover. Turning now to Premium, revenue for the quarter was up 50% on a 31% increase in volume. Average revenue per car increased by 14% from higher fuel surcharge revenue, positive mix of traffic and core pricing gains. Automotive volume was up 119% year-over-year, but down 4% compared to the first quarter, driven by shortages for semiconductor-related parts. Intermodal volume increased by 21% year-over-year, and 10% from the first quarter. Domestic intermodal improved from continuous strength in retail sales and recent business wins, parcel in particular, benefited from the ongoing strength in e-commerce. International intermodal saw continued strength in containerize import, despite congestion in the overall global supply chain. Now, looking ahead to the back-half of 2021. Starting out with our bulk commodities, we expect coal to remain stable for the remainder of the year, based on the current natural gas futures as well as export demand. Our food and refrigerated shipments should continue to be strong, as the nation recovers from COVID coupled with truck penetration wins. We're also optimistic with our grain products business, as ethanol shipments will improve from increased consumer demand, and our focus in growing the renewable diesel market. Lastly, while we see positive signs for the upcoming grain harvest and strengthen export demand, we expect tight supply in the third quarter, as well as top year-over-year comparisons in the back-half of the year. As we look ahead to our industrial commodities, the year-over-year comps for our energy market are favorable. However, there is still uncertainty with crew plans supporting crew by warehouse shipments. We continue to be encouraged by the strength and the industrial production forecast for the rest of 2021, which will positively impact many of our markets. In addition, forest product volume will remain strong for us in the second-half of the year. And lastly for premium, automotive sales are forecasted to increase from 14 million units in 2020 to almost 17 million in 2021. However, we are keeping a watchful eye on the supply chain issues for parts related to the semiconductor chip. Now switching to intermodal, on the international side we expect demand to remain strong through the rest of the year. The entire supply chain continues to be constrained by most notably to haul away our containers from our inland ramp. But I've been pleased with the collaboration between our commercial and operating teams, as we work together to create solutions for our international customers to improve service and network fluidity. With regard to domestic intermodal, limited truck capacity will encourage conversion from over the road to rail, tampered by constraint on chassis supply. Retail inventories remained historically low, and restocking of inventory along with continued strength in the sales should drive intermodal volumes higher for the remainder of this year. Overall, I'm encouraged by the improving economic outlook, but more importantly, by our commercial teams\u2019 intensity and ability to win in the marketplace. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jennifer.\nJennifer Hamann: Thanks, Kenny, and good morning. As you heard from Lance, Union Pacific recorded record second quarter financials with earnings per share of $2.72 and an operating ratio of 55.1%. Rise in fuel prices throughout the quarter and the two month lag on our fuel surcharge programs, negatively impacted our quarterly ratio by 210 basis points, and earnings per share by $0.04. Below the line, our previously announced real estate gain and a lower effective tax rate associated with reduced corporate tax rates in three states added $0.13 to earnings per share. Partially offsetting that good news in 2021 is a real estate gain of $0.08 recorded in last year second quarter. Setting aside the impact of one-time items and fuel, UP\u2019s core operational performance drove operating ratio improvement of 800 basis points, and added $1.04 to earnings per share. These results are a clear demonstration of how we are positioned to efficiently leverage volume growth to the bottom-line. Looking now at our second quarter income statement on Slide 15, where we're showing a comparison of this quarter's results to second quarter 2020, as well as 2019. This is to provide additional context to our results by comparing periods with more normal seasonal volume levels. For perspective, seven day car loadings in the second quarter of 2019 were almost 166,000, versus only 133,000 in 2020, and then rebounding this year to 163,000. So, not quite back to pre-pandemic levels. For second quarter 2021, the combination of operating revenue up 30% and operating expense only up 17%, illustrates our efficient handling of volume growth to produce record quarterly operating income of $2.5 billion. Net income of $1.8 billion and earnings per share also were quarterly records. Looking more closely at second quarter revenue, Slide 16 provides a breakdown of our freight revenue, both on a year-over-year basis and sequentially versus the first quarter. Freight revenue totaled $5.1 billion in the second quarter, up 29% compared to 2020, and up 10% compared to the first quarter. Looking first at the year-over-year analysis, volume was the largest driver up 22% against the pandemic impacted second quarter 2020 volumes. Fuel surcharges increased freight revenue by 425 basis points compared to last year, as our fuel surcharge programs adjusted to rise in fuel prices. And as we experienced a strong demand environment, our pricing actions continue to yield dollars in excess of inflation. On a year-over-year basis, those gains were further supplemented by a slightly positive business mix, driving in total 300 basis points of improvement. Looking at freight revenue sequentially, volume was again the largest driver of growth, up 875 basis points against weather impacted first quarter volumes. Sequentially, fuel surcharge increased freight revenue 275 basis points. Business mix was actually negative sequentially, more than offsetting positive pricing gains and creating a 100 basis point headwind. Now, let's move on to Slide 17, which provides a summary of our second quarter operating expenses. With volumes up 22% in the quarter, our benchmark of success is growing expenses at a slower rate. And as you have seen through our results, we did an excellent job of being more than volume variable with our cost structure. Looking at the individual lines, compensation and benefits expenses up 13% versus 2020. Second quarter workforce levels were flat compared to last year, generating very strong workforce productivity, as Eric described. Specifically, our train and engine workforce continues to be more than volume variable up only 10%, while management, engineering and mechanical workforces together decreased 5%. Offsetting some of this productivity was an elevated cost per employee, up 13% as we experienced increased overtime, and more recently, higher recrew costs associated with some of our network outages. Other drivers of the increase were wage inflation, the negative comparison against last year's management actions in response to the pandemic, as well as higher year-over-year incentive compensation. Quarterly fuel expense increased over 100% driven by a 71% increase in fuel prices, and the 22% increase in volumes. Offsetting some of this expense was a 3% improvement in our fuel consumption rate, driven by our energy management initiative and a more fuel efficient business mix. Purchase services and materials expense increased 8%, primarily due to higher volume related subsidiary drayage costs, as well as other volume related expenses, such as transportation and lodging for our train crews. These increases were partially offset by around $35 million of favorable one-time items. Equipment and other rents actually decreased 5% or $11 million, driven by decreased rent expense on stored equipment and higher TTX equity income, partially offset by volume increases. The other expense line increased 21% or $49 million this quarter, driven by last year's $25 million insurance reimbursement, higher casualty expenses and higher state and local taxes. Lastly, as previously announced in an 8-K during the quarter, we expect our annual effective tax rate to be closer to 23% for the year. Looking now at our efficiency results on Slide 18, despite some of the operational challenges that Eric discussed, we continue to generate solid productivity. Second quarter productivity totaled $130 million, bringing our year-to-date total to $235 million. Productivity results continue to be led by train length improvements and locomotive productivity. As we stated at our Investor Day, a better long-term indicator of our efficiency is incremental margins. So looking at this quarter, we achieved a very strong incremental margins of 78%, demonstrating the positive impact PSR is having on our operating models. Turning to Slide 19, cash from operations in the first-half of 2021 decreased slightly to $4.2 billion from $4.4 billion in 2020, a 4% decline. This decrease was the result of deferred tax payments last year. Our cash flow conversion rate was a strong 96%, and free cash flow increased in the first-half up $142 million or 9%, highlighting our ongoing capital discipline. Supported by our strong cash generation and cash balances, we've returned $5.4 billion to shareholders year-to-date, as we increased our industry-leading dividend by 10% in May, and repurchased 19 million shares totaling $4.1 billion. This includes the initial delivery of a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase program established during the quarter, and funded by new debt issued in mid-May. We finished the second quarter with a comparable adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.8 times, on par with the first quarter. Wrapping up on Slide 20, we are optimistic about what's ahead in the back-half of 2021. From a volume standpoint, we are increasing our growth outlook for the full year to around 7%, which includes just over a one point headwind from ongoing energy market challenges. We also see tough comparisons in both intermodal and grain, as well as continued impacts from the semiconductor shortage. And as you heard Kenny mentioned, supply chain challenges in the intermodal space are likely to slow asset turns and impact loading. On the flip side, we see growing confidence in the industrial sector, and the team is successfully executing on our plan to grow and win with customers. Looking at operating ratio, we're dropping the low end of our initial range and now expect to achieve roughly 200 basis points of improvement, or an operating ratio closer to 56.5% for full year 2021. With that strengthening outlook, cash generation is growing as is our plan for share repurchases, which we would target at approximately $7 billion or $1 billion more than we had originally planned. Finally, I want to acknowledge that these record results would not be possible without our great workforce. Behind each of these numbers is a member of the UP team, who works safely and efficiently to attract new business and serve our customers. And with UP\u2019s new employee stock purchase plan, the entire team has more opportunity to benefit from the company's success. So with that, I'll turn it back to Lance.\nLance Fritz: Thank you, Jennifer. As I mentioned at the start, we must improve our safety performance, it's foundational to everything we do at Union Pacific. The pace of our progress has to accelerate. As Eric stated, we're dedicated to improving our service products to the level our customers expect and demand. All of our long-term goals are predicated on a safe, reliable and consistent service product. As you heard from Kenny, we're winning with customers and growing our business. You're seeing our customer focus and obsession in action. We've got fantastic momentum and we're excited about the increasing opportunities that we are creating and uncovering. Given the workforce issues faced across various parts of the supply chain outside of UP, we will likely be working to overcome that congestion for the remainder of the year. But our second quarter achievements set the table for continued strong results in the second-half of the year. These results also provide a solid start toward the long-term targets we set for the next three years that we laid out at our Investor Day in early May. The future is very bright for Union Pacific. We're in a fantastic position to deliver value to all of our stakeholders, as we win together. So with that, let's open up the line for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nTom Wadewitz: Yeah, good morning. Let's see, I wanted to ask you a bit about the network constraints. Obviously, you took an action at G-IV that was unusual, but I know there was good logic, obviously, for that. Is that something where you're confident that we'll be reopened in a week? And then I guess, from a broader perspective, maybe for Kenny, or Lance, is this - is it the broader rail network issues or service issues, the significant headwind to your ability to gain fear from truck and make that pitch a better service? Or is this just extreme unusual times, and you don't think it really hurts you on that share gain versus truck strategy? Thank you.\nLance Fritz: Thank you, Tom. I'll start. This is Lance, and then I'll turn it over to Kenny. So, in terms of network constraints, we view them largely as transitory. There's one issue, which we pointed out in the international intermodal supply chain, which is about demand and inbound containers, overwhelming the capacity for the ultimate customer to take the boxes off our ramps and get them into their warehouses and distribution centers. We think that's going to be around for a little while. The pause that we've taken at G-IV is all about allowing those end users, those shippers to ultimately be able to clean off that inventory, so that we can start with a more fluid operation. And overall, I think, Kenny that we've demonstrated in this environment, we can still convert truck with our current service product. But that's in no way saying the current service product is adequate or appropriate for truck conversion in the long run.\nKenny Rocker: Yeah, Lance, you said it right. Let me just back up for a minute and just say that this started with some pretty strong demand that we saw coming from international trade. And I'll tell you, Eric, and I jumped right in with our customers and all the supply chain members as soon as we saw this. And what I mean by that is first, we went out, we added more short rails, we added more long rails, we added more chassis, we increased the train start, we sat down with our customers on a daily basis, flew out to the ports and had executive meetings there. We also held an executive forum with all of the international intermodal customers to work through solutions. That's where we came up with a solution of G-III. What people don't know is we also came up with off ramp type solutions. And finally, we inserted loop to help with the BCOs to try to offer up solutions for more drayage off of our ramps. So, we've been working hand in hand with not only our customers, but everyone in the supply chain. And so, the pause that you see should help us balance the network. Now, on a broader level, this is transitory. We don't see this being around forever. We expect as the velocity continues to improve, absolutely, we're going to win more truck share. We've demonstrated that we can do it thus far, so we feel very good about what we see in the future.\nTom Wadewitz: Do you think that the haul is going to be done within a week or is that -- can you comment on that?\nKenny Rocker: We're in the early stages right now. What I can say is that we're working on a daily basis to make sure that that demand matches the haul way.\nTom Wadewitz: Yep. Okay. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.\nJon Chappell: Thank you. Good morning. Kenny, sticking with you, given all the service issues that seem to be grabbing the headlines, your pricing environment still seems to be incredibly robust, pretty much across all sectors. Can you speak to balancing some of these service issues and your conversations with the customers to still being able to push through price on a consistent basis going forward? And maybe even as it relates to coal, where you're super cautious back in April, and maybe a little bit more balanced in July. Is there a chance you're still even being conservative with the coal outlook for the back-half of the year, especially on the pricing front?\nKenny Rocker: Thanks, Jon. You've got a lot of questions here, I'll try to answer them all. So first of all, the pricing environment, we're going to price to the market and there's tight dray capacity, there's tight truck capacity. You look at even the first part of this year, we felt good about the price that we were able to take. We've improved on that price acceleration as we moved now to the second-half of the year. I do think it's important for us to look at our intermodal business, and not call that or have a broad brush to say all of our challenges in international intermodal are playing out in other areas. So, we are able to get more price and volume there. And then the last question is about coal, and as we look for the rest of the year, for sure, as we look at where the futures are, we think that the run rate that we see today will be consistent for the rest of the year.\nJon Chappell: Got it. Thanks for your insight, Kenny.\nOperator: The next question is coming from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask one about mix and how you see that developing here throughout the rest of the year. It looks like on a sequential basis, it was still weak either way in most of your core pricing gains there. But given the commentary about the volume outlook and the back-half of the year, I would expect that that should start to turn positive. So any thoughts on there would be appreciated? And also the implications for fuel economy, which as we talked about in the past, has been also impacted by adverse mix?\nJennifer Hamann: Yes. So Brian, I'll jump in here. You're right from a mix -- we did have a little bit better performance there relative to mix, as we saw the coal and the grain continued strong. Whether or not that continues, you've heard Kenny talk about coal staying stable, so that may help us. But our primary efforts relative to fuel consumption are really around how we're running our locomotive fleet, the technology that we're using, and mix is just kind of a benefit sometimes, but not something that we're counting on. We know that we need to drive that change ourselves. In terms of how we look at mix overall for the back-half of the year, we do see some ongoing pressure, particularly with grain. We had very strong grain last year, and so grain plays a big role in that mix. And as I look just at the third quarter, autos could potentially play a role there. It was beneficial a little bit in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis, but not sequentially to your point. And so, we're really watching that chip shortage to see what happens with autos. Intermodal is going to stay strong, and we're maybe losing a little bit of the top side there relative to some of these supply chain challenges. But those are the things to watch for, and obviously you guys get good visibility to that throughout the quarter.\nBrian Ossenbeck: And, specifically on fuel, was there anything that you implemented this quarter was just kind of accumulation of all the initiatives you've been working on?\nJennifer Hamann: I don't believe there was anything special that we did this quarter. Eric, I don't know if you want to comment on that.\nEric Gehringer: The accumulation of initiatives, and we've talked before about the fact that we've got more than a dozen initiatives. The big ones continue to be our work on modernizing locomotives, implementation of BMS, with 800 more units this year. And even things as we look at continuing to invest in our waste side lubrication, all those point in the direction of being able to continue to become more fuel efficient.\nLance Fritz: Hey, Brian, the cool part about that sea rate is it hits two critical buttons for us. It's got a cost impact, maybe more importantly, it's got a greenhouse gas emissions impact.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Exactly. All right. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nAllison Landry: Thanks. Good morning. So I wanted to ask about train lengths. I mean, obviously, you guys continued to improve that meaningfully. So, I guess I'm curious, can we see an acceleration in the pace of improvement in the second-half given the sidings additions? I imagine increased volumes help as well? And I guess can you get to 10,000 feet by Q4 or year-end? And does all of this drive potential upside to the $500 million productivity target for the year? Thank you.\nEric Gehringer: Absolutely. Thank you for the question, Allison. So, to your point, yes, the siding extension work was seven completed and 20 more to be completed for the year, at the end of the year, certainly assist us in our efforts to be able to grow train lengths. As I've mentioned before, though, we also have our process improvement, which is really focused on our transportation plan and looking at how we combine trains. I'm not going to guide you to a specific number by the end of the year. What I will certainly tell you, though, is that the entire team understands it's one of our single biggest levers to continue to drive productivity. And we're all focused on it day after day. I'll also point out that as we've been working through some of these transitory events, i.e. the bridge outage on the I-V that will become a temporary headwind to us in the beginning of the third quarter that does not stop all of our efforts, so they continue to grow that through the rest of the year.\nAllison Landry: Okay, perfect. Thank you.\nEric Gehringer: Thank you, Allison.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Jennifer, you guys referenced some equipment incidents. Is there any way to put some numbers around how much that's costing? And then, when you think about operating ratio and incremental margins, do you think we should see sequential operating ratio improvement as we go into the back-half? And as just the year-over-year trends just start to normalize a little bit, do you think we can maintain this level of incremental margin? Thank you.\nJennifer Hamann: Thanks, Scott. So, in terms of the equipment incidents, we would kind of put all of our casualty costs together. So yes, we did have some equipment incidents. We have a little bit higher expense, in terms of some of our environmental and personal injury accruals. And I'd say all in that cost is probably about a nickel on the quarter. So that's how I would size that. In terms of the operating ratio and margins, our incremental margins in the second quarter 78%, very strong. I think we can maintain that pace through the back-half. If you think about our operating ratio guidance, though, the 56.5% just mathematically, that would say that we're not probably going to see sequential level improvements. We do have tougher comps, as we move into the back-half of 2021. And we see volumes being, I'll say kind of flattish sequentially. If we can get some upside there, obviously, that could help as well.\nLance Fritz: Yeah. I just want to point out, Jennifer, that 55.1, 55x are terrific operating ratios. We're not satisfied. It's not like we're going to camp out there if there's an opportunity to improve, but that\u2019s a hell of a performance.\nJennifer Hamann: No, absolutely. And of course, that all goes into our longer-term guidance that you're aware of Scott, in terms of getting to that 55 next year, and then having long-term incrementals in the mid to high 60s.\nScott Group: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Hoexter: Hey, great. Good morning. Lance and Jen, if I could just follow-up on that incremental comment, right. So, if you think about the second-half, you're increasing your volume target, yet you're kind of maintaining the DLR target at that 56.5. So, just want to walk through kind of the leverage you see on the network. If you've got room still, you've been in 180,000 weekly carloads. You mentioned down at 163,000. So it still seems like you've got operational room for benefit. You should have fuel catching up in the second-half after getting a negative in the current quarter. So, is there anything that wouldn't lead to a better than the 56.5 target that you've got, given the additional 100 basis points of volumes?\nLance Fritz: Ken, you're kind of painting us into a corner there. I'm going to start and say the full year operating ratio, of course incorporates the first quarter, which I think was a 60 dot something. And there's also the headwinds that Jennifer mapped out. There are tailwinds, but we got to be balanced in our perspective in terms of recognizing. There's some headwinds that are going to be showing up in the second-half.\nJennifer Hamann: Yeah. And to your point Ken, we did up our volume outlook. But if you look at that, that really says we're pretty flat from where we're at today in terms of ending the second quarter out through the end of the year. And July is off to a bit of a slower start, which isn't unusual. You've got the 4th of July holiday, but right now our seven day run rate for July is kind of the high 150. So we've got to see that pickup. And obviously some of these transitory issues that are going on in the intermodal space are having an impact on that top-line. So I feel very good, 56.5 would be a record performance and sets us up great going forward.\nKen Hoexter: Great. Thanks.\nLance Fritz: All right. Thanks, Ken.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJordan Alliger: Hi. Yeah. Given this still very solid demand and some of the congestion issues, can you maybe reiterate your thoughts around resourcing, specifically headcount and maybe touch a little bit on other inflationary cost pressures that may be lurking that you referenced second-half headwinds? Obviously, congestion is some of it perhaps costs as well. Thanks.\nLance Fritz: Just to be clear, I think we've said this, maybe even in our prepared comments that as we look into the second-half, our headcount right now is about 30,000 employees, and it's going to stay around in that ballpark, as we look out into what we think the demand profile is going to be. We're going to have to hire here and there to fill in vacancies or take care of attrition. But, we don't see any significant hiring program or headwind in that headcount number.\nJennifer Hamann: Yeah, that's exactly right, Lance. So with regard to inflation, Jordan, you might recall, our full year guidance relative to 2021 inflation is 2.25%. We still feel good with that. When you think about materials costs, those are largely contracted and that really flows through our capital line. Obviously, our wages are set for the year. And other purchase services, we do those on contractual basis as well. We'll look and see what inflation looks like next year. Certainly, it's setting up that that might be greater. But in terms of how we're looking at 2021, we're still good with that initial guidance.\nJordan Alliger: And just as a quick follow-up, maybe you said this before, can you give the dollar amount for the real estate gain and the tax benefit? Thanks.\nJennifer Hamann: The dollar amount for the real estate gain, I think I have that right in front of my head. It was $0.13 together between real estate and the taxes is what the gain was. And of course, you'll recall that last year, we had an $0.08 benefit from real estates. So net-net, those came down to a $0.05 good guide.\nJordan Alliger: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Wetherbee: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Maybe we talk a little bit about the productivity outlook for the rest of the year, maybe you could help us kind of give a little bit of color around the various buckets and maybe where do you see the better opportunities in the back-half of the year? And then how does kind of service sort of play in with that opportunity to get obviously a little bit more than half for the rest of the year? Just kind of curious if that service dynamic kind of make that a little bit more challenging to get, or are there other sort of areas of momentum that kind of make you feel pretty good about that $500 million?\nLance Fritz: Eric, do you want to talk a little bit about that?\nEric Gehringer: Sure. So we did reaffirm the fact that we're still targeting $500 million. Regarding your question about the service and thinking about some of the transitory events we've shared, I'll just give you one example. I mentioned before, train length is a large productivity driver for us. And as a result of some of the transitory events, we've had to be intentional with actually reducing train length temporarily, and a couple trains as we think about getting them on a different reroute path than they would normally go. So, certainly you could consider that to be a headwind. You still have a whole team of people here that are committed with a number of different initiatives to still drive towards that $500 million by the end of the year.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is coming from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC. Please proceed with your questions.\nJames McGarragle: Hey, this is James McGarragle. I'm on for all Walter Spracklin this morning. Appreciate you taking my questions. My question was on the pricing environment, kind of how sustainable you believe it is going to be longer-term? Are you seeing the opportunity to lock in higher rates for longer with customers that want to increase certainty of real capacity?\nKenny Rocker: Yeah, thanks for that. I don't think I'm prepared to go out and forecast how long we think that strength will be there. What I will talk about is the fact that, as we do have this reliable service product that Eric has put out in front of us, along with some of the market dynamics on the truck inside it, it clearly has afforded us the opportunity to go out there and take some pretty robust pricing to the market. But as it stands now, I would expect that the favorable pricing environment withstand, at least throughout this year, and then we'll see what happens if we turn a corner in the next year.\nLance Fritz: And you said something important, Kenny, that I want to make sure we don't miss on the call. We've talked about the transitory issues that we've gotten in the network, we showed some of the service reflections of that. But PSR and the fact that we've transformed our railroad has us in a whole different ballpark of performance than these kinds of issues would have us in three, four, five years ago. And we shouldn't miss that. We're not proud of it. We know we have an opportunity and an expectation to improve and improve rapidly, when for instance, we get the bridge back, et cetera. But the overall performance, like we showed from \u201819 to \u201821, is fundamentally difference under our PSR transformation.\nKenny Rocker: Lance, when we're talking to our customers, they certainly respect the recoverability, beat of recoverability that we have today that we didn't have a few years ago.\nLance Fritz: Yeah.\nJames McGarragle: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is coming from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Vernon: Hey, guys, thanks for the time. So Lance, we heard the word transitory a couple times here around the issue of service disruptions. I just wanted to dig into that a little bit. We heard from one of the other we did today that there's actually some issues, staffing the railroad, getting resources to come back off of the inactive boards, maybe even having to kind of reach into the checkbook and put some labor incentives out there. I'd love to kind of get your perspective on the ability to add resource to the extent that we see a better stronger demand environment? Kenny\u2019s teams do well, sort of convincing people to use the rail? How do you feel about the friction cost that might come if we actually do end up in a better demand environment?\nLance Fritz: That's a great question, David. And I certainly hope we do end up with a better volume environment, and it just forces us to keep bringing more resources. Let's start with labor, right now, we're really not seeing substantial problems hiring labor. We've got a couple of issues with very different skill sets, most of those are in our non-agreement workforce, like data scientists or machine learning scientists. But when it comes to hire and TE&Y, the core team that actually runs our transportation product, there might be a spot like LA where it's relatively harder to hire than somewhere else. But it's not -- we're not yet in a place where we think that's an impediment. We don't have to do anything at this moment special to try to attract people to the jobs. Now, longer-term, for sure, we do have initiatives and understand that we've got to make our jobs more attractive over time, so that we can continue to attract a really big pool to our jobs. And that includes our national negotiation on right now, where we think taking somebody out of a capital locomotive and putting them on the ground, actually makes the job more attractive. It makes it a job that stays at home and turns it into shift work. So that kind of answers your labor question. Other assets, we think about bringing locomotives out to support the network. We're actually doing that right now because the reroutes require more power. And some of those locomotives are a little more costly to repair and get into operating condition. But again, that's a temporary thing. Once those reroutes are done, and we're able to get the network back to its normal routing, those locomotives are going to go right back into storage. So, I just don't see anything other than maybe the international intermodal issue that looks like it's going to last for a little while, until demand and supply gets balanced. That's really going to get in the way.\nJennifer Hamann: I was just going to add to that, we still have about 800 or 900 folks on the team in Y-sides that are furloughed, and a larger number on the mechanical and engineering side. So that's always our first draw to the extent we can. And now some of those folks have been off for quite a while, but our retention rate is still I think, kind of 70% or so. So, still a pretty good hit rate there.\nDavid Vernon: That's great. I guess, maybe just as a follow-up, you guys had talked about opening up some new intermodal services, new terminal, things like that. Has the issues that you're dealing with in terms of the international intermodal sort of impacted the ability to ramp up the pop up facility in Minnesota, the new facility in LA? Is there any sort of delay in that domestic growth story that we should be expecting because of a knock on effect from the temporal disruption of international?\nKenny Rocker: David, this is Kenny. We've been very excited. You look at Inland Empire, we've got a small group of customers that have been there. We started up in call it, I think it was June 21, and started our first units on the 22nd, and that's been growing. We share the run rate at the Investor Day where we see that. And then the same is true with Twin Cities, that started the first week in January. We've seen the volume increase throughout the year. We've seen more customers attracted to that product. So, on both fronts, we\u2019re encouraged and we have not seen aside from call it some of the wildfires, we haven't seen really anything structural impact that in a negative light.\nDavid Vernon: Alright. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.\nJustin Long: Thanks, and good morning. Maybe a two part question for Eric. I was wondering if you could provide your thoughts around the progression of trip plan compliance, as we get into the back-half of the year. And then Kenny, any update on new business wins either from truckload or some of your rail competitors? And how that could influence volumes in the quarters ahead?\nEric Gehringer: So, I'll start. So if you look at the bridge outage in Northern California combined with the wildfires east of there, we've done the work to see the impact of TPC, and you're talking about five to eight points in percentage increase in that metric. After that, what's ahead of us, Justin is really our continued work on variability reduction, looking at every opportunity, as we think about dwelling terminals, as we think about train stops online a road, how do we understand how to avoid those in the future, and then putting up either new process or new mechanism in this place to do that. So still lots of work ahead of us, still a team focused very critically on ensuring that we return the service to what our customers expect.\nKenny Rocker: Yeah. Thanks for that question. Yeah, we've been able to secure quite a bit of business that has been moving over the road. You think about some of the products like lumber and paper, we've been encouraged there. We just talked about the Inland Empire and the Twin Cities and the benefits that we've seen there. I think one of the things that have really opened up for us with this lower cost structure and more reliable services, really some of the markets that were shorter distances that might have been call it less than 500 miles. We've seen tremendous uptick there. And then we're excited about the pizza business that we will see come onto our line next year. We got an opportunity to meet with the Knight-Swift folks, and we're impressed with their management team, and leadership team. So we're looking forward to growth here in the near-term and the future. The demand is strong, and we want to take advantage of it.\nJustin Long: Okay. Thanks for the time.\nLance Fritz: Thanks, Justin.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Seidl: Thank you, operator. Good morning, Lance and the rest of the team. I wanted to talk a little bit about conversations with shippers. As we look out to the future obviously, the executive order was a lot less worse than I think the original Wall Street Journal article had some of us believe, but it does sort of bring the rails back in the spotlight with potential increased regulations. Is that going to change any of the discussions that you guys think you're going to have going on into the future with some shippers? I\u2019ve spoken to a few which I think are thinking about bringing it up when they renegotiate their next contracts. I'm just trying to think this through, because clearly, we're starting to see some rail cost inflation in here. And you guys are going to need to push rates even higher to get that same spread going forward. How should we think about this as we look out into 2022?\nLance Fritz: Jason, this is Lance. Let me take a first stab at how we think about the EO and the relationship to the STB, where you're really talking about regulation, and then maybe some of the rest of the team have perspective on it. So baseline, you know that railroads perform a critical function in the economy. We provide affordable shipping for bulk products in large volume. We provide really high paying union jobs. We help people reduce their carbon intensity and their carbon emissions. And we do all of that investing in our own infrastructure. So we're a solution to a number of the things that the current administration emphasize across their different departments, their different functions. And we think when we look at the EO, the EO really needs to be looked through the lens of all of government perspective. There's some things in the EO that looked like they would fight against initiatives that the Department of Transportation, the EPA, OMB, Amtrak, are trying to accomplish with the help of freight railroads. So number one is we're trying to help all of the administration understand the impact of some of what they've got inside the EO in terms of urging the STB to reregulate the railroad. And so, stepping back a little further, we've been helping the STB see the impact of potential regulation and the multiplicity of regulation, and the retarding impact that could have on our ability, for instance, to help relieve highways, to take trucks off the highway and bring them onto the railroad, to continue to help industries reduce their greenhouse gas footprints. And doing it all with an ability to invest in our own infrastructure. So this just says we've got continued work to do. I don't think it's more work, I don't think it's a unique set of new work. It's the same work we've been doing for years and years, helping the STB understand when they regulate what the negative impacts could be if they get it wrong.\nKenny Rocker: And all I add is, we have customers that from time to time will ask us what we think of the EO discussion, and we reflect the comments that Lance just mentioned. But we haven't seen any of our customers try to insert that into negotiations of our business.\nJason Seidl: Lance, well put and Kenny, thank you for that color. One quick follow-up on all this. Kenny, as you look at the service product, and as you start to clear up some of the bottlenecks. I mean, clearly, it's a compelling one to take some trucks off of the road. But one thing also when I speak to railroad shippers, supply chain visibility always comes into play. And we're seeing some improvement, I think across the railroad space. Can you update us on what UP is doing to increase the supply chain visibility for the shippers?\nKenny Rocker: Yeah, so a number of things. We've been pretty aggressive on that front. And Rahul Jalali, our new CIO has really sparked that too. We've been what I'll call overzealous in terms of API development for our customers. We have a significant number of our customers that are utilizing APIs now. And the value of doing that is not just what we're pushing for is not just on our rail line, but also from an inner line basis. I talked a little bit earlier about the fact that even on our international intermodal side, that we work with the ports also so that we can see inside the terminals and what's coming to them, it\u2019s a key focus. The other part of that is customers want visibility, they also want to know what's going to happen if there is a disruption or something that is going to happen next. And we've been working with operating also make sure we have proactive feedback from a technology perspective there. So, we feel really good about the visibility that we've inserted, and that we're providing customers. And clearly, for the customers that are not as sophisticated, there's room for us to share that more with the receiver. We feel good about the work we've done with the larger customers.\nLance Fritz: Yeah, Jason, very clearly, there's a strategic imperative that's right in front of us in the international intermodal supply chain. More transparency, more coordination across the whole supply chain, probably would be addressing the issues that we've got today in advance. And so, there's an imperative there, we see it, we're positioned to take care of it with our product portfolio and our platforms, and we're going after it.\nJason Seidl: That's great news, for sure. Appreciate the update, guys. Thanks as always.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nAmit Mehrotra: Hey, thanks, everybody. So, I just had a couple quick ones. One is, we talked a lot about pricing, but I don't think you guys mentioned where we are actually in the pricing cycle. There's obviously inflation everywhere in the freight economy. I think it just be helpful to understand how closely your book of business today reflects the current market dynamics? And what the runway is on that, if you can just update us on that? And then, Kenny, there's just a lot of growth coming from intermodal, and that seems to be the place of secular growth. I think, you mentioned you won the contract with Knight-Swift as well. The issue with that is, as you know better than I do, there's extra costs that come with that growth. There's lower revenue intensity, if I can call it that way, associated with intermodal. There are other rails there's one particular other rail that's kind of proactively trying to balance out that secular mix dynamic through acquisitions, trucking company, for example. What can you do aside from riding the wave of industrial production growth? And there's going to be a wave over the next couple of years. But aside from that, what can you do proactively to lean into some of the higher value carloads that offset some of the intermodal headwinds the mixed drag that you have? Thank you.\nLance Fritz: Kenny, do you want to take all of that?\nJennifer Hamann: Well, let me jump in, I'll give the first part just to remind the focus and stats in terms of what our portfolio looks like and what we can touch. So, if you look at our revenue portfolio, about 45% is under multi-year deals. And there's some amount of assets turning on an annual basis. But then, we have about 30%, that's one year contracts or less than duration, and then about 25% that's kind of our tariff or spot business. And that's primarily in some of the construction products and grain. So, think of our portfolio in that sense and you think about kind of pricing cycle. And then Kenny, I\u2019ll let you add.\nAmit Mehrotra: But the 30%, is the 30% rerate towards the end of the year or for the year? How does that 30% breakdown?\nLance Fritz: Across the year.\nJennifer Hamann: Across the year, yeah.\nAmit Mehrotra: Got you. Okay.\nKenny Rocker: Yeah, just real quick. All I can tell you is that we have seen acceleration from the book of business that we have been able to touch. Jennifer talked about that, we think if we've been able to achieve more price on that as we move throughout the year. The larger question that you asked about growing that business faster than industrial production, which we've committed to over the long-term, we feel very confident about the products that we have within our loop network. We dray a tremendous amount of business. We do a lot of trains loading for customers.  We're playing in those areas today. So it's not something that we cannot do. We're also providing whether you call it team tracks that are out there, whether you call it added services with chopping up some of the wood or aggregating some of the cement and rock. We want to continue to build that out and provide more of those services. And to someone that asked a little bit earlier provide a little bit more of that shipment visibility to make it stickier for our customers to move on ourselves. So, that's something that we will continue to do. That's something that we have to do. We have to make sure that to the customer we look not just only like a railroad but a logistics transportation provider.\nAmit Mehrotra: Got it. Okay. Thank you. Congrats on the results. Appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nCherilyn Radbourne: Thanks very much, and good morning. Just a question on grain, you highlighted in your comments tight grain supply in Q3 and typical comps in Q4. But the outlook for grain and grain products is still characterized as positive overall. So, just hoping for a bit more color there? Thanks.\nKenny Rocker: All I\u2019m saying is that demand is strong for grain. It was very strong the back-half of last year. So, to be above those comps are going to be pretty challenging. But, we feel very positive and have a positive outlook about that demand and being able to capture it. And working with Eric\u2019s team, we want to maximize all the volume that's out there.\nLance Fritz: Yeah, demand looks pretty strong, Kenny. We're kind of starting to shift over to what's the crop going to look like that we serve.\nCherilyn Radbourne: That's all from me. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nJeff Kauffman: Thank you very much, and congratulations. A question for Jen, you mentioned that you're targeting about $7 billion in free cash on the year, which is amazing. And you did about $3 billion in the first-half of the year, so that implies $4 billion in the second-half of the year. So about $500 million a quarter give or take extra. But the operating profits are not rising by that much, if I look at the updated guidance on margins and volumes. So could you help me understand what's occurring that's helping drive a little more that free cash flow generation in the second-half of the year?\nJennifer Hamann: Well, Jeff, just to clarify, when we talked about the $7 billion that's related to share repurchases, not working cash flow generation.\nJeff Kauffman: Oh, okay.\nJennifer Hamann: And, and as you know, we are using our balance sheet and our EBITDA growth to be able to fund some of those share repurchases. So, I referenced we did the $2 billion in May, and that was funded through debt issuance. So, we do see cash growing. Some of that in terms of the free cash flow fall is impacted by the fact that we did have, and I mentioned this in my remarks, taxes year-over-year relative to the Cares Act are higher and impacting some of that free cash flow a little bit more. But the comments on the $7 billion were specific to share repurchases.\nJeff Kauffman: Now that answers my question. I just couldn't get the math to work. So thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we've reached the end of a question-and-answer session. And I'd like to turn the floor back to Mr. Lance Fritz for closing comments.\nLance Fritz: Thank you, Rob, and thank you all for your questions. We're looking forward to talking with you again in October to discuss our third quarter results. Until then, I wish everyone good health. Take care and goodbye.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Eric Gehringer",
            "content": "Thanks, Lance, and good morning. I'd like to begin by thanking the entire operating department for their support, our customers through the many transitory challenges we've faced during the first-half of this year. While we don't see these events impacting us long-term, there's real work to be done to get past them. Moving to Slide 4. Taking a look at our key performance metrics for the quarter. It's important to note that year-over-year comparisons are a little skewed. 2020 included a couple historically low volume months at the start of the pandemic. So as Lance said, we've provided a 2019 comparison to give a little more context to more normal, seasonal volumes. Freight car velocity improved from 2019 due to the execution of PSR principles that reduced freight car terminal dwell and improved train speeds. However, we still have work to do to return to running a more fluid network, with the goal to return this metric back to the 220 miles per day range to 230 miles per day range we achieved earlier this year. As you can see, our service reliability as measured by trip plan compliance has improved over the time in both service categories. However, current quarterly metrics do not meet our expectations or that of our customers. Disruptions in the international supply chains, especially in the intermodal space, have impacted our network significantly. At the expense of our own service metrics, we chose to help reduce port congestion by moving more assets into dock operations. But that West Coast port congestion has now moved East, and is affecting some of our inland terminals, most notably in Chicago. We are working proactively with our commercial team and ocean carrier customers to address the congestion, while continuing to sustain shipment volumes, to and from the ports. To help alleviate the congestion and maintain fluidity, we also temporarily reopened Global III in Chicago for use as an inland storage. We are also working with our customers to develop additional storage and transportation options. We will continue to work with all members of the supply chain, our ocean carrier customers, beneficial cargo owners, port operators, chassis providers, and dray carriers to mean the fluidity of international freight flows. During the first-half, our network has been impacted by weather and costly rail equipment incidents as well. We have made good progress on reducing the frequency of rail incidents. However, the location of a couple of the incidents occurring on our East West main corridor and our sunset route had a notable effect on both intermodal and manifest auto trip plan compliance measures. Ultimately, we recognize the importance of improving these metrics to support our customers and our long-term growth strategy. Turning to Slide 5. We continue to make good progress in our efficiency measures, as both locomotive and workforce productivity improved in the quarter. Improvement in locomotive productivity was the result of running an efficient transportation plan that requires fewer locomotives. Workforce productivity was an all-time quarterly record, driven by an increase in daily car miles of more than 20%, while workforce levels remained flat. These improvements were also driven by our continued focus on growing train linked, which has grown by 9% since the second quarter 2020 to just over 9,400 feet. Increasing and more consistent volumes provide the team with more optionality to adjust transportation plans. We will continue to focus on train length to run a more efficient and reliable railroad for our customers. Turning to Slide 6. One driver of the continued increase in train length is our siding extension program. Through the first-half of the year, we've completed seven sidings and began construction or the bidding process on more than 20 additional sidings. Through growing train size, other productivity initiatives and technology, our fuel consumption rate was a second quarter record, improving 3% compared to last year. The operating department understands the important role we play in achieving our long-term greenhouse gas emission goals. Wrapping up on Slide 7. The entire team is focused on performing our work safer every day. Year-to-date, our safety results have been mixed. Real equipment incidents have decreased, but personal injuries increased. To address personal injuries, we are maturing our peer-to-peer safety programs, which is a continuation and next level of our Courage-to-Care program. Recently, our network has been impacted by wildfires in Northern California. Our Dry Canyon Bridge north of Redding, California sustained significant structural damage. The team is working around the clock to repair the bridge. Current projections have a reopening in late August. We are actively rerouting traffic in that area, which requires additional crew and locomotive resources, as well as adding transit time to those customer shipments. Ultimately, I have the utmost confidence that we will guide our network through these transitory challenges, and return our service product to the level our customers expect and deserve. The team did an excellent job during the quarter and how efficiently we added volume to our network. PSR remains our guiding principle and the improvements you've seen, and our productivity and operating efficiency speaks to that commitment. Our ability to be far more volume variable with our cost structure is a testament to our employees who execute the plan every day. With that, I will turn it over to Kenny to provide an update on the business environment. The accumulation of initiatives, and we've talked before about the fact that we've got more than a dozen initiatives. The big ones continue to be our work on modernizing locomotives, implementation of BMS, with 800 more units this year. And even things as we look at continuing to invest in our waste side lubrication, all those point in the direction of being able to continue to become more fuel efficient. Absolutely. Thank you for the question, Allison. So, to your point, yes, the siding extension work was seven completed and 20 more to be completed for the year, at the end of the year, certainly assist us in our efforts to be able to grow train lengths. As I've mentioned before, though, we also have our process improvement, which is really focused on our transportation plan and looking at how we combine trains. I'm not going to guide you to a specific number by the end of the year. What I will certainly tell you, though, is that the entire team understands it's one of our single biggest levers to continue to drive productivity. And we're all focused on it day after day. I'll also point out that as we've been working through some of these transitory events, i.e. the bridge outage on the I-V that will become a temporary headwind to us in the beginning of the third quarter that does not stop all of our efforts, so they continue to grow that through the rest of the year. Thank you, Allison. Sure. So we did reaffirm the fact that we're still targeting $500 million. Regarding your question about the service and thinking about some of the transitory events we've shared, I'll just give you one example. I mentioned before, train length is a large productivity driver for us. And as a result of some of the transitory events, we've had to be intentional with actually reducing train length temporarily, and a couple trains as we think about getting them on a different reroute path than they would normally go. So, certainly you could consider that to be a headwind. You still have a whole team of people here that are committed with a number of different initiatives to still drive towards that $500 million by the end of the year. So, I'll start. So if you look at the bridge outage in Northern California combined with the wildfires east of there, we've done the work to see the impact of TPC, and you're talking about five to eight points in percentage increase in that metric. After that, what's ahead of us, Justin is really our continued work on variability reduction, looking at every opportunity, as we think about dwelling terminals, as we think about train stops online a road, how do we understand how to avoid those in the future, and then putting up either new process or new mechanism in this place to do that. So still lots of work ahead of us, still a team focused very critically on ensuring that we return the service to what our customers expect."

            "name": "Jennifer Hamann",
            "content": "Thanks, Kenny, and good morning. As you heard from Lance, Union Pacific recorded record second quarter financials with earnings per share of $2.72 and an operating ratio of 55.1%. Rise in fuel prices throughout the quarter and the two month lag on our fuel surcharge programs, negatively impacted our quarterly ratio by 210 basis points, and earnings per share by $0.04. Below the line, our previously announced real estate gain and a lower effective tax rate associated with reduced corporate tax rates in three states added $0.13 to earnings per share. Partially offsetting that good news in 2021 is a real estate gain of $0.08 recorded in last year second quarter. Setting aside the impact of one-time items and fuel, UP's core operational performance drove operating ratio improvement of 800 basis points, and added $1.04 to earnings per share. These results are a clear demonstration of how we are positioned to efficiently leverage volume growth to the bottom-line. Looking now at our second quarter income statement on Slide 15, where we're showing a comparison of this quarter's results to second quarter 2020, as well as 2019. This is to provide additional context to our results by comparing periods with more normal seasonal volume levels. For perspective, seven day car loadings in the second quarter of 2019 were almost 166,000, versus only 133,000 in 2020, and then rebounding this year to 163,000. So, not quite back to pre-pandemic levels. For second quarter 2021, the combination of operating revenue up 30% and operating expense only up 17%, illustrates our efficient handling of volume growth to produce record quarterly operating income of $2.5 billion. Net income of $1.8 billion and earnings per share also were quarterly records. Looking more closely at second quarter revenue, Slide 16 provides a breakdown of our freight revenue, both on a year-over-year basis and sequentially versus the first quarter. Freight revenue totaled $5.1 billion in the second quarter, up 29% compared to 2020, and up 10% compared to the first quarter. Looking first at the year-over-year analysis, volume was the largest driver up 22% against the pandemic impacted second quarter 2020 volumes. Fuel surcharges increased freight revenue by 425 basis points compared to last year, as our fuel surcharge programs adjusted to rise in fuel prices. And as we experienced a strong demand environment, our pricing actions continue to yield dollars in excess of inflation. On a year-over-year basis, those gains were further supplemented by a slightly positive business mix, driving in total 300 basis points of improvement. Looking at freight revenue sequentially, volume was again the largest driver of growth, up 875 basis points against weather impacted first quarter volumes. Sequentially, fuel surcharge increased freight revenue 275 basis points. Business mix was actually negative sequentially, more than offsetting positive pricing gains and creating a 100 basis point headwind. Now, let's move on to Slide 17, which provides a summary of our second quarter operating expenses. With volumes up 22% in the quarter, our benchmark of success is growing expenses at a slower rate. And as you have seen through our results, we did an excellent job of being more than volume variable with our cost structure. Looking at the individual lines, compensation and benefits expenses up 13% versus 2020. Second quarter workforce levels were flat compared to last year, generating very strong workforce productivity, as Eric described. Specifically, our train and engine workforce continues to be more than volume variable up only 10%, while management, engineering and mechanical workforces together decreased 5%. Offsetting some of this productivity was an elevated cost per employee, up 13% as we experienced increased overtime, and more recently, higher recrew costs associated with some of our network outages. Other drivers of the increase were wage inflation, the negative comparison against last year's management actions in response to the pandemic, as well as higher year-over-year incentive compensation. Quarterly fuel expense increased over 100% driven by a 71% increase in fuel prices, and the 22% increase in volumes. Offsetting some of this expense was a 3% improvement in our fuel consumption rate, driven by our energy management initiative and a more fuel efficient business mix. Purchase services and materials expense increased 8%, primarily due to higher volume related subsidiary drayage costs, as well as other volume related expenses, such as transportation and lodging for our train crews. These increases were partially offset by around $35 million of favorable one-time items. Equipment and other rents actually decreased 5% or $11 million, driven by decreased rent expense on stored equipment and higher TTX equity income, partially offset by volume increases. The other expense line increased 21% or $49 million this quarter, driven by last year's $25 million insurance reimbursement, higher casualty expenses and higher state and local taxes. Lastly, as previously announced in an 8-K during the quarter, we expect our annual effective tax rate to be closer to 23% for the year. Looking now at our efficiency results on Slide 18, despite some of the operational challenges that Eric discussed, we continue to generate solid productivity. Second quarter productivity totaled $130 million, bringing our year-to-date total to $235 million. Productivity results continue to be led by train length improvements and locomotive productivity. As we stated at our Investor Day, a better long-term indicator of our efficiency is incremental margins. So looking at this quarter, we achieved a very strong incremental margins of 78%, demonstrating the positive impact PSR is having on our operating models. Turning to Slide 19, cash from operations in the first-half of 2021 decreased slightly to $4.2 billion from $4.4 billion in 2020, a 4% decline. This decrease was the result of deferred tax payments last year. Our cash flow conversion rate was a strong 96%, and free cash flow increased in the first-half up $142 million or 9%, highlighting our ongoing capital discipline. Supported by our strong cash generation and cash balances, we've returned $5.4 billion to shareholders year-to-date, as we increased our industry-leading dividend by 10% in May, and repurchased 19 million shares totaling $4.1 billion. This includes the initial delivery of a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase program established during the quarter, and funded by new debt issued in mid-May. We finished the second quarter with a comparable adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.8 times, on par with the first quarter. Wrapping up on Slide 20, we are optimistic about what's ahead in the back-half of 2021. From a volume standpoint, we are increasing our growth outlook for the full year to around 7%, which includes just over a one point headwind from ongoing energy market challenges. We also see tough comparisons in both intermodal and grain, as well as continued impacts from the semiconductor shortage. And as you heard Kenny mentioned, supply chain challenges in the intermodal space are likely to slow asset turns and impact loading. On the flip side, we see growing confidence in the industrial sector, and the team is successfully executing on our plan to grow and win with customers. Looking at operating ratio, we're dropping the low end of our initial range and now expect to achieve roughly 200 basis points of improvement, or an operating ratio closer to 56.5% for full year 2021. With that strengthening outlook, cash generation is growing as is our plan for share repurchases, which we would target at approximately $7 billion or $1 billion more than we had originally planned. Finally, I want to acknowledge that these record results would not be possible without our great workforce. Behind each of these numbers is a member of the UP team, who works safely and efficiently to attract new business and serve our customers. And with UP's new employee stock purchase plan, the entire team has more opportunity to benefit from the company's success. So with that, I'll turn it back to Lance. Yes. So Brian, I'll jump in here. You're right from a mix -- we did have a little bit better performance there relative to mix, as we saw the coal and the grain continued strong. Whether or not that continues, you've heard Kenny talk about coal staying stable, so that may help us. But our primary efforts relative to fuel consumption are really around how we're running our locomotive fleet, the technology that we're using, and mix is just kind of a benefit sometimes, but not something that we're counting on. We know that we need to drive that change ourselves. In terms of how we look at mix overall for the back-half of the year, we do see some ongoing pressure, particularly with grain. We had very strong grain last year, and so grain plays a big role in that mix. And as I look just at the third quarter, autos could potentially play a role there. It was beneficial a little bit in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis, but not sequentially to your point. And so, we're really watching that chip shortage to see what happens with autos. Intermodal is going to stay strong, and we're maybe losing a little bit of the top side there relative to some of these supply chain challenges. But those are the things to watch for, and obviously you guys get good visibility to that throughout the quarter. I don't believe there was anything special that we did this quarter. Eric, I don't know if you want to comment on that. Thanks, Scott. So, in terms of the equipment incidents, we would kind of put all of our casualty costs together. So yes, we did have some equipment incidents. We have a little bit higher expense, in terms of some of our environmental and personal injury accruals. And I'd say all in that cost is probably about a nickel on the quarter. So that's how I would size that. In terms of the operating ratio and margins, our incremental margins in the second quarter 78%, very strong. I think we can maintain that pace through the back-half. If you think about our operating ratio guidance, though, the 56.5% just mathematically, that would say that we're not probably going to see sequential level improvements. We do have tougher comps, as we move into the back-half of 2021. And we see volumes being, I'll say kind of flattish sequentially. If we can get some upside there, obviously, that could help as well. No, absolutely. And of course, that all goes into our longer-term guidance that you're aware of Scott, in terms of getting to that 55 next year, and then having long-term incrementals in the mid to high 60s. Yeah. And to your point Ken, we did up our volume outlook. But if you look at that, that really says we're pretty flat from where we're at today in terms of ending the second quarter out through the end of the year. And July is off to a bit of a slower start, which isn't unusual. You've got the 4th of July holiday, but right now our seven day run rate for July is kind of the high 150. So we've got to see that pickup. And obviously some of these transitory issues that are going on in the intermodal space are having an impact on that top-line. So I feel very good, 56.5 would be a record performance and sets us up great going forward. Yeah, that's exactly right, Lance. So with regard to inflation, Jordan, you might recall, our full year guidance relative to 2021 inflation is 2.25%. We still feel good with that. When you think about materials costs, those are largely contracted and that really flows through our capital line. Obviously, our wages are set for the year. And other purchase services, we do those on contractual basis as well. We'll look and see what inflation looks like next year. Certainly, it's setting up that that might be greater. But in terms of how we're looking at 2021, we're still good with that initial guidance. The dollar amount for the real estate gain, I think I have that right in front of my head. It was $0.13 together between real estate and the taxes is what the gain was. And of course, you'll recall that last year, we had an $0.08 benefit from real estates. So net-net, those came down to a $0.05 good guide. I was just going to add to that, we still have about 800 or 900 folks on the team in Y-sides that are furloughed, and a larger number on the mechanical and engineering side. So that's always our first draw to the extent we can. And now some of those folks have been off for quite a while, but our retention rate is still I think, kind of 70% or so. So, still a pretty good hit rate there. Well, let me jump in, I'll give the first part just to remind the focus and stats in terms of what our portfolio looks like and what we can touch. So, if you look at our revenue portfolio, about 45% is under multi-year deals. And there's some amount of assets turning on an annual basis. But then, we have about 30%, that's one year contracts or less than duration, and then about 25% that's kind of our tariff or spot business. And that's primarily in some of the construction products and grain. So, think of our portfolio in that sense and you think about kind of pricing cycle. And then Kenny, I'll let you add. Across the year, yeah. Well, Jeff, just to clarify, when we talked about the $7 billion that's related to share repurchases, not working cash flow generation. And, and as you know, we are using our balance sheet and our EBITDA growth to be able to fund some of those share repurchases. So, I referenced we did the $2 billion in May, and that was funded through debt issuance. So, we do see cash growing. Some of that in terms of the free cash flow fall is impacted by the fact that we did have, and I mentioned this in my remarks, taxes year-over-year relative to the Cares Act are higher and impacting some of that free cash flow a little bit more. But the comments on the $7 billion were specific to share repurchases."

            "content": "Thank you, Eric, and good morning. Our second quarter volume was up 22% from a year ago, as all of our major markets improved from the economic shutdown that we saw from the onset of the pandemic. Freight revenue was up 29%, due to the volume increase coupled with a higher fuel surcharge and core pricing gains. We clearly have easy comp this quarter versus last year. In order to provide a little more color into the current business, I will also share our sequential comparison to the first quarter, as I walk through each of the business groups. So, let's get started with our bulk commodity. Revenue for the quarter was up 19% compared to last year, driven by a 13% increase in volume, and a 5% increase in average revenue per car, reflecting core pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenue. Coal and renewable carloads grew 6% year-over-year and 14% from the first quarter, due to higher natural gas prices supporting domestic coal demand, Winter Storm Uri in the first quarter, as well as increased coal exports. Grain and grain products were up 22% year-over-year due to the strength in both domestic and export grain. Ethanol shipments also continue to improve as production recovers from COVID-related shutdown. Fertilizer carloads were up 2% year-over-year and 23% from the first quarter, due to strong agricultural demand and seasonality of fertilizer applications. And finally, food and refrigerated volume was up 17% year-over-year and 7% from the first quarter, driven primarily by higher consumer demand, as the economy recovers from COVID, along with increased growth from truck penetration. Moving on to industrial, industrial revenue improved 24% for the quarter, driven by a 15% increase in volume, coupled with an 8% increase in average revenue per car from a positive mix of traffic, core pricing gains and a higher fuel surcharge. Energy and specialized shipments were up 20% year-over-year, but we're down 1% compared to the first quarter, as strength in specialized shipments were offset by fewer crude oil shipments, and seasonal LPG demand. Forest products continues to be a bright spot, as second quarter volumes grew 28% year-over-year and 7% over the first quarter. Lumber drove this increase from strong housing start, repairing remodels, along with further penetration from product moving over the road. Industrial chemicals and plastics shipments were up 11% for both year-over-year and the first quarter comparison. The sequential growth was driven by the recovery of the Gulf Coast production rates from the February storm and improved demand. Metals and minerals volumes was up 12% year-over-year and 25% from the first quarter, driven by increased rock shipments and stronger steel demand, as the industrial sectors recover. Turning now to Premium, revenue for the quarter was up 50% on a 31% increase in volume. Average revenue per car increased by 14% from higher fuel surcharge revenue, positive mix of traffic and core pricing gains. Automotive volume was up 119% year-over-year, but down 4% compared to the first quarter, driven by shortages for semiconductor-related parts. Intermodal volume increased by 21% year-over-year, and 10% from the first quarter. Domestic intermodal improved from continuous strength in retail sales and recent business wins, parcel in particular, benefited from the ongoing strength in e-commerce. International intermodal saw continued strength in containerize import, despite congestion in the overall global supply chain. Now, looking ahead to the back-half of 2021. Starting out with our bulk commodities, we expect coal to remain stable for the remainder of the year, based on the current natural gas futures as well as export demand. Our food and refrigerated shipments should continue to be strong, as the nation recovers from COVID coupled with truck penetration wins. We're also optimistic with our grain products business, as ethanol shipments will improve from increased consumer demand, and our focus in growing the renewable diesel market. Lastly, while we see positive signs for the upcoming grain harvest and strengthen export demand, we expect tight supply in the third quarter, as well as top year-over-year comparisons in the back-half of the year. As we look ahead to our industrial commodities, the year-over-year comps for our energy market are favorable. However, there is still uncertainty with crew plans supporting crew by warehouse shipments. We continue to be encouraged by the strength and the industrial production forecast for the rest of 2021, which will positively impact many of our markets. In addition, forest product volume will remain strong for us in the second-half of the year. And lastly for premium, automotive sales are forecasted to increase from 14 million units in 2020 to almost 17 million in 2021. However, we are keeping a watchful eye on the supply chain issues for parts related to the semiconductor chip. Now switching to intermodal, on the international side we expect demand to remain strong through the rest of the year. The entire supply chain continues to be constrained by most notably to haul away our containers from our inland ramp. But I've been pleased with the collaboration between our commercial and operating teams, as we work together to create solutions for our international customers to improve service and network fluidity. With regard to domestic intermodal, limited truck capacity will encourage conversion from over the road to rail, tampered by constraint on chassis supply. Retail inventories remained historically low, and restocking of inventory along with continued strength in the sales should drive intermodal volumes higher for the remainder of this year. Overall, I'm encouraged by the improving economic outlook, but more importantly, by our commercial teams' intensity and ability to win in the marketplace. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jennifer. Yeah, Lance, you said it right. Let me just back up for a minute and just say that this started with some pretty strong demand that we saw coming from international trade. And I'll tell you, Eric, and I jumped right in with our customers and all the supply chain members as soon as we saw this. And what I mean by that is first, we went out, we added more short rails, we added more long rails, we added more chassis, we increased the train start, we sat down with our customers on a daily basis, flew out to the ports and had executive meetings there. We also held an executive forum with all of the international intermodal customers to work through solutions. That's where we came up with a solution of G-III. What people don't know is we also came up with off ramp type solutions. And finally, we inserted loop to help with the BCOs to try to offer up solutions for more drayage off of our ramps. So, we've been working hand in hand with not only our customers, but everyone in the supply chain. And so, the pause that you see should help us balance the network. Now, on a broader level, this is transitory. We don't see this being around forever. We expect as the velocity continues to improve, absolutely, we're going to win more truck share. We've demonstrated that we can do it thus far, so we feel very good about what we see in the future. We're in the early stages right now. What I can say is that we're working on a daily basis to make sure that that demand matches the haul way. Thanks, Jon. You've got a lot of questions here, I'll try to answer them all. So first of all, the pricing environment, we're going to price to the market and there's tight dray capacity, there's tight truck capacity. You look at even the first part of this year, we felt good about the price that we were able to take. We've improved on that price acceleration as we moved now to the second-half of the year. I do think it's important for us to look at our intermodal business, and not call that or have a broad brush to say all of our challenges in international intermodal are playing out in other areas. So, we are able to get more price and volume there. And then the last question is about coal, and as we look for the rest of the year, for sure, as we look at where the futures are, we think that the run rate that we see today will be consistent for the rest of the year. Yeah, thanks for that. I don't think I'm prepared to go out and forecast how long we think that strength will be there. What I will talk about is the fact that, as we do have this reliable service product that Eric has put out in front of us, along with some of the market dynamics on the truck inside it, it clearly has afforded us the opportunity to go out there and take some pretty robust pricing to the market. But as it stands now, I would expect that the favorable pricing environment withstand, at least throughout this year, and then we'll see what happens if we turn a corner in the next year. Lance, when we're talking to our customers, they certainly respect the recoverability, beat of recoverability that we have today that we didn't have a few years ago. David, this is Kenny. We've been very excited. You look at Inland Empire, we've got a small group of customers that have been there. We started up in call it, I think it was June 21, and started our first units on the 22nd, and that's been growing. We share the run rate at the Investor Day where we see that. And then the same is true with Twin Cities, that started the first week in January. We've seen the volume increase throughout the year. We've seen more customers attracted to that product. So, on both fronts, we're encouraged and we have not seen aside from call it some of the wildfires, we haven't seen really anything structural impact that in a negative light. Yeah. Thanks for that question. Yeah, we've been able to secure quite a bit of business that has been moving over the road. You think about some of the products like lumber and paper, we've been encouraged there. We just talked about the Inland Empire and the Twin Cities and the benefits that we've seen there. I think one of the things that have really opened up for us with this lower cost structure and more reliable services, really some of the markets that were shorter distances that might have been call it less than 500 miles. We've seen tremendous uptick there. And then we're excited about the pizza business that we will see come onto our line next year. We got an opportunity to meet with the Knight-Swift folks, and we're impressed with their management team, and leadership team. So we're looking forward to growth here in the near-term and the future. The demand is strong, and we want to take advantage of it. And all I add is, we have customers that from time to time will ask us what we think of the EO discussion, and we reflect the comments that Lance just mentioned. But we haven't seen any of our customers try to insert that into negotiations of our business. Yeah, so a number of things. We've been pretty aggressive on that front. And Rahul Jalali, our new CIO has really sparked that too. We've been what I'll call overzealous in terms of API development for our customers. We have a significant number of our customers that are utilizing APIs now. And the value of doing that is not just what we're pushing for is not just on our rail line, but also from an inner line basis. I talked a little bit earlier about the fact that even on our international intermodal side, that we work with the ports also so that we can see inside the terminals and what's coming to them, it's a key focus. The other part of that is customers want visibility, they also want to know what's going to happen if there is a disruption or something that is going to happen next. And we've been working with operating also make sure we have proactive feedback from a technology perspective there. So, we feel really good about the visibility that we've inserted, and that we're providing customers. And clearly, for the customers that are not as sophisticated, there's room for us to share that more with the receiver. We feel good about the work we've done with the larger customers. Yeah, just real quick. All I can tell you is that we have seen acceleration from the book of business that we have been able to touch. Jennifer talked about that, we think if we've been able to achieve more price on that as we move throughout the year. The larger question that you asked about growing that business faster than industrial production, which we've committed to over the long-term, we feel very confident about the products that we have within our loop network. We dray a tremendous amount of business. We do a lot of trains loading for customers.  We're playing in those areas today. So it's not something that we cannot do. We're also providing whether you call it team tracks that are out there, whether you call it added services with chopping up some of the wood or aggregating some of the cement and rock. We want to continue to build that out and provide more of those services. And to someone that asked a little bit earlier provide a little bit more of that shipment visibility to make it stickier for our customers to move on ourselves. So, that's something that we will continue to do. That's something that we have to do. We have to make sure that to the customer we look not just only like a railroad but a logistics transportation provider. All I'm saying is that demand is strong for grain. It was very strong the back-half of last year. So, to be above those comps are going to be pretty challenging. But, we feel very positive and have a positive outlook about that demand and being able to capture it. And working with Eric's team, we want to maximize all the volume that's out there."

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Fritz. You may begin.\nLance Fritz: Thank you and good morning, everybody and welcome to Union Pacific's first quarter earnings conference call. With me today in Omaha are Eric Gehringer, Executive Vice President of Operations; Kenny rocker, Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales and Jennifer Hamann, our Chief Financial Officer. Before discussing first quarter results, I want to recognize our employees for their work during the major winter events we experienced in February and early March. Many of the communities we serve faced unprecedented weather conditions that damaged factories and made surface transportation nearly impossible. Our employees rose to the occasion to maintain or restore critical service in those areas while dealing with weather impacts art to their own homes and families. We owe a debt of gratitude to our team as they again proved the resiliency, their grid and their dedication to serve. Moving on first quarter results, this morning Union Pacific is reporting 2021 first quarter net income of $1.3 billion or $2 a share. This compares to $1.5 billion or $2.15 per share in the first quarter of 2020. Our quarterly operating ratio came in at 60.1%, reflecting the impact of weather and rising fuel prices in the quarter. As you will hear from the team, and see these items, our core results improved 150 basis points. We delivered strong productivity in very challenging conditions and based on our core performance, I remain optimistic about the remainder of the year. In fact we are affirming our 2021 guidance. While it was a tough quarter, that does not dampen our expectations. We're in a terrific position to take advantage of the improving economic outlook and grow our volume. Our service product, our cost structure and continuing productivity set us up for an outstanding year. To get us started reviewing the details, I will turn it over to Eric for an operations update.\nEric Gehringer: Thanks, Lance, and good morning. The operating team rose to the challenge of this past quarter as it responded to numerous weather challenges across the network. The speed with which the team recovered the network is a testament to the transformation PSR has had on our operations. Moving to Slide 4, we began 2021 with strong key performance indicators across the rough board as the operations were solid and running smooth in January. However, the winter weather challenges we faced in February and March across our network had a heavy impact. The South in particular is not accustomed to the whether they faced. In fact, the weather across our southern region represented the second worst stretch of cold temperatures in over 70 years. Through the team's hard work our network recovered quickly, and we were able to mitigate, most of the impact to our service. In fact, we recovered twice as fast compared to our recovery from the flooding in 2019 and significantly faster than any disruptions we experienced before implementation of PSR. While the operating team is frustrated with the mixed results you see on Slide 4, we will return all of these measures to a state of constant improvement through execution of our transportation plan. Weather heavily impacted the results you see in freight car velocity, freight car terminal dwell and train speed. However, we continue to make good progress on our efficiency measures as both locomotive and workforce productivity improved in the quarter. These improvements were driven by our continual evaluation and adjustment of our transportation plan as well as through our continued efforts to grow train link. Intermodal trip plan compliance decreased in the quarter as weather and a surge in intermodal shipments of 12% year-over-year placed significant pressure on that service. Our manifest service remained solid during the quarter, driving improvement in trip plan compliance for manifest and autos. The team did an excellent job of maintaining this service product throughout the weather impact. Slide 5 highlights some of our recent network changes. We continue to push train length to drive productivity while striving to provide a better service product to our customers. Train length was almost 9,250 feet in the first quarter, which was up 10% or 850ft year over year. One enabler of this great progress is our siding extension program. During the quarter, we completed two sidings and began construction or the bidding process, and another 18 sidings. We continue to make progress in the redesign of our operations in the Houston area to drive efficiency. We are leveraging the recent investment of our Englewood facility and we consolidated the blocking of local cars at our Settegast yard, allowing us to curtail operations at four of our smaller yards around the area. This allows us to bypass those smaller yards and deliver cars directly to the customers, eliminating extra handlings, improving transit time and reducing crew start. We also curtailed switching operations at our North Council Bluffs yard by leveraging surrounding yards, which will reduce local train starts. As I look to the future, I'm excited about the full pipeline of initiatives we have to drive productivity throughout our network and enhance our service product. Turning to Slide 6; everything we do is done with the focus towards safely accomplishing our work. We understand the continuous improvement we need to make and safety, and we have the right plan to achieve our goal. We remain focused on executing on the PSR principles that transformed our operation and there still remain many opportunities for us to improve our operations and drive productivity we have work to do to return our service product to the level we expect. We need to return intermodal trip plan compliance to the mid to upper '80s, manifest trip plan compliance to the low to mid '70s and freight car velocity, the low '20s. We're on that path today as we fully recognize the importance of providing our customers with a highly reliable service product. With that, I will turn it over to Kenny to provide an update on the business environment.\nKenny Rocker: Thank you, Eric, and good morning. Our first quarter volume was down 1% from a year ago due to weather events and the leap year in 2020. Solid gains in our intermodal on export grain markets were offset by declines in our industrial and energy related market. Freight revenue was down 5% for the quarter due to the decrease in volume, coupled with the lower fuel surcharge and negative business mix that offset...that were offset by our core pricing. Let's take a closer look at how each of our business groups performed in the first quarter. Starting with our bulk markets, revenue for the quarter was down 1%, volume decreased by 2%, which was partially offset by a 1% increase in average revenue per car, due to the positive mix in traffic and core pricing gains. Coal and renewable carloads were down 16% as a result of continued high customer inventory levels, our contract law and weather-related challenges, which were partially offset by higher natural gas prices. Volume for grain and grain products was up 16%, driven by increased demand for export grain. Fertilizer carloads were down 4% as reduced export potash shipments were partially offset by stronger demand for industrial sulfur. And finally, food and refrigerated volume was down 6%, driven primarily by decreased demand for food service due to the ongoing pandemic as well as weather related challenges. Moving on to industrial, industrial revenue declined 13% for the quarter, driven by an 11% decrease in volume. Average revenue per car also declined 1% from a lower fuel surcharge and mix. Energy and specialized shipment decreased 14% primarily driven by reduced crude oil shipments due to unfavorable price drag and reduced demand. Forest products volume grew by 7%, lumber was driven by strong housing starts, along with an increase in repair and remodel. We also saw strength in brown paper, driven by increased box demand and low inventory. Industrial chemicals and plastic shipments were down 9% for the quarter, due to the severe storm in May and February that cost plant interruptions for producers throughout the Gulf Coast as well as feedstock shortages in certain sectors. Metals and minerals volume was down 16% primarily driven by weather and market softness in rock coupled with reduced frac sand shipments associated with the decline in drilling and surplus in local sand. Turning now to premium, revenue for the quarter was up 2% on a 6% increase in volume. Average revenue per car declined by 4% reflecting mix effect from greater container volumes and fewer automotive carload shipment. Automotive volume was down 13% for the quarter as manufacturers struggled with semiconductor-related part shortages and extreme winter weather disruptions to the supply chain. Finished vehicle and auto parts shipments were impacted similarly with finished vehicles, down 13% and auto part, down 14%. Intermodal volume increased by 12% in the quarter. Domestic intermodal was up 16% year-over-year due to continued strength in retail sales in recent business land parcel in particular benefited from ongoing strength and e-commerce. International intermodal volume grew 8% despite poor congestion related to strong growth in containerized import. Now looking ahead to the rest of 2021, for our bulk commodities, we expect a continued negative outlook for coal, electricity demand and natural gas prices are forecasted to improve have high customer inventory levels, combined with increased demand for other energy sources and a contract law presents a challenging market. However, there is continued strength for export grain as China remains committed to incremental ag product purchases in 2021 calendar year, with clearly a tougher year-over-year comparison in the back half of the year. We also are optimistic with our biofuel shipments as domestic production is expected to increase, which will drive new volume at new UP destination facility for bulk renewable diesel feedstocks and finished products. As we look ahead to our industrial commodities, the year-over-year comps for our energy market are favorable however, there is still uncertainty with the speed of the recovery in those markets. We are encouraged by the stronger forecast for industrial production. Full year 2021 is now forecasted at 6.5%, a 2% point improvement since we spoke in January. Plastic volumes will also remain strong for us in 2021 as production rates increase. And lastly, for premium, we expect strong uplift in both our automotive and intermodal businesses. Automotive sales are forecasted to increase from 14 million units in 2020 to closer to $16 million in 2021. We are optimistic that automotive production will normalize and supply chain issue for parts are expected to improve later in the second quarter. With regard to intermodal, Limited truck capacity we're encouraged conversion from over the road truck to rail. Retail inventories remain historically low, restocking of inventory along with continued strength in sales should drive intermodal volumes, higher this year. Before I hand this over to Jennifer, I'd like to express my appreciation to our operating and engineering teams for their hard work and dedication to keep our network running in the unprecedented weather event in February and March. Both our commercial and operating teams work closely together to quickly recover operations for our customers and win new bit. With that, I'll turn it over to Jennifer to review our financial performance.\nJennifer Hamann: Thanks. Kenny and good morning, I'm going to start with a look at the first quarter operating ratio and earnings per share on Slide 13. As you heard from Lance, Union Pacific is reporting first quarter earnings per share of $2 and a quarterly operating ratio of 60.1%. Comparing our first quarter results 2020 the extreme winter weather previously discussed negatively impacted our operating ratio by 160 basis points or $0.16 to earnings. In addition, rising fuel prices throughout the quarter and the associated 2-month lag on our fuel surcharge recovery programs impacted our quarterly ratio by 100 basis points or $0.11 per share. Despite these challenges, our core operations and profitability continued to improve, delivering 150 basis points of benefit to our operating ratio and adding $0.12 earnings per share. Looking now at our first quarter income statement on Slide 14, operating revenue totaled $5 billion, down 4% versus 2020 on a 1% year-over-year volume decrease. Operating expense decreased 3% to $3 billion demonstrating our consistent ability to adjust costs more than volume. Taken together, we are reporting first quarter operating income of $2 billion, a 7% decrease versus last year. Interest expense increased 4% compared to 2020 resulting from an increase in fees related to our debt exchange with some offset from lower weighted average debt level, income tax decreased 7% due to lower pre-tax income, net income of $1.3 billion decreased 9% versus 2020 which when combined with share repurchases resulted in earnings per share of $2, down 7%. Looking more closely at first quarter revenue; Slide 15 provides a breakdown of our freight revenue which totaled $4.6 billion, down 5% compared to 2020. Factoring in weather and last year being a leap year, the volume impact on freight revenue was a 75 basis point decrease. Fuel surcharge negatively impacted freight revenue by 200 basis points compared to last year. The decrease was driven by the lag and fuel surcharge recovery as well as slightly lower fuel prices. Our pricing actions continue to yield pricing dollars in excess of inflation. However, those gains were more than offset by a negative business mix and reduced freight revenue 225 basis points. Although our grain shipments increased in the quarter, this impact was more than offset by very strong intermodal volumes coupled with declines in petroleum and industrial product shipments. Now let's move on to Slide 16 which provides a summary of our first quarter operating expenses. Starting with compensation and benefits expense down 3% year-over-year. First quarter workforce levels declined 12% or about 4100 full-time equivalent generating very strong productivity against only a 1% decrease in volume. Specifically, our train and engine workforce continues to be more than volume variable down 11%, while management, engineering and mechanical workforces together decreased 13%. Offsetting some of this productivity was an elevated cost per employee, up 10% as we tightly managed headcount-based wage inflation and higher year-over-year incentive compensation as well as higher weather-related crew costs. Quarterly fuel expense decreased 5%, a result of lower volume and prices. Our fuel consumption rate was essentially flat as productivity initiatives were offset by the additional fuel needed as a result of the extremely cold temperatures. Purchased services and materials expense improved 6% driven by our loop subsidiary utilizing less drayage as a result of lower auto volumes as well as maintenance costs related to a smaller active equipment fleet. These savings were partially offset by additional weather-related expenses. Equipment and other rents fell 7% driven by higher equity income from our ownership in TTS. The other expense line increased 22 million this quarter driven by higher casualty expenses that were primarily related to adverse developments on certain claims. This increase should not be viewed as an indicator of current safety record. As we think about expenses going forward recall that last year in the second and 3rd quarters. We took temporary actions in response to the pandemic reducing management salaries and closing shop. These actions produce a 2% headwind in total for second quarter expenses predominantly impacting compensation and benefits and purchased services and material expenses, and for a full-year comparison excluding, we now expect both purchased services and materials as well as other expense to be up mid-single digits versus 2020. Lastly, we expect our annual effective tax rate to be slightly higher than previously thought, around 24% looking now at productivity on Slide 17, in spite of the $35 million weather headwind, we continue our solid productivity trend in the first quarter generating $105 million. Productivity results were led again by train length improvement contributing to strong workforce and locomotive productivity as Eric detailed earlier. Turning to Slide 18 and our cash flow, cash from operations in the first quarter decreased to $2 billion from $2.2 billion in 2020, a 9% decline despite that free cash flow after capital investments increased 5% to over $1.4 billion, highlighting our ongoing capital discipline as well as a slightly slower start to our capital programs. This generated a cash flow conversion rate of 106%. Free cash flow after dividends also increased in the quarter, up $115 million or 17%. Supported by our strong cash generation and cash balances we returned $2 billion to shareholders during the first quarter as we maintained our industry-leading dividend payout and repurchase shares totaling 1.4 billion. We finished the first quarter with a comparable adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.8 times on par with year-end 2020. Wrapping up on Slide 19; despite the slow start to the year, we remain confident in our ability to show improvement across all three performance drivers' volume, price and productivity, we do face some volume headwinds declining coal demand the lingering impact of industrial, chemical plant closures from the February storm and the semiconductor shortage that is continuing to impact autos into the second quarter. Setting that aside though, there are even more reasons to be encouraged about '21. The pace of vaccination rollouts, strong consumer and trade demand, and an improving industrial production forecast. And we are increasingly optimistic about our ability to drive business to the railroad. Since early March, we have seen an improving demand trajectory with March averaging roughly a 157,000 seven-day car loadings and we crossed the 160,000 plus threshold in April. So with the strength we're seeing in our volumes, we now expect full year carload growth to be around 6%. Our guidance around full-year pricing, productivity and operating ratio improvement in the range of 150 to 200 basis points, all remain intact. However, with our updated volume outlook, we will likely be closer to the 200 than the 150. We clearly have work ahead of us to achieve these goals. But a broader economic picture and good traction on our PSR initiatives, give us a path to success. Turning to cash and capital, our capital spending plan remains at $2.9 billion for the year, well within our long-term guidance of below 15% of revenue as we generate capacity through our PSR focus. We will maintain our industry-leading dividend payout ratio and are committed to strong share repurchases. Specifically, we plan to return approximately $6 billion to our shareholders in 2021 through share repurchases. Before I turn it back to Lance, I'd like to add my thanks to our exceptional workforce. Mother Nature tested our capabilities this quarter and once again our workforce showed they are ready for the challenges and are committed to serving our customers. So with that, I'll turn it back to Lance.\nLance Fritz: Thank you, Jennifer. As you've heard me say many times, our first priority will always be see, I'm confident in our ability to meet our high expectations in that area. With today being Earth Day it feels appropriate to highlight the actions we're taking to protect our planet. In February, we announced our science-based target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 26% against the 2018 base by 2030. Additionally in our 2021 proxy statement we rolled out our ESG strategy, which we call building a sustainable future 2030, we will expand on this strategy in our 2020 building America report, which is going to be published in early May in conjunction with our Investor Day. We're reinforcing our commitment to delivering value to all of our stakeholders. As you heard today, we're very optimistic about the future. Our service product made more resilient through PSR and lower cost structure is enabling us to win new business and expand opportunities that will ultimately grow the top line. Looking to the rest of the year and improving economic outlook, our continued commitment to value-based pricing that exceeds inflation and the opportunity for strong productivity gives us confidence to affirm our 2021 guidance. Union Pacific is poised to take advantage of a strengthening economy by leveraging our best in industry franchise to produce long-term growth and excellent returns. So with that, let's open up the line for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra, Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks. I guess you went from no follow-up for me this time. Okay, so I'll just stick to one. Good morning, everyone. Jennifer, I just wanted to focus on the 200 basis points of margin improvement this year. I think that implies 56.5 OR for this year, which would be...which would be impressive, it sort of implies you guys hitting kind of a mid '50s or better this year at some quarter maybe in the back half of the year. I'm wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about that mix is obviously getting a little bit better, but if you can talk about what you think needs to be achieved to get to the high end of that 150 million 200 target.\nJennifer Hamann: So thanks for the question. So yes, I mean starting off the year with a 60.1 and be able to get to in that range of 56.5 to 57 and as we said, we're hoping to get closer to the 200 basis points of improvement. That certainly says we have to improve over the balance of the year and make very strong improvement to hit those targets. And so in terms of what gives us confidence, it really is the ability to win in the marketplace. As we mentioned that we're expecting volumes to be around 6% or so up year-over-year as you might recall back in January our original guidance was 46%, so we're now seeing strengthening in the economy. Kenny and the team winning new business and so, those are all very positive signs. And then again, the efficiency piece, certainly we were impacted in the quarter with weather and fuel, they took their toll on the first quarter OR. But we still generated 150 basis points of core improvement. And so as we look to grow volumes and put some of those transitory issues behind us. We feel good about the rest of the year.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thank you. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Group: Hey Thanks, good morning guys. Lance just given everything going on, I wanted to ask an M&A question. So, you guys have been very focused on operating ratio and over time, I sense perhaps more of a focus on volume and overall earnings growth going forward. I wondered, does that change your view around M&A and if it's perhaps time to start thinking more about that, and then on the specific transactions on the table right now, do you have a view or a preference of CN, in case your Cpk is one a bigger threat to you, is perhaps one that's more likely to cause you to think about extending your own network reach.\nLance Fritz: Yes. Thanks, Scott. I'll start with the last part of the question-and-end with the first part, regarding whether the CPU or the CN we're to acquire the KCS, our concern It really is the same. What we're focused on is with the STB says the next Class 1 merger must provide, and that is an enhancement to the competition and clear improvement for all customers, through that to be true in any transaction our current service product has to remain intact. So our concern is making sure that we have good operational and commercial access to all the customers that we serve currently in Mexico and in other parts, whether this near or on the CP railroad or the CN railroad as regards to that transaction, the first thing we're focused on is making sure that the STB sets up a level playing field for all Class 1 mergers and in that does not apply the waiver that they created potentially for the KCS back in 2000-2001. We think those new 2001 merger rules should apply to every Class 1 merger, so that the STB has a full opportunity to vet the game plan to enhance competition by the transaction. And then, if you think a little bit about what we're focused on, you're exactly right. We're focused on the three stools to drive enterprise value for Union Pacific, the three legs of the stool, excuse me, we're focused on making sure we get value-based pricing in the marketplace, we're focused on making sure that we're efficient and productive both in assets and an operating expense and we're focused on growth and I think growth is going to play a bigger role, it has to. And then as regards, whether or not that changes our stance on overall M&A activity, our big concern on any Class 1 merger is that in the STB's regulatory review, they are committed to enhancing competition and they are also committed to taking a look at the downstream impacts of weather creates incentives to remain in stability in the industry for further consolidation. In that context, we see a lot of opportunities for long-term value impact that's not in our best interest. We're going to be very, very active and engaged in this process with the STB and of potentially directly with the acquirers and we're going to first and foremost focused on making sure that we protect our interest and then help the STB enhance competition as they seek us.\nScott Group: Okay. So it sounds like you've got some concerns around both transactions and you're not thinking about M&A in your near future.\nLance Fritz: That's correct. Scott. At this point, we are not contemplating M&A, we've done plenty of work to understand what the costs and benefits could be and we'll just continue to be engaged and monitor the process.\nScott Group: Okay, thank you for the thoughts Lance. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Wetherbee: Yes, hey, thanks, good morning! Lance, wanted to pick up on some of your comments about some of the long-term growth potential. I guess in the context of the competitive environment and the improvements that UP has been making under its PSR progress over the course of the last couple of years, maybe give us a little bit of a sort of preview maybe how you think about some of the growth opportunities for the franchise, if you go out maybe just beyond this year, but obviously including this year, it seems like your macro is going to be a help to you but has service gotten to the point where maybe the competitive landscape in the Western United States is a bit more favorable for you or does that sort of factor into your outlook when you think about some of the multi-year growth potential of the company.\nLance Fritz: Good question Chris and thank you for asking it. So when we think about growth, there is a number of ways that we're able to attack it, one is opening markets to us that hadn't been open before either through a more consistent reliable service product, which is true or a lower cost structure, which is also true. So we see clearly more opportunity happening. Another way to do it is to expand our reach and that can be done any number of ways, it can be done by a new intermodal terminal in Minneapolis, it can be done by a new transload, it can be done by taking property that already exists around the Dallas intermodal terminal and turning it into opportunity to cite new industry on it. All of that is underway and Kenny maybe I'll ask you to make some observations and give us a few examples of the kinds of growth opportunities you're achieving right now.\nKenny Rocker: Yes. So, I think so. First of all, Chris, you know, it really does start with the service product. Eric and his team have done a really fabulous job of improving the service performance and it shows up in things like car velocity. So for example, as you look at our intermodal network is that velocity becomes more reliable and more consistent, but we're able to compete right up there with truck on that domestic network. The same is true with parcel. And then as you look at the carload business, the lower cost structure has really opened up market for us, we're able to compete and have been able to win in lower value commodities in areas like bulk, we're able to access customers that may not have want to take large positions on either fertilizers, or some commodities like grain that's been encouraging to us, on the auto side we've been really excited about new lines that we've won that we, that weren't there in the past, and then finally, Lance, as you talk about product sales that we talked about the product offering in Pocatello, where we're going to be able to provide a match back opportunities for containers getting back to the way.\nLance Fritz: Yes, and Kenny, there's something else that Chris, that we haven't mentioned yet, two big drivers of near-term wins. One is our technology base our technology platform. You all know we rewrote our ERP over the course of the last number of years and it's a micro services architecture. What that means is APIs are really easy for us to do. We've already got something approaching, 4 dozen active APIs with our customer base. Those are helping us win business with electric vehicle manufacturers for instance that really care about the data streams technology platform is winning and then our ESG story is winning. There is a number of customers that are looking to us to help them reduce their carbon footprint and as you know that's becoming a much, much more important part of the conversation with a number of our customers. So there's a lot of moving parts there Chris and from our perspective, there is a lot of opportunity.\nChris Wetherbee: Yes. Okay, great. That this great color. Appreciate the time. Thank you.\nLance Fritz: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks everyone. Lance, I can give you one to one question, first is on the guide. I mean obviously you guys had a bit of a tough circumstance here with the weather that's completely understandable in 1Q, but given the much stronger second half macro outlook than 3 months ago, did you consider going to raising the guidance at all and also not to steal your thunder from next week, but can you give us a sense of what we can expect at the Analyst Day in terms of broad topics that you may address?\nLance Fritz: Yes great, thank you. Ravi, so we do evaluate our guidance periodically. Of course, every quarter is an opportunity and we've delivered what we think is a good prudent middle of the fairway, a set of expectations as we look forward, we're already kind of moving ourselves up in the range, which is meaningful, 200 basis points of improvement is not jump change year-over-year, particularly when you're at the performance level that we were at last year at 58.5 that would mark us being a very, very strong industrial performer. So there is no more news on the second half guidance. I would also just remind you that there is some kind of very high optimism on what the second quarter is going to look like, just because the comps are so easy, but then when you get the 3rd and 4th quarter, we're starting to lap now the real acceleration in domestic intermodal, particularly the parcel world and we're also then starting to lap some of the real strength in grain. So it has yet to be seen exactly how that plays out. But even in that context, our guidance stands. And then in terms of what to expect for our Investor Day next week. So what you're going to hear is you're going to hear us lay out just what we talked about there, we're going to...we're going to lay out how we serve our customers and how that continues to improve and what to expect from us there in real granular firms. So you can, you can get a good sense of the work streams and what to expect, you're going to, you're going to hear us lay out how we expect to grow, will name customers, we'll talk about very specific opportunity and work streams that you can hold us to account for. We'll talk about what winning looks like in that context and kind of reaffirm of course guidance this year. And then we're going to talk about a couple of markers we're going to lay down for the next 3 years. And then we're going to start with a nice overall context of how doing that together with all of our stakeholders really comes to reality. So we'll talk about our ESG story. We'll talk about what's going on with our employees, the communities that we serve. Because I think that's a critically important part of how we run this railroad. We have a social license to operate and all 7300 communities that we serve and they need to hear us talk about how much we value them and our relationship with them and how we keep it healthy. So you're going to hear all of that you're going to see it in 2 hours and you're going to see the leadership team of Union Pacific tell that story collectively.\nRavi Shanker: Excellent, looking forward to that. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nAllison Landry: Good morning. Thanks. Just wanted to go back to the topic of service and growth, and specifically the trip plan compliance, not to say that both the manifest and Intermodal took a step back from weather, but Eric, I think you mentioned earlier, you know, sort of meeting to get the manifest trip plan compliance back to the low to mid '70s. So I mean, that's really where you need to be longer term to start to chip away at the opportunity to convert some of the merchandize volume from the highway or do you need to be somewhere in the '80s or '90s range to really be competitive with truck and then if you could just sort of help us through, when you think you could get there if that could start to accrue in 2021 and more about '22 and beyond story?\nLance Fritz: I appreciate your question, Allison. So my guidance today is really focused on the short-term as we think about going into the second quarter that we're in right now and what the team focused on responding to and recovering trip plan compliance both on the intermodal and the manifest and the auto side. To your point into the discussion we've had so far this morning, growth is going to take a lot of different forms. I remain completely open to the idea that as we continue to progress forward both in 2021 and beyond. We're going to see opportunities to be able to grow that service product very intentionally broadly, but then also some growth opportunities, will demand certain operations that we will continue to work with Kenny on as he finds those opportunities and we partner together to bring them on the railroad. So we have a complete dedication to growing TPC broadly, but then also remain very close with Kenny to ensure that we're providing the service in certain opportunities to continue to grow that business.\nKenny Rocker: Eric, let me jump in and part of your question Allison was kind of what should the thresholds be and our experience at least right now. And I would say into the near-term tells us trip plan compliance on the manifest side about 75-ish plus or minus better more is better, but there is a threshold at which more costs more than it's valued. And then on the intermodal side, we do think high '80s '90s is kind of where that needs to be parked to be reliable and truck-competitive.\nAllison Landry: Okay, just to clarify the manifest the mid-70 like [indiscernible] at what point do you reach the threshold? We just mentioned that the cost is at low '80s or should we think about the mid-70s mark?\nLance Fritz: Look Allison, it's not a hard and fast rule. If you look backwards when volume goes away like it did in the second quarter you can run a railroad really smoothly and efficiently and get those numbers jacked up pretty good. I would just say somewhere in the mid '70s is great for manifest if it starts creeping up into the mid '80s in mid-90s, it's probably more service than is valued and not the same in intermodal, intermodal there's an appetite for '90s and they'll pay for it.\nKenny Rocker: Yes, let me jump in real quick, what I just want to say what is critical here is the reliability part of it that could predictably can get to that 75 and we can take that to the customer, we can still talk to them about going after truck lanes that they know predictably that it's going to be at 75 or 77 or 73 or whatever that number is.\nAllison Landry: Okay, I understand. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Next question is coming from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. One for Eric. If you could just give us an update on the metrics through April here on the key performance, KPIs. I think that'll be helpful to hear how things are moving on some of the more detailed ones that you track. And then just from a bigger picture perspective workforce productivity is still pretty strong despite the challenges offer all-time record last quarter and how do you view that in the context of some of the growth that you're mentioning can that still improve independent of the growth and what the mix might look like? And then if I can squeeze one in for Lance, can you just give us an update on, we're talking about labor on the train crew size negotiations. I realize it's still early, but we're seeing more about putting potentially a conductor on the ground in the I guess the next few years. If and when that gets negotiated. So if you can just bring us up to speed on...on what that means and how that's progressing. That would be helpful as well. Thank you.\nEric Gehringer: We just started. Sounds good. So if we look at Slide 4 as our baseline, so you see on the left-hand side we can just start with freight car velocity showing 209 last 7 day, 218; freight car terminal dwell. So in 23.5 for the quarter last 7 days, 22.6. So very strong indications that we are out of that weather event, we're recovering the system, have recovered much of the system and can get back on the pace than we were before. So strong confidence that we can do that.\nBrian Ossenbeck: I also asked about the labor prudent.\nEric Gehringer: Yes, so on the labor productivity side, we think about that, 2 ways. Is there more opportunities to continue to grow that number? Absolutely there is. When we think about how do you make sure you're doing that, you're really focused on, are you getting the retention rate that you expect out of the people that are currently furloughed, we're sitting at 75% to 85% on that. So we're still very effective had been able to retain when we need to be able to bring our people for growth and at the same time, our total furloughed count on the TE&Y side of 1400. So there is a strong pool there to draw upon, so no concerns at this time.\nLance Fritz: And then I'll build off that labor productivity commentary to answer your labor negotiation question Brian, which is we are right in the middle of national round. It's been underway for over a year. The railroads are pursuing crew size changes in the capital locomotive, if successful, that would put one of the individuals on the ground servicing, more than one train. We think that's got a lot of positives to it, first and foremost is a, is a lifestyle improvement for half of the capital locomotive in that circumstance, one of the most difficult parts of being train and engine men on the railroad is that their work schedules are unpredictable, they match the flow of trains, which are 24/7, 365. If we can put somebody on the ground, we can create that work into shift work and scheduled shift work which is a real benefit. There are other benefits of course it's a real productivity move, but that's far from certain that we'll be able to get that in this round we're pursuing it of course it's got to be negotiated.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Thank you, Eric. And I appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Hoexter: Great. Good morning. Just a follow-up on a couple of questions. In the first quarter you said last year or first part our 46% carload target for the year. Moving to the top end of that, but if can you mention IP up 200 basis points since you set that target. Do you still see yourself as being conservative by staying in that target, or are there any losses we need to consider in share and then thoughts to meet that? Just to follow on the last question, your employee changes maybe Jan you can throw. I mean, down 12%. What your thoughts are on employees by year-end? Thanks.\nLance Fritz: Let me take the conservative or not conservative question if I could, the short answer is no, I mean 46% was our best thinking before 6%, our best thinking now we'll keep tuned up on it. We've talked about the potential headwinds late in the year. But yes, it's our best thinking.\nJennifer Hamann: And I would just add to that and Allison wants a large commentary. We're also starting in a little bit worse off than we anticipated when we laid out our guidance for you. We had a tougher first quarter than how things actually played out with what happened with weather. So, but to your headcount question, Ken in terms of how we see that playing out where it call it just shy of 30,000 employees. Today, we think that we should be able to even at the high end of that range, kind of keep steady state relative to those, you may see some ups and downs a little bit. We may actually have to do a little bit of hiring in some small locations if we don't have adequate crew base there. You heard Eric refer to the 1400 furloughs, but we plan on being very efficient with the crew base. And so we think even up to that high-end of the range that we gave, the 6%. We should be able to keep that pretty flat with some little seasonal fluctuation.\nKen Hoexter: Appreciate it. Thanks.\nLance Fritz: Thanks.\nOperator: Next question is coming from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good morning everyone and thanks for taking my question. So I guess, I want to follow-up on Ken's question there, Lance or Eric or maybe you can, Jennifer with where trip plan compliance is where you want to get it, it just feels like a repetitive scene when rail volumes come back historically, we see, not just Union Pacific but industry service metrics really lag. So I guess what can be different this time that you think you can do of such of our resource base because I think historically, you know the answer was always throw more light going to more locomotives assets employees that is no.\nLance Fritz: Yes, that's a great question, a very fair question Brandon. What's different for us is a demonstrated track record now, in our world of PSR where when volumes return, we don't crater a case in point. Perfect. Great. Case in point is last year, last year volumes dropped as dramatically as we've ever seen in our recorded history from, call it late February, early March into April and then subsequently recovered as fast as we've ever seen. And if I recall in the recovery period from Q2 to Q3 to Q4. We continued to improve our metrics on service, that's a proof statement right now when you go from 120,000 seven days to a 160,000 seven day at the end of the year. Now clearly, you're loading resources into a pretty empty network at that point, but you're still having to do the work of loading resources into the network. I think the same is true right now. I'm going to make up a number. If we go from today's volume to a 180,000 seven day, we've got on a network, a physical franchise that can handle that pretty readily and the job would be to efficiently layer in the train starts, that would be necessary to crews, the locomotive and we've demonstrated, we know how to do that and should be able to do that. Eric, take the color.\nEric Gehringer: And one of the greatest tool to do that is all of our continued efforts on train length as, as we reported this morning, we're up 10%, 850 feet. But when you're thinking about the service product and being able to deliver that, one of the best tool you have is a very fluid network as we think about 2.5 years ago, we would have had 800-ish trains running around of any given day. Now, we're at 600 and 605 a day, that's 25% less potential variability events, which is the primary driver for any degradation and trip plan compliance, so continuing to leverage train link on top of how we operate in our terminals both key opportunities to consistently drive that number up to that mid 80 number.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nJon Chappell: Thank you. Good morning. Kenny, you noted the tight truck capacity in the favorable outlook for taking share off the highway, beyond the weather, the West Coast congestion issues still seem to be in the headlines and the rails seem to be getting thrown at the bus, a little bit as part of the problem, not the solution, can you speak to the progression of clearing some of the backlog, especially as it relates to the West Coast ports? And then also, what's your capacity to actually take advantage then of this favorable competitive dynamic that you have from a cost perspective? The headlines you are reading, I have got a thought in, Eric as you pitched in back me to talk about on opportunities, but, look, when you look at the port congestion that's going on there, there's a lot going on there. There's a lot of supply chain, the court conversations with a lot of ocean carrier and a port here recently, so let me just break down here a few things. One, we know about the increased demand that's been pretty flattened, but one other thing that you look at, another variable that you look at is the warehousing capacity. So in a lot of cases, the warehouses out there aren't just full, they are unable to physically take the container, so we have seen those containers still left out there on the floor. There are some challenges on the trade side, certainly some labor issues at the terminal, and then, if you look at the trucking capacity to even go long-haul, there are tightness there. So, what we're focused on here is what we can control. And Eric, if you wanted to talk about what we're doing from an operational standpoint.\nEric Gehringer: Sure. And Jon, I appreciate the question because the Union Pacific is a critical component of that entire supply chain Kenny was mentioning. So when we look at being able to ensure that we have the resources up against that we're always looking at how, what's the total footage of trains that we're able to depart from the LA Basin specifically out of ICTF and so if we go back in time from July to October last year, we had 60,000 feet of capacity. Now as we sell that volume continue to increase. We were intentional and ahead of time increase that to 68,000 in the middle of November and then actually again in April 1 of this year, we took that to 80,000 now that's on top of and driving a 25% increase in our train starts out of the LA Basin also to support that growth. So you see, I hope you see Union Pacific as the component in that process, that's doing everything they can to bring on that volume and efficiently, get it out of the LA Basin and into the Inland Empire, inland terminals, which helps the overall fluidity with the entire supply chain.\nKenny Rocker: So, just close out here, Jon. We feel good about the incremental wins that we're seeing on the domestic side. It is a tight market as we're going through this season. We feel encouraged by some of the past wins on the international intermodal side though, as we move throughout the year, we're fully going very optimistic about the marketplace.\nJon Chappell: Okay. Thank you, Kenny. Thanks, Eric.\nOperator: There your next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nTom Wadewitz: Yes, good morning. I wanted to go back a little bit to the some of the consolidation question Lance said. I think your comments this morning and, in the past, have been kind of cautious about rail consolidation, are you essentially against consolidation. Would you say. We just don't think it should happen, or is that kind of overstating it and then in terms of gateway. I mean, obviously, you do a large amount of business at the Laredo gateway, how do you protect yourself. Yes. CP CN get care few and there is some essentially bridge traffic that you have from Laredo to Chicago that would potentially be at risk? So how do you think about what you need to do to protect yourself at that gateway?\nLance Fritz: And Tom, good morning and thanks for the questions. We've been very clear on consolidation. You mentioned that we think that the process the STB is committed to undertake in terms of reviewing any Class 1 merger to ensure it both enhances competition has better outcomes for all customers and that they contemplate the downstream impacts when you boil that all together and note that the STB has full authority to put in whatever remedies and regulations are required to achieve that we've always thought there is lots of opportunity in that to destroy long-term value for the industry. That's our big concern. If we are constantly evaluating long term enterprise value creation, part of that is weather not mergers make sense for us and that's always been a primary sticking point. We'll have to navigate this current process to see how it comes out. And of course will be an active participant in it. Related to the second part of your question, which is how do we protect or how do we ensure that the competitive option that the UP represent, it doesn't get disadvantaged by either the CPU or the CN, if they were to own KCS and you've got it exactly right. The Laredo gateway is the primary gateway for the KCS KCSM and we'd have to do 2 things. We have to make sure that operationally, we're treated fairly and equitably at the gateway and then we'd have to make sure commercially that we're treated fairly and equitably to all the points that we currently have an opportunity to serve with our franchise in the United States in conjunction with the KCSM, our franchise is damn good, the best in the industry. And that's why we represent about 2/3 of all rail cross border traffic to and from Mexico would be a crying shame and it would be against what the STB has committed they would do in evaluating the merger if that excellence is replaced by something that's inferior and it's because we're disadvantaged. So we'll be crystal clear about that in front of the STB and in the process.\nTom Wadewitz: Okay. But you think there are we to protect the franchise at Laredo?\nLance Fritz: Yes, 100%. There are, and they would be it positions concessions remedies that would flow through FTD.\nTom Wadewitz: Great. Thank you, Lance. Thanks for the perspective.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nCherilyn Radbourne: Thanks very much and good morning. Just wanted to ask a slightly different question regarding the capacity challenges on the West Coast. I was just hoping you could comment on what you've done to protect service for customers in the mutual commitment program and what do you expect to see more interest in that program going forward. Just given the capacity challenges across all modes.\nLance Fritz: Yes. Thanks, Cherilyn. I mean clearly, we announced that and have taken the action to protect those customers that are in the program, and we are doing that with a lot quicker responsiveness as we see the market changes as we see the supply chain tightened. We will take those actions and European enough to, that we're in constant communication with our customers and help and talk into them about their supply chain as it relates to the Street time as it relates to dwell and what they're doing with their BCOs and individual customer, so were going beyond just having that surcharge out there and talking with our customers about what they can do to make sure that they can efficiently utilize of assets.\nCherilyn Radbourne: And do you expect to see more interest in that program going forward?\nLance Fritz: We have not seen any of that waiver and we would expect the entrants to be there and be strong.\nCherilyn Radbourne: Thank you. That's all from me.\nOperator: Gentleman, the next question is coming from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nWalter Spracklin: Yes, thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. So just following on that question with regards to congestion and if we do see a very significant increase in economic activity, potentially above and beyond what's currently expected, how much of your ability to protect services within is outside of your control? In other words, what can you do here to speak to your supply chain partners to make sure that, that everything remains fluid and how much of a risk is that? And just as a follow-on question there on yields. I think you mentioned that yields were going to be negative for the year and I'm just curious with everything going on with that demand and the potential pricing opportunities. Are you still expecting yields to be negative for this year?\nLance Fritz: Let me start on both. And then, I'll turn it over to first probably Kenny and Eric to comment on specifics about congestion and how do we avoid it. I don't think we've said anything about negative yields in the year, Jennifer.\nJennifer Hamann: Now we said the business mix is expected to be negative.\nLance Fritz: Right.\nJennifer Hamann: But not so overall yield. So when you think about yields. Obviously, there's numerous components there is the mix impact. There's, which we do expect is going to be pressured probably going to look a little bit better here in the second quarter and 3rd quarter of pressure in the 4th quarter with some of the grain come. But in terms of pricing. So, very good about pricing and then fuel surcharges. This is the last quarter where we've got a pretty negative comparison year-over-year relative to fuel prices and surcharges. And so that should look better over the balance of the year as well.\nLance Fritz: Yes, I'm sorry. Walter said yields, I went to how we define, yes without predominantly price at the price, so Walter, talking to a little bit about congestion and if economic activity surprises us and is even stronger and continues to strengthen, what are we going to do about avoiding congestion? And the short answer is making sure that we've got the right resources against it staying ahead of it through the viewpoint of Kenny and his team in terms of translating economic activity in the carloads for us which we do routinely and periodically to try to stay front. And I also need to make sure we talk, Kenny and Erin both talked about us having the full supply chain visibility and working towards that specifically with the West Coast ports, but that's an active engagement whether it's in the LA Basin or up in the PNW on our part to make sure that we and the entire supply chain have transparency and visibility into to make sure that we and the entire supply chain has the transparency and visibility into what's happening, what the metrics are and KPIs need to be for us to stay fluid and support an excellent service product. And from my perspective, that's not just about satisfying current demand, that's about making sure that the West Coast ports are competitive in a very, very competitive world where stuff can hit Prince Rupert or the Gulf Coast or the East Coast, Eric.\nEric Gehringer: Yes, I'll take on the resources on hand over to the visibility. So when you think about what are the resource base rate, you're talking about 3 things, you're talking about locomotives. So obviously we have reported that we have 3000 plus locomotives in storage, but we also more importantly to respond to that growth as we have been at the ready locomotives that are actually pre-placed out in geographical areas like the LA Basin. So we can be very agile in responding to that, from a car perspective, we know how many constraints on that. Now as Kenny mentioned earlier, you're trying to drive intermodal velocity, higher and higher, which just allows you to turn the cars faster and provide you even more at the ready for cars as well and then crew base wise still use the same process we use every single month to evaluate crude demand, see as Jennifer mentioned, there may be sporadic hiring some of that may be in the LA Basin, but no immediate concerns on crews. And then, finally, it's the agility for decision making when I talked about increasing the train count on the LA Basin by 25% that was a decision we started on Monday, and by Wednesday. We're already moving the resources there to answer that call. So I feel very comfortable on the operating side.\nKenny Rocker: Yes, I'd just add to that. We stay very coordinated with the customer on what they plan to do on what their forecasts are. And then we in turn taken that it didn't now with Eric and so he talked about the adjustments that we've made. We've got visibility just talking to our customers, from that perspective, obviously here this year, we made some changes to our charges to incentivize our customers to get the equipment moving regardless whether it's our equipment or their equipment. We are sitting down with our customers to talk about efficiency in turn times and well, I think they can do to get the network moving so boy. We feel really good about the visibility there. And in the coordination there and decisiveness there to keep the network fluid.\nWalter Spracklin: Okay, I appreciate. Then just to clarify, I was referring to there where it was negative 2.5% in the first quarter, I think Jennifer you you'd indicated that it would. The business mix would keep that kind of negative for the full year and that was what I was asking about but it sounds like you add to. That's great, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Jordan Alger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJordan Alliger: Yes. Just following up on the revenue per carload yield and I'll be instead, to be sufficient to get move that into the positive territory as soon as the second quarter or is it more second half. And then just, then I think you've mentioned biofuel now for at least a couple of quarters. I'm just curious of that opportunity now and perhaps scope and size of that opportunity down the road. Thanks.\nJennifer Hamann: Jordan. This is Jennifer, certainly the second quarter should look better last year's second quarter was obviously with the pandemic greatly impacted especially with the auto production, which was virtually stopped. Now we do still have some production headwinds. This year, that's a little bit of a headwind, but we're expecting it to look better rather it will turn positive in the second quarter. I think that is really going to be dependent on the mix, but we feel good about the direction that things are going, particularly in the back half.\nKenny Rocker: Yes, so biofuels, we've been very encouraged with where we are today with that and we are even more encouraged with where we see by the end of the year and long term, we do see that renewable diesel have a had lags. We've been working with customers to land by on our network and we feel really good about that. We've talked to a growing number of customers that are interested and have committed capital dollars to investment, but we know it's real. So that's why you're seeing that optimism there from us on the biofuels, at that point.\nJordan Alliger: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.\nJustin Long: Thanks and good morning. Lance, following up on the topic of growth in some of the tailwinds that you mentioned. Do you think volume growth above GDP is something that's achievable longer term for the business and if the answer to that is yes, is this something that can happen without negatively impacting mix because I'm guessing a lot of the truckload conversion opportunity is coming in intermodal; it's a lower ARPU.\nLance Fritz: Yes, it's a great question, Justin. So the short answer is, we believe we can grow faster than our served markets, GDP might not be the best measure right because there is a boatload of services embedded in GDP but maybe instead, you'd have to look at the elements of industrial production. So the one caveat I'd give you is that's going to be true. We expect that to be true. We'll be able to drive that with the exception of handful of commodities, coal being one of them, perhaps petroleum being another one and maybe frac sand being another, but you take those off the table and our expectation, if we grow at a better rate than our served markets\nJennifer Hamann: And just say to the next question. We're going to grow profitably. I mean we expect to be able to, we recognize that that's a dynamic that we have in our business today, but we don't see that has been the hindrance has been able to improve our profitability through ongoing efficiency through price into the service that we provided in the marketplace. So that's all kind of baked into how we're looking at the future, and obviously we'll talk more about that on. Therefore\nJustin Long: Great. Appreciate the time.\nOperator: The next question is coming from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Vernon: Good morning to Lance. One of the things that stands out in these two competing bids for case you is this opportunity to convert Highway Traffic either from the Laredo gateway or the Texas area perhaps down even as far down in the Mexico up into the Midwest, now as you look at that intermodal opportunity in that truck conversion opportunity. Would you agree that that is a huge potential market? and if so, what are you guys doing to actually capitalize on that short of a merger? and what can you do to kind of catalyze some of that growth, because it seems like there's a lot of truck-competitive traffic in that corridor and that's carriers are saying is not being converted today because there is a merger, like how do you think about getting out of that opportunity?\nLance Fritz: Thank you, David. So let's start with the potential there is a lot of truck traffic that can be converted to rail and we're constantly working with both the FXE in the KCSM to try to get that done. We have been successful in actually growing our overall intermodal product that we call it the domestic intermodal product. Even though it's to and from Mexico and we expect to continue to do that. Now let's pick and shovel work, right, because we've got to get the FXE or the KCSM interested in a move that might be relative shortfall for them in comparison to what they might be able to do just staying within Mexico, if that's the case, there is always an opportunity to use truck in Mexico as the origination or destination and transload at the border. It's a little more complex, but we do that today and we can continue to do some of that. So yes, the market's big it's pick and shovel work to convert and there has been plenty of advertising about the potential to convert and what it means in synergies, we have not seen the game plan that would be required to be filed with the SCB and once we see that game plan, all of us then can start evaluating how real is it and is it going to be done at our expense, in which case, there's got to be a remedy that maintains our competitive posture.\nDavid Vernon: And then maybe just as a quick follow-up to that, if you look at the routing on your railroad of the reserve, why not Laredo up into the Midwest. That's always been the. I think the lease routing out there. I was just wondering for the rail traffic that's coming over that corridor. I'd imagine customers have a lot of say on the routing. So just because there is another way to kind of move it up a different route, it's out of route. I mean what role, the customers play and sort of determining the routing and some of that carload traffic that would help us assess kind of the diversion risk there?\nLance Fritz: A potential acquisition is the combined carriers might have the opportunity to go to an inferior routing through a commercial construct and it's, and it's not best for the customer, it's not best for the market.\nDavid Vernon: Thanks, officer [ph]. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question is coming from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Seidl: Thanks, operator. And then, Lance and team, thank you for taking this Kenny maybe one for you on the automotive side, I mean obviously that's a question mark. You guys have up there going forward. Clearly, that's going to depend on the ability to get the ships and manufacturing back up, but once that is back up and running. What should that backlog look like for you guys. And what should we expect on the volume side, in the second half of the year and maybe into the first half of 2022.\nKenny Rocker: You're talking about international intermodal not automotive.\nJason Seidl: Automotive, yes.\nKenny Rocker: If the demand is there. We expect that demand Jason, to be strong for the rest of the year. So going into peak season. So the overall demand will be there. You've heard us talk about some of the wins in the international intermodal side and we've also her Eric talk about what we're doing to service the customers out there. So we are encouraged with the demand structure that there with our ability to compete and as the supply chain moves out a little bit. And when I say that I mean the well that warehouse and the Street time that should also open up the velocity for us to move more volume.\nJason Seidl: So you're - then the premium service. Then in the back half of the year and then in the 2022, but it's just a question mark. I just ask quickly, it's going to come back.\nKenny Rocker: I am. That's a good way to not feel confident about the demand on the international intermodal side.\nJustin Long: Okay. I appreciate the time, as always.\nLance Fritz: Thank you, Jason.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no additional questions at this time, I will now turn the floor to Mr. Lance Fritz for closing comments.\nLance Fritz: Thank you, Rob, and thank you all for your questions. Just a reminder, we have an upcoming Virtual Investor Day on May 4 at 2:00 PM Eastern Time. We're all looking forward to discussing our strategy and vision for Union Pacific and we hope you're going to be able to attend with us. I wish you all good health and take care.\nOperator: Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Eric Gehringer",
            "content": "Thanks, Lance, and good morning. The operating team rose to the challenge of this past quarter as it responded to numerous weather challenges across the network. The speed with which the team recovered the network is a testament to the transformation PSR has had on our operations. Moving to Slide 4, we began 2021 with strong key performance indicators across the rough board as the operations were solid and running smooth in January. However, the winter weather challenges we faced in February and March across our network had a heavy impact. The South in particular is not accustomed to the whether they faced. In fact, the weather across our southern region represented the second worst stretch of cold temperatures in over 70 years. Through the team's hard work our network recovered quickly, and we were able to mitigate, most of the impact to our service. In fact, we recovered twice as fast compared to our recovery from the flooding in 2019 and significantly faster than any disruptions we experienced before implementation of PSR. While the operating team is frustrated with the mixed results you see on Slide 4, we will return all of these measures to a state of constant improvement through execution of our transportation plan. Weather heavily impacted the results you see in freight car velocity, freight car terminal dwell and train speed. However, we continue to make good progress on our efficiency measures as both locomotive and workforce productivity improved in the quarter. These improvements were driven by our continual evaluation and adjustment of our transportation plan as well as through our continued efforts to grow train link. Intermodal trip plan compliance decreased in the quarter as weather and a surge in intermodal shipments of 12% year-over-year placed significant pressure on that service. Our manifest service remained solid during the quarter, driving improvement in trip plan compliance for manifest and autos. The team did an excellent job of maintaining this service product throughout the weather impact. Slide 5 highlights some of our recent network changes. We continue to push train length to drive productivity while striving to provide a better service product to our customers. Train length was almost 9,250 feet in the first quarter, which was up 10% or 850ft year over year. One enabler of this great progress is our siding extension program. During the quarter, we completed two sidings and began construction or the bidding process, and another 18 sidings. We continue to make progress in the redesign of our operations in the Houston area to drive efficiency. We are leveraging the recent investment of our Englewood facility and we consolidated the blocking of local cars at our Settegast yard, allowing us to curtail operations at four of our smaller yards around the area. This allows us to bypass those smaller yards and deliver cars directly to the customers, eliminating extra handlings, improving transit time and reducing crew start. We also curtailed switching operations at our North Council Bluffs yard by leveraging surrounding yards, which will reduce local train starts. As I look to the future, I'm excited about the full pipeline of initiatives we have to drive productivity throughout our network and enhance our service product. Turning to Slide 6; everything we do is done with the focus towards safely accomplishing our work. We understand the continuous improvement we need to make and safety, and we have the right plan to achieve our goal. We remain focused on executing on the PSR principles that transformed our operation and there still remain many opportunities for us to improve our operations and drive productivity we have work to do to return our service product to the level we expect. We need to return intermodal trip plan compliance to the mid to upper '80s, manifest trip plan compliance to the low to mid '70s and freight car velocity, the low '20s. We're on that path today as we fully recognize the importance of providing our customers with a highly reliable service product. With that, I will turn it over to Kenny to provide an update on the business environment. We just started. Sounds good. So if we look at Slide 4 as our baseline, so you see on the left-hand side we can just start with freight car velocity showing 209 last 7 day, 218; freight car terminal dwell. So in 23.5 for the quarter last 7 days, 22.6. So very strong indications that we are out of that weather event, we're recovering the system, have recovered much of the system and can get back on the pace than we were before. So strong confidence that we can do that. Yes, so on the labor productivity side, we think about that, 2 ways. Is there more opportunities to continue to grow that number? Absolutely there is. When we think about how do you make sure you're doing that, you're really focused on, are you getting the retention rate that you expect out of the people that are currently furloughed, we're sitting at 75% to 85% on that. So we're still very effective had been able to retain when we need to be able to bring our people for growth and at the same time, our total furloughed count on the TE&Y side of 1400. So there is a strong pool there to draw upon, so no concerns at this time. And one of the greatest tool to do that is all of our continued efforts on train length as, as we reported this morning, we're up 10%, 850 feet. But when you're thinking about the service product and being able to deliver that, one of the best tool you have is a very fluid network as we think about 2.5 years ago, we would have had 800-ish trains running around of any given day. Now, we're at 600 and 605 a day, that's 25% less potential variability events, which is the primary driver for any degradation and trip plan compliance, so continuing to leverage train link on top of how we operate in our terminals both key opportunities to consistently drive that number up to that mid 80 number. Sure. And Jon, I appreciate the question because the Union Pacific is a critical component of that entire supply chain Kenny was mentioning. So when we look at being able to ensure that we have the resources up against that we're always looking at how, what's the total footage of trains that we're able to depart from the LA Basin specifically out of ICTF and so if we go back in time from July to October last year, we had 60,000 feet of capacity. Now as we sell that volume continue to increase. We were intentional and ahead of time increase that to 68,000 in the middle of November and then actually again in April 1 of this year, we took that to 80,000 now that's on top of and driving a 25% increase in our train starts out of the LA Basin also to support that growth. So you see, I hope you see Union Pacific as the component in that process, that's doing everything they can to bring on that volume and efficiently, get it out of the LA Basin and into the Inland Empire, inland terminals, which helps the overall fluidity with the entire supply chain. Yes, I'll take on the resources on hand over to the visibility. So when you think about what are the resource base rate, you're talking about 3 things, you're talking about locomotives. So obviously we have reported that we have 3000 plus locomotives in storage, but we also more importantly to respond to that growth as we have been at the ready locomotives that are actually pre-placed out in geographical areas like the LA Basin.

            "name": "Jennifer Hamann",
            "content": "Thanks. Kenny and good morning, I'm going to start with a look at the first quarter operating ratio and earnings per share on Slide 13. As you heard from Lance, Union Pacific is reporting first quarter earnings per share of $2 and a quarterly operating ratio of 60.1%. Comparing our first quarter results 2020 the extreme winter weather previously discussed negatively impacted our operating ratio by 160 basis points or $0.16 to earnings. In addition, rising fuel prices throughout the quarter and the associated 2-month lag on our fuel surcharge recovery programs impacted our quarterly ratio by 100 basis points or $0.11 per share. Despite these challenges, our core operations and profitability continued to improve, delivering 150 basis points of benefit to our operating ratio and adding $0.12 earnings per share. Looking now at our first quarter income statement on Slide 14, operating revenue totaled $5 billion, down 4% versus 2020 on a 1% year-over-year volume decrease. Operating expense decreased 3% to $3 billion demonstrating our consistent ability to adjust costs more than volume. Taken together, we are reporting first quarter operating income of $2 billion, a 7% decrease versus last year. Interest expense increased 4% compared to 2020 resulting from an increase in fees related to our debt exchange with some offset from lower weighted average debt level, income tax decreased 7% due to lower pre-tax income, net income of $1.3 billion decreased 9% versus 2020 which when combined with share repurchases resulted in earnings per share of $2, down 7%. Looking more closely at first quarter revenue; Slide 15 provides a breakdown of our freight revenue which totaled $4.6 billion, down 5% compared to 2020. Factoring in weather and last year being a leap year, the volume impact on freight revenue was a 75 basis point decrease. Fuel surcharge negatively impacted freight revenue by 200 basis points compared to last year. The decrease was driven by the lag and fuel surcharge recovery as well as slightly lower fuel prices. Our pricing actions continue to yield pricing dollars in excess of inflation. However, those gains were more than offset by a negative business mix and reduced freight revenue 225 basis points. Although our grain shipments increased in the quarter, this impact was more than offset by very strong intermodal volumes coupled with declines in petroleum and industrial product shipments. Now let's move on to Slide 16 which provides a summary of our first quarter operating expenses. Starting with compensation and benefits expense down 3% year-over-year. First quarter workforce levels declined 12% or about 4100 full-time equivalent generating very strong productivity against only a 1% decrease in volume. Specifically, our train and engine workforce continues to be more than volume variable down 11%, while management, engineering and mechanical workforces together decreased 13%. Offsetting some of this productivity was an elevated cost per employee, up 10% as we tightly managed headcount-based wage inflation and higher year-over-year incentive compensation as well as higher weather-related crew costs. Quarterly fuel expense decreased 5%, a result of lower volume and prices. Our fuel consumption rate was essentially flat as productivity initiatives were offset by the additional fuel needed as a result of the extremely cold temperatures. Purchased services and materials expense improved 6% driven by our loop subsidiary utilizing less drayage as a result of lower auto volumes as well as maintenance costs related to a smaller active equipment fleet. These savings were partially offset by additional weather-related expenses. Equipment and other rents fell 7% driven by higher equity income from our ownership in TTS. The other expense line increased 22 million this quarter driven by higher casualty expenses that were primarily related to adverse developments on certain claims. This increase should not be viewed as an indicator of current safety record. As we think about expenses going forward recall that last year in the second and 3rd quarters. We took temporary actions in response to the pandemic reducing management salaries and closing shop. These actions produce a 2% headwind in total for second quarter expenses predominantly impacting compensation and benefits and purchased services and material expenses, and for a full-year comparison excluding, we now expect both purchased services and materials as well as other expense to be up mid-single digits versus 2020. Lastly, we expect our annual effective tax rate to be slightly higher than previously thought, around 24% looking now at productivity on Slide 17, in spite of the $35 million weather headwind, we continue our solid productivity trend in the first quarter generating $105 million. Productivity results were led again by train length improvement contributing to strong workforce and locomotive productivity as Eric detailed earlier. Turning to Slide 18 and our cash flow, cash from operations in the first quarter decreased to $2 billion from $2.2 billion in 2020, a 9% decline despite that free cash flow after capital investments increased 5% to over $1.4 billion, highlighting our ongoing capital discipline as well as a slightly slower start to our capital programs. This generated a cash flow conversion rate of 106%. Free cash flow after dividends also increased in the quarter, up $115 million or 17%. Supported by our strong cash generation and cash balances we returned $2 billion to shareholders during the first quarter as we maintained our industry-leading dividend payout and repurchase shares totaling 1.4 billion. We finished the first quarter with a comparable adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.8 times on par with year-end 2020. Wrapping up on Slide 19; despite the slow start to the year, we remain confident in our ability to show improvement across all three performance drivers' volume, price and productivity, we do face some volume headwinds declining coal demand the lingering impact of industrial, chemical plant closures from the February storm and the semiconductor shortage that is continuing to impact autos into the second quarter. Setting that aside though, there are even more reasons to be encouraged about '21. The pace of vaccination rollouts, strong consumer and trade demand, and an improving industrial production forecast. And we are increasingly optimistic about our ability to drive business to the railroad. Since early March, we have seen an improving demand trajectory with March averaging roughly a 157,000 seven-day car loadings and we crossed the 160,000 plus threshold in April. So with the strength we're seeing in our volumes, we now expect full year carload growth to be around 6%. Our guidance around full-year pricing, productivity and operating ratio improvement in the range of 150 to 200 basis points, all remain intact. However, with our updated volume outlook, we will likely be closer to the 200 than the 150. We clearly have work ahead of us to achieve these goals. But a broader economic picture and good traction on our PSR initiatives, give us a path to success. Turning to cash and capital, our capital spending plan remains at $2.9 billion for the year, well within our long-term guidance of below 15% of revenue as we generate capacity through our PSR focus. We will maintain our industry-leading dividend payout ratio and are committed to strong share repurchases. Specifically, we plan to return approximately $6 billion to our shareholders in 2021 through share repurchases. Before I turn it back to Lance, I'd like to add my thanks to our exceptional workforce. Mother Nature tested our capabilities this quarter and once again our workforce showed they are ready for the challenges and are committed to serving our customers. So with that, I'll turn it back to Lance. So thanks for the question. So yes, I mean starting off the year with a 60.1 and be able to get to in that range of 56.5 to 57 and as we said, we're hoping to get closer to the 200 basis points of improvement. That certainly says we have to improve over the balance of the year and make very strong improvement to hit those targets. And so in terms of what gives us confidence, it really is the ability to win in the marketplace. As we mentioned that we're expecting volumes to be around 6% or so up year-over-year as you might recall back in January our original guidance was 46%, so we're now seeing strengthening in the economy. Kenny and the team winning new business and so, those are all very positive signs. And then again, the efficiency piece, certainly we were impacted in the quarter with weather and fuel, they took their toll on the first quarter OR. But we still generated 150 basis points of core improvement. And so as we look to grow volumes and put some of those transitory issues behind us. We feel good about the rest of the year. And I would just add to that and Allison wants a large commentary. We're also starting in a little bit worse off than we anticipated when we laid out our guidance for you. We had a tougher first quarter than how things actually played out with what happened with weather. So, but to your headcount question, Ken in terms of how we see that playing out where it call it just shy of 30,000 employees. Today, we think that we should be able to even at the high end of that range, kind of keep steady state relative to those, you may see some ups and downs a little bit. We may actually have to do a little bit of hiring in some small locations if we don't have adequate crew base there. You heard Eric refer to the 1400 furloughs, but we plan on being very efficient with the crew base. And so we think even up to that high-end of the range that we gave, the 6%. We should be able to keep that pretty flat with some little seasonal fluctuation. Now we said the business mix is expected to be negative. But not so overall yield. So when you think about yields. Obviously, there's numerous components there is the mix impact. There's, which we do expect is going to be pressured probably going to look a little bit better here in the second quarter and 3rd quarter of pressure in the 4th quarter with some of the grain come. But in terms of pricing. So, very good about pricing and then fuel surcharges. This is the last quarter where we've got a pretty negative comparison year-over-year relative to fuel prices and surcharges. And so that should look better over the balance of the year as well. Jordan. This is Jennifer, certainly the second quarter should look better last year's second quarter was obviously with the pandemic greatly impacted especially with the auto production, which was virtually stopped. Now we do still have some production headwinds. This year, that's a little bit of a headwind, but we're expecting it to look better rather it will turn positive in the second quarter. I think that is really going to be dependent on the mix, but we feel good about the direction that things are going, particularly in the back half. And just say to the next question. We're going to grow profitably. I mean we expect to be able to, we recognize that that's a dynamic that we have in our business today, but we don't see that has been the hindrance has been able to improve our profitability through ongoing efficiency through price into the service that we provided in the marketplace. So that's all kind of baked into how we're looking at the future, and obviously we'll talk more about that on. Therefore"

            "content": "Thank you, Eric, and good morning. Our first quarter volume was down 1% from a year ago due to weather events and the leap year in 2020. Solid gains in our intermodal on export grain markets were offset by declines in our industrial and energy related market. Freight revenue was down 5% for the quarter due to the decrease in volume, coupled with the lower fuel surcharge and negative business mix that offset...that were offset by our core pricing. Let's take a closer look at how each of our business groups performed in the first quarter. Starting with our bulk markets, revenue for the quarter was down 1%, volume decreased by 2%, which was partially offset by a 1% increase in average revenue per car, due to the positive mix in traffic and core pricing gains. Coal and renewable carloads were down 16% as a result of continued high customer inventory levels, our contract law and weather-related challenges, which were partially offset by higher natural gas prices. Volume for grain and grain products was up 16%, driven by increased demand for export grain. Fertilizer carloads were down 4% as reduced export potash shipments were partially offset by stronger demand for industrial sulfur. And finally, food and refrigerated volume was down 6%, driven primarily by decreased demand for food service due to the ongoing pandemic as well as weather related challenges. Moving on to industrial, industrial revenue declined 13% for the quarter, driven by an 11% decrease in volume. Average revenue per car also declined 1% from a lower fuel surcharge and mix. Energy and specialized shipment decreased 14% primarily driven by reduced crude oil shipments due to unfavorable price drag and reduced demand. Forest products volume grew by 7%, lumber was driven by strong housing starts, along with an increase in repair and remodel. We also saw strength in brown paper, driven by increased box demand and low inventory. Industrial chemicals and plastic shipments were down 9% for the quarter, due to the severe storm in May and February that cost plant interruptions for producers throughout the Gulf Coast as well as feedstock shortages in certain sectors. Metals and minerals volume was down 16% primarily driven by weather and market softness in rock coupled with reduced frac sand shipments associated with the decline in drilling and surplus in local sand. Turning now to premium, revenue for the quarter was up 2% on a 6% increase in volume. Average revenue per car declined by 4% reflecting mix effect from greater container volumes and fewer automotive carload shipment. Automotive volume was down 13% for the quarter as manufacturers struggled with semiconductor-related part shortages and extreme winter weather disruptions to the supply chain. Finished vehicle and auto parts shipments were impacted similarly with finished vehicles, down 13% and auto part, down 14%. Intermodal volume increased by 12% in the quarter. Domestic intermodal was up 16% year-over-year due to continued strength in retail sales in recent business land parcel in particular benefited from ongoing strength and e-commerce. International intermodal volume grew 8% despite poor congestion related to strong growth in containerized import. Now looking ahead to the rest of 2021, for our bulk commodities, we expect a continued negative outlook for coal, electricity demand and natural gas prices are forecasted to improve have high customer inventory levels, combined with increased demand for other energy sources and a contract law presents a challenging market. However, there is continued strength for export grain as China remains committed to incremental ag product purchases in 2021 calendar year, with clearly a tougher year-over-year comparison in the back half of the year. We also are optimistic with our biofuel shipments as domestic production is expected to increase, which will drive new volume at new UP destination facility for bulk renewable diesel feedstocks and finished products. As we look ahead to our industrial commodities, the year-over-year comps for our energy market are favorable however, there is still uncertainty with the speed of the recovery in those markets. We are encouraged by the stronger forecast for industrial production. Full year 2021 is now forecasted at 6.5%, a 2% point improvement since we spoke in January. Plastic volumes will also remain strong for us in 2021 as production rates increase. And lastly, for premium, we expect strong uplift in both our automotive and intermodal businesses. Automotive sales are forecasted to increase from 14 million units in 2020 to closer to $16 million in 2021. We are optimistic that automotive production will normalize and supply chain issue for parts are expected to improve later in the second quarter. With regard to intermodal, Limited truck capacity we're encouraged conversion from over the road truck to rail. Retail inventories remain historically low, restocking of inventory along with continued strength in sales should drive intermodal volumes, higher this year. Before I hand this over to Jennifer, I'd like to express my appreciation to our operating and engineering teams for their hard work and dedication to keep our network running in the unprecedented weather event in February and March. Both our commercial and operating teams work closely together to quickly recover operations for our customers and win new bit. With that, I'll turn it over to Jennifer to review our financial performance. Yes. So, I think so. First of all, Chris, you know, it really does start with the service product. Eric and his team have done a really fabulous job of improving the service performance and it shows up in things like car velocity. So for example, as you look at our intermodal network is that velocity becomes more reliable and more consistent, but we're able to compete right up there with truck on that domestic network. The same is true with parcel. And then as you look at the carload business, the lower cost structure has really opened up market for us, we're able to compete and have been able to win in lower value commodities in areas like bulk, we're able to access customers that may not have want to take large positions on either fertilizers, or some commodities like grain that's been encouraging to us, on the auto side we've been really excited about new lines that we've won that we, that weren't there in the past, and then finally, Lance, as you talk about product sales that we talked about the product offering in Pocatello, where we're going to be able to provide a match back opportunities for containers getting back to the way. Eric, let me jump in and part of your question Allison was kind of what should the thresholds be and our experience at least right now. And I would say into the near-term tells us trip plan compliance on the manifest side about 75-ish plus or minus better more is better, but there is a threshold at which more costs more than it's valued. And then on the intermodal side, we do think high '80s '90s is kind of where that needs to be parked to be reliable and truck-competitive. Yes, let me jump in real quick, what I just want to say what is critical here is the reliability part of it that could predictably can get to that 75 and we can take that to the customer, we can still talk to them about going after truck lanes that they know predictably that it's going to be at 75 or 77 or 73 or whatever that number is. So, just close out here, Jon. We feel good about the incremental wins that we're seeing on the domestic side. It is a tight market as we're going through this season. We feel encouraged by some of the past wins on the international intermodal side though, as we move throughout the year, we're fully going very optimistic about the marketplace. Yes, I'd just add to that. We stay very coordinated with the customer on what they plan to do on what their forecasts are. And then we in turn taken that it didn't now with Eric and so he talked about the adjustments that we've made. We've got visibility just talking to our customers, from that perspective, obviously here this year, we made some changes to our charges to incentivize our customers to get the equipment moving regardless whether it's our equipment or their equipment. We are sitting down with our customers to talk about efficiency in turn times and well, I think they can do to get the network moving so boy. We feel really good about the visibility there. And in the coordination there and decisiveness there to keep the network fluid. Yes, so biofuels, we've been very encouraged with where we are today with that and we are even more encouraged with where we see by the end of the year and long term, we do see that renewable diesel have a had lags. We've been working with customers to land by on our network and we feel really good about that. We've talked to a growing number of customers that are interested and have committed capital dollars to investment, but we know it's real. So that's why you're seeing that optimism there from us on the biofuels, at that point. You're talking about international intermodal not automotive. If the demand is there. We expect that demand Jason, to be strong for the rest of the year. So going into peak season. So the overall demand will be there. You've heard us talk about some of the wins in the international intermodal side and we've also her Eric talk about what we're doing to service the customers out there. So we are encouraged with the demand structure that there with our ability to compete and as the supply chain moves out a little bit. And when I say that I mean the well that warehouse and the Street time that should also open up the velocity for us to move more volume. I am. That's a good way to not feel confident about the demand on the international intermodal side."

        "content": "Operator: Greetings. Welcome to the Union Pacific Fourth Quarter 2022 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]  As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today\u2019s presentation are available on Union Pacific\u2019s website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Mr. Fritz, you may now begin.\nLance Fritz: Thank you, Rob, and good morning. And welcome to Union Pacific's fourth quarter earnings conference call. With me today in Omaha are Kenny Rocker, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Eric Gehringer, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Jennifer Hamann, our Chief Financial Officer. The fourth quarter and 2022 overall were challenging for Union Pacific and our employees. The lengthy labor negotiations tested our work force, while customers felt the impact of our service issues. Two things are critically important as we turn the page to 2023. First, is the trend line of improving freight car velocity since late summer, although acknowledging there were bumps along the way. And second, is how we move forward, establishing consistent service for our customers day-in and day-out and demonstrating to all stakeholders our commitment to excellence. Now turning to our fourth quarter results. This morning Union Pacific is reporting 2022 fourth quarter net income of $1.6 billion or $2.67 per share. This compares to fourth quarter 2021 results of $1.7 billion or $2.66 per share. Our fourth quarter operating ratio of 61% deteriorated 360 basis points versus 2021, driven by continued service challenges and the impact from winter weather. For the full year, reported operating ratio finished at 60.1%, deteriorating 290 basis points, driven by operational inefficiency, inflation and higher fuel prices. The entire Union Pacific team recognizes that 2022 did not beat expectations. Crew constraints in critical locations impacted by shifting demand had a real impact on our performance. As you will hear from Eric, we are building resiliency into the network through hiring efforts, shifting critical resources and better operations to address that shortfall, and you are seeing those benefits manifested in how the network has responded since Thanksgiving through the ups and downs of extreme winter weather. These challenges aside, we achieved volume growth for the year. We demonstrated our commitment to meet customer needs with business development wins that are critical to long-term financial success. The recent onboarding of Schneider is a great proof statement of delivering on that commitment. We also made significant progress towards our climate goals. In 2022, we increased our biofuel blend to over 4.5% on pace to achieve our 2030 target of 20%. This is a key initiative in achieving our 2030 greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. In addition, for a fourth consecutive year, we improved our fuel consumption rate on a year-over-year basis, lowering at 1% to an all-time record. This helped our customers avoid 23.4 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions by using rail versus truck. Union Pacific will continue to be a rail leader in sustainability. Now let\u2019s start with Kenny for an update on the business environment.\nKenny Rocker: Thank you, Lance, and good morning. Fourth quarter volume was up 1% compared to 2021. Gains in our Premium Business Group were partially offset by a decline in our bulk area. However, freight revenue was up 9%, driven by higher fuel surcharges and strong price. Let\u2019s take a closer look at each of these business groups. Starting with Bulk. Revenue for the quarter was up 7% compared to 2021, driven by a 10% increase in average revenue per car, reflecting higher fuel surcharges and solid core pricing gains. Volume was down 3% year-over-year. Grain and grain products volume was down 2%, driven by a decrease in export grain shipments. Despite strong market demand, we faced service and weather challenges that slow shuttle cycle times, as well as having a tough 2021 comparable. Fertilizer carloads were down 15% year-over-year driven by reduced shipments for potash due to market softness along with another tough comp the 2021 fourth quarter. Food and refrigerated volume was down 8% due to reduced shipments of finished beverage product and their associated raw materials. And lastly, coal and renewable carloads remained flat in the quarter, as our ability to capture demand from favorable natural gas prices was impacted by weather and service challenges, particularly in late December. Moving on to Industrial. Industrial revenue was up 5% for the quarter, driven by a 5% improvement in average revenue per car due to higher fuel surcharges and core pricing gains, somewhat offset by a negative business mix. Volume for the quarter was flat. Industrial chemicals and plastic shipments were down 4% year-over-year driven by lower Industrial chemicals demand. Metals and minerals volumes continued to deliver robust year-over-year growth, driven in part by our business development efforts. Volume was up 8% compared to 2021, primarily driven by an increase in frac sand shipments and growth in construction materials. Forest products volume declined 17% year-over-year, driven by weak corrugated box demand and softness in the housing market. Energy and specialized shipments were up 2% compared to 2021, driven by an increased waste and soda ash demand, partially offset by pure petroleum shipments from regulatory changes in Mexico markets. Turning to Premium. Revenue for the quarter was up 15% on a 3% increase in volume. Average revenue per car increased 12% due primarily to higher fuel surcharge revenue and core pricing gains. Automotive volume was up 9%, driven by strengthening production and inventory replenishment for finished vehicles. Intermodal volume was up 2%, driven by increased international shipments, mainly due to an easier comp in 2021. Although domestic volumes decreased due to soft market demand, declining truck rates and increased over the roll capacity, the aforementioned negative impact was partially offset with the Schneider conversion in December. Now as we look ahead to 2023, you can see the macro indicators that we are watching along with inflation and interest rates, and you will notice that we have some challenges with Industrial production, imports and housing starts. However, we remain optimistic that we will be Industrial production with our strong focus on business development. So now moving on to Slide 8. Here is our market outlook for 2023 as we sit here today. Starting with our Bulk commodities, we expect a challenging year were grain based on drought conditions, which will affect crop availability in UP served origin. However, we expect to see growth in coal, even though natural gas prices have come off their highs, low inventories will continue -- will support continued demand. We are keeping a close eye on natural gas prices, given the price impact of our index based contracts. In addition, we expect biofuel shipments for renewable diesel to continue to grow due to solid market demand, new production facilities coming online and business development wins. Moving on to Industrial. The forecast for Industrial production is to shrink slightly in 2023 and the demand is softening in forest products. However, we expect to see continued strength in metal with new business wins. And lastly, for Premium, we expect the entire Intermodal market to be challenged, both international and domestic by high inventory levels, lower truck rates and temper consumer spending. We expect to outperform that market, however, through our new business with Schneider, as well as opportunities to grow with other private asset owners and our strong IMC partners. We expect automotive growth to be another bright spot in this segment driven by production strength and inventory replenishment. As I wrap up my comments, I want to take a moment to express my gratitude to our customers and the operating team. Over the past month, extreme weather events impacted large portions of our network and I want to thank our employees who safely worked around the clock in harsh conditions to keep the railroad running for our customers. And with that, I will turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance.\nEric Gehringer: Thanks, Kenny, and good morning. Starting on Slide 10, safety is at the foundation of everything we do. We have enhanced our training programs and are working to solidify our safety culture through ownership and personal accountability. These efforts drove an 18% improvement in our 2022 full year personal injury safety results, which is at the lowest level in five years. We look to leverage these gains to improve derailment performance in 2023. While good progress, overall, our goal remains returning each employee home safely at the end of the day. Moving now to Slide 11 for a look at our current operational performance, our attention throughout 2022 was focused on onboarding the necessary crew resources to operate a fluid network and meet customer demand. I would like to thank our partners and workforce resources and the operating team for their great work in recruiting and onboarding new team members. We currently have around 600 employees in training as our pipeline is significantly stronger than it was a year ago. That being said, our hiring efforts will continue in 2023, as we backfill for attrition and target locations across the northern region, where crude challenges persist. In the near-term, we will continue to utilize borrow outs to supplement crew shortfalls. Another key element in increasing fluidity is the reduction of excess inventory, which builds the foundation for a strong and resilient service product. I am proud of the progress we made, which would have not been accomplished without the dedication and tireless work of the commercial and operating teams. Mother Nature threatened to derail some of that progress in the last weeks of December with blizzard conditions and extreme cool temperatures across much of the network. However, our team responded and we quickly rebounded demonstrating greater resiliency that we can build on in 2023. With current freight car velocity around 210 miles per day and trip plan compliance measures demonstrating sequential improvement, we look to maintain that progress as volumes strengthen into 2023. Now let\u2019s review our key performance metrics for the quarter, starting on Slide 12, which continue to trail 2021\u2019s results. Both freight car velocity and manifest and auto trip plan compliance were flat sequentially from last quarter\u2019s results. Importantly, however, Intermodal trip plan compliance did improve 11 points sequentially, as supply chain congestion alleviated, resulting in less stack containers at the inland ramps. Near the end of the quarter, we successfully onboarded the Schneider Intermodal business and remain actively engaged to manage that transition. Turning to Slide 13 to review our network efficiency metrics, which also like 2021\u2019s fourth quarter measures, locomotive productivity, workforce productivity and train length all declined sequentially driven by lower volumes in the back half of the quarter and winter weather challenges. Entering 2023, the team remains focused on strengthening the network while recovering lost productivity. Moving to Slide 14, we continue to exercise discipline in our capital spending, while delivering value to our shareholders. We are targeting 2023 capital spending of $3.6 billion, pending final approval by our Board of Directors. While the projected increase from last year, we expect capital spending to remain in line with our long-term guidance of less than 15% of revenue. As always, our first capital dollars will support our existing infrastructure. This spending will harden our infrastructure, renew older assets and support safe operations. For 2023, in addition to a higher inflationary environment, the elevated capital spending will be driven by increased locomotive spending of $175 million. With 430 modernized locomotives currently in the fleet, we will bring the total modernized to over 1,000 by the end of 2025. These modernizations not only help build resiliency into the network through enhanced reliability and productivity, but also further the progress towards our carbon emission reduction goals. We continue to invest capital for growth. On the Intermodal front, we are investing in additional capacity at the Inland Empire terminal and we will be expanding our footprint in Kansas City. And on the capacity side, we will continue to invest in projects like sidings that drive productivity, allow us to handle more car loadings and improve our network efficiency. Wrapping up on Slide 15, we are dedicated to improving our service product in 2023. Slide 15 provides a roadmap of the key activities to achieve that goal. We demonstrated meaningful improvement in our safety results in 2022 through an enhancement to our safety management systems and continue towards the goal of world class safety. Additionally, we recognize the importance of quality of life concerns that our agreement professionals voiced. We continue to work closely with union leadership to find win-win solutions that enable a strong service product and provide our employees with more consistent work schedules. As we sustain improved operational performance, use our resources more efficiently and reduce variability, we will generate productivity. At the same time, technology enhancements will drive further productivity and support a consistent and reliable service product for our customers. With that, I will turn it over to Jennifer to review our financial performance.\nJennifer Hamann: Thanks, Eric, and good morning. Let\u2019s start with fourth quarter income statement on Slide 17. Operating revenue in the quarter totaled $6.2 billion, up 8% versus 2021 on a 1% increase in volume. These gains were more than offset by a 14% increase in operating expense, which totaled $3.8 billion. Excluding the impact of higher fuel prices expenses were up 7% in the quarter. Operating income of $2.4 billion declined 1% versus 2021. Other income remained strong, up 11% to $92 million, driven by higher real estate income and pension benefit, which offset 2021\u2019s $36 million gain on the sale of a technology investment. Interest expense increased 13% as average debt levels increased more than $3 billion year-over-year. Net income of $1.6 billion declined 4%. But when combined with share repurchases, resulted in essentially flat earnings per share at $2.67. Fourth quarter operating ratio of 61% increased 360 basis points, driven by higher inflation and operating costs. Falling fuel prices during the quarter had a favorable 20-basis-point impact. Looking more closely at fourth quarter revenue, Slide 18 provides a breakdown of our freight revenue, which totaled $5.8 billion in the fourth quarter, up 9% compared to 2021. Volume contributed 75 basis points. As fuel prices stayed high year-over-year, fourth quarter fuel surcharge revenue also remained elevated, totaling $975 million and increased freight revenue 850 basis points. Strong core pricing gains that exceeded inflation dollars were more than offset by a negative business mix, resulting in a 25-basis-point decline in freight revenue. Fewer forest product shipments combined with higher International Intermodal and rock shipments drove the negative mix. Turning to Slide 19 for a summary of our fourth quarter operating expenses, the largest driver of the overall expense increase was again fuel, up 43% as fuel prices rose 46%. Combating these higher prices, we continue to drive productivity, improving our fuel consumption rate 2 points to produce a fourth quarter record. Our compensation and benefits expense was up 10% versus 2021. Total fourth quarter workforce levels increased 4%, reflecting our hiring efforts throughout 2022. Cost per employee grew 6%, primarily driven by wage inflation. In addition, cost pressures from network inefficiencies in the form of higher overtime and borrow out costs continued in the quarter. Purchased services and materials expense remained elevated, up 18%, driven by cost to maintain a larger active locomotive fleet, volume related purchase transportation expense at our loop subsidiary and inflation. Equipment and other rents increased 3%, driven by the impact of slower cycle times on car hire expenses. Other expense was flat in the quarter, as higher travel and casualty expenses were offset by a partial insurance recovery related to 2021 bridge fire, as well as lower state and local taxes. Looking to 2023, we have opportunities across the Board to improve efficiency and that\u2019s job one as we recover our service product. Although we still expect to be more than volume variable with our workforce, we will continue to aggressively hire crews in critical locations and to backfill attrition. For 2023, we expect our all-in inflation to be around 4%, while cost per employee is expected to increase in the mid single digits as elevated wage inflation is partially offset by productivity. Depreciation expense should be up around 3% versus 2022 and below the line, similar to last year, we expect other income to remain elevated versus historic levels driven by higher real estate and interest income. Finally, we expect our 2023 annual effective tax rate to be around 24%. Moving to Slide 20 with a quick recap of full year 2022 results, which are shown on the slide as reported and include the impact of the third quarter PEB adjustment. Revenue was up 14%, an annual record, driven by increased fuel surcharges, strong pricing gains and 2% volume growth. Record operating income increased 6% to $9.9 billion, which includes a net increase of just under $700 million from fuel surcharges. Our full year reported operating ratio of 60.1% deteriorated 290 basis points versus 2021. Network inefficiencies and inflation were the primary components of the degradation with the PEB adjustment and higher fuel prices impacting the full year operating ratio by 30 basis points and 20 basis points, respectively. Earnings per share finished the year at a record $11.21, a 13% increase versus 2021 results. Our consistent and disciplined approach to deploying capital back into our railroad coupled with volume growth that produced increased operating income drove a 90-basis-point improvement in return on invested capital to a record 17.3%. Turning to shareholder returns on the balance sheet on Slide 21, full year cash from operations increased over $300 million to $9.4 billion, a 4% increase from 2021. The first priority for our cash is capital investment, which finished 2022 at $3.4 billion or just under 14% of revenue. Our cash flow conversion rate finished 2022 at 82% and free cash flow totaled $2.7 billion. Although a decrease of nearly $800 million versus 2021, that includes an almost $700 million increase in cash capital, a more than $350 million increase in dividend payments and $70 million for PEB back pay settlements. Our dividend payout ratio for 2022 was around 45%, in line with our long-term target, as we rewarded shareholders with a 10% dividend increase in the second quarter and distributed nearly $3.2 billion. We also returned cash through strong share repurchases, buying back 5% or $27 million of our common shares at an all-in cost of $6.3 billion. In total, between dividends and share repurchases, we returned $9.4 billion to our owners in 2022, demonstrating our ongoing commitment to deliver significant shareholder value. We closed out the year at an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.9 times, consistent with our resolve to maintain strong investment-grade credit ratings as we finished the year A rated by Moody\u2019s, S&P and Fitch. Turning now to our view on 2023, we think about the year ahead in two parts, what we can control and what we cannot. We don\u2019t control the markets we serve, and as you saw on Kenny\u2019s slide of economic indicators, it\u2019s a mixed bag in terms of expectations. We do control the way we compete in those markets with the great foundation of the UP franchise. Onboarding Schneider is clearly the marquee win for 2023 and with Kenny\u2019s team posting profitable wins across the Board, we are positioned to further outperform the market. In 2023, that will be evidenced by car loadings that exceed Industrial production. Another area where we don\u2019t have direct control is the current inflationary environment, which continues to be elevated. However, we know we have it within our control to improve operations. As you heard from Eric, it\u2019s imperative that we improve the reliability of our service product, while regaining lost productivity. In addition, as we have demonstrated consistently, we expect to generate pricing dollars that exceed inflation dollars in 2023. Assuming current fuel prices and our thoughts on volume, productivity and price, we expect to improve our full year 2023 operating ratio on a year-over-year basis. That said, there will be a lag to fully offset the impact of inflation on our profitability until we are able to actively touch or re-price our business while also further improving productivity. Turning to capital allocation, we continue to make significant investments into our business with an expected 6% increase in capital investments versus 2022 to $3.6 billion. Growth is the cornerstone to the long-term financial success of Union Pacific and we are continuing to invest in opportunities that support that strategy. In addition to the locomotive and Intermodal investments Eric described, we also are investing to support carload growth. The remainder of our capital allocation plans remain unchanged, rewarding our owners with an industry-leading dividend payout of around 45% and returning excess cash through share repurchases. With our balance sheet currently leveraged at the desired levels, the amount of cash available for repurchases will be less than in prior years and predominantly funded from cash generation. With the New Year comes new opportunities and by focusing on what we can control, we are confident in our ability to provide strong value to all of our stakeholders in 2023. So, with that, I will turn it back to Lance.\nLance Fritz: Thank you, Jennifer. Let\u2019s wrap up on Slide 24. We made great strides on personal safety in 2022 and it\u2019s imperative we continue that momentum. The commitment made by our employees to care for one another has been exceptional, resulting in our best employee safety metrics in five years. We look to further translate these gains into better derailment performance in the upcoming year. We understand that safety is about culture and it\u2019s about engagement, listening to and responding to our employees needs and ideas will continue to improve our safety performance. Our robust hiring pipeline and improving network fluidity strengthen crew availability. That leads to a more efficient and better service product that enables us to recapture lost productivity. Over the past couple of years, we have demonstrated our commitment to customer-centered growth as reflected in business development wins, and while growth in 2023 may be challenging given the uncertainty of the economic backdrop, we will continue to make strategic capital investments in support of our long-term growth objectives. Our fundamentals for long-term success have not changed, powered by our best-in-industry employees and franchise, a strategy built for profitable growth and a more efficient and reliable service product, Union Pacific is poised to do great things in 2023 and we are ready to prove it. So, with that, let\u2019s open up the line for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will be coming from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nJon Chappell: Thank you. Good morning. Eric kind of a bigger picture question for you, if we go back to the Investor Day and you laid out a multiyear productivity improvement for the network, obviously, some of that\u2019s been delayed given the macro challenges. But are you confident that you can eventually obtain the aggregate plan over time or does the slower macro backdrop, higher labor costs, some of these recent service challenges, weather, et cetera, I mean that, the total aggregate improvements are reset at a lower level going forward?\nEric Gehringer: Yeah. Jon, thank you for that question. As we think about that, certainly, as we look at the environment right now and what lays in front of us, it may be over a longer period of time that those actually come to fruition. But everyone here remains focused on those commitments and you see that in the activities that we have taken on in some of my prepared comments, I talked about some of the technology initiatives that are more focused not only in 2023, but even beyond that. What\u2019s sitting in front of us right now is the biggest opportunity is to improve that service product that from it drives out that excess cost when we think about our locomotive and our workforce productivity. That\u2019s job number one right now, but we are all still focused on the long-term targets that we gave you on the Investor Day.\nJon Chappell: Thank you, Eric.\nEric Gehringer: Thanks, Jon.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks. Good morning. Hey, everyone. I just wanted to ask about yields, particularly Intermodal yields and how we should expect Intermodal yield to develop in 2023, excluding the impact of fuel. There were some reports in the trade rags back in December that UP is cutting Intermodal rates by 3% effective February. I just want to get maybe this question for Kenny, but just get a little bit more color on that specific item and then how you expect overall Intermodal yields to trend as the new business comes on? Thank you.\nKenny Rocker: Yeah. Thanks a lot, Amit. First of all, we are in the early stages of bid season, call it, 10% to 15%. You heard me call out in my notes we are seeing some softness there in the marketplace. We have been encouraged that we are retaining all the business that we are out there competing for. I think it\u2019s too soon to call out what will happen in terms of pricing, but what I will tell you is that, we do have mechanisms for our business to make sure that we can remain competitive in a challenged market like this, but also price to the market and make sure that we are capturing some of the upside as things get tight throughout the year.\nLance Fritz: And Kenny, Amit, this is Lance. But Kenny, you are also remaining confident that as we put our plan together, all that included, we are still -- we see a clear path for pricing ahead of inflation.\nKenny Rocker: Absolutely.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my question. Just maybe on the back of that answer, Jennifer, you did talk about a lagged ability to recapture some of the cost inflation on the price line, so I was wondering if you could expand on that? And maybe also just discuss your fuel surcharge revenue that does appear to be above fuel expense for a certain period of 2022 and the mix impact that Kenny was just speaking about?\nJennifer Hamann: That\u2019s a lot there in one question. But in terms of the lag part, so there is that piece. When you think about our contract structure, so in any given year, call it, 50% we are able to touch directly. The remainder is longer term contracts and they roll over in some segments over periods of years. Now those generally have escalators, but there can be limits on the escalators and those are lagging as well. So that\u2019s what we are referring to as having a lag impact. As well as kind of going back to the first question to, Eric, still very confident in our productivity initiatives, but we did take a step back this year. We have to acknowledge that and it\u2019s going to take us a little bit to gain that back because the inflation is real. That\u2019s a real factor that is certainly above what we have seen historically when you think about 4% kind of number for 2023. So that\u2019s that piece. You also mentioned fuel surcharge, and yeah, that was a positive contributor to us on an EPS operating income front in 2023 and so depending on what you estimate for fuel prices, that could be a headwind for us at some point. Overall, we averaged, I think, 365 [ph] for the year. Right now, we are paying closer to, call it, 315, 320 [ph]. So that could certainly be a difference when you think about year-over-year comparisons on the fuel surcharge revenue.\nLance Fritz: I think he also asked about mix.\nJennifer Hamann: Mix. I knew there was one more in there. So from a mix standpoint, yeah, I mean, fourth quarter mix was certainly negative when you look at it. And one of the things probably that really jumps out at you think about Intermodal, but in particular, International Intermodal and the year-over-year comparison, when you think about last year, International Intermodal was down substantially and then we saw it grow here in the fourth quarter this year, plus forest products, some of the Industrial segments a little weaker in the fourth quarter and higher rock shipments. So it\u2019s kind of that all-in and look there, Brandon. Now I think it covers.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you, Jennifer. Yeah. You did.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ari Rosa with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nAri Rosa: Great. Good morning. So I wanted to ask about the target for growth to exceed Industrial production. It seems like a little bit of a low bogey given the service improvement that\u2019s expected for 2023, given the cost advantages for the railroad and then in particular the addition of Schneider\u2019s Intermodal business. You have obviously see a lot of volume in recent years, but I wonder get a little bit more clarity on kind of what that means in terms of that expectation for Industrial production, I am sorry, for growth to exceed Industrial production? And then over kind of a longer three-year to five-year time horizon, how you are thinking about the prospects for UP to grow volume significantly ahead of kind of economic growth?\nLance Fritz: Yeah. Ari, this is Lance. So I am going to start -- I am going to focus my commentary on 2023 and then I will turn it over to Kenny to broaden that out. Clearly, what you are seeing from us is a perspective that says there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty as we enter 2023. You could see it in some of the macroeconomic indicators that Kenny shared but you can hear it and see it across the Board in many markets right now and so while we are confident we can outperform Industrial production, which is an underlying driver for a fair amount of what we ship, going beyond that and becoming more granular just is it\u2019s a little too early in the year given all the uncertainty that we see, so hard to stop on that.\nKenny Rocker: Yeah. So, Lance, I want to hit hard for those on the call, the mindset of this management team and the commercial team is really to drive business development and so that\u2019s one thing that we can control. There are some markets out there that we really want to go after that we think are right. Renewable diesel is one of them and we feel good and confident about the wins there. If you look at finished vehicles, both the finished vehicle side and also the auto parts side is an area that we feel good about. There are some expansions that are coming along our line that we won in the petrochem area with plastics and Industrial chem. And then also, we have talked and been very bullish about metals as we have seen some wins come up there. So very focused on the things we can control and been encouraged that car velocity has been improving along the way.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nTom Wadewitz: Yeah. Good morning. So I wanted to touch a little bit on some of the price commentary. Can you say like kind of broad brush, what you are assuming on Intermodal revenue per car and coal revenue per car. What are you assuming when you talk about pricing dollars above inflation? And then maybe if you can just offer a comment and kind of broader pricing, is the dynamic changing in rail competition? You have won a bunch of business over the last, I don\u2019t know, 18 months. Is that having an effect on the competitive dynamic or would you say things are pretty stable?\nJennifer Hamann: So, Tom, let me take the first part of that question, and then I will let Kenny address the second part. We are not going to give comments on directional guidance for RPU for various line items. You know the factors that are going to drive that. It\u2019s certainly the pricing but also fuel surcharge and then the mix of the business within that line. So those will all be things that will play into what that turns out to for 2023.\nKenny Rocker: Yeah. Let me lead again with something Lance mentioned that we feel very confident that we will be able to price over the inflation dollars. So I want to say that, our commercial team has done a great job of articulating the need to price to the market. When we talk about price into the market, we have talked about some of those dynamics. Inflation is one our customers are facing that, too. They understand that. But we also talk pretty broadly about investment. When I say investments, part of what I am talking about is what Eric is doing with our capital plan. The other part is making sure that we are resourced the helm of growth. So we are doubt in on that, we are having those conversations with customers and we are articulating that.\nLance Fritz: Hey, Tom. This is Lance. We have also got to recognize that I think underlying your question certainly in the Intermodal space is that the truck market is pretty darn loose right now, and certainly, it\u2019s not as fruitful of an environment to be pricing in as, let\u2019s say, a year or year and a half ago. But that doesn\u2019t change any of what Kenny just said. It just makes the job harder.\nTom Wadewitz: So you assume that in your pricing guide that you have those pressures on Intermodal price I guess?\nLance Fritz: Yeah.\nKenny Rocker: Yeah.\nLance Fritz: All-in\u2026\nKenny Rocker: Yeah.\nLance Fritz: \u2026 we understand it and it\u2019s assumed in there.\nTom Wadewitz: Yeah. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to talk on that growth and sort of that service product commentary, a lot of investment obviously being put into the productivity headcount and so forth to drive that this year. But as we look past that, are you thinking through that service product differently in terms of investment, whether it\u2019s trying to improve the ease of doing business with you or transparency with customers, just any thoughts there on how that might be evolving over time?\nLance Fritz: Yeah. Allison, thank you for the question. This is Lance again. We are thinking more broadly about what is necessary to support growth in our service product and it takes a lot of different forms. I will start in the Intermodal space. We have made investments in things called UPGo and Precision Gate Technology. PGT allows trucks to essentially enter and exit the ramp without stopping. Paperless and uses technology and pre clears, if you will, the load with machine vision before the truck even gets there. UPGo is a holistic tool that our IMCs can use and it can be embedded on their own platforms so that once a drivers on our property, they know exactly where to go, they know exactly where all the facilities are, they know a map of the facility and we have done a hell of a job signing and improving the signage on our properties. So that\u2019s just one example where if truck drivers, if dray drivers have a better, faster experience on our property, we might be able to help them get an extra turn now and then that helps move boxes off our ramp and that\u2019s a better service product than the end. But why don\u2019t I turn it over to, Kenny, you first and then Eric for more detail.\nKenny Rocker: Yeah. Lance, you talked about our Premium network. And again, Allison, those products show up in terms of Inland Empire in our product in Twin Cities that we feel very encouraged and confident about and filling those areas out. And it also shows up in other areas like our investments in GPS, our investment in chassis. On the carload side, we are really excited about what\u2019s taking place with RailPulse. So you are seeing it across the Board both on our carload side and in our Intermodal network.\nEric Gehringer: And Allison, as we think about consistent and reliable service, a couple of examples from the operating side that we are all involved and as -- and when I talk about modernizations, an improvement in reliability of 50% in those locomotives wants modernized, it\u2019s significant, it\u2019s meaningful, it\u2019s less variability that will drive improved service. And even as we think about even on our crews and we are talking about how do we approach that differently. When we talk about consistent schedules for our crews, we are talking about the trade or the benefit for us collectively which has improved availability. Improved availability again reduces variability and drive a more consistent and reliable service product.\nAllison Poliniak: Great. Thank you.\nLance Fritz: Yeah. Thank you, Allison.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Group: Hey. Thanks. Good morning.\nLance Fritz: Hi.\nScott Group: So if inflation is running around 4% and price mix is running flat, slightly negative right now. I guess, how do we get confidence in margin improvement for the year? I guess maybe, Jen, do you think is it the price mix reaccelerates from here, is it cost getting better? Just help us sort of get confidence in that margin improvement? And then just separately, any color on this -- on other revenue and how you are thinking about that for the year?\nJennifer Hamann: Yeah. So I will start with the confidence around the margin improvement and we are confident in our ability to do that. Certainly, there are headwinds and you have just pointed to a couple of them. But then go back to the things I talked about in terms of how we are looking at the year and the key levers, which as you know, are volume, price and productivity. So volume certainly is a wildcard and we will see how that plays out. Pricing, we are confident that although it is going to lag a bit, we are confident that our price will -- price dollars will exceed inflation dollars. And then the productivity side, we know we have upside there. Yes, we are still adding resources and taking some steps to heal the network today. But we also know that there\u2019s a pipeline of opportunities to improve and we have those identified and we know what actions we need to put up against that to do that. And then as you do that and as the network hills, that gives us more opportunities on the volume side. We still know we are mixing Bulk loads today. So those are opportunities for us to get more leverage across that cost base. And then, obviously, there\u2019s fuel, which I mentioned before and we will see how that plays out. But right now, we are certainly playing a little bit less, call it, $0.40 or so less than what we were paying a year ago or what we paid for the full year 2022. So those are all the things that we are looking at, Scott, and we believe that those combination of factors are setting up in a way that we will be able to drive OR improvement. To your question on other revenue, so I think that\u2019s really a question maybe more geared towards accessorials and what we see playing out there. As the supply chain has healed, as we are seeing a little bit of softness in that Intermodal market, we have seen accessorials come down a bit. They were down a little bit for us here in the fourth quarter and that would probably be my expectation going into 2023 as well.\nLance Fritz: And that\u2019s a good thing, right?\nJennifer Hamann: Yeah. Absolutely.\nLance Fritz: I mean, we want that fluidity. We want the entire network to match the kind of fluidity that we are putting up post Christmas holiday. They are still in the Intermodal supply chain. There\u2019s still some elevated street time for boxes and chassis. And that\u2019s the last piece that reflects excess inventory that\u2019s going to have to get worked out.\nKenny Rocker: Yeah.\nScott Group: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Fadi Chamoun with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nFadi Chamoun: Thank you. Good morning. Question on the operating side a little bit, maybe, Jennifer, if you can help us understand what were these unique costs is in network congestion in 2022, so we can kind of play those numbers going forward. But the main question I got is, if I look at your operational productivity data in the fourth quarter and compare that to a couple of years ago when you were running well, locomotive productivity, car velocity are still 13%, 14% lower than they were and headcount is 5% higher, but volumes are flat. Do you have now the resources you think to get back to those levels that you have had a couple of years ago, like what are the really remaining things we need to do to get the network to spend a lot higher than it has been in the last few quarters?\nJennifer Hamann: Yeah. I wasn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know that I totally caught the first part of your question there, Fadi, but I think you were basically asking to quantify what the congestion costs were for our network for 2022. We have not quantified that other than we -- when you look at our operating ratio and the degradation that we had on a year-over-year basis, 290 basis points, 50 basis points of that was a combination of PEB and fuel. The rest of that was inflation and congestion and probably fairly equally weighted between the two. So that\u2019s how I would think about that. That is our opportunity certainly and that feeds through all of the lines. It feeds through wage inflation. Now some of that, obviously, is real. We have the PEB. We know that\u2019s real. But then it\u2019s how we use the crews, and you have heard us talk about the fact that in 2022, we had higher recrew rates, we have higher borrow out costs, more deadhead and held away, more vans. Those all inflate those cost categories. Purchased services, as we were putting more locomotives into service, that inflated those costs on a year-over-year basis in addition to some of just the contractor inflation that we saw as all of our suppliers were faced with higher inflation, and you saw that come through. And then on the other line, we know we have opportunities there from a casualty standpoint. You heard us talk about casualty a couple of different times in 2022 and the higher cost that that brought to us. So those are all elements that we are now very much focused on attacking. You asked are we right-sized yet. You have heard us say, we still are short crews in critical locations. We are still hiring.\nFadi Chamoun: Yeah.\nJennifer Hamann: So we still need to bring folks onto our network. That does two things that helps the -- well, three things only helps improve our reliability, our fluidity, it helps us move more volumes and as we are able to hire folks in those critical locations, we then move the people that we have working there in terms of borrow outs back to their home location and that reduces our cost base as well, and you can improve your recrew rate. So a lot of different moving parts there, Fadi. You know our business isn\u2019t just one element, but that\u2019s how we are looking at it. Those are the things that impacted us in 2022 and that\u2019s what we are looking to do in 2023.\nLance Fritz: Yeah. I think the other part of Fadi\u2019s question is a structural question, like, did something structurally change. And on the five critical resources, nothing structurally changed on line of road and terminal, how you achieve freight car utilization, how you achieve locomotive utilization. We probably look at crews differently going forward than we did historically. That means a little bit more on Board so that we are not staffed at the tight end. We are staffed a bit looser, that\u2019s hundreds, it\u2019s not thousands and then also making sure that we have a watch back in place to the extent that we have got counterparties that want to negotiate that. So that\u2019s probably the only thing, and I think that\u2019s probably an at risk as opposed to a major headline.\nJennifer Hamann: And helps to reduce more volume ultimately.\nLance Fritz: In that. That\u2019s right. It supports us for growth.\nFadi Chamoun: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long, Stephens. Please proceed with your question.\nJustin Long: Thanks and good morning. I guess to follow up on that last question. If I just run the quick math, it seems like there was around 120 basis points of headwind to the OR last year from congestion. So as you think about kind of recapturing what I will call lost productivity, do you need to see volume growth in order to get that back or can you see improvement in the absence of volume growth? And I guess, on the cadence of the OR, Jennifer, is it reasonable to say that first half OR probably doesn\u2019t improve year-over-year, so this is more back half weighted?\nLance Fritz: Yeah. Jennifer, why don\u2019t I start with, can you get -- can you recover productivity without volume growth? The answer is, yes. And we anticipate volume growth as well, which is a tailwind.\nJennifer Hamann: Yeah. So the only thing I\u2019d say in terms of cadence there is, really pointing out to the fuel piece of it and where you saw fuel was a bigger headwind to us in the earlier part of the year than the latter part of the year. You saw some of the inflation pick up in the latter part of the year. So there\u2019s some trade-offs there either way that I would just ask you to look at your models pretty closely there, because there are differences first half, second half in 2022 that you need to be thinking through there.\nJustin Long: Okay. Thank you.\nLance Fritz: Yeah. Thank you, Justin.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nWalter Spracklin: Yeah. Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. I just want to come back to the yield question, sorry, to focus on that. But there were, and Jennifer, you mentioned a number of the key drivers being core price and fuel surcharge and mix and so on. I just wanted to make sure that we are understanding the charges that you were levying of the congestion side, those search, I will call it, congestion surcharges for lack of a better word, that you registered through 2022. Are they -- with them going away, does not -- is that not another factor that will weigh against your revenue per carload or is that just not meaningful enough to enter into the equation?\nLance Fritz: Jennifer, you want to take that?\nJennifer Hamann: I think you were referencing congestion surcharges?\nLance Fritz: I think he\u2019s talking about accessorial\u2026\nJennifer Hamann: Oh! Accessorial.\nLance Fritz: \u2026cost.\nJennifer Hamann: Okay. Again, we do expect that they could be less year-over-year, but I don\u2019t see that as a significant driver for us.\nWalter Spracklin: Okay. Fair enough. And just on the coal side, there\u2019s a lot of talk about deteriorating coal statistics, just understanding your catchment area, I know you got a plus on that outlook. How does that compare with what we are hearing from the EIA and what you are seeing in your catchment area?\nKenny Rocker: Kenny?\nKenny Rocker: Yeah. We feel good about being able to move coal in these natural gas prices and even the forward curve for the rest of the year. I will tell you, there\u2019s still quite a bit of low inventories out there. So I can assure you, those customers are willing and able to receive that coal demand that\u2019s out there.\nWalter Spracklin: Okay. Thanks for the time.\nLance Fritz: Yeah. Thank you, Walter.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.\nBascome Majors: Lance, thanks for taking my question. As the Chairman of UP, can you talk a little bit to the longer term transition plans? What skill sets do you think the Board really focused on for the next leader of the business? Any time line around that as we have seen some of the leadership at the other Class 1s start to change? Thank you.\nLance Fritz: Sure, Bascome. So we have not announced any leadership transition or timing. We do periodically as a Board review what our needs are, both the skills matrix of the Board and also the skills and development of our leadership team on the management team. And so, yeah, Board has a strong eye on that, knows on a running basis, what we are looking for, what we are thinking about and while we don\u2019t have anything announced, I will make sure and we as a company will make sure that it is transparent when it does occur.\nBascome Majors: Thank you.\nLance Fritz: Yeah.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJordan Alliger: Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Just sort of curious, what are customers, I mean, obviously, Intermodal is a big part of the longer term story and important near term, too. But what do customers tell you in terms of, hey, rails have had a tough time service wise the last year or so. When are they going to be open to really trying you guys again and maybe shifting some of that business back from truck and could that happen in an environment where truck rates are so beat up right now as well? Thanks.\nLance Fritz: Yeah. Kenny, you want to take that, because we are still winning business off of truck.\nKenny Rocker: Yeah. I mean we are definitely still winning business from truck, and what I would tell you is that, we haven\u2019t seen any large pieces and I said that they are earlier move away from them. A lot of that is driven by the economy. Clearly, some of the service challenges we have, we may have seen some lanes move at versus via truck or maybe another mode. But our customers realize that this is a short-term phenomenon and that we are investing, we have been very transparent in our investment again in hiring and our investment in our CapEx, so that they can stay with us.\nLance Fritz: Well, Kenny, sustainability has also been playing a bigger and bigger role in that, some of our sophisticated customers, we are helping them understand and they are asking us for greater detail on how we can be part of their sustainability initiatives and that\u2019s driving more look at us as opposed to less look at us. We just joined the Dallas Sustainability Index and that\u2019s just a one marker of many that say that we are quite serious in making good progress in those areas.\nKenny Rocker: I mean, Lance, you talked about it a little bit earlier, if you look at our car velocity from the summer to now, we have seen some improvement, and Eric and I were talking about this a couple of days ago. If you look at third quarter to fourth quarter sequentially on our Premium network, that is improving as we onboard at Schneider. So that gives us a lot of confidence.\nLance Fritz: Right.\nJordan Alliger: And just sort of -- just continuing on that, I mean, the other side of shares, the West Coast probably lost to the East Coast this year for a myriad of reasons. Do you think some of that shifts back over the course of 2023?\nKenny Rocker: I -- some of that was really, I think, labor challenges that you saw in the port and a little bit of ambiguity on what they thought might happen. I think as we see that clear up on the port that you will see a little bit more of that volume come back to the West Coast port. Again, everything that we are doing, all of our investments around Inland Empire, the G4 relo would act, the Dallas to Dock and Dallas. I am telling you we are bullish to make sure we can make those areas more competitive for the customers.\nJordan Alliger: Thank you.\nLance Fritz: Yeah. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nCherilyn Radbourne: Thanks very much and good morning. My question sort of picked up on that last one. I did want to ask about the next outlook for International Intermodal. Clearly, the inventory cycle is the most important factor there. So I am curious whether implicit in your guidance is the potential for a second half recovery in Intermodal. And then along with that, I was also curious on your thoughts regarding the timing of a labor settlement on the West Coast and what you thought for that would mean for market share in LA, Long Beach, which I think you just addressed?\nLance Fritz: Let me start, Kenny, and I will talk to the labor negotiation that\u2019s going on in the West Coast. So that started up, I want to say, in July of last year. There has been a negotiation. There hasn\u2019t been a lot of progress announced publicly. But the port directors share with us that they have confidence they are going to reach an agreement that there\u2019s the temperature is low and there\u2019s a line of sight to reach agreement. So from that perspective I think we are going to be okay.\nKenny Rocker: Yeah. As we are spending time with customers, as a mixed bag when they think some of these inventory issues will get resolved. So some are saying back half of third quarter. For us, we are not going to try to time that or be so precise at the time. What we are really focused on is making sure that we have got the service product where it should and I just want to double down on what I said sequentially, we are seeing that improvement. We have onboarded a large customer and we are walking towards trying to capture that growth when it shows up or when a pop.\nCherilyn Radbourne: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Two-part question here, I think quality of life is a big focus area for you and a lot of your peers. What does that mean exactly in terms of kind of what you are negotiating and what your prospective employees are looking for? How do we think about that in terms of our costs, et cetera? And just also, I don\u2019t think you have said the word 55 OR on this call so far, obviously, that seems like a fair way away given where we are macro wise. What is the path to get there, kind of given the quality of life, given the kind of EV inflation, everything else kind of, is that just going to need like a really big lift from the topline to bring that gap in the coming years?\nLance Fritz: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Ravi. So I will start with just a quick comment on quality of life, and then maybe, Eric, you can follow up on what we are negotiating there, and then, Jennifer, you can handle a 55 OR. So one thing that came out of the PEB and is in the tentative agreements that were signed and now agreed to was directive to negotiate things like unscheduled work going to scheduled work. There are other things bundled into the quality of life issues for our craft employees, but that\u2019s a big one. There\u2019s a fair amount of our craft employees that are on call in an unscheduled job and that\u2019s the way that the staffing for the railroad is handled. And so we are actively in those discussions, because there is a path forward to be able to create more predictability in that work for those craft professions. I will let Eric kind of get into the detail.\nEric Gehringer: Yeah. So, Ravi, as one example, we are engaged right now in a pilot where we are focused on some adjustments to the way that we collectively do the work where we actually have a group of people in the state of Kansas that are working a defined schedule. So to Lance\u2019s point, today, the vast majority of our employee base is on an on-call basis. So that\u2019s on the TE and Y side of the transportation side. In this pilot, we have carved out a handful of people where they actually are in a specific schedule and what we are watching for is to ensure that the actual days that we have planned for them to have off occur and that that\u2019s translating then to more availability on the days in which they are scheduled to work. That\u2019s the win-win solution that we are looking for and we are focused on. And we are working on it for the entire period of this year and I bet it carry into the next year because we are putting so much thought into making sure that the net impact is beneficial for both sides.\nJennifer Hamann: Yeah. And then, Ravi, to your 55 OR questions, I mean, you have heard us talk that, that is still our goal and I will reiterate that again. We have not put a new time line on that because of all the things that you have heard us talk about here today in terms of the challenges that we are facing. But that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t improve, that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t have a path to improve and a path to get there. And relative to the quality of life, it really goes back to what you have heard from both Lance and Eric, as we improve crew availability, as we improve predictability, that improves our service product and it improves our ability to grow and with that service product comes further pricing opportunities as well. So it\u2019s a virtuous circle in my view and that\u2019s how we are going about pursuing those things.\nRavi Shanker: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Wetherbee: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Maybe I wanted to come back to headcount and resources as we are thinking about sort of improving the network and efficiency and ultimately getting back up to sort of optimal performance. Can you give us a sense of sort of how long you think it will take until you get heads to sort of where you think to be able to support the [technical difficulty] that you have and maybe is that a first half, second half kind of dynamic as you think about the relative growth in both periods?\nLance Fritz: Yeah. Chris, you broke up a little bit at the end. But what I heard you asking is about, we are adding headcount and resources to support network fluidity particularly in some part of the network where we are tight on crews and how long is that going to take, is it a first half, second half? So we are not putting a fine button on when exactly we declare victory. What I will say is, you look at how we are performing coming into 2023 and the network is fluid. We have still got tight spots in the network that are limiting our ability to grow and ship all the demand like in coal, maybe to a lesser extent in rock and we are hiring actively in those areas that would support the network for that growth. The pipeline is full, we have got 600 people in the pipeline and we are graduating something like 150 a month to 200 a month at this point. So it\u2019s kind of fundamentally being pretty well healed is happening this year. It\u2019s just hard to say exactly when given that demand could shift around. We are still not meeting all demand and the game plan is operate a fluid network like we are right now, continue to add resources to support the demand that wants to ship and grow that volume as we are able to.\nChris Wetherbee: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter, Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Hoexter: Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Just, Jen, maybe can you put a range on the OR improvement, I know you said just you are looking for improvement, given the background issues that you talked about. Can you clarify how much of that is impacted by service and I guess you typically see 200 basis points of deterioration from\u2026\nLance Fritz: Yeah.\nKen Hoexter: \u2026 fourth quarter to first quarter. Is there anything unseasonable or different this year, you pointed out a couple of things that should look different? And then a second one just for, Lance, something totally different, any thoughts on the STB Open Access mandate? Anything that you expect out of that or remediation expectations from CPK issue? Thanks.\nJennifer Hamann: So, Ken, I am going to refrain from giving the order of magnitude on the OR guide or giving you a range. It really is just too soon in the year. We are sitting here on January 24th to give that to you. I could try, but I am sure I\u2019d be wrong. So we are going to resist that temptation. I think the important thing to think about is we are going to work to improve as fast as we can, as hard as we can, you have seen us do that and demonstrate that, we are not trying to meter any progress. Our goal is to deliver that better service, be more fluid, and with that, leverage more volumes across the topline. There are some other things that influence it, obviously, when you think about fuel and inflation. But the team knows what those are and they know how to go about it. I am also not going to give you any guidance relative to sequential and whether we are going to have normal sequential patterns. We had a really hard hit here the end of 2022 with the weather, the way it impacted our volumes here at the close of the quarter. We have had some weather here again here in the start of the year. So hang with us, watch the volumes, watch the service metrics. Those are your best barometer to know how we are operating and how we are generating positive growth and positive financials across the network.\nLance Fritz: Yes. Admitted. It really does all start with our service product. In terms of the STB and Open Access, Ken, so that\u2019s a pending decision on their part. Clearly, we have fed back for quite some time now to the STB that we think Open Access is a bad idea from the following perspective. It puts interchange where investment has not occurred. It would negatively impact the service product for those demanding open access and anyone else riding the trains and the service product that those particular customers are using. We have looked at this a lot of ways. We don\u2019t say hell no when allowing access in a certain circumstance makes sense. We have done it. We have negotiated it. We have done it in short periods to help customer out. But in the broader context of allowing customers to determine where their interchange point should be, we think, as currently conceived, it\u2019s -- it would be bad for overall service product, not better.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hey. Good morning. So a couple of different follow-ups, if you don\u2019t mind. One, just on mix for Jennifer, it sounds like the trends impacting the fourth quarter probably will continue for 2023. I just didn\u2019t hear if you confirm that or not? And then for Eric, you are talking about getting to a better spot with headcount, do you expect any attrition from when all the back pay clears as maybe some of the more senior folks take that retire or look for something else as that comes up in the next couple of weeks? And lastly, Lance, another hot button topic for STB embargoes, a little hard for us to tell exactly the implications of the two-day hearing from last month, but would be great to hear your thoughts on what changes if anything after that? Thanks very much.\nJennifer Hamann: All right. I will start with your mix question, Brian. So for 2023, we are expecting to have a negative mix for the year and really it\u2019s pretty simple when you think about it with increased Intermodal shipments with the onboarding of Schneider. And then you heard Kenny talk about tough grain markets and then also some of the question marks and toughness that we are expecting on the Industrial product side. Those things add up to negative mix for us in 2023.\nEric Gehringer: On the attrition side, we have not seen any attrition post the payment of the PEB. We continue to watch that very closely and where necessary we will incentivize.\nLance Fritz: Yes. And that -- the last big back pay happened January 13th, right?\nEric Gehringer: That\u2019s correct.\nLance Fritz: So it\u2019s in hand, and to your point, Brian, if something occurs, we should be seeing that basically right now, it should start. In terms of the STB on embargos. So, yeah, we were called in for a two-day hearing. The reason is that Union Pacific historically in 2022 had used embargoes more so than all of our peers. We use it for a very specific reason and we use it as a last resort. The reason why we use embargoes is either if something has occurred in the network like, call it, winter storm Elliott that really negatively impacted the Great Lakes region. So that we don\u2019t get overwhelmed as we are trying to recover from the winter weather, we will use an embargo in that circumstance to control product flow. That\u2019s not to stop growth. It\u2019s basically controlled product flow, so the network can get its feedback under it. It\u2019s worked wonderfully in that area, because you can see in our car velocity and the overall network fluidity, we are operating quite well. We will also use embargoes to control excess inventory in very targeted circumstances as a last resort. We engage the customers, help them understand what we see and what they could do to help control that excess inventory, and then as a last resort, we would use an embargo. The vast majority of them are about protecting the serving yards for our customers. That\u2019s where cars end up and before the last mile delivery to customers they get inventoried at the serving yard. And if a particular customer has way more inventory in that serving yard than what they can handle or what supports their business, it can crowd out the service product for others. So that\u2019s the reason we were called in is we use those more so than anyone else. We -- I am not sure exactly what\u2019s going to come out of that hearing. What we heard from our customers and through the STB and in continuing conversation with our customers is they want to know why and how to remedy with a lot more granularity. So we have modified what we communicate to our customers so that they understand that. And our commitment was we are going to pause on the level of embargoes that we have been using so that we can absorb the feedback and make some additional changes in how we approach excess inventory and serving yard excess inventory and engage with customers more effectively on it. Kenny?\nKenny Rocker: All right, Brian, you win the title for getting us all the talk. I will make this quick. Two things, one, yeah, we have had some pretty difficult conversations with customers. But 1 of the positives that has come out of that is creating tech solutions for them to give them the visibility that Lance was talking about, whether it\u2019s inventory on our line, the release rates number of cars that are in the serving yard. We have shared that those tech solutions with them here a couple of weeks ago and we are working with the customer so that they can integrate that into their supply chain.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Thank you very much.\nLance Fritz: Yeah. Thank you, Brian.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Jeff Kaufman with Vertical Research. Please proceed with your question.\nJeff Kaufman: Thank you very much. I will just make this quick, because a lot of mine have been answered. Kenny, what do the changes in China with their COVID policy and reopening the economy potentially mean for Union Pacific?\nKenny Rocker: We will have to see what plays out there. Historically, what we have seen is a little bit of fits and starts. I think what we will also be looking at is the inventory levels at least in the near-term, it may not have that much of an impact as they start up a little bit later, it may be right in time. So a lot of uncertainty there, definitely some fits and starts. What we really need is the consumer spending and a little bit more demand to be out there more so than the issue in Asia.\nJeff Kaufman: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Vernon: Hey. Good morning, guys. I wanted to come back to resourcing questions really quickly here. Also I will keep it on one theme as opposed to make only guys kind of go around the table. What is the exact number of heads we are looking to add in 2023 and if we are thinking about adding more crew resources and automotive resources to get a service level that\u2019s more resilient, how does that change the dynamic of adding future resources to see the growth? I know it won\u2019t be one for one, but are we looking at a little bit less put the leverage here going forward based on the changes you are making to the resourcing model right now?\nJennifer Hamann: Yeah. You were breaking up there quite a bit, David. But I think what your basic question was, was how many do we expect to hire in 2023 and do we think about hiring at a different cadence maybe versus volumes going forward? In terms of hiring for the year, I think, we have said it would be similar probably to 2022 levels. But that obviously carries with it some attrition assumptions what we see happen with volumes and so if we would see a change positive or negative relative to volumes that obviously could impact that, we are just going to make sure that we have the right crews in place to be able to take advantage of the demand that\u2019s there for us. We know we are still not meeting at all today. In terms of how we think about hiring, I mean, I think, you have heard Lance and Eric talk about the fact that we would maybe keep our Boards a little bit larger established A once if we can and those will be things that can give us I will say cushion, as you see fluctuations in demand. Again, we expect to be able to leverage that service reliability into more volumes and better pricing and overall better productivity. And so when you think about the bottomline impact of that, we think it should worst case be neutral, but really be a positive for us in the long-term.\nDavid Vernon: Yeah. I understand the foundation will be positive in the long-term, but, I mean, we are adding more resources to do essentially the same amount of volume right now, correct?\nJennifer Hamann: Yeah. I mean you are seeing that flow through today, I would say. When you have got 600, 700 people in training today.\nLance Fritz: Yeah.\nJennifer Hamann: Not out actively moving freight, that is the headwind that we have in those numbers today that I would say is already there.\nLance Fritz: Well and it\u2019s substantial because they are completely unproductive from a moving freight perspective.\nJennifer Hamann: Right.\nLance Fritz: But we anticipate we need them to both backfill attrition and support growth.\nDavid Vernon: Right. Thanks for added color guys.\nLance Fritz: Yeah.\nJennifer Hamann: Thanks.\nLance Fritz: Thank you, David.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Seidl: Thank you, Operator. The anchorman position, I won\u2019t make any [Ron Bergan] you referenced this year. I wanted to get back to domestic Intermodal, guys. I am assuming the positive growth outlook is basically the Schneider business and some of the freight that you guys lost last year that\u2019s more of a natural rail fit flowing back to the network. But I want to look a little bit longer term, sort of as you look to the competitive marketplace with the trucks, where do you think the visibility needs to be and will RailPulse help you improve that? And then where do you think trip plan compliance needs to be and what else do you need to do to get that up there?\nKenny Rocker: Yeah. I will tell you. Thanks for that question, Jason. We have been encouraged as the management team with all the investment that we put into the railroad to support growth and we have talked about those products here a little bit today. We do think that Inland Empire is transformative for us. We do think that the Twin Cities Intermodal facility is transformative for us. We do think that the focus on technology, some of which Lance mentioned a little bit earlier that will help drive our experience. What ultimately helps our customers reduce their costs with their drivers will have an impact. And then, Jason, everything you just said, RailPulse is for our carload business and we put a lot of focus on making sure we can do ease of business and know exactly what our customers are asking for.\nEric Gehringer: And on the performance side, from the service product, Jason, we have been very consistent over the last handful of years that our Intermodal trip plan compliance, starting with an eight, like, 80%, 85% is where we want to be. But or and we are also very close to our customers over the last two years to continue to make sure that what we are measuring is most reflective of their experience and what\u2019s most important to them. So stay tuned because we continue to evolve how we think about customer service in line with the customer\u2019s voice.\nJason Seidl: And is there -- if you guys get to that 85% or above, is that when it starts inflecting in a normalized demand market in terms of getting more freight on the network?\nEric Gehringer: The way to think about that is really when you get to 85%, what we are recognizing as we are an outdoor factory. We are 32,000 miles. We do deal with winter, et cetera, et cetera. There\u2019s nobody here that gets to 85%, because we have done our job, but it\u2019s a place to strive to get to and then reevaluate even within the challenges of being an outdoor factory with 32,000 miles, hey, what\u2019s the next opportunity still?\nJason Seidl: Fair enough. Appreciate the commentary as always.\nLance Fritz: Yeah. Thank you, Jason.\nOperator: At this time, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session and I will turn the floor over to Mr. Lance Fritz for closing comments.\nLance Fritz: Rob, thank you very much for your help this morning and thank you all for your questions, we are looking forward to talking with you again in April about our first quarter results, until then please take care.\nOperator: Thank you. This will conclude today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. We do thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Eric Gehringer",
            "content": "Thanks, Kenny, and good morning. Starting on Slide 10, safety is at the foundation of everything we do. We have enhanced our training programs and are working to solidify our safety culture through ownership and personal accountability. These efforts drove an 18% improvement in our 2022 full year personal injury safety results, which is at the lowest level in five years. We look to leverage these gains to improve derailment performance in 2023. While good progress, overall, our goal remains returning each employee home safely at the end of the day. Moving now to Slide 11 for a look at our current operational performance, our attention throughout 2022 was focused on onboarding the necessary crew resources to operate a fluid network and meet customer demand. I would like to thank our partners and workforce resources and the operating team for their great work in recruiting and onboarding new team members. We currently have around 600 employees in training as our pipeline is significantly stronger than it was a year ago. That being said, our hiring efforts will continue in 2023, as we backfill for attrition and target locations across the northern region, where crude challenges persist. In the near-term, we will continue to utilize borrow outs to supplement crew shortfalls. Another key element in increasing fluidity is the reduction of excess inventory, which builds the foundation for a strong and resilient service product. I am proud of the progress we made, which would have not been accomplished without the dedication and tireless work of the commercial and operating teams. Mother Nature threatened to derail some of that progress in the last weeks of December with blizzard conditions and extreme cool temperatures across much of the network. However, our team responded and we quickly rebounded demonstrating greater resiliency that we can build on in 2023. With current freight car velocity around 210 miles per day and trip plan compliance measures demonstrating sequential improvement, we look to maintain that progress as volumes strengthen into 2023. Now let's review our key performance metrics for the quarter, starting on Slide 12, which continue to trail 2021's results. Both freight car velocity and manifest and auto trip plan compliance were flat sequentially from last quarter's results. Importantly, however, Intermodal trip plan compliance did improve 11 points sequentially, as supply chain congestion alleviated, resulting in less stack containers at the inland ramps. Near the end of the quarter, we successfully onboarded the Schneider Intermodal business and remain actively engaged to manage that transition. Turning to Slide 13 to review our network efficiency metrics, which also like 2021's fourth quarter measures, locomotive productivity, workforce productivity and train length all declined sequentially driven by lower volumes in the back half of the quarter and winter weather challenges. Entering 2023, the team remains focused on strengthening the network while recovering lost productivity. Moving to Slide 14, we continue to exercise discipline in our capital spending, while delivering value to our shareholders. We are targeting 2023 capital spending of $3.6 billion, pending final approval by our Board of Directors. While the projected increase from last year, we expect capital spending to remain in line with our long-term guidance of less than 15% of revenue. As always, our first capital dollars will support our existing infrastructure. This spending will harden our infrastructure, renew older assets and support safe operations. For 2023, in addition to a higher inflationary environment, the elevated capital spending will be driven by increased locomotive spending of $175 million. With 430 modernized locomotives currently in the fleet, we will bring the total modernized to over 1,000 by the end of 2025. These modernizations not only help build resiliency into the network through enhanced reliability and productivity, but also further the progress towards our carbon emission reduction goals. We continue to invest capital for growth. On the Intermodal front, we are investing in additional capacity at the Inland Empire terminal and we will be expanding our footprint in Kansas City. And on the capacity side, we will continue to invest in projects like sidings that drive productivity, allow us to handle more car loadings and improve our network efficiency. Wrapping up on Slide 15, we are dedicated to improving our service product in 2023. Slide 15 provides a roadmap of the key activities to achieve that goal. We demonstrated meaningful improvement in our safety results in 2022 through an enhancement to our safety management systems and continue towards the goal of world class safety. Additionally, we recognize the importance of quality of life concerns that our agreement professionals voiced. We continue to work closely with union leadership to find win-win solutions that enable a strong service product and provide our employees with more consistent work schedules. As we sustain improved operational performance, use our resources more efficiently and reduce variability, we will generate productivity. At the same time, technology enhancements will drive further productivity and support a consistent and reliable service product for our customers. With that, I will turn it over to Jennifer to review our financial performance. Yeah. Jon, thank you for that question. As we think about that, certainly, as we look at the environment right now and what lays in front of us, it may be over a longer period of time that those actually come to fruition. But everyone here remains focused on those commitments and you see that in the activities that we have taken on in some of my prepared comments, I talked about some of the technology initiatives that are more focused not only in 2023, but even beyond that. What's sitting in front of us right now is the biggest opportunity is to improve that service product that from it drives out that excess cost when we think about our locomotive and our workforce productivity. That's job number one right now, but we are all still focused on the long-term targets that we gave you on the Investor Day. Thanks, Jon. And Allison, as we think about consistent and reliable service, a couple of examples from the operating side that we are all involved and as -- and when I talk about modernizations, an improvement in reliability of 50% in those locomotives wants modernized, it's significant, it's meaningful, it's less variability that will drive improved service. And even as we think about even on our crews and we are talking about how do we approach that differently. When we talk about consistent schedules for our crews, we are talking about the trade or the benefit for us collectively which has improved availability. Improved availability again reduces variability and drive a more consistent and reliable service product. Yeah. So, Ravi, as one example, we are engaged right now in a pilot where we are focused on some adjustments to the way that we collectively do the work where we actually have a group of people in the state of Kansas that are working a defined schedule. So to Lance's point, today, the vast majority of our employee base is on an on-call basis. So that's on the TE and Y side of the transportation side. In this pilot, we have carved out a handful of people where they actually are in a specific schedule and what we are watching for is to ensure that the actual days that we have planned for them to have off occur and that that's translating then to more availability on the days in which they are scheduled to work. That's the win-win solution that we are looking for and we are focused on. And we are working on it for the entire period of this year and I bet it carry into the next year because we are putting so much thought into making sure that the net impact is beneficial for both sides. On the attrition side, we have not seen any attrition post the payment of the PEB. We continue to watch that very closely and where necessary we will incentivize. That's correct. And on the performance side, from the service product, Jason, we have been very consistent over the last handful of years that our Intermodal trip plan compliance, starting with an eight, like, 80%, 85% is where we want to be. But or and we are also very close to our customers over the last two years to continue to make sure that what we are measuring is most reflective of their experience and what's most important to them. So stay tuned because we continue to evolve how we think about customer service in line with the customer's voice. The way to think about that is really when you get to 85%, what we are recognizing as we are an outdoor factory. We are 32,000 miles. We do deal with winter, et cetera, et cetera. There's nobody here that gets to 85%, because we have done our job, but it's a place to strive to get to and then reevaluate even within the challenges of being an outdoor factory with 32,000 miles, hey, what's the next opportunity still?"

            "name": "Jennifer Hamann",
            "content": "Thanks, Eric, and good morning. Let's start with fourth quarter income statement on Slide 17. Operating revenue in the quarter totaled $6.2 billion, up 8% versus 2021 on a 1% increase in volume. These gains were more than offset by a 14% increase in operating expense, which totaled $3.8 billion. Excluding the impact of higher fuel prices expenses were up 7% in the quarter. Operating income of $2.4 billion declined 1% versus 2021. Other income remained strong, up 11% to $92 million, driven by higher real estate income and pension benefit, which offset 2021's $36 million gain on the sale of a technology investment. Interest expense increased 13% as average debt levels increased more than $3 billion year-over-year. Net income of $1.6 billion declined 4%. But when combined with share repurchases, resulted in essentially flat earnings per share at $2.67. Fourth quarter operating ratio of 61% increased 360 basis points, driven by higher inflation and operating costs. Falling fuel prices during the quarter had a favorable 20-basis-point impact. Looking more closely at fourth quarter revenue, Slide 18 provides a breakdown of our freight revenue, which totaled $5.8 billion in the fourth quarter, up 9% compared to 2021. Volume contributed 75 basis points. As fuel prices stayed high year-over-year, fourth quarter fuel surcharge revenue also remained elevated, totaling $975 million and increased freight revenue 850 basis points. Strong core pricing gains that exceeded inflation dollars were more than offset by a negative business mix, resulting in a 25-basis-point decline in freight revenue. Fewer forest product shipments combined with higher International Intermodal and rock shipments drove the negative mix. Turning to Slide 19 for a summary of our fourth quarter operating expenses, the largest driver of the overall expense increase was again fuel, up 43% as fuel prices rose 46%. Combating these higher prices, we continue to drive productivity, improving our fuel consumption rate 2 points to produce a fourth quarter record. Our compensation and benefits expense was up 10% versus 2021. Total fourth quarter workforce levels increased 4%, reflecting our hiring efforts throughout 2022. Cost per employee grew 6%, primarily driven by wage inflation. In addition, cost pressures from network inefficiencies in the form of higher overtime and borrow out costs continued in the quarter. Purchased services and materials expense remained elevated, up 18%, driven by cost to maintain a larger active locomotive fleet, volume related purchase transportation expense at our loop subsidiary and inflation. Equipment and other rents increased 3%, driven by the impact of slower cycle times on car hire expenses. Other expense was flat in the quarter, as higher travel and casualty expenses were offset by a partial insurance recovery related to 2021 bridge fire, as well as lower state and local taxes. Looking to 2023, we have opportunities across the Board to improve efficiency and that's job one as we recover our service product. Although we still expect to be more than volume variable with our workforce, we will continue to aggressively hire crews in critical locations and to backfill attrition. For 2023, we expect our all-in inflation to be around 4%, while cost per employee is expected to increase in the mid single digits as elevated wage inflation is partially offset by productivity. Depreciation expense should be up around 3% versus 2022 and below the line, similar to last year, we expect other income to remain elevated versus historic levels driven by higher real estate and interest income. Finally, we expect our 2023 annual effective tax rate to be around 24%. Moving to Slide 20 with a quick recap of full year 2022 results, which are shown on the slide as reported and include the impact of the third quarter PEB adjustment. Revenue was up 14%, an annual record, driven by increased fuel surcharges, strong pricing gains and 2% volume growth. Record operating income increased 6% to $9.9 billion, which includes a net increase of just under $700 million from fuel surcharges. Our full year reported operating ratio of 60.1% deteriorated 290 basis points versus 2021. Network inefficiencies and inflation were the primary components of the degradation with the PEB adjustment and higher fuel prices impacting the full year operating ratio by 30 basis points and 20 basis points, respectively. Earnings per share finished the year at a record $11.21, a 13% increase versus 2021 results. Our consistent and disciplined approach to deploying capital back into our railroad coupled with volume growth that produced increased operating income drove a 90-basis-point improvement in return on invested capital to a record 17.3%. Turning to shareholder returns on the balance sheet on Slide 21, full year cash from operations increased over $300 million to $9.4 billion, a 4% increase from 2021. The first priority for our cash is capital investment, which finished 2022 at $3.4 billion or just under 14% of revenue. Our cash flow conversion rate finished 2022 at 82% and free cash flow totaled $2.7 billion. Although a decrease of nearly $800 million versus 2021, that includes an almost $700 million increase in cash capital, a more than $350 million increase in dividend payments and $70 million for PEB back pay settlements. Our dividend payout ratio for 2022 was around 45%, in line with our long-term target, as we rewarded shareholders with a 10% dividend increase in the second quarter and distributed nearly $3.2 billion. We also returned cash through strong share repurchases, buying back 5% or $27 million of our common shares at an all-in cost of $6.3 billion. In total, between dividends and share repurchases, we returned $9.4 billion to our owners in 2022, demonstrating our ongoing commitment to deliver significant shareholder value. We closed out the year at an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.9 times, consistent with our resolve to maintain strong investment-grade credit ratings as we finished the year A rated by Moody's, S&P and Fitch. Turning now to our view on 2023, we think about the year ahead in two parts, what we can control and what we cannot. We don't control the markets we serve, and as you saw on Kenny's slide of economic indicators, it's a mixed bag in terms of expectations. We do control the way we compete in those markets with the great foundation of the UP franchise. Onboarding Schneider is clearly the marquee win for 2023 and with Kenny's team posting profitable wins across the Board, we are positioned to further outperform the market. In 2023, that will be evidenced by car loadings that exceed Industrial production. Another area where we don't have direct control is the current inflationary environment, which continues to be elevated. However, we know we have it within our control to improve operations. As you heard from Eric, it's imperative that we improve the reliability of our service product, while regaining lost productivity. In addition, as we have demonstrated consistently, we expect to generate pricing dollars that exceed inflation dollars in 2023. Assuming current fuel prices and our thoughts on volume, productivity and price, we expect to improve our full year 2023 operating ratio on a year-over-year basis. That said, there will be a lag to fully offset the impact of inflation on our profitability until we are able to actively touch or re-price our business while also further improving productivity. Turning to capital allocation, we continue to make significant investments into our business with an expected 6% increase in capital investments versus 2022 to $3.6 billion. Growth is the cornerstone to the long-term financial success of Union Pacific and we are continuing to invest in opportunities that support that strategy. In addition to the locomotive and Intermodal investments Eric described, we also are investing to support carload growth. The remainder of our capital allocation plans remain unchanged, rewarding our owners with an industry-leading dividend payout of around 45% and returning excess cash through share repurchases. With our balance sheet currently leveraged at the desired levels, the amount of cash available for repurchases will be less than in prior years and predominantly funded from cash generation. With the New Year comes new opportunities and by focusing on what we can control, we are confident in our ability to provide strong value to all of our stakeholders in 2023. So, with that, I will turn it back to Lance. That's a lot there in one question. But in terms of the lag part, so there is that piece. When you think about our contract structure, so in any given year, call it, 50% we are able to touch directly. The remainder is longer term contracts and they roll over in some segments over periods of years. Now those generally have escalators, but there can be limits on the escalators and those are lagging as well. So that's what we are referring to as having a lag impact. As well as kind of going back to the first question to, Eric, still very confident in our productivity initiatives, but we did take a step back this year. We have to acknowledge that and it's going to take us a little bit to gain that back because the inflation is real. That's a real factor that is certainly above what we have seen historically when you think about 4% kind of number for 2023. So that's that piece. You also mentioned fuel surcharge, and yeah, that was a positive contributor to us on an EPS operating income front in 2023 and so depending on what you estimate for fuel prices, that could be a headwind for us at some point. Overall, we averaged, I think, 365 [ph] for the year. Right now, we are paying closer to, call it, 315, 320 [ph]. So that could certainly be a difference when you think about year-over-year comparisons on the fuel surcharge revenue. Mix. I knew there was one more in there. So from a mix standpoint, yeah, I mean, fourth quarter mix was certainly negative when you look at it. And one of the things probably that really jumps out at you think about Intermodal, but in particular, International Intermodal and the year-over-year comparison, when you think about last year, International Intermodal was down substantially and then we saw it grow here in the fourth quarter this year, plus forest products, some of the Industrial segments a little weaker in the fourth quarter and higher rock shipments. So it's kind of that all-in and look there, Brandon. Now I think it covers. So, Tom, let me take the first part of that question, and then I will let Kenny address the second part. We are not going to give comments on directional guidance for RPU for various line items. You know the factors that are going to drive that. It's certainly the pricing but also fuel surcharge and then the mix of the business within that line. So those will all be things that will play into what that turns out to for 2023. Yeah. So I will start with the confidence around the margin improvement and we are confident in our ability to do that. Certainly, there are headwinds and you have just pointed to a couple of them. But then go back to the things I talked about in terms of how we are looking at the year and the key levers, which as you know, are volume, price and productivity. So volume certainly is a wildcard and we will see how that plays out. Pricing, we are confident that although it is going to lag a bit, we are confident that our price will -- price dollars will exceed inflation dollars. And then the productivity side, we know we have upside there. Yes, we are still adding resources and taking some steps to heal the network today. But we also know that there's a pipeline of opportunities to improve and we have those identified and we know what actions we need to put up against that to do that. And then as you do that and as the network hills, that gives us more opportunities on the volume side. We still know we are mixing Bulk loads today. So those are opportunities for us to get more leverage across that cost base. And then, obviously, there's fuel, which I mentioned before and we will see how that plays out. But right now, we are certainly playing a little bit less, call it, $0.40 or so less than what we were paying a year ago or what we paid for the full year 2022. So those are all the things that we are looking at, Scott, and we believe that those combination of factors are setting up in a way that we will be able to drive OR improvement. To your question on other revenue, so I think that's really a question maybe more geared towards accessorials and what we see playing out there. As the supply chain has healed, as we are seeing a little bit of softness in that Intermodal market, we have seen accessorials come down a bit. They were down a little bit for us here in the fourth quarter and that would probably be my expectation going into 2023 as well. Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. I wasn't -- I don't know that I totally caught the first part of your question there, Fadi, but I think you were basically asking to quantify what the congestion costs were for our network for 2022. We have not quantified that other than we -- when you look at our operating ratio and the degradation that we had on a year-over-year basis, 290 basis points, 50 basis points of that was a combination of PEB and fuel. The rest of that was inflation and congestion and probably fairly equally weighted between the two. So that's how I would think about that. That is our opportunity certainly and that feeds through all of the lines. It feeds through wage inflation. Now some of that, obviously, is real. We have the PEB. We know that's real. But then it's how we use the crews, and you have heard us talk about the fact that in 2022, we had higher recrew rates, we have higher borrow out costs, more deadhead and held away, more vans. Those all inflate those cost categories. Purchased services, as we were putting more locomotives into service, that inflated those costs on a year-over-year basis in addition to some of just the contractor inflation that we saw as all of our suppliers were faced with higher inflation, and you saw that come through. And then on the other line, we know we have opportunities there from a casualty standpoint. You heard us talk about casualty a couple of different times in 2022 and the higher cost that that brought to us. So those are all elements that we are now very much focused on attacking. You asked are we right-sized yet. You have heard us say, we still are short crews in critical locations. We are still hiring. So we still need to bring folks onto our network. That does two things that helps the -- well, three things only helps improve our reliability, our fluidity, it helps us move more volumes and as we are able to hire folks in those critical locations, we then move the people that we have working there in terms of borrow outs back to their home location and that reduces our cost base as well, and you can improve your recrew rate. So a lot of different moving parts there, Fadi. You know our business isn't just one element, but that's how we are looking at it. Those are the things that impacted us in 2022 and that's what we are looking to do in 2023. And helps to reduce more volume ultimately. Yeah. So the only thing I'd say in terms of cadence there is, really pointing out to the fuel piece of it and where you saw fuel was a bigger headwind to us in the earlier part of the year than the latter part of the year. You saw some of the inflation pick up in the latter part of the year. So there's some trade-offs there either way that I would just ask you to look at your models pretty closely there, because there are differences first half, second half in 2022 that you need to be thinking through there. I think you were referencing congestion surcharges? Oh! Accessorial. Okay. Again, we do expect that they could be less year-over-year, but I don't see that as a significant driver for us. Yeah. And then, Ravi, to your 55 OR questions, I mean, you have heard us talk that, that is still our goal and I will reiterate that again. We have not put a new time line on that because of all the things that you have heard us talk about here today in terms of the challenges that we are facing. But that doesn't mean we can't improve, that doesn't mean we don't have a path to improve and a path to get there. And relative to the quality of life, it really goes back to what you have heard from both Lance and Eric, as we improve crew availability, as we improve predictability, that improves our service product and it improves our ability to grow and with that service product comes further pricing opportunities as well. So it's a virtuous circle in my view and that's how we are going about pursuing those things. So, Ken, I am going to refrain from giving the order of magnitude on the OR guide or giving you a range. It really is just too soon in the year. We are sitting here on January 24th to give that to you. I could try, but I am sure I'd be wrong. So we are going to resist that temptation. I think the important thing to think about is we are going to work to improve as fast as we can, as hard as we can, you have seen us do that and demonstrate that, we are not trying to meter any progress. Our goal is to deliver that better service, be more fluid, and with that, leverage more volumes across the topline. There are some other things that influence it, obviously, when you think about fuel and inflation. But the team knows what those are and they know how to go about it. I am also not going to give you any guidance relative to sequential and whether we are going to have normal sequential patterns. We had a really hard hit here the end of 2022 with the weather, the way it impacted our volumes here at the close of the quarter. We have had some weather here again here in the start of the year. So hang with us, watch the volumes, watch the service metrics. Those are your best barometer to know how we are operating and how we are generating positive growth and positive financials across the network. All right. I will start with your mix question, Brian. So for 2023, we are expecting to have a negative mix for the year and really it's pretty simple when you think about it with increased Intermodal shipments with the onboarding of Schneider. And then you heard Kenny talk about tough grain markets and then also some of the question marks and toughness that we are expecting on the Industrial product side. Those things add up to negative mix for us in 2023. Yeah. You were breaking up there quite a bit, David. But I think what your basic question was, was how many do we expect to hire in 2023 and do we think about hiring at a different cadence maybe versus volumes going forward? In terms of hiring for the year, I think, we have said it would be similar probably to 2022 levels. But that obviously carries with it some attrition assumptions what we see happen with volumes and so if we would see a change positive or negative relative to volumes that obviously could impact that, we are just going to make sure that we have the right crews in place to be able to take advantage of the demand that's there for us. We know we are still not meeting at all today. In terms of how we think about hiring, I mean, I think, you have heard Lance and Eric talk about the fact that we would maybe keep our Boards a little bit larger established A once if we can and those will be things that can give us I will say cushion, as you see fluctuations in demand. Again, we expect to be able to leverage that service reliability into more volumes and better pricing and overall better productivity. And so when you think about the bottomline impact of that, we think it should worst case be neutral, but really be a positive for us in the long-term. Yeah. I mean you are seeing that flow through today, I would say. When you have got 600, 700 people in training today. Not out actively moving freight, that is the headwind that we have in those numbers today that I would say is already there. Right. Thanks."

            "name": "Kenny Rocker",
            "content": "Thank you, Lance, and good morning. Fourth quarter volume was up 1% compared to 2021. Gains in our Premium Business Group were partially offset by a decline in our bulk area. However, freight revenue was up 9%, driven by higher fuel surcharges and strong price. Let's take a closer look at each of these business groups. Starting with Bulk. Revenue for the quarter was up 7% compared to 2021, driven by a 10% increase in average revenue per car, reflecting higher fuel surcharges and solid core pricing gains. Volume was down 3% year-over-year. Grain and grain products volume was down 2%, driven by a decrease in export grain shipments. Despite strong market demand, we faced service and weather challenges that slow shuttle cycle times, as well as having a tough 2021 comparable. Fertilizer carloads were down 15% year-over-year driven by reduced shipments for potash due to market softness along with another tough comp the 2021 fourth quarter. Food and refrigerated volume was down 8% due to reduced shipments of finished beverage product and their associated raw materials. And lastly, coal and renewable carloads remained flat in the quarter, as our ability to capture demand from favorable natural gas prices was impacted by weather and service challenges, particularly in late December. Moving on to Industrial. Industrial revenue was up 5% for the quarter, driven by a 5% improvement in average revenue per car due to higher fuel surcharges and core pricing gains, somewhat offset by a negative business mix. Volume for the quarter was flat. Industrial chemicals and plastic shipments were down 4% year-over-year driven by lower Industrial chemicals demand. Metals and minerals volumes continued to deliver robust year-over-year growth, driven in part by our business development efforts. Volume was up 8% compared to 2021, primarily driven by an increase in frac sand shipments and growth in construction materials. Forest products volume declined 17% year-over-year, driven by weak corrugated box demand and softness in the housing market. Energy and specialized shipments were up 2% compared to 2021, driven by an increased waste and soda ash demand, partially offset by pure petroleum shipments from regulatory changes in Mexico markets. Turning to Premium. Revenue for the quarter was up 15% on a 3% increase in volume. Average revenue per car increased 12% due primarily to higher fuel surcharge revenue and core pricing gains. Automotive volume was up 9%, driven by strengthening production and inventory replenishment for finished vehicles. Intermodal volume was up 2%, driven by increased international shipments, mainly due to an easier comp in 2021. Although domestic volumes decreased due to soft market demand, declining truck rates and increased over the roll capacity, the aforementioned negative impact was partially offset with the Schneider conversion in December. Now as we look ahead to 2023, you can see the macro indicators that we are watching along with inflation and interest rates, and you will notice that we have some challenges with Industrial production, imports and housing starts. However, we remain optimistic that we will be Industrial production with our strong focus on business development. So now moving on to Slide 8. Here is our market outlook for 2023 as we sit here today. Starting with our Bulk commodities, we expect a challenging year were grain based on drought conditions, which will affect crop availability in UP served origin. However, we expect to see growth in coal, even though natural gas prices have come off their highs, low inventories will continue -- will support continued demand. We are keeping a close eye on natural gas prices, given the price impact of our index based contracts. In addition, we expect biofuel shipments for renewable diesel to continue to grow due to solid market demand, new production facilities coming online and business development wins. Moving on to Industrial. The forecast for Industrial production is to shrink slightly in 2023 and the demand is softening in forest products. However, we expect to see continued strength in metal with new business wins. And lastly, for Premium, we expect the entire Intermodal market to be challenged, both international and domestic by high inventory levels, lower truck rates and temper consumer spending. We expect to outperform that market, however, through our new business with Schneider, as well as opportunities to grow with other private asset owners and our strong IMC partners. We expect automotive growth to be another bright spot in this segment driven by production strength and inventory replenishment. As I wrap up my comments, I want to take a moment to express my gratitude to our customers and the operating team. Over the past month, extreme weather events impacted large portions of our network and I want to thank our employees who safely worked around the clock in harsh conditions to keep the railroad running for our customers. And with that, I will turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance. Yeah. Thanks a lot, Amit. First of all, we are in the early stages of bid season, call it, 10% to 15%. You heard me call out in my notes we are seeing some softness there in the marketplace. We have been encouraged that we are retaining all the business that we are out there competing for. I think it's too soon to call out what will happen in terms of pricing, but what I will tell you is that, we do have mechanisms for our business to make sure that we can remain competitive in a challenged market like this, but also price to the market and make sure that we are capturing some of the upside as things get tight throughout the year. Absolutely. Yeah. So, Lance, I want to hit hard for those on the call, the mindset of this management team and the commercial team is really to drive business development and so that's one thing that we can control. There are some markets out there that we really want to go after that we think are right. Renewable diesel is one of them and we feel good and confident about the wins there. If you look at finished vehicles, both the finished vehicle side and also the auto parts side is an area that we feel good about. There are some expansions that are coming along our line that we won in the petrochem area with plastics and Industrial chem. And then also, we have talked and been very bullish about metals as we have seen some wins come up there. So very focused on the things we can control and been encouraged that car velocity has been improving along the way. Yeah. Let me lead again with something Lance mentioned that we feel very confident that we will be able to price over the inflation dollars. So I want to say that, our commercial team has done a great job of articulating the need to price to the market. When we talk about price into the market, we have talked about some of those dynamics. Inflation is one our customers are facing that, too. They understand that. But we also talk pretty broadly about investment. When I say investments, part of what I am talking about is what Eric is doing with our capital plan. The other part is making sure that we are resourced the helm of growth. So we are doubt in on that, we are having those conversations with customers and we are articulating that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Lance, you talked about our Premium network. And again, Allison, those products show up in terms of Inland Empire in our product in Twin Cities that we feel very encouraged and confident about and filling those areas out. And it also shows up in other areas like our investments in GPS, our investment in chassis. On the carload side, we are really excited about what's taking place with RailPulse. So you are seeing it across the Board both on our carload side and in our Intermodal network. Yeah. Kenny? Yeah. We feel good about being able to move coal in these natural gas prices and even the forward curve for the rest of the year. I will tell you, there's still quite a bit of low inventories out there. So I can assure you, those customers are willing and able to receive that coal demand that's out there. Yeah. I mean we are definitely still winning business from truck, and what I would tell you is that, we haven't seen any large pieces and I said that they are earlier move away from them. A lot of that is driven by the economy. Clearly, some of the service challenges we have, we may have seen some lanes move at versus via truck or maybe another mode. But our customers realize that this is a short-term phenomenon and that we are investing, we have been very transparent in our investment again in hiring and our investment in our CapEx, so that they can stay with us. I mean, Lance, you talked about it a little bit earlier, if you look at our car velocity from the summer to now, we have seen some improvement, and Eric and I were talking about this a couple of days ago. If you look at third quarter to fourth quarter sequentially on our Premium network, that is improving as we onboard at Schneider. So that gives us a lot of confidence. I -- some of that was really, I think, labor challenges that you saw in the port and a little bit of ambiguity on what they thought might happen. I think as we see that clear up on the port that you will see a little bit more of that volume come back to the West Coast port. Again, everything that we are doing, all of our investments around Inland Empire, the G4 relo would act, the Dallas to Dock and Dallas. I am telling you we are bullish to make sure we can make those areas more competitive for the customers. Yeah. As we are spending time with customers, as a mixed bag when they think some of these inventory issues will get resolved. So some are saying back half of third quarter. For us, we are not going to try to time that or be so precise at the time. What we are really focused on is making sure that we have got the service product where it should and I just want to double down on what I said sequentially, we are seeing that improvement. We have onboarded a large customer and we are walking towards trying to capture that growth when it shows up or when a pop. All right, Brian, you win the title for getting us all the talk. I will make this quick. Two things, one, yeah, we have had some pretty difficult conversations with customers. But 1 of the positives that has come out of that is creating tech solutions for them to give them the visibility that Lance was talking about, whether it's inventory on our line, the release rates number of cars that are in the serving yard. We have shared that those tech solutions with them here a couple of weeks ago and we are working with the customer so that they can integrate that into their supply chain. We will have to see what plays out there. Historically, what we have seen is a little bit of fits and starts. I think what we will also be looking at is the inventory levels at least in the near-term, it may not have that much of an impact as they start up a little bit later, it may be right in time. So a lot of uncertainty there, definitely some fits and starts. What we really need is the consumer spending and a little bit more demand to be out there more so than the issue in Asia. Yeah. I will tell you. Thanks for that question, Jason. We have been encouraged as the management team with all the investment that we put into the railroad to support growth and we have talked about those products here a little bit today. We do think that Inland Empire is transformative for us. We do think that the Twin Cities Intermodal facility is transformative for us. We do think that the focus on technology, some of which Lance mentioned a little bit earlier that will help drive our experience. What ultimately helps our customers reduce their costs with their drivers will have an impact. And then, Jason, everything you just said, RailPulse is for our carload business and we put a lot of focus on making sure we can do ease of business and know exactly what our customers are asking for."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you. Mr. Fritz, you may now begin.\nLance Fritz: Thank you, Rob, and good morning, and welcome to Union Pacific's third quarter earnings conference call. With me today in Omaha are Kenny Rocker, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Eric Gehringer, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Jennifer Hamann, our Chief Financial Officer. Before discussing results for the quarter, I want to thank our employees for their tireless efforts over the past several months to improve service levels. I'd also note the dedicated service of our craft professionals throughout the recent very lengthy labor negotiation. The new agreements based on the Presidential Emergency Board recommendations reward our employees for their hard work. And with roughly half of our unions ratifying agreements, we are looking forward to complete this process and move forward. Now turning to our third quarter results. This morning, Union Pacific is reporting 2022 third quarter net income of $1.9 billion or $3.05 per share. These results include the impact of a $114 million charge for prior period estimates related to the new labor agreements. Excluding that charge, adjusted net income is $2 billion or $3.19 per share. This compares to third quarter 2021 results of $1.7 billion or $2.57 per share. Our adjusted third quarter operating ratio of 58.2% is 190 basis points higher than 2021. Costs related to higher inflation and ongoing network inefficiencies were offset by fuel surcharge revenue, volume growth and strong core pricing gains to produce adjusted operating income growth of 13%. We made real progress during the quarter to increase network fluidity and better meet customer demand. And as you'll hear from the team, we're continuing to take steps in the fourth quarter to better meet that demand and drive costs from the network. While the year hasn't played out as originally planned, our volumes have outpaced our peers, demonstrating the growth mindset that we're instilling within our organization. So with that, let me turn it over to Kenny for an update on the business environment.\nKenny Rocker : Thank you, Lance, and good morning. Third quarter volume was up 3% compared to a year ago as carloads increased across all three of our business segments. Although overall volume was up, we undoubtedly had left demand on the table as we continue to improve service across the network. Freight revenue was up 18% driven by higher fuel surcharges and strong pricing gains. Let's take a closer look at each of these business groups. Starting with Bulk, revenue for the quarter was up 16% compared to last year driven by a 14% increase in average revenue per car, reflecting higher fuel surcharges and solid core pricing gains. Volume was up 2% year-over-year. Coal and renewable carloads grew 5% year-over-year driven by continued favorable natural gas prices and two contract wins that started on January 1. Grain and grain products volume was up 3% with strong domestic feed grain and increased biofuel shipments for renewable diesel. Fertilizer carloads were down 7% year-over-year due to reduced shipments of export and domestic consumed potash. And lastly, food and refrigerated volume remained flat in the quarter. Moving on to Industrial. Industrial revenue was up 15% for the quarter driven by a 4% increase in volume and an 11% improvement in average revenue per car due to higher fuel surcharges and core pricing gains. Energy and specialized shipments were down 3% compared to 2021 driven by pure petroleum shipments primarily due to regulatory changes in the Mexico market. Volumes for forest products was down 2% year-over-year primarily driven by lower demand for corrugated boxes. This was partially offset by positive year-over-year lumber shipments. Industrial chemicals and plastic shipments were up 8% compared to 2021 due to new business wins, customer expansion and market demand. Metals and minerals volumes continued to deliver robust year-over-year growth. Volume was up 7% compared to last year primarily driven by an increase in frac sand shipments, growth in construction materials and metals business development. Turning to premium. Revenue for the quarter was up 25% on a 3% increase in volume. Average revenue per car increased 21% due primarily to higher fuel surcharge revenue and core pricing gains. Automotive volume was up 19% driven by strengthening production and inventory replenishment. Finished vehicles increased by 33%, and auto parts increased by 11% against a softer comparison from last year. Intermodal volume was flat. Domestic intermodal was down 3% due to softening demand driven by a 16% decline in parcel shipments. However, international volume strengthened by 4% from ocean carriers shifting more freight to inland terminals. Now moving to our outlook for the rest of 2022. At a macro level, we will be closely watching our markets to see how inflation and interest rates will impact our overall volume. But here is where we sit today with our markets. Let's start out with our bulk commodities. We expect biofuel shipments for renewable diesel to continue to grow due to solid market demand and business development wins. For coal, we anticipate continued favorable natural gas prices to generate demand for both domestic and export shipments. However, the opportunity to capture demand is dependent on the available resources. And our outlook for grain is also dependent on our service recovery. But as we've mentioned before, we have a tough comp in the fourth quarter as exports were strong last year. Moving on to Industrial. The forecast for industrial production is decelerating, and demand is softening in forest products. However, we expect construction to be a positive due to strong project demand in the south. And lastly, for premium, we are closely monitoring domestic intermodal demand as spot truck rates fall and inventories climb. We expect parcel and truckload demand to remain soft as consumer preferences have shifted more to experiences versus goods. We're also watching the international markets closely, but we expect to be positive in the fourth quarter due to easier comps. And we expect growth in Automotive to be driven by improving supply for parts and inventory replenishment. Overall, we still foresee a favorable demand environment for the fourth quarter. Crew availability continues to improve, which will help us capture more growth and support our business development wins as we head into 2023. With that, I'll turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance.\nEric Gehringer: Thanks, Kenny, and good morning. Turning to Slide 9. Our year-to-date safety results are demonstrating meaningful and sustained improvement compared to 2021. Safety impacts every facet of our business: our employees, our customers and our shareholders. While our safety management system is promoting the right culture, our #1 priority remains returning every employee home safely at the end of the day. Taking a look at our current network performance on Slide 10. Our operating metrics steadily improved through the third quarter, aided by improving crew availability from hiring initiatives, lower recrew rates and improved crew utilization. Our hiring and training pipeline is strong. To date, we have graduated 890 employees and have an additional 518 currently in training, all expected to graduate by January of 2023. We have now hired 1,408 new transportation employees, exceeding our goal for the year. Freight car velocity is approaching 200 miles per day, up from its low in April. Even more encouraging, the improvement came while moving 10,000 more weekly carloads. By utilizing approximately 250 borrowed out employees and adding new graduates to some of our challenged crew locations, we have been able to add more coal and grain sets back into the network. We also reduced our recrew rates from a peak of 11% in April to now around 7%. Exiting the third quarter, the network is in a more solid and fluid state than earlier in the year. Going forward, we are building upon these improved results to drive excess cost from the network. Now let's review our key performance metrics for the quarter, starting on Slide 11, which remained challenged when compared to 2021 even considering the relatively easy comparison from last year's wildfire and weather events. However, both freight car velocity and manifest and auto trip plan compliance strengthened sequentially from last quarter's results. Intermodal trip plan compliance was flat sequentially and remains impacted by persistent supply chain challenges, resulting in elevated chassis street times and container ramp to well. We continue to make progress at the West Coast ports as the number of stacked containers decline. Turning to Slide 12 to review our network efficiency metrics. During the third quarter, as performance improved, we were able to remove and stage locomotives across the network to improve overall fleet utilization. As a result, locomotive productivity did improve sequentially although remains below last year's metric. Entering the fourth quarter, as we continue to improve train speed and other measures, locomotive productivity will continue to strengthen as well. Third quarter workforce productivity was flat as both the labor force and car miles increased. Train length improved 1% compared to third quarter 2021 as the team utilized longer trains to handle increasing volumes. We now anticipate completing an additional four sidings in 2022 on top of the 20 sidings in our original plan. This will bring the total sidings completed since 2019 to 80. These sidings are a key enabler of our ability to effectively use our resources and drive productivity. Wrapping up on Slide 13. I'm encouraged by the progress we've made, but our work is not yet done. Using our PSR principles, we will further improve our service product and build a more resilient network. Our trajectory to this point reflects the great team we have at Union Pacific, and my thanks goes out to everyone for their efforts and dedication. To finish 2022, we remain focused on further reducing excess inventory, safely improving operational efficiency and using our crews and locomotives even more effectively. Ultimately, as is always the goal, we need to run the network and manage our assets in a more than volume variable manner. To that point, we are storing excess international intermodal well cars as the expected levels of volume did not materialize while at the same time, to capture demand in other areas, we are bringing cars out of storage. Additionally, to support bulk demand, we will continue hiring programs and send additional borrowed-out employees to crew-challenged locations in our northern region. As we wrap up the year and I look forward, I am confident that the foundation we are building will provide a better service product for our customers. With that, I will turn it over to Jennifer to review our financial performance.\nJennifer Hamann: Thanks, Eric, and good morning. I'm going to start on Slide 15 with a walk down of our third quarter operating ratio and earnings per share. Our reported operating ratio of 59.9% and earnings per share of $3.05 includes a $114 million change in estimate related to the Presidential Emergency Board recommendation and subsequent ratified and tentative labor agreements. At a high level, the $114 million charge negatively impacted third quarter operating ratio by 170 basis points and reduced EPS by $0.14. For more granular information on the charge, please refer to the appendix slide at the back of the presentation deck.  It's important to note, however, that while our general wage accruals weren't far off the PEB recommendation, we did not accrue for the [$1,000] annual bonus payments. Core results in the quarter continue to reflect inflation and network inefficiencies as our operating ratio was unfavorably impacted 310 basis points but contributed $0.20 to EPS. Importantly, we did make sequential core improvement in our operating ratio of 40 basis points versus the second quarter. Decreasing fuel prices in the quarter and the roughly two-month lag in our fuel surcharge program favorably impacted our quarterly operating ratio by 70 basis points and added $0.37 to EPS.  Finally, third quarter results also include the favorable comparison to last year's weather and wildfire events, which adds 50 basis points to OR and $0.05 to EPS. Looking now at our third quarter income statement on Slide 16, where we provide both reported and adjusted numbers that exclude the impact of the labor charge. Throughout my remarks, I will speak to the adjusted results. Operating revenue totaled $6.6 billion, up 18% versus 2021 on 3% year-over-year volume growth. As we have seen throughout the year, higher fuel prices are the primary contributor to higher operating expenses, which increased 22% to $3.8 billion. Excluding the impact of higher fuel prices, our expenses were up 10% in the quarter. Third quarter adjusted operating income totaled $2.7 billion, a 13% increase versus 2021. Other income increased $86 million driven by higher real estate income, including a $35 million gain on sale and pension benefit. Income tax expense increased 13% as a result of higher pretax income, partially offset by corporate income tax rate reductions in three of our operating states. As a result of those changes, we now expect our full year tax rate to be around 23%. Adjusted net income of $2 billion increased 18% versus 2021, and adjusted earnings per share was up 24% to $3.19. Operating revenue, operating income, net income and earnings per share were all quarterly records. Looking more closely at third quarter freight revenue, Slide 17 provides a breakdown, which totaled $6.1 billion, up 18% versus 2021. Year-over-year volume gains, supported by our business development efforts and sequentially improving operational fluidity, increased freight revenue 325 basis points. Fuel surcharge revenue impacted revenue 13 points, reflecting the impact of higher year-over-year diesel prices and the two-month lag in our recovery program. Total fuel surcharge revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter. Strong pricing gains when combined with a slightly negative business mix drove 200 basis points of freight revenue growth. Lower petroleum shipments, combined with higher rock and auto part shipments, contributed to the negative mix. From a price standpoint, we have now lapped the positive benefit from coal contracts indexed to natural gas prices. So the year-over-year benefit is minimal. And as we experienced in the second quarter, network fluidity limited the upside for both price and mix. Setting these headwinds aside, we are confident that we will yield price dollars that exceed inflation dollars even with a higher inflationary hurdle than expected at the start of the year. Moving on to Slide 18, which provides a summary of our third quarter adjusted operating expenses where the primary driver again this quarter was fuel, up 71% on a 67% increase in fuel prices. While we saw fuel prices come down some in the quarter, our average quarterly fuel price was $3.96 per gallon, only $0.07 lower than second quarter's average price. Our fuel consumption rate achieved an all-time quarterly record in the quarter, improving 1% versus 2021 as a result of productivity gains and a more fuel-efficient business mix. Looking closer at the other expense lines, adjusted compensation and benefits expense was up 12% versus 2021. This includes an additional $19 million related to this quarter's accrual for wage increases and annual bonus. Total third quarter workforce levels increased 3%. Management, engineering and mechanical workforces grew 3%, while train and engine crews were up 5% primarily reflecting year-over-year increases in our training pipeline. As you heard from Eric, we have now exceeded our 2022 hiring goals. Cost per employee came in higher than anticipated, up 8% primarily driven by wage inflation. We also experienced continued cost pressures related to network inefficiencies with higher overtime and borrow-out costs. For the fourth quarter, we expect the year-over-year increase to be around 7%, in line with tentative and ratified wage increases. Purchased services and materials expense remained elevated, up 23% driven by higher cost to maintain a larger active locomotive fleet, volume-related purchase transportation expense associated with our Loup subsidiary and inflation. Equipment and other rents decreased 1% driven by higher equity income that more than offset increased car hire expenses. Other expense grew 18% in the quarter, a bit higher than we anticipated as a result of increased casualty expenses associated with freight loss and damage and personal injury. For the fourth quarter, we expect other expense to be flat versus 2021 as we are anticipating the receipt of an insurance settlement for last year's bridge fire. Overall, inflation and cost inefficiencies offset the benefits of volume leverage and resulted in fuel-adjusted incremental margins of just 2%. Although not the results we know we can achieve, it still reflects positive progress from the second quarter and provides us with momentum as we wrap up 2022. Turning to Slide 19 and our cash flows. Cash from operations through the third quarter increased 9% to $7.1 billion. Our comparable cash flow conversion rate was 80%, and free cash flow totaled $2.1 billion. Although this is a decrease of $517 million versus 2021, it includes $745 million of increased cash capital spending and $317 million in higher dividends. With the increased capital spending to date, we now expect full year 2022 capital to be around $3.4 billion, up slightly from our prior guidance, but well within our overall guidance of less than 15% of revenue. Year-to-date, shareholders have received $7.9 billion through dividends and share repurchases. This level of cash returns demonstrates our firm commitment to rewarding shareholders with strong returns. Related to share repurchases, we now expect to buy back roughly $6.5 billion in 2022. Although we repurchased shares at a strong pace in the third quarter and expect that to continue for the remainder of the year, we have been impacted by higher-than-anticipated inflationary pressures and service costs. Lastly, we finished the third quarter with a comparable adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.8x as we continue to maintain a strong investment-grade credit rating. In fact, during the quarter, we received an upgrade from Moody's to A3, and we are now A-rated across all 3 credit agencies. Also during the quarter, we issued $1.9 billion in debt, which included $600 million of green bonds, our first such issuance. Wrapping up on Slide 20. With a little over two months left in the year, we are focused on building upon the positive momentum of the third quarter. The operating team is executing on its plan to improve operating performance and capture additional unmet customer demand. As you heard from Kenny, however, markets are softening a bit, and that is resulting in a slight reduction in our overall volume expectations, now more in the range of 3% growth for full year 2022. With more clarity on the impact from the new labor agreements, our operating ratio outlook also has changed. We now expect our reported full year operating ratio to be around 60%. As we close out 2022, attention is quickly turning to 2023. While we are not yet ready to share our outlook, it is important to reiterate our long-term view. Our focus on generating strong cash returns and improving ROIC remains unchanged, and we are firmly committed to achieving the goals established at our May 2021 Investor Day of a 55% operating ratio and incremental margins in the mid- to upper 60s. Since establishing those targets and even achieving them in a few quarters, the environment has changed with higher inflation and a weaker economic outlook. The road to achieving those milestones now is a bit longer, but our road map to success is still the same, supported by our great employees and the foundation of UP's strong and diverse franchise, we will leverage volume, pricing and productivity to achieve those goals. With that, I'll turn it back to Lance.\nLance Fritz : Thank you, Jennifer. As you heard from Eric, our year-to-date safety metrics have shown good sustainable improvement, which is very encouraging. However, the most important metric is for all of our employees to go home safely every day. We remain relentless in pursuit of that ultimate and most important goal. On the sustainability front, during the quarter, we announced a $1 billion agreement with Wabtec to modernize 600 locomotives over the next three years. This is a key investment as we work to reduce our carbon footprint and meet our 2030 SBTI targets. This investment also supports what our customers need as each modernized locomotive is significantly more reliable. This is true game-changing for Union Pacific. As we close out 2022, we look to capitalize on the demand available to us as we sequentially improve operational efficiency. And although we're still putting together our 2023 plan, we like our positioning relative to the industry, considering our great customer wins like Schneider, expected strong coal demand and a positive impact to our construction business associated with the infrastructure bill. I also want to reiterate Jennifer's point about our long-term view. We are committed to achieving a 55% operating ratio and mid- to high 60s incremental margins. These goals are achievable. And as we safely and efficiently improve operations, our customers, our employees, our communities and our shareholders will all win together. With that, let's open up the line for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan.\nBrian Ossenbeck: So I know you said it's still too early to talk more about 2023, but just given the importance of volume growth and visibility to that, Kenny, maybe I just wanted you to go through some of the areas you have a little bit more confidence and visibility at this point. And also, can you touch on the impact of the stronger dollar as it relates to the various end markets because it has been disruptive in the past for you? And then, Lance, any update on the negotiation process considering one of the unions rejected the contract, and I believe the National Rail Conference also rejected their counteroffer last night. An update on thoughts ahead and timing would be appreciated there.\nLance Fritz : Thanks, Brian. I'll start with a look at the labor negotiation, and then we'll turn it over to Kenny for talking about 2023 growth potential. So when we look at the overall negotiation, we've got on UP property, five unions; on the industry, six unions that have ratified. That's about half the unions. We've got four that are out for ratification votes still, and then we've got the BMWED that's rejected their ratification early and are back into negotiation.  A couple of things to note. We've got an agreed-upon status quo or maintained of status quo with BMWE while we're negotiating out what they take back to their membership. And one of the reasons, maybe we think the predominant reason for that original vote not to be ratified is that the PEB recommended both wages. And they also, for the BMWE, recommended a change in their compensation for travel to the work site because about 40%, sometimes more of that work team goes to away-from-home work sites, works for seven days and then comes back. So a change in that travel allowance and a change in the per diem while they're away from home. That negotiation on UP property just finished up last week. And so as the members were ratifying the vote, there was a section of it that they really didn't have clarity to. We think that clarity makes that vote more straightforward. And so that's part of the negotiation that's happening is exactly what's going to be embedded in the agreement when it goes back out for ratification. Ultimately, I remain confident that we're going to get our temporary agreements ratified and be able to avoid a strike. That's still a possibility, but I don't think it's a probability.\nKenny Rocker : So I'll start off a little backwards here and take the currency question first. Lance and I just came back from Asia here recently, and we saw the evidence of what you're talking about. We're really looking at how the consumer is going to spend their money. We're seeing some evidence that they're spending more on the services right now than the goods. We're seeing that show up in the parcel shipment. And so we're going to just watch that pretty closely week to week. So I talked a little bit about some of the markets that we feel very bullish on. Obviously, coal is one of them. Eric and his team and our commercial leaders have done a really good job of being agile and put resources, incremental resources up to capture that business. On our biofuel market as an emerging market for us, we feel good about the order book of customers that are coming on. We're going to bring on two new plants here in the next, call it, three to six months, which is very encouraging for us. Grain is going to be a tough comp, but we'll see how that plays out. On the Industrial side, housing markets, we're seeing our lumber shipments taper off a little bit. One of the things that I'd tell you about Industrial is on the construction product side, our rock shipments are still relatively strong, and so that's a positive for us. Our metals business has been strong. A lot of the rebar goes into construction materials for highways and roads. So that's encouraging for us. A lot of the other sheet and coil is helping out the Automotive business, which is also -- I talked about that being up. Automotive is up. Dealer supplied at their facilities are low. They're about 30 today. Some of the OEMs that we talk to, their dealers supply for inventory at their dealerships is in the single digits, in the teens. That's going to be a positive for us. The rest of the quarter, I mentioned this a little bit early on the international intermodal side. It will be a positive for us. We've got an easier comp. And then we're going to keep an eye on, again, domestic as we're moving through\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi.\nChristian Wetherbee: I guess maybe I wanted to clarify a point on the full year operating ratio. So I just wanted to make sure, I think you said reported 60 for the full year. So does that include the $114 million that's sort of excluded from the adjusted third quarter? I guess that's my first question. Just sort of piggybacking on that, as you think about the sequential progression, it sounds like yields probably decelerate just given what's going on with fuel. But can you talk a little bit about sort of the cost dynamic? Maybe moving forward, it seems like maybe a bit bigger than normal seasonal step-up in the operating ratio in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. Can you just sort of elaborate a little bit on that? That would be helpful.\nJennifer Hamann : Sure, Chris, and thanks for that question. You did hear right. So the 60% is the reported operating ratio. So that does include the impact of the PEB, the $114 million that we took the charge for relative to the change in estimates as well as the ongoing impact, which, as I mentioned in my remarks, was $19 million in the third quarter and will be likely a similar amount in the fourth quarter. So we absolutely do have that cost inflation. You also, I think, referenced fuel. That is going to flip on us, we believe, from third quarter to fourth quarter where it was a tailwind for us in the third quarter. That flips back to a headwind of a decent amount, we think, now in the fourth quarter. So that's going to be an impact. And of course, mix was a little bit negative for us here in the third quarter. That's probably going to look a little bit worse as we move into the fourth quarter. So kind of putting all those things together cumulatively on a sequential basis, we are expecting the operating ratio to deteriorate some even as we're bringing more volume on and still working to take costs out of the network. But we have those headwinds. And as you know, with those inflationary things, in particular, while we're very confident we're going to offset that with price, there is some timing there.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company.\nJason Seidl : Wanted to focus a little bit on the intermodal side and break up between both domestic and international. On the domestic side, you obviously called out sort of a weakening truck market going to be a little bit of a challenge. How should we think about that going forward in terms of the yields? And on the international side, how should we think about what we've seen as a big shift from the West Coast to the East Coast? How much of that traffic shift do you think will be permanent in the long term?\nLance Fritz : Kenny?\nKenny Rocker : Yes, I'll start off with the international intermodal and just kind of walk you through it. First of all, one of the things that is encouraging to us is that we're seeing the percentage of traffic that goes on to the West Coast and move to our inland facilities increase. And so again, that means that less of that product is being transloaded on the West Coast. So that is a positive to us. That's encouraging to us. We're pushing up, I'll call it, product and solutions up against our customers in that light. For example, our Katoen Dallas to Dock facility last quarter had its highest volume of West-bound traffic there. Also, we opened up our Global 4 ag relo facility in August. So those are things that we're doing to make the product a lot more encouraging. So keep that in mind as you're thinking about the West Coast versus the East Coast. Then on the domestic side, again, I mentioned and called out the fact that in our parcel business, we're looking at that fairly closely as we're kind of heading into the last part of the year. We have seen the inventory rise a little bit. We -- that is reflected in some of our inland terminals to a very small degree. We've seen the spot rates lower, but we haven't seen that in the contract rate. We'll know more about that as we head into a bid season, which is in, call it, December 4.\nLance Fritz : Yes. And Jason, I'd just add one thing, and that is we're encouraged by the movement of the international boxes between ports and inland, right? That's fluid, looks pretty good. We've taken some of the box count down off of the ports. That's approaching back to normal. We still have an issue with trying to get boxes off the inland ramps and process through warehouses. There's a lot of inventory sitting in warehouses right now. And the U.S. consumer is going to have to chew through that for us to be able to get street times and boxed well on the destination side back to normal.\nJason Seidl : Okay. And any -- and the comments that I made about yields, if we do see a bleed in the contract rates on the truckload side, Kenny, how should we think about pressure on intermodal yields as we look to '23?\nKenny Rocker: So first of all, I think, again, it's just a little too soon to tell. Hey, I'm not ready to concede all the tightness that Lance just talked about, might not show up in firming prices on the contract side. So it's just a little too soon to call that out.\nLance Fritz : Doubtless, there's a headwind there through the bid season, and we'll have to just see how it plays out.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI.\nJonathan Chappell: Eric, you spent most of this year, probably even much of last year trying to bring on resources, mostly labor, but all these resources that you needed for fluidity and productivity, et cetera. And now you feel like you're getting close, if not there, into a slowing demand backdrop. So as you look about going forward, do you have the flexibility and the nimbleness that you've had in prior cycles to maybe manage some of those resources down if demand is weaker than you expect? Or do you need to keep the network a bit more over-resourced in the short term, given these challenges that you've had and maybe even more intense scrutiny from the regulator?\nEric Gehringer: Yes. I appreciate that question, Jon. Without a doubt, as we've demonstrated in multiple times, unfortunately, we have the ability to bring down our resources in line with volume. In my prepared comments, I made a point to point out that we want to be more than volume variable. So that playbook is known, and we've demonstrated an efficiency in being able to do that. Now as we think about that and we think about the last 1.5 years to your point, there are three things that we continue to be focused on. Our ability to hire no matter what the market is remains critical. As part of that, we continue to work on how we think about making our jobs even more attractive to the population. So no matter what the market is, we can attract the talent that we need.  At the same time, as we look at resources and continue to be able to balance them, to your point, you will see us, as we've had in the past, reestablish AWTS, which is a way for us to have a little bit of a buffer. It's not thousands of people. It's a couple of hundred people to be able to react both on the upside and the downside. So we have that playbook. We clearly have demonstrated our ability to execute it, yet we continue to take lessons we're learning to make that playbook even stronger.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein.\nDavid Vernon : Eric, you mentioned in the slides that you're getting ahead of your 1,400 hiring goals for T&E this year. Can you think -- can you help us think about how much more hiring we need to do to kind of maintain the service levels that you need to be? Like what are you thinking about in terms of headcount for next year? Obviously, you don't have the volume plans and everything else, but are we still in the process of catching up from a headcount perspective for where you need to resource the network? Or are you -- if we get to 1,400, are we there?\nEric Gehringer : Yes, David, great question. So to reiterate, we set out the year to start hiring 1,400 people. You heard in my prepared comments that we've done that. Now admittedly, 1/3 of that 1,400 have been hired, and they're in the training pipeline. So we won't see the benefit of having them towards -- until the end of the year, between now and the end of the year, really. As we think about looking out at our hiring demands, as you pointed out and as Kenny highlighted, there are obviously questions about the markets. We'll stay close to those. We'll use the same process that we've employed in the past to ensure that we don't fall short of hiring. And at the same time, as we look, we're really focused on attrition. You have a couple of questions that are outstanding with regards to the implications of the ratification with some population of our employees, and we're going to react to that accordingly. So it's really about the markets, what do we need to be staffed to for that and contending with attrition.\nDavid Vernon : And is it right to think that there's a little bit of buffer you need to add in there for some of those agreements around extra pay, paid time off just having some people -- more people on staff? Is that something that's also sort of contemplated in your hiring outlook? Or is that -- how do we think about that from a productivity standpoint?\nEric Gehringer : It's contemplated and always has been contemplated. Certainly, inside the agreements that are still out for ratification, there are questions around additional time off, and we'll adjust accordingly for that. I think the more important part of that is how do we think about that AWTS program and making sure -- but again, it's a couple of hundred people, and it's viable, and it's something that we can rely on.\nJennifer Hamann: But David, I think it's important to remember, and Eric said this, we still expect that we can be volume variable even with those agreements. So we're going to see volumes exceed whichever -- what happens in the economy, you won't see headcount grow to the same extent.\nLance Fritz : 100%. One last thing to note, David. We got to step a little carefully here. We've committed and we've started and been in negotiation with some of our crafts, the unscheduled jobs specifically to try to find ways to get scheduled time off. Part of the PEB and this negotiation address that, but it's a far bigger issue that needs to be addressed on property in job design. That's underway. We think there's a path to do that without a substantial or kind of meaningful impact on overall headcount requirement because what we're trying to do is we're trying to make availability of employees flat across the week, right? So you don't get spikes in crew availability and layoffs. And the way you do that is you make time off predictable, and we think that trade-off is feasible. We think it's absolutely going to be happening. We don't think there's a large impact on employment through that.\nJennifer Hamann : And it could actually give us better crew availability.\nLance Fritz : 100%.\nJennifer Hamann : That gives us opportunities.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.\nRavi Shanker : So I get that you're -- obviously, it's too early to give us 2023 guidance or anything, and then you did reiterate your commitment to the long-term targets. But Lance, I just wanted to get a sense with all of the moving parts you see right now, are you confident that you guys can get pricing over inflation next year with kind of higher inflation inputs and pressure on the top line from what's going on in the macro?\nLance Fritz : Yes, Ravi. Short answer, yes. Longer answer, there are a lot of moving parts. There are going to be some headwinds into next year. Inflation is quite real. But as we look at rolling up a budget and starting or really at the tail end of putting our plan together for sure, we are confident we can get pricing above inflation.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.\nAllison Poliniak: Kenny, I want to go back to your comment that you put out there about leaving demand on the table. Can you maybe help us understand or quantify what you think that headwind was? And then as you're talking to potential new customers, has the service challenges that you guys faced this year impacted some of that conversion to new accounts? Just any thoughts there?\nKenny Rocker : Yes, a couple of things. One is, I'll tell you, Allison, that's hard to quantify. Clearly, we saw second week of September, mid-September, and it probably lasted for a couple of weeks a dip in our carloads, probably more noticeable in our premium network than it was in our carload network. So Allison, I can't give you a number.\nLance Fritz : Yes, we can tell her where it's at, right? Most likely, we left stuff on the table in coal, probably some left on the table in grain. I think that's where Allison is looking for.\nKenny Rocker: Yes. On our -- I'd say, mostly in our bulk market, I mean, or unit train market. So if you look at our coal business, a little bit in our grain business, probably some on our fertilizer business. And there was a little bit more demand in our rock network. So primarily associated with our unit train business, which consumes quite a bit of crews and resources.\nLance Fritz : And Allison, I think it's safe to say that there was less in the third quarter than the second quarter. And as we're entering in the fourth quarter, there's less again. So the whole idea isn't for all unmet demand to go away, right? There's -- at some point, when you're running the business, it's good to have people want you that you don't have resources for. The issue is making sure that's not performance-based, that we're not leaving demand on the table because we weren't performing.\nKenny Rocker: So the thing I'm encouraged by, and Eric talked about this is that we did have more resources, and we have added more sets in. We are putting more resources up against it. We do have more crews coming on. So I'm more encouraged now we're in a better place. Lance, you talked about it, second to third, but we're in a better place today. And we're working closely together. That's on the unit train network. What you don't see is that our commercial team is working closely with operating on the carload side. So if we are seeing a little bit of softening on the lumber side, we're supplementing a little bit of boxcar and covered hoppers to capture areas where we do see the demand. The other part of that, I think you talked about just overall new customers coming into the network. Our customers face some of the same challenges that we did in terms of hiring and getting some of the resources. So they understand that. They realize that, that was a, I'll call it a short-term challenge for us. We're bringing on more resources to give them confidence. We're putting more capital for the growth. And so that gives us a lot of a lot of good things to articulate to our customers as we're talking about our preparedness in the future.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.\nKenneth Hoexter : It looks like we're opening up a little rough morning here. But thinking about your volume outlook with falling demand but improving fluidity, how do you win share in that environment, particularly given the rapidly loosening trucking environment? I guess I'm more speaking on intermodal, Kenny. It looks like your volume target for the fourth quarter is down to maybe 7%, given that full year 3% target. And then how do you win share if your trip plan compliance is still 58% to 62%? I mean, it just seems like after PSR, we should have been able to bounce back. I get the employees are still coming on, but just given that differential. And then, Jen, can you just clarify some comments you made on the real estate gain and pension? Just to clarify what was maybe onetime versus ongoing?\nJennifer Hamann : Yes, Ken, let me start with that, and then we'll give it to Kenny. So on the real estate side, we called out that we had a sale with -- I don't think I said this in my remarks, but that we had a real estate sale that impacted other income. We said that, that real estate income was $35 million. The pension benefit, that was actually probably about, call it, $14 million, $15 million higher year-over-year. That's something that we have seen through most of the year and maybe not quite to that magnitude, but should continue into the fourth quarter to a degree. But the real estate piece is the one that I would consider more onetime-ish.\nKenny Rocker: Yes. So I've mentioned this a little bit earlier on our premium side. It really is a mixed bag as we look at it. We expect our international intermodal business to be up in the fourth quarter. Domestic intermodal, we're going to be looking at that closely. I talked about the shift in preferences. Now I want to mix up fourth quarter and 2023. Looking into 2023, we've made it clear we've got another large private asset customer coming on base, which is a positive for us. How do you win in this type of market, it's all the investments that we're making. We feel good about the increased ramp capacity that we're putting on. We feel great about the tech that we're pushing up against the intermodal network in terms of precision gate technology, which will be great for our -- the driver experiences there, quite a bit of investment, both line of road that's over there in terms of sidings that will be lengthened. We are putting quite a bit of investment up against that intermodal network to be prepared to compete and grow with it as we look into the future.\nLance Fritz : And part of, Ken, your question is as predicated, I expect you to snapback quicker given PSR, why isn't your trip plan compliance better on premium and on your manifest side. And the short answer is they continue to improve. As we see car velocity, which is now approaching the 200 number last couple of days, that continues to improve. And what you saw posted for second Q and 3Q is much better now in print as we're entering 4Q.\nKenneth Hoexter: But is that what gets you to the 80s from the 50s, 60s? Is it the employees? Is it the speed? What gets you back to where you were running?\nEric Gehringer : Yes. So the biggest opportunity we have is really the congestion that we saw have been working through. And Lance pointed out earlier in the conversation regarding the west ports and the fluidity there. That translates. If you look into our velocity gains throughout this quarter, a big portion of that has been on the intermodal side. When I look on a daily basis at our arrival performance at terminals as well as our departure, those are both improving. Those are contributors to increased TPC. Yes, additional people are helping in certain particular markets, but it really is about the fundamentals, and I see them improving week over week.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\nScott Group : Jennifer, the 3Q to 4Q OR deterioration, is that relative to the reported or the adjusted? And then just bigger picture, you reiterated this year pricing in excess of inflation. But with that positive price and positive volume, margins are going to be down about 300 basis points this year. So maybe just sort of help connect those two comments. And then maybe more importantly, just what's your confidence of improving the OR next year relative to this 60 OR we're seeing in 2022?\nJennifer Hamann : Yes, Ken (sic) [Scott]. So the comments about fourth quarter is really talking about the adjusted, so adjusted here the 58.2. We see some sequential deterioration on that adjusted basis, not on a reported basis. So that's a good clarification. Thanks for that. In terms of 2023, again, still putting the plan together and a lot of moving pieces and parts. Probably the biggest part of that is really what's the economy going to be doing. But we know that we have opportunities to grow. You've heard Kenny talk about that. You've heard Lance mention that. We also know that we have continued price opportunities, and we feel very confident in our ability to price above the inflation dollars. And you heard Eric talk about the fact that we have certainly the opportunities to improve our overall efficiency. So putting all those things together, as we sit here today, I'm not going to give you, obviously, any numbers. But we are confident that we will be able to achieve margin improvement going from 2022 to 2023.\nScott Group: And maybe just to ask it differently, like if we got positive price and positive volume, and we're giving up 3 points of margin, what were the causes of that 3 points that maybe could go away next year or maybe not, I don't know?\nJennifer Hamann : Well, I mean, just in this quarter, we'll just talk about this quarter, we had 310 basis points of margin deterioration in terms of the service inefficiencies and the inflation. So that right there is your 300 points. And so to the extent that we can do better offsetting that, don't have an inflation number for next year yet, certainly going to be impacted by the higher wages. This year's inflation, while we came into the year thinking inflation was probably going to be around 3%, and that would be higher than what we've seen historically, it's probably going to be closer to 5%. So -- and it's accelerated, obviously, as we've gotten here in the back half of the year and had some of these wage settlements. So it takes a bit to catch up to that with some of our pricing and as we're approaching the market, but we are confident in our ability to do that.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities.\nCherilyn Radbourne : In terms of the intermodal business, I was hoping you could give us some perspective on how the onboarding of Knight-Swift has progressed year-to-date, the extent to which both partners may have left opportunities on the table in the first year based on supply chain congestion and whether you think that represents a tailwind as you look ahead to 2023.\nKenny Rocker : We have been very encouraged. I think Knight-Swift would also agree the onboarding has gone very well. Both companies have stayed very close to each other. Sure, there have been some supply chain challenges, but chassis dwell is not where it should be. It actually stayed pretty elevated for some time now. So there could be some volume tailwind as that kind of loosens up as we move into the future. But I can tell you that onboarding them has gone very well, and I'd use the word seamless.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Ari Rosa with Credit Suisse.\nAriel Rosa: Great. So Lance, you talked about the path to getting to a 55 OR. I was hoping you could just elaborate on that a little bit. And do you think that's primarily driven by price? Or are there further efficiency gains that you guys think you can realize to get there? And then on the pricing point, obviously, the labor negotiations have been very public. I wanted to know to what extent that's kind of influenced discussions with customers on how much yield you might be able to get as you think about 2023?\nLance Fritz : Yes. Okay, Ari. So the path to 55 is really pretty plain. It hasn't changed. This year, we ran into a rough patch. We ran the network type. We got into trouble on our crew availability, and we're digging out of that. We've made progress in the third quarter, and we'll make another strong step to normal in the fourth quarter. I anticipate we enter into the back half of 2022 in the 200-plus car velocity. We're essentially there at this point and need to grow from there and then be normal going into 2023, which I anticipate is going to be the case. As we do that, there is, for sure, an opportunity to take excess cost out of the network. Now having said that, we're fighting against pretty significant inflation. You see it in the PEB, but it's across the board on our services and our inputs. We're going to have to overcome that with price, and we anticipate we will. We're confident we will, but that's not helpful on the OR side, right? So you got to create margin somewhere. For us, that's got to be incremental volume. At this point, incremental volume is going to be a more important part of the three-legged stool into the future years. We're set up well to exceed what the industry is going to do. We're doing that this year. I think we're going to do that again next year, and we're going to have to make hay with it. And that's what gives us confidence that we're going to be able to improve margins going into next year. That's the clear path to a 55 operating ratio. And again, I don't think we said it yet today, but reiterating leading the industry in terms of our margins. So Kenny?\nKenny Rocker: Yes. I mean, we've said it as a management team, we're going to cover inflation with price. But just to get a little granular here, our commercial leaders have done a really good job sitting now with customers, making adjustments to the rate real time, again, real-time discussions to reflect the inflationary environment that we're seeing to date. And so we're articulating the why behind the need for those adjustments with rates, especially in light of the capital that we're expending and then also the fact that sequentially our service is improving.\nOperator: Next question is coming from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank.\nAmit Mehrotra : Jennifer, I just wanted to understand with respect to the walk from '22 to '23, I understand there's a lot of macro and uncertainty, but you have the tentative agreement. So you should be able to obviously at least help us a little bit on what the incremental headwind is from the tentative agreement in 2023. It looks like -- I mean, the slide was very helpful in the back. It looks like it's like $44 million a year. Is that the right way to think about kind of on day 1, the incremental headwind in 2023? And then, Kenny, I just want to understand, so Lance just talked about getting to 200 car miles per day. There's still a huge gap, given where fuel is obviously on the economics of moving something by rail. As we think about kind of the near-term volume, the weekly volume trends, it's kind of stuck in this low to mid-160,000. If the asset -- if the cycle times get better, because you're able to get to 200 or get to 200 plus, is there more volume for you to move in the near term? Like can we see a corresponding step-up immediately if we start getting to that 200-plus car miles per day because of where the economics are today?\nJennifer Hamann : Okay, Amit. Thanks for that. Let me start, and then we'll turn it over. So the 22 you referenced is for the first quarter and second quarter. That was before the wage increase that became effective July 1. And so the thing you have to remember is the way that the wage accruals or the wages work is it's a July 1 increase. So effective July 1, we went from I think it was 3.5% to a 7% increase. And so when I referenced in my comments, $19 million was the wage impact inflation, that's the third quarter impact, similar amount in the fourth quarter. Those two impacts will carry into first and second quarter of next year. And then July of 2023, it goes to a 4% increase. So that's how you need to think about that. So 7% increase first half, 4% increase in the second half in terms of just the wage inflation piece relative to that. Does that make sense?\nAmit Mehrotra : Yes, it makes sense, but I'm just trying to -- I'm just -- maybe I'm lazy. I just wanted to see if you can give us a number. I mean, it looks like if it's $20 million third quarter and fourth quarter, and then another incremental -- I'm just -- it doesn't see -- it looks like it's kind of like $50 million to $60 million on a net incremental next year versus 2022.\nJennifer Hamann : Yes. I mean, it's another, call it, $36 million to $38 million in the first half and then something a little bit less than that in the second half of it going to 4%. So you're thinking about it the right way. But that's -- again, that's wage inflation. We know that there continues to be inflationary pressures, particularly in our purchase services category when you think about the labor that is contracted labor. So don't have the full year inflation number, not ready to share that. But there's certainly wage inflation, PEB inflation, but there will be inflation above that again, 5% for this year. I don't know that we'll be quite that next year, but it's going to be much higher than our normal, which -- or higher than what we thought kind of back at our May Analyst Day, which was 2.25%. We're well beyond that now.\nLance Fritz : Yes, oh, yes. Kenny, there was a question in there about...\nKenny Rocker: Yes, Amit, we're -- as you can imagine, we're looking at the economy, and we're looking at our carloads daily, weekly, monthly. But as the velocity improves, there are some areas that we see demand out there. I mentioned coal. I mentioned rock, auto, finished vehicles. Auto parts is another area where we see quite a bit of demand that's out there. And so yes, I think that there's still an opportunity for us to capture more volume in the near term.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Okay. Our next question will be from the line of Ben Nolan with Stifel.\nBenjamin Nolan : Yes. Actually, just to follow a little bit on the latter part of Amit's question there, just thinking about areas of the market that -- where you could pick up volume that maybe you're underserved at the moment. And thinking about the fourth quarter specifically, we've heard a lot about how there's water level problems in the Mississippi, and the barges can't move around. Is it possible or do you have the capacity in the fourth quarter to maybe make up for that at all? Is it something that could in the immediate term be a little bit of a tailwind for you?\nKenny Rocker : Yes. I'll tell you, we've been working with customers. We've been working closely with Eric's team. The short answer is yes. We've been talking to our customers. As you know, this will be incremental volume to what we have today. So based on that, we're working with our customers to make sure that the rates reflect that's incremental volume. But yes, I don't want to say that it's going to be a large amount of volume for us that we're going to take. But what you need to hear is that we're working with customers. I'm looking at Eric, we have a good plan to go out and capture some of that business. But again, that barge market is a huge amount of product that seems to be kind of misplaced right now.\nLance Fritz : Yes. And Kenny, helping our owners understand this, we ship in a normal year grain to the river up North on the river, and then it heads down the river. That's a carload. What's going to happen is the flow of those carloads is going to go all the way down to the Gulf. And so it's a carload, but it's a longer haul, and for sure, we see that demand showing up right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski : I guess, Lance, the 55 OR target has proved pretty elusive for most carriers when they put it out there. And just in hindsight here, looking at what's happened the last couple of years, as you try to get resources out, service falters, and you can't move the volume that's out there. Is that the right metric we should be focusing on anymore? I mean, does it even make sense to target a 55 OR, maybe something higher with more resources, but better asset turns? I mean, Jennifer did mention focusing on ROIC. So I guess, can you speak to that over the longer term?\nLance Fritz : Yes, Brandon, and that's a fair question, but here's how we think about it. We do believe that, that 55 is achievable. We don't think it sacrifices the service product for a number of different reasons. You look backward in the last two years, as you know, there's just a lot of moving parts there that made -- that created unique headwinds that bit us pretty hard. This year, it was about us getting our resources wrong in terms of crew availability and for a number of reasons, the pandemic being one of them early on. It's a distant memory now because we're kind of living as if life is normal, but that had a real live impact on us from '21 heading into '22 when we first got behind. Now setting that aside, your fundamental question is absolutely spot on, and we talked about this at Investor Day. We said just merely focusing on an operating ratio number that isn't the right way to think about our business. We think more important to our business is long-term sustainable incremental margins being the railroad with a leading margin. We think we can do that. Our franchise sets us up for that and then growth, right? And that's what we fundamentally focused on at Investor Day. The reason why we have to speak to the 55 right now is, candidly, it was a target we put out for this year. We thought it was quite achievable this year. And then a whole lot of stuff happened that made it difficult. The other thing to note is we've achieved it in a couple of handful of quarters. And that's not the goal is to nail it once and then be done with it, right? The goal is we think that the business is set long term to be able to handle it. Now things could change, and you're pointing it out, Brandon. But they haven't changed yet to make us believe it's unachievable. More important to us right now is continued progress, get back on track of improving our margins and grow. And that's what we're focused on when we go into next year.\nJennifer Hamann : Yes. And we really -- we think about it, too, in terms of setting us up to be competitive in the marketplace and win. That's what having that very solid competitive cost structure does for us. And that gives Kenny and his team the ability to go out there and win new business to leverage across that very efficient franchise.\nLance Fritz : 100%. And again, I think we got to point this out. We are performing best at the top of the heap amongst our peers today, and I think we're going to repeat that again next year in terms of growth.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets.\nWalter Spracklin : Just keeping on the OR focus here. I know you underline reported on that guidance. And I can understand you're kind of adjusting it for the third quarter, given that you're putting in some prior period adjustments. But isn't the 60 OR, I mean, that's taking into effect prior period under accounting for labor. So isn't 60 the right number for this year? It shouldn't be reported or it's not a number we should adjust. Am I -- I know I'm going to get that confusion, and I know it's going to -- so I want to nip that in the bud now. Is that the right way to look at the 60 OR is the real number for this year and shouldn't be adjusted. Is that right?\nJennifer Hamann : No, I wouldn't agree with that because the 60 OR includes, call it, $92 million. And that's what's shown on that appendix slide for 2020 and 2021. And so that is -- those are dollars that really pertain to prior years where -- and again, it's primarily due to this bonus that we were under accrued. So while I wouldn't take the whole $114 million out, maybe that's to your point, that we were under accrued. So is the piece that you need to think about when you're thinking about repeatable OR.\nWalter Spracklin : Okay. That -- okay. Got it. And then for next year, I heard the word confident a lot. I heard confident about price, confident about efficiency but not confident enough to give the OR guide for next year of 55. And I'm just -- what I didn't hear you say confident about was the volume outlook for next year given uncertainty of the macro. Is that the only thing that's keeping you back from giving a 55 -- in other words, if we see even modest growth next year, is 55 achievable for next year?\nJennifer Hamann : No. Hopefully, what you heard from us is say that while we still absolutely have that goal, the road to getting there is longer. And it would be a pretty big stretch for us to go from again, something less than a 60 when you take out the $92 million, but call it a high 59 kind of OR to get into that 55 range next year. That's not where we think that we can get to. We certainly believe that we can get improvement. And the level of that really is going to be dependent on how we see the macro environment shape up to a degree, and that's where we're still putting the plan together. But that was what we were intending to communicate is we can still get to a 55, but we're not going to be able to snapback into that range we don't believe in 2023.\nWalter Spracklin : And that's the swing factor to volume. You feel confident enough that network fluidity and all those issues will be kind of resolved next year that, that won't be a significantly constraining factor. Is that right?\nLance Fritz: Yes. Running the railroad normally, being a normal kind of operation next year, that's not a constraint. The constraints are lots of incremental inflation. Volume, that's a question mark as to exactly what it's going to look like. So you've got that right. Next year is a normal railroad and basically back to squeezing out incremental efficiencies with a lot of inflation that we're going to have to find to overcome.\nJennifer Hamann : Yes, I was just going to say, as you know, we don't have the access to reprice 100% of our contracts next year. So there is a bit of some timing there as we catch up on some of those contracts as they roll.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kaufman with Vertical Research Partners.\nJeffrey Kauffman: Jen, just a quick question. That $114 million, does that represent an accrual on all outstanding labor contracts, including the ones not yet ratified? Or is that only for the agreements that have been ratified to this point?\nJennifer Hamann: Yes. Thanks for that clarification. It is for all of the agreements, both ratified and tentative at this point because those are the deals that are literally on the table and that are waiting ratification. So that's what we know to be able to take the accrual for.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna.\nBascome Majors : Jennifer, when you look at the cost per employee trends, the 8% in the third quarter and the 7%, I think you implied for the fourth quarter pretty close to the union wage increase for the second half of this year that started on July 1. As we look into next year with 7% on wage increases continuing in the first half and 4% in the second half, is there anything that you can do to maybe get the realized cost per employee below that? Or is that actually kind of a decent proxy for the kind of inflation that you'll feel per head next year?\nJennifer Hamann : Yes. Thanks for that question. I mean, certainly, that's the starting point. But as you heard us talk today, where we will look to end out would be something less than that because we know there's inefficiencies in that and that we're working to squeeze that out. I referenced overtime and borrow-out costs. Those are real headwinds to the overall cost structure relative to our employee costs. While we'll probably have borrow outs for a while as we're working to catch up in some of these hard-to-hire areas, we would hope to be in a position to certainly slim that down and then ultimately eliminate that as well as be able to manage the overtime better.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens.\nJustin Long : Just to clarify that 2023 commentary, are you still assuming that you'll be able to grow volumes next year? And as we think about your comment around improving the OR in 2023, is that predicated on that volume growth? Or do you feel like even if volumes are flat or maybe even down a little bit that you can still improve the OR from the cost takeout as network inefficiencies improve?\nJennifer Hamann : Yes. Thanks for that question, Justin. I mean, again, no numbers being given here today, but we have some good tailwinds as I think both Lance and Kenny have talked to you about in terms of volumes. We've got Schneider coming on, large piece of business. We have demand that we know we didn't move today on the coal market, some of our bulk markets, we know good construction demand going into next year from a rock standpoint. So our expectation is to be able to outperform the market as we said back at our Investor Day. And so if you look at industrial production now, I think forecast for 2023 are in the negative range. But even outperforming that could put us on the positive side of the ledger a bit. So that's how we're shaping things up right now. I'm not going to give you degrees. And obviously, it's going to depend on what really ultimately happens. My crystal ball isn't quite that good yet to know exactly how the economy is going to fare next year. But we do like our setup going into the year, and that's how we're thinking about that at the moment.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS.\nThomas Wadewitz : I wanted to ask you a bit about truckload pricing sensitivity. I think there's generally a sense that given enough time, railroads can recover inflation with price. But you are looking to do that against a market where truck -- the truckload market is a lot more loose. So kind of how much of a barrier is that to accelerating your price? And how much of the book do you think really is sensitive to the truck market in terms of pricing? I guess the second one would just be on imports. Do you think -- I mean, it seems reasonable to think that import, container imports might be down next year. If they're down meaningfully, can you still grow your intermodal? Or is that a pretty tight link just in terms of import activity and UP intermodal?\nKenny Rocker : Yes. So just again, just trying to differentiate the two. On the domestic side, you're right, there's still a few more question marks there. As I stated a little bit earlier, we're going to get into our bids even here in December. We'll find out a little bit more about where the markets are. As I stated, there's still enough capacity constraint that are out there in the supply chain on the domestic side that could firm up some of the pricing. We just have to see how that plays out. On the international intermodal side, it's still too soon to tell what will happen there. I wanted to make sure that I really highlighted the fact that regardless of what's happening with the actual volume, the percentage of international rail volume has increased is coming into the port. So again, last year, we talked a little bit about the fact that we had a larger percentage of our customers transloading on the West Coast port. Today, as we stand, we can see that our customers are now moving more of that via rail. So that's a positive for us.\nLance Fritz : Yes, those moving parts, Kenny and Tom, are hard to discern exactly how they're going to play out. It sure does look like inbound port container volume is going to be down in the -- certainly the early part of next year. I mean, we're hearing enough markers of that. But depending on what happens with our percentage that's coming inland depends on what exactly we see, right?\nThomas Wadewitz : Right.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs.\nJordan Alliger: Sorry, I had some technical issues before. But just a quick question on the auto sector. Is that something that could deviate from the economy, just given dealer inventories at the lot as we think through to next year? I mean, will there need to be fill regardless to what happens to the consumer outlook?\nKenny Rocker: Yes, we certainly believe so. There are just a number of markers that point to it. I talked about the supply of the dealership is very low, much lower than the OEMs wanted to be. Average age of a car out there now is 13 years old. There's just a lot of pent-up demand in terms of shippable, non-shippable, meaning the OEMs have actually produced the cars, and they haven't moved via rail yet. And then just the fact that, again, the part supply, the semiconductor chip, I think that's going to improve here. And so based on those things, we feel very bullish on that auto part in the finished vehicle side.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Lance Fritz for closing comments.\nLance Fritz: Thank you, Rob, and thank you all for joining us this morning and for your questions. We look forward to talking with you again in January to discuss our fourth quarter and full year results. Until then, please take care.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Eric Gehringer",
            "content": "Thanks, Kenny, and good morning. Turning to Slide 9. Our year-to-date safety results are demonstrating meaningful and sustained improvement compared to 2021. Safety impacts every facet of our business: our employees, our customers and our shareholders. While our safety management system is promoting the right culture, our #1 priority remains returning every employee home safely at the end of the day. Taking a look at our current network performance on Slide 10. Our operating metrics steadily improved through the third quarter, aided by improving crew availability from hiring initiatives, lower recrew rates and improved crew utilization. Our hiring and training pipeline is strong. To date, we have graduated 890 employees and have an additional 518 currently in training, all expected to graduate by January of 2023. We have now hired 1,408 new transportation employees, exceeding our goal for the year. Freight car velocity is approaching 200 miles per day, up from its low in April. Even more encouraging, the improvement came while moving 10,000 more weekly carloads. By utilizing approximately 250 borrowed out employees and adding new graduates to some of our challenged crew locations, we have been able to add more coal and grain sets back into the network. We also reduced our recrew rates from a peak of 11% in April to now around 7%. Exiting the third quarter, the network is in a more solid and fluid state than earlier in the year. Going forward, we are building upon these improved results to drive excess cost from the network. Now let's review our key performance metrics for the quarter, starting on Slide 11, which remained challenged when compared to 2021 even considering the relatively easy comparison from last year's wildfire and weather events. However, both freight car velocity and manifest and auto trip plan compliance strengthened sequentially from last quarter's results. Intermodal trip plan compliance was flat sequentially and remains impacted by persistent supply chain challenges, resulting in elevated chassis street times and container ramp to well. We continue to make progress at the West Coast ports as the number of stacked containers decline. Turning to Slide 12 to review our network efficiency metrics. During the third quarter, as performance improved, we were able to remove and stage locomotives across the network to improve overall fleet utilization. As a result, locomotive productivity did improve sequentially although remains below last year's metric. Entering the fourth quarter, as we continue to improve train speed and other measures, locomotive productivity will continue to strengthen as well. Third quarter workforce productivity was flat as both the labor force and car miles increased. Train length improved 1% compared to third quarter 2021 as the team utilized longer trains to handle increasing volumes. We now anticipate completing an additional four sidings in 2022 on top of the 20 sidings in our original plan. This will bring the total sidings completed since 2019 to 80. These sidings are a key enabler of our ability to effectively use our resources and drive productivity. Wrapping up on Slide 13. I'm encouraged by the progress we've made, but our work is not yet done. Using our PSR principles, we will further improve our service product and build a more resilient network. Our trajectory to this point reflects the great team we have at Union Pacific, and my thanks goes out to everyone for their efforts and dedication. To finish 2022, we remain focused on further reducing excess inventory, safely improving operational efficiency and using our crews and locomotives even more effectively. Ultimately, as is always the goal, we need to run the network and manage our assets in a more than volume variable manner. To that point, we are storing excess international intermodal well cars as the expected levels of volume did not materialize while at the same time, to capture demand in other areas, we are bringing cars out of storage. Additionally, to support bulk demand, we will continue hiring programs and send additional borrowed-out employees to crew-challenged locations in our northern region. As we wrap up the year and I look forward, I am confident that the foundation we are building will provide a better service product for our customers. With that, I will turn it over to Jennifer to review our financial performance. Yes. I appreciate that question, Jon. Without a doubt, as we've demonstrated in multiple times, unfortunately, we have the ability to bring down our resources in line with volume. In my prepared comments, I made a point to point out that we want to be more than volume variable. So that playbook is known, and we've demonstrated an efficiency in being able to do that. Now as we think about that and we think about the last 1.5 years to your point, there are three things that we continue to be focused on. Our ability to hire no matter what the market is remains critical. As part of that, we continue to work on how we think about making our jobs even more attractive to the population. So no matter what the market is, we can attract the talent that we need.  At the same time, as we look at resources and continue to be able to balance them, to your point, you will see us, as we've had in the past, reestablish AWTS, which is a way for us to have a little bit of a buffer. It's not thousands of people. It's a couple of hundred people to be able to react both on the upside and the downside. So we have that playbook. We clearly have demonstrated our ability to execute it, yet we continue to take lessons we're learning to make that playbook even stronger. Yes, David, great question. So to reiterate, we set out the year to start hiring 1,400 people. You heard in my prepared comments that we've done that. Now admittedly, 1/3 of that 1,400 have been hired, and they're in the training pipeline. So we won't see the benefit of having them towards -- until the end of the year, between now and the end of the year, really. As we think about looking out at our hiring demands, as you pointed out and as Kenny highlighted, there are obviously questions about the markets. We'll stay close to those. We'll use the same process that we've employed in the past to ensure that we don't fall short of hiring. And at the same time, as we look, we're really focused on attrition. You have a couple of questions that are outstanding with regards to the implications of the ratification with some population of our employees, and we're going to react to that accordingly. So it's really about the markets, what do we need to be staffed to for that and contending with attrition. It's contemplated and always has been contemplated. Certainly, inside the agreements that are still out for ratification, there are questions around additional time off, and we'll adjust accordingly for that. I think the more important part of that is how do we think about that AWTS program and making sure -- but again, it's a couple of hundred people, and it's viable, and it's something that we can rely on. Yes. So the biggest opportunity we have is really the congestion that we saw have been working through. And Lance pointed out earlier in the conversation regarding the west ports and the fluidity there. That translates. If you look into our velocity gains throughout this quarter, a big portion of that has been on the intermodal side. When I look on a daily basis at our arrival performance at terminals as well as our departure, those are both improving. Those are contributors to increased TPC. Yes, additional people are helping in certain particular markets, but it really is about the fundamentals, and I see them improving week over week."

            "name": "Jennifer Hamann",
            "content": "Thanks, Eric, and good morning. I'm going to start on Slide 15 with a walk down of our third quarter operating ratio and earnings per share. Our reported operating ratio of 59.9% and earnings per share of $3.05 includes a $114 million change in estimate related to the Presidential Emergency Board recommendation and subsequent ratified and tentative labor agreements. At a high level, the $114 million charge negatively impacted third quarter operating ratio by 170 basis points and reduced EPS by $0.14. For more granular information on the charge, please refer to the appendix slide at the back of the presentation deck.  It's important to note, however, that while our general wage accruals weren't far off the PEB recommendation, we did not accrue for the [$1,000] annual bonus payments. Core results in the quarter continue to reflect inflation and network inefficiencies as our operating ratio was unfavorably impacted 310 basis points but contributed $0.20 to EPS. Importantly, we did make sequential core improvement in our operating ratio of 40 basis points versus the second quarter. Decreasing fuel prices in the quarter and the roughly two-month lag in our fuel surcharge program favorably impacted our quarterly operating ratio by 70 basis points and added $0.37 to EPS.  Finally, third quarter results also include the favorable comparison to last year's weather and wildfire events, which adds 50 basis points to OR and $0.05 to EPS. Looking now at our third quarter income statement on Slide 16, where we provide both reported and adjusted numbers that exclude the impact of the labor charge. Throughout my remarks, I will speak to the adjusted results. Operating revenue totaled $6.6 billion, up 18% versus 2021 on 3% year-over-year volume growth. As we have seen throughout the year, higher fuel prices are the primary contributor to higher operating expenses, which increased 22% to $3.8 billion. Excluding the impact of higher fuel prices, our expenses were up 10% in the quarter. Third quarter adjusted operating income totaled $2.7 billion, a 13% increase versus 2021. Other income increased $86 million driven by higher real estate income, including a $35 million gain on sale and pension benefit. Income tax expense increased 13% as a result of higher pretax income, partially offset by corporate income tax rate reductions in three of our operating states. As a result of those changes, we now expect our full year tax rate to be around 23%. Adjusted net income of $2 billion increased 18% versus 2021, and adjusted earnings per share was up 24% to $3.19. Operating revenue, operating income, net income and earnings per share were all quarterly records. Looking more closely at third quarter freight revenue, Slide 17 provides a breakdown, which totaled $6.1 billion, up 18% versus 2021. Year-over-year volume gains, supported by our business development efforts and sequentially improving operational fluidity, increased freight revenue 325 basis points. Fuel surcharge revenue impacted revenue 13 points, reflecting the impact of higher year-over-year diesel prices and the two-month lag in our recovery program. Total fuel surcharge revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter. Strong pricing gains when combined with a slightly negative business mix drove 200 basis points of freight revenue growth. Lower petroleum shipments, combined with higher rock and auto part shipments, contributed to the negative mix. From a price standpoint, we have now lapped the positive benefit from coal contracts indexed to natural gas prices. So the year-over-year benefit is minimal. And as we experienced in the second quarter, network fluidity limited the upside for both price and mix. Setting these headwinds aside, we are confident that we will yield price dollars that exceed inflation dollars even with a higher inflationary hurdle than expected at the start of the year. Moving on to Slide 18, which provides a summary of our third quarter adjusted operating expenses where the primary driver again this quarter was fuel, up 71% on a 67% increase in fuel prices. While we saw fuel prices come down some in the quarter, our average quarterly fuel price was $3.96 per gallon, only $0.07 lower than second quarter's average price. Our fuel consumption rate achieved an all-time quarterly record in the quarter, improving 1% versus 2021 as a result of productivity gains and a more fuel-efficient business mix. Looking closer at the other expense lines, adjusted compensation and benefits expense was up 12% versus 2021. This includes an additional $19 million related to this quarter's accrual for wage increases and annual bonus. Total third quarter workforce levels increased 3%. Management, engineering and mechanical workforces grew 3%, while train and engine crews were up 5% primarily reflecting year-over-year increases in our training pipeline. As you heard from Eric, we have now exceeded our 2022 hiring goals. Cost per employee came in higher than anticipated, up 8% primarily driven by wage inflation. We also experienced continued cost pressures related to network inefficiencies with higher overtime and borrow-out costs. For the fourth quarter, we expect the year-over-year increase to be around 7%, in line with tentative and ratified wage increases. Purchased services and materials expense remained elevated, up 23% driven by higher cost to maintain a larger active locomotive fleet, volume-related purchase transportation expense associated with our Loup subsidiary and inflation. Equipment and other rents decreased 1% driven by higher equity income that more than offset increased car hire expenses. Other expense grew 18% in the quarter, a bit higher than we anticipated as a result of increased casualty expenses associated with freight loss and damage and personal injury. For the fourth quarter, we expect other expense to be flat versus 2021 as we are anticipating the receipt of an insurance settlement for last year's bridge fire. Overall, inflation and cost inefficiencies offset the benefits of volume leverage and resulted in fuel-adjusted incremental margins of just 2%. Although not the results we know we can achieve, it still reflects positive progress from the second quarter and provides us with momentum as we wrap up 2022. Turning to Slide 19 and our cash flows. Cash from operations through the third quarter increased 9% to $7.1 billion. Our comparable cash flow conversion rate was 80%, and free cash flow totaled $2.1 billion. Although this is a decrease of $517 million versus 2021, it includes $745 million of increased cash capital spending and $317 million in higher dividends. With the increased capital spending to date, we now expect full year 2022 capital to be around $3.4 billion, up slightly from our prior guidance, but well within our overall guidance of less than 15% of revenue. Year-to-date, shareholders have received $7.9 billion through dividends and share repurchases. This level of cash returns demonstrates our firm commitment to rewarding shareholders with strong returns. Related to share repurchases, we now expect to buy back roughly $6.5 billion in 2022. Although we repurchased shares at a strong pace in the third quarter and expect that to continue for the remainder of the year, we have been impacted by higher-than-anticipated inflationary pressures and service costs. Lastly, we finished the third quarter with a comparable adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.8x as we continue to maintain a strong investment-grade credit rating. In fact, during the quarter, we received an upgrade from Moody's to A3, and we are now A-rated across all 3 credit agencies. Also during the quarter, we issued $1.9 billion in debt, which included $600 million of green bonds, our first such issuance. Wrapping up on Slide 20. With a little over two months left in the year, we are focused on building upon the positive momentum of the third quarter. The operating team is executing on its plan to improve operating performance and capture additional unmet customer demand. As you heard from Kenny, however, markets are softening a bit, and that is resulting in a slight reduction in our overall volume expectations, now more in the range of 3% growth for full year 2022. With more clarity on the impact from the new labor agreements, our operating ratio outlook also has changed. We now expect our reported full year operating ratio to be around 60%. As we close out 2022, attention is quickly turning to 2023. While we are not yet ready to share our outlook, it is important to reiterate our long-term view. Our focus on generating strong cash returns and improving ROIC remains unchanged, and we are firmly committed to achieving the goals established at our May 2021 Investor Day of a 55% operating ratio and incremental margins in the mid- to upper 60s. Since establishing those targets and even achieving them in a few quarters, the environment has changed with higher inflation and a weaker economic outlook. The road to achieving those milestones now is a bit longer, but our road map to success is still the same, supported by our great employees and the foundation of UP's strong and diverse franchise, we will leverage volume, pricing and productivity to achieve those goals. With that, I'll turn it back to Lance. Sure, Chris, and thanks for that question. You did hear right. So the 60% is the reported operating ratio. So that does include the impact of the PEB, the $114 million that we took the charge for relative to the change in estimates as well as the ongoing impact, which, as I mentioned in my remarks, was $19 million in the third quarter and will be likely a similar amount in the fourth quarter. So we absolutely do have that cost inflation. You also, I think, referenced fuel. That is going to flip on us, we believe, from third quarter to fourth quarter where it was a tailwind for us in the third quarter. That flips back to a headwind of a decent amount, we think, now in the fourth quarter. So that's going to be an impact. And of course, mix was a little bit negative for us here in the third quarter. That's probably going to look a little bit worse as we move into the fourth quarter. So kind of putting all those things together cumulatively on a sequential basis, we are expecting the operating ratio to deteriorate some even as we're bringing more volume on and still working to take costs out of the network. But we have those headwinds. And as you know, with those inflationary things, in particular, while we're very confident we're going to offset that with price, there is some timing there. But David, I think it's important to remember, and Eric said this, we still expect that we can be volume variable even with those agreements. So we're going to see volumes exceed whichever -- what happens in the economy, you won't see headcount grow to the same extent. And it could actually give us better crew availability. That gives us opportunities. Yes, Ken, let me start with that, and then we'll give it to Kenny. So on the real estate side, we called out that we had a sale with -- I don't think I said this in my remarks, but that we had a real estate sale that impacted other income. We said that, that real estate income was $35 million. The pension benefit, that was actually probably about, call it, $14 million, $15 million higher year-over-year. That's something that we have seen through most of the year and maybe not quite to that magnitude, but should continue into the fourth quarter to a degree. But the real estate piece is the one that I would consider more onetime-ish. Yes, Ken (sic) [Scott]. So the comments about fourth quarter is really talking about the adjusted, so adjusted here the 58.2. We see some sequential deterioration on that adjusted basis, not on a reported basis. So that's a good clarification. Thanks for that. In terms of 2023, again, still putting the plan together and a lot of moving pieces and parts. Probably the biggest part of that is really what's the economy going to be doing. But we know that we have opportunities to grow. You've heard Kenny talk about that. You've heard Lance mention that. We also know that we have continued price opportunities, and we feel very confident in our ability to price above the inflation dollars. And you heard Eric talk about the fact that we have certainly the opportunities to improve our overall efficiency. So putting all those things together, as we sit here today, I'm not going to give you, obviously, any numbers. But we are confident that we will be able to achieve margin improvement going from 2022 to 2023. Well, I mean, just in this quarter, we'll just talk about this quarter, we had 310 basis points of margin deterioration in terms of the service inefficiencies and the inflation. So that right there is your 300 points. And so to the extent that we can do better offsetting that, don't have an inflation number for next year yet, certainly going to be impacted by the higher wages. This year's inflation, while we came into the year thinking inflation was probably going to be around 3%, and that would be higher than what we've seen historically, it's probably going to be closer to 5%. So -- and it's accelerated, obviously, as we've gotten here in the back half of the year and had some of these wage settlements. So it takes a bit to catch up to that with some of our pricing and as we're approaching the market, but we are confident in our ability to do that. Okay, Amit. Thanks for that. Let me start, and then we'll turn it over. So the 22 you referenced is for the first quarter and second quarter. That was before the wage increase that became effective July 1. And so the thing you have to remember is the way that the wage accruals or the wages work is it's a July 1 increase. So effective July 1, we went from I think it was 3.5% to a 7% increase. And so when I referenced in my comments, $19 million was the wage impact inflation, that's the third quarter impact, similar amount in the fourth quarter. Those two impacts will carry into first and second quarter of next year. And then July of 2023, it goes to a 4% increase. So that's how you need to think about that. So 7% increase first half, 4% increase in the second half in terms of just the wage inflation piece relative to that. Does that make sense? Yes. I mean, it's another, call it, $36 million to $38 million in the first half and then something a little bit less than that in the second half of it going to 4%. So you're thinking about it the right way. But that's -- again, that's wage inflation. We know that there continues to be inflationary pressures, particularly in our purchase services category when you think about the labor that is contracted labor. So don't have the full year inflation number, not ready to share that. But there's certainly wage inflation, PEB inflation, but there will be inflation above that again, 5% for this year. I don't know that we'll be quite that next year, but it's going to be much higher than our normal, which -- or higher than what we thought kind of back at our May Analyst Day, which was 2.25%. We're well beyond that now. Yes. And we really -- we think about it, too, in terms of setting us up to be competitive in the marketplace and win. That's what having that very solid competitive cost structure does for us. And that gives Kenny and his team the ability to go out there and win new business to leverage across that very efficient franchise. No, I wouldn't agree with that because the 60 OR includes, call it, $92 million. And that's what's shown on that appendix slide for 2020 and 2021. And so that is -- those are dollars that really pertain to prior years where -- and again, it's primarily due to this bonus that we were under accrued. So while I wouldn't take the whole $114 million out, maybe that's to your point, that we were under accrued. So is the piece that you need to think about when you're thinking about repeatable OR. No. Hopefully, what you heard from us is say that while we still absolutely have that goal, the road to getting there is longer. And it would be a pretty big stretch for us to go from again, something less than a 60 when you take out the $92 million, but call it a high 59 kind of OR to get into that 55 range next year. That's not where we think that we can get to. We certainly believe that we can get improvement. And the level of that really is going to be dependent on how we see the macro environment shape up to a degree, and that's where we're still putting the plan together. But that was what we were intending to communicate is we can still get to a 55, but we're not going to be able to snapback into that range we don't believe in 2023. Yes, I was just going to say, as you know, we don't have the access to reprice 100% of our contracts next year. So there is a bit of some timing there as we catch up on some of those contracts as they roll. Yes. Thanks for that clarification. It is for all of the agreements, both ratified and tentative at this point because those are the deals that are literally on the table and that are waiting ratification. So that's what we know to be able to take the accrual for. Yes. Thanks for that question. I mean, certainly, that's the starting point. But as you heard us talk today, where we will look to end out would be something less than that because we know there's inefficiencies in that and that we're working to squeeze that out. I referenced overtime and borrow-out costs. Those are real headwinds to the overall cost structure relative to our employee costs. While we'll probably have borrow outs for a while as we're working to catch up in some of these hard-to-hire areas, we would hope to be in a position to certainly slim that down and then ultimately eliminate that as well as be able to manage the overtime better. Yes. Thanks for that question, Justin. I mean, again, no numbers being given here today, but we have some good tailwinds as I think both Lance and Kenny have talked to you about in terms of volumes. We've got Schneider coming on, large piece of business. We have demand that we know we didn't move today on the coal market, some of our bulk markets, we know good construction demand going into next year from a rock standpoint. So our expectation is to be able to outperform the market as we said back at our Investor Day. And so if you look at industrial production now, I think forecast for 2023 are in the negative range. But even outperforming that could put us on the positive side of the ledger a bit. So that's how we're shaping things up right now. I'm not going to give you degrees. And obviously, it's going to depend on what really ultimately happens. My crystal ball isn't quite that good yet to know exactly how the economy is going to fare next year. But we do like our setup going into the year, and that's how we're thinking about that at the moment."

            "name": "Kenny Rocker",
            "content": "Thank you, Lance, and good morning. Third quarter volume was up 3% compared to a year ago as carloads increased across all three of our business segments. Although overall volume was up, we undoubtedly had left demand on the table as we continue to improve service across the network. Freight revenue was up 18% driven by higher fuel surcharges and strong pricing gains. Let's take a closer look at each of these business groups. Starting with Bulk, revenue for the quarter was up 16% compared to last year driven by a 14% increase in average revenue per car, reflecting higher fuel surcharges and solid core pricing gains. Volume was up 2% year-over-year. Coal and renewable carloads grew 5% year-over-year driven by continued favorable natural gas prices and two contract wins that started on January 1. Grain and grain products volume was up 3% with strong domestic feed grain and increased biofuel shipments for renewable diesel. Fertilizer carloads were down 7% year-over-year due to reduced shipments of export and domestic consumed potash. And lastly, food and refrigerated volume remained flat in the quarter. Moving on to Industrial. Industrial revenue was up 15% for the quarter driven by a 4% increase in volume and an 11% improvement in average revenue per car due to higher fuel surcharges and core pricing gains. Energy and specialized shipments were down 3% compared to 2021 driven by pure petroleum shipments primarily due to regulatory changes in the Mexico market. Volumes for forest products was down 2% year-over-year primarily driven by lower demand for corrugated boxes. This was partially offset by positive year-over-year lumber shipments. Industrial chemicals and plastic shipments were up 8% compared to 2021 due to new business wins, customer expansion and market demand. Metals and minerals volumes continued to deliver robust year-over-year growth. Volume was up 7% compared to last year primarily driven by an increase in frac sand shipments, growth in construction materials and metals business development. Turning to premium. Revenue for the quarter was up 25% on a 3% increase in volume. Average revenue per car increased 21% due primarily to higher fuel surcharge revenue and core pricing gains. Automotive volume was up 19% driven by strengthening production and inventory replenishment. Finished vehicles increased by 33%, and auto parts increased by 11% against a softer comparison from last year. Intermodal volume was flat. Domestic intermodal was down 3% due to softening demand driven by a 16% decline in parcel shipments. However, international volume strengthened by 4% from ocean carriers shifting more freight to inland terminals. Now moving to our outlook for the rest of 2022. At a macro level, we will be closely watching our markets to see how inflation and interest rates will impact our overall volume. But here is where we sit today with our markets. Let's start out with our bulk commodities. We expect biofuel shipments for renewable diesel to continue to grow due to solid market demand and business development wins. For coal, we anticipate continued favorable natural gas prices to generate demand for both domestic and export shipments. However, the opportunity to capture demand is dependent on the available resources. And our outlook for grain is also dependent on our service recovery. But as we've mentioned before, we have a tough comp in the fourth quarter as exports were strong last year. Moving on to Industrial. The forecast for industrial production is decelerating, and demand is softening in forest products. However, we expect construction to be a positive due to strong project demand in the south. And lastly, for premium, we are closely monitoring domestic intermodal demand as spot truck rates fall and inventories climb. We expect parcel and truckload demand to remain soft as consumer preferences have shifted more to experiences versus goods. We're also watching the international markets closely, but we expect to be positive in the fourth quarter due to easier comps. And we expect growth in Automotive to be driven by improving supply for parts and inventory replenishment. Overall, we still foresee a favorable demand environment for the fourth quarter. Crew availability continues to improve, which will help us capture more growth and support our business development wins as we head into 2023. With that, I'll turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance. So I'll start off a little backwards here and take the currency question first. Lance and I just came back from Asia here recently, and we saw the evidence of what you're talking about. We're really looking at how the consumer is going to spend their money. We're seeing some evidence that they're spending more on the services right now than the goods. We're seeing that show up in the parcel shipment. And so we're going to just watch that pretty closely week to week. So I talked a little bit about some of the markets that we feel very bullish on. Obviously, coal is one of them. Eric and his team and our commercial leaders have done a really good job of being agile and put resources, incremental resources up to capture that business. On our biofuel market as an emerging market for us, we feel good about the order book of customers that are coming on. We're going to bring on two new plants here in the next, call it, three to six months, which is very encouraging for us. Grain is going to be a tough comp, but we'll see how that plays out. On the Industrial side, housing markets, we're seeing our lumber shipments taper off a little bit. One of the things that I'd tell you about Industrial is on the construction product side, our rock shipments are still relatively strong, and so that's a positive for us. Our metals business has been strong. A lot of the rebar goes into construction materials for highways and roads. So that's encouraging for us. A lot of the other sheet and coil is helping out the Automotive business, which is also -- I talked about that being up. Automotive is up. Dealer supplied at their facilities are low. They're about 30 today. Some of the OEMs that we talk to, their dealers supply for inventory at their dealerships is in the single digits, in the teens. That's going to be a positive for us. The rest of the quarter, I mentioned this a little bit early on the international intermodal side. It will be a positive for us. We've got an easier comp. And then we're going to keep an eye on, again, domestic as we're moving through Yes, I'll start off with the international intermodal and just kind of walk you through it. First of all, one of the things that is encouraging to us is that we're seeing the percentage of traffic that goes on to the West Coast and move to our inland facilities increase. And so again, that means that less of that product is being transloaded on the West Coast. So that is a positive to us. That's encouraging to us. We're pushing up, I'll call it, product and solutions up against our customers in that light. For example, our Katoen Dallas to Dock facility last quarter had its highest volume of West-bound traffic there. Also, we opened up our Global 4 ag relo facility in August. So those are things that we're doing to make the product a lot more encouraging. So keep that in mind as you're thinking about the West Coast versus the East Coast. Then on the domestic side, again, I mentioned and called out the fact that in our parcel business, we're looking at that fairly closely as we're kind of heading into the last part of the year. We have seen the inventory rise a little bit. We -- that is reflected in some of our inland terminals to a very small degree. We've seen the spot rates lower, but we haven't seen that in the contract rate. We'll know more about that as we head into a bid season, which is in, call it, December 4. So first of all, I think, again, it's just a little too soon to tell. Hey, I'm not ready to concede all the tightness that Lance just talked about, might not show up in firming prices on the contract side. So it's just a little too soon to call that out. Yes, a couple of things. One is, I'll tell you, Allison, that's hard to quantify. Clearly, we saw second week of September, mid-September, and it probably lasted for a couple of weeks a dip in our carloads, probably more noticeable in our premium network than it was in our carload network. So Allison, I can't give you a number. Yes. On our -- I'd say, mostly in our bulk market, I mean, or unit train market. So if you look at our coal business, a little bit in our grain business, probably some on our fertilizer business. And there was a little bit more demand in our rock network. So primarily associated with our unit train business, which consumes quite a bit of crews and resources. So the thing I'm encouraged by, and Eric talked about this is that we did have more resources, and we have added more sets in. We are putting more resources up against it. We do have more crews coming on. So I'm more encouraged now we're in a better place. Lance, you talked about it, second to third, but we're in a better place today. And we're working closely together. That's on the unit train network. What you don't see is that our commercial team is working closely with operating on the carload side. So if we are seeing a little bit of softening on the lumber side, we're supplementing a little bit of boxcar and covered hoppers to capture areas where we do see the demand. The other part of that, I think you talked about just overall new customers coming into the network. Our customers face some of the same challenges that we did in terms of hiring and getting some of the resources. So they understand that. They realize that, that was a, I'll call it a short-term challenge for us. We're bringing on more resources to give them confidence. We're putting more capital for the growth. And so that gives us a lot of a lot of good things to articulate to our customers as we're talking about our preparedness in the future. Yes. So I've mentioned this a little bit earlier on our premium side. It really is a mixed bag as we look at it. We expect our international intermodal business to be up in the fourth quarter. Domestic intermodal, we're going to be looking at that closely. I talked about the shift in preferences. Now I want to mix up fourth quarter and 2023. Looking into 2023, we've made it clear we've got another large private asset customer coming on base, which is a positive for us. How do you win in this type of market, it's all the investments that we're making. We feel good about the increased ramp capacity that we're putting on. We feel great about the tech that we're pushing up against the intermodal network in terms of precision gate technology, which will be great for our -- the driver experiences there, quite a bit of investment, both line of road that's over there in terms of sidings that will be lengthened. We are putting quite a bit of investment up against that intermodal network to be prepared to compete and grow with it as we look into the future. We have been very encouraged. I think Knight-Swift would also agree the onboarding has gone very well. Both companies have stayed very close to each other. Sure, there have been some supply chain challenges, but chassis dwell is not where it should be. It actually stayed pretty elevated for some time now. So there could be some volume tailwind as that kind of loosens up as we move into the future. But I can tell you that onboarding them has gone very well, and I'd use the word seamless. Yes. I mean, we've said it as a management team, we're going to cover inflation with price. But just to get a little granular here, our commercial leaders have done a really good job sitting now with customers, making adjustments to the rate real time, again, real-time discussions to reflect the inflationary environment that we're seeing to date. And so we're articulating the why behind the need for those adjustments with rates, especially in light of the capital that we're expending and then also the fact that sequentially our service is improving. Yes, Amit, we're -- as you can imagine, we're looking at the economy, and we're looking at our carloads daily, weekly, monthly. But as the velocity improves, there are some areas that we see demand out there. I mentioned coal. I mentioned rock, auto, finished vehicles. Auto parts is another area where we see quite a bit of demand that's out there. And so yes, I think that there's still an opportunity for us to capture more volume in the near term. Yes. I'll tell you, we've been working with customers. We've been working closely with Eric's team. The short answer is yes. We've been talking to our customers. As you know, this will be incremental volume to what we have today. So based on that, we're working with our customers to make sure that the rates reflect that's incremental volume. But yes, I don't want to say that it's going to be a large amount of volume for us that we're going to take. But what you need to hear is that we're working with customers. I'm looking at Eric, we have a good plan to go out and capture some of that business. But again, that barge market is a huge amount of product that seems to be kind of misplaced right now. Yes. So just again, just trying to differentiate the two. On the domestic side, you're right, there's still a few more question marks there. As I stated a little bit earlier, we're going to get into our bids even here in December. We'll find out a little bit more about where the markets are. As I stated, there's still enough capacity constraint that are out there in the supply chain on the domestic side that could firm up some of the pricing. We just have to see how that plays out. On the international intermodal side, it's still too soon to tell what will happen there. I wanted to make sure that I really highlighted the fact that regardless of what's happening with the actual volume, the percentage of international rail volume has increased is coming into the port. So again, last year, we talked a little bit about the fact that we had a larger percentage of our customers transloading on the West Coast port. Today, as we stand, we can see that our customers are now moving more of that via rail. So that's a positive for us. Yes, we certainly believe so. There are just a number of markers that point to it. I talked about the supply of the dealership is very low, much lower than the OEMs wanted to be. Average age of a car out there now is 13 years old. There's just a lot of pent-up demand in terms of shippable, non-shippable, meaning the OEMs have actually produced the cars, and they haven't moved via rail yet. And then just the fact that, again, the part supply, the semiconductor chip, I think that's going to improve here. And so based on those things, we feel very bullish on that auto part in the finished vehicle side."

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today\u2019s presentation are available on Union Pacific\u2019s website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Fritz. You may now begin.\nLance Fritz: Thank you, Rob, and good morning. And welcome to Union Pacific\u2019s second quarter earnings conference call. With me today in Omaha are Kenny Rocker, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Eric Gehringer, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Jennifer Hamann, our Chief Financial Officer. As we expected and shared back in April during our first quarter earnings call, the second quarter was a tough quarter. Our initiatives to restore fluidity limited car loadings and increased operating costs. Those actions are working. We made solid progress improving the network with increased car velocity, reduced Cardwell and reduced excess inventory. But before we get into that discussion, I want to recognize the Union Pacific team that is making it happen. Our people truly are special and they are the foundation of our long-term success. Now turning to our second quarter results. This morning, Union Pacific\u2019s reporting 2022 second quarter net income of $1.8 billion or $2.93 per share. This compares to the second quarter 2021 results of $1.8 billion or $2.72 per share. Our second quarter operating ratio of 60.2% deteriorated 510 basis points versus 2021. Network recovery efforts and record high fuel prices were headwinds. However, fuel surcharge revenue, strong core pricing gains and a positive business mix offset these pressures to produce operating income growth. As we discussed during the quarter, we understood that the actions we took to improve fluidity would impact our financial performance. Those actions were necessary to increase the speed of our recovery and be in a better position to handle customer demand. The improvements we have made since mid-April gives me confidence that will grow volumes as we continue to improve service in the third and fourth quarters. There\u2019s more to be done, but we are moving in the right direction. Let me turn it over to Kenny for an update on the business environment.\nKenny Rocker: Thank you, Lance, and good morning. Second quarter volume was down 1% compared to a year ago. Growth in our industrial was more than offset by a decline in our Premium and Bulk business segments. To improve network fluidity, we make reductions to our active freight car inventory and those efforts had a negative impact on all three of our business groups. In addition, our intermodal volume was down due to continued global supply chain disruptions. Freight revenue was up 14%, driven by higher fuel surcharges, strong pricing gains and a positive mix. Let\u2019s take a closer look at each of these business groups. Starting with Bulk, revenue for the quarter was up 10% compared to last year, driven by a 12% increase in average revenue per car, reflecting higher fuel surcharges and solid core pricing gains. Volume was down 1% year-over-year. Coal and renewable carloads grew 2% year-over-year driven by continued favorable natural gas prices and two new contracts wins that started on January 1st. Grain and grain products volume was down 4% due to fewer grain shipments from longer shuttle cycle times, partially offset by increased shipments of biofuels. Fertilizer carloads were down 2% year-over-year due to reduced shipments of sulfur and domestic consumed potash. And lastly, food and refrigerated volume remained flat in the quarter, as inventory reduction efforts eliminate car supply. Moving on to industrial, industrial revenue was up 12% for the quarter, driven by 6% increase in volume and a 7% improvement in average revenue per car, due to higher fuel surcharges and core pricing gains. Overall volume was up, although, we certainly left demand on the table as we took actions to reduce car inventory to improve the network. Energy and specialized shipments were up 2% compared to 2021, driven by improvements across various markets, partially offset by fewer petroleum shipments. Volume for forest products was down 2% year-over-year, primarily driven by our service challenges, although overall demand for forest products remain steady in the quarter. Industrial chemicals and plastics shipments were up 3% year-over-year, due to new business winds and demand within the plastics market. Metals and minerals volumes continue to deliver year-over-year growth. Volume was up 3% compared to last year, primarily driven by growth in construction materials and increase in frac sand shipments and metals business development. Turning to Premium, revenue for the quarter was up 19% on a 5% decrease in volume versus last year. Average revenue per car increased by 26%, due to higher fuel surcharge revenue, core pricing gains and a positive mix of traffic. Automotive volume was up 11% driven by auto parts, which increased 12% and finished vehicles increasing 10%, both driven by strong demand against the software comparison. Intermodal volume went down 8% primarily driven by service challenges and fewer international shipments from continued global supply chain disruptions. Domestic volume was up 1% in the quarter aided by tight truck capacity and private asset growth, offsetting weaker parcel shipments. Now moving to our outlook for the back half of 2022. At a macro level, we will be closely watching our markets to see how rising inflation and interest rates will impact our overall volume. But based on our conversations with customers, I am excited about the opportunities that are in front of us. Let\u2019s start out with our Bulk commodity. We expect biofuel shipments to grow due to solid market demand and business development wins. For coal we anticipate continued favorable natural gas prices throughout the year. We know there\u2019s more demand available than what we have captured to-date, so our opportunity to better match our resources to that demand and our outlook for grain is also dependent on our service recovery, where we expect cycle times to improve. But we have a tough comp in the fourth quarter, as exports were strong last year. Moving on to industrial, our outlook has not changed. We expect our markets to be stronger than the current industrial production forecast. Customer expansions and business development wins will drive growth in our industrial chemicals and plastics commodity groups. We do not expect to see petroleum shipments return to 2021 level. And lastly for Premium, we are closely monitoring domestic intermodal demand by truck rates of softness. We expect to see improvements to international intermodal with the recovery from the supply chain challenges and pandemic shutdowns in China. However, we will continue to monitor [Technical Difficulty] we maintain fluidity throughout the entire supply chain from the ports to the warehouses. In spite of elevated fuel prices and interest rate increases, we expect automotive growth in the second half of the year to be driven by improving supply of semiconductor chips and pent-up demand. Overall, I am optimistic about the demand environment we see in the marketplace, as we head into the third quarter and you will hear from Eric that we are seeing positive momentum in our service product. I want to thank our operating team and our customers for working together to recover our service levels. As we continue to improve the network, I am confident that we can capture more growth in the back half of the year and into 2023. With that, I will turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance.\nEric Gehringer: Thanks, Kenny, and good morning. Beginning on slide nine, as we discussed in April, we began the quarter with our service product in need of significant improvement. To recover the network and better serve our customers, we implemented decisive measures to reduce inventory levels and restore fluidity. The chart on slide nine shows the current state of operations. We hit a trough in April and have since made steady progress. While the improvement has not been a straight line, because of continued crew challenges and isolated incidents, the team has stayed the course to build momentum and generate positive results. We experienced reduced crew availability from the Father\u2019s Day and 4th of July holidays as we expected and planned for. We have, however, recovered from those holiday impacts and return to our prior improvement trajectory. We continue to see the benefits of our hiring initiatives and feel confident in our ability to hire and train approximately 1,400 new transportation employees this year. To-date in 2022, we have graduated 486 employees and have an additional 504 currently in training, with almost 400 of those employees graduating by the end of the third quarter. Although, the hard work is not yet done, I am encouraged by the improvement already made. I would be remiss to not acknowledge the efforts and cooperation from all to the operating and marketing and sales teams within UP, and most importantly, our customers. Our network is in a better state today because of these combined efforts. Now let\u2019s review our key performance metrics for the quarter starting on slide 10. The key performance measures for second quarter 2022 continue to trend below 2021 results. We did however strengthen freight car velocity, as well as manifest and auto trip plan compliance sequentially as we move through the quarter. Intermodal trip plan compliance continues to lag results from earlier in the year due to continued supply chain congestion resulting in increased container box dwell and elevated chassis street time. Our attention remains on increasing freight car velocity, which will improve intermodal service performance. Although, the challenges associated with the supply chain will likely persist. Turning now to slide 11, the network efficiency metrics for the quarter illustrate the impact of our network recovery actions. Since the beginning of the year, we have added locomotive to the network, which when coupled with lower train velocity impacts locomotive productivity results for the quarter, declining 12% compared to 2021. As we anticipate volume growth heading into the second half of the year, locomotive productivity will improve with better fleet utilization, as we move more car loads at a greater overall velocity. Second quarter workforce productivity deteriorated slightly down 2% as car miles were essentially flat for the quarter, while employee levels increased. Train length remains flat compared to one year ago. However, train length is up 3% sequentially. The team leveraged train length to improve crew utilization aided by the completion of 10 sightings to-date in 2022. We continue to identify productivity opportunities as we build a more resilient and high quality service product for our customers. Wrapping up on slide 12, we remain committed to the goal of achieving world class safety performance. The improvement in our employee incident metric provides evidence that the enhancements we made to our safety programs are beginning to take hold. While the derailment rates have not yet improved compared to 2021, we continue to educate our workforce to ultimately reduce variability and expense. The swift and decisive initiatives implemented in April reduced congestion and sped up the network, an increase in crew supply will further support these recovery efforts. Looking forward to the second half of 2022, we plan to build on the momentum gained during the second quarter. With that, I will turn it over to Jennifer to review our financial performance.\nJennifer Hamann: Thanks, Eric, and good morning. Let me start with a look at the walk down of our second quarter operating ratio and earnings per share on slide 14. Union Pacific\u2019s earnings per share increased $0.21 to $2.93 and our quarterly operating ratio of 60.2% worsened by 510 basis points. Rapidly rising fuel prices throughout the quarter, the lag on our fuel surcharge program and the widening refining spreads negatively impacted our quarterly operating ratio by 130 basis points, while adding $0.18 to earnings per share. Our operating ratio and EPS were further negatively impacted 380 basis points and $0.02 per share, respectively, as core results reflect the impact of network recovery efforts that more than offset the benefits of our topline growth. Below the line real estate sales and lower state tax rates netted to a year-over-year benefit of $0.05 per share. We close the second half of a land sale with the Illinois Tollway Authority, which we announced in May and then the State of Nebraska changed its corporate tax rate in the quarter. Looking now at our second quarter income statement on slide 15. Operating revenue totaled $6.3 billion, up 14% versus 2021 on a 1% year-over-year volume decline. Operating expense increased 25% to $3.8 billion. Excluding the impact of higher fuel prices expenses were up 11% in the quarter. Second quarter operating income was $2.5 billion, a 1% increase versus last year. Interest expense increased 12% compared to 2021, reflecting higher debt levels. Income tax decrease 2% due to the Nebraska corporate tax rate reduction I just mentioned and contributing to lower second quarter effective tax rate. Net income of $1.8 billion, increased 2% versus 2021, which when combined with share repurchases resulted in earnings per share up 8% to $2.93. Looking more closely at second quarter revenue, slide 16 provides the breakdown of our freight revenue, which totaled $5.8 billion, up 14% versus 2021. Lower year-over-year volume reduced revenue 150 basis points. Fuel surcharge revenue increased freight revenue 11.25 points reflecting the rise in diesel prices. Total fuel surcharge revenue was $976 million in the quarter. Strong pricing gains combined with the positive business mix drove 425 basis points of freight revenue growth, the significant decline in international intermodal volumes contributed positively to mix. However, the usually strong mix impact of year-over-year industrial growth was muted by strength in short-haul rock movements. Overall, the demand environment continues to support actions that yield price dollar exceeding inflation dollars. It\u2019s important to note, though, that our network recovery efforts limited our upside for both price and mix as we only count price if we move the cars. Moving on to slide 17, which provides a summary of our second quarter operating expenses where the primary driver of the increased expense was fuel, up 89% on an 87% increase in fuel prices. We saw a dramatic rise in prices through the quarter, paying record highs is a surged from an average of $3.71 per gallon in April to $4.34 per gallon in June. Our fuel consumption rate was relatively flat compared to 2021, as negative productivity was partially offset by a more fuel efficient business mix. Looking further at the expense lines, compensation and benefits expense was up 7% versus 2021. Second quarter workforce levels increased 2%. Management engineering and mechanical workforces grew 1%. While train and engine crews were up 5%, primarily reflecting year-over-year increases in our training pipeline. As you heard from, Eric, strong third quarter graduations position us to support our network recovery efforts and prepare for future growth. Cost per employee increased 5%, as a result of wage inflation and continued elevated costs relating to network inefficiencies that come in the form of higher recruit, overtime and borrow out costs. For the balance of the year, we expect year-over-year increases to be sequentially lower from the second quarter in both the third and fourth quarters. Purchase services and materials expense was up 30%, driven by higher cost to maintain, a larger active locomotive fleet inflation and volume-related purchase transportation expense associated with our loop subsidiary. We also had an unfavorable comparison in the quarter versus 2021, where we called out a $35 million favorable one-time item. Equipment and other rents grew 15%, driven by lower TTX equity income and increased car higher expense related to network congestion. Other expense grew 17% in the quarter, driven by a $35 million increase in casualty expenses associated with adverse adjustments to older claims and increased business travel. For the full year we now expect other expense to be up low-single digits versus 2021. Although, fuel was clearly the driver of higher quarterly costs, the added expense from our service performance resulted in 69% fuel adjusted detrimental margins. Turning to slide 18 and our cash flows. Cash from operations in the first half of 2022 decreased slightly to just under $4.2 billion down 1%. Our cash flow conversion rate was 73% and free cash flow of $1.1 billion declined $727 million. This, of course, includes the impact of $455 million increase cash capital spending and $206 million in higher dividends. Capital spending year-to-date is up 38% versus 2021, which reflects both a more normalized spend trajectory and an increased capital budget for 2022. Year-to-date, we returned $5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This includes a 10% dividend payout increase announced in May, the third such increase in a little over a year\u2019s time. And we finished the second quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.8 times, as we continue to maintain a strong investment grade credit rating. Wrapping up on slide 19, as we have discussed this morning, it was a difficult second quarter, but necessary to position ourselves for success in the second half of the year. Importantly, we are demonstrating greater network fluidity as evidenced by the metrics and Kenny just describe for you that there is still solid demand for our services, despite some indications of economic softening. For example, full year industrial production is still forecasted at nearly 5%, but back half 2022 estimates are weaker. Against that backdrop, we expect to be back on track to exceed industrial production in the second half of 2022 and produce full year carload growth of 4% to 5%. As it relates to our operating ratio, the first half performance makes achievement of year-over-year improvement unlikely. However, we do expect year-over-year improvement in the second half of 2022 and a full year operating ratio around 58%. Well, our 2022 results won\u2019t match our view coming into the year, we remain committed to our goal of ultimately achieving a 55% operating ratio. We are also revising our guidance for incremental margins, which we now expect to be around 50% for the back half of the year. Beyond 2022, we still expect to achieve our longer term guidance of mid-to-upper 60% incremental margins. Our capital allocation plans remain unchanged, capital spending at $3.3 billion for the year, well within our long-term guidance of below 15% of revenue and we remain committed to leading the industry with our long-term dividend payout ratio and share repurchases on par with 2021. Finally, I feel fortunate to work with such a fantastic team of railroaders at Union Pacific. Every time I return from the field visit, I am energized about the future of our company. Thanks to a great team, we have a bright future ahead. So, with that, I will turn it back to Lance.\nLance Fritz: Thank you, Jennifer. Before my closing remarks, I want to briefly touch on a couple of topics. First, related to our sustainability efforts, we have made great progress to increase the use of renewable diesel and biodiesel in our locomotives. We are currently over 4% blended in our fuel usage and on target to achieve our interim goal of a 10% blend by 2025. This is a critical initiative for us to achieve our 2030 greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. Second is a quick update on the status of our labor negotiations. Earlier this week, President Biden appointed a Presidential Emergency Board and the Board\u2019s proceedings begin this coming Sunday in Washington D.C. All parties are anxious for a reasonable agreement. Our employees are long overdue for a wage increase. We are ready to put the uncertainty behind us and look forward to a resolution in the near future. Now wrapping up, as you heard from Eric, we have made positive strides on safety in the first half of the year. I am encouraged by the momentum that I see building within our safety programs. Having said that, we are short of our goal of world class performance and that is our task ahead. Our second quarter performance both operationally and financially did not reflect the best of Union Pacific, yet we still achieved quarterly financial records. This reflects the great work we have done through PSR adoption in the last several years to make our company more resilient, efficient and profitable. Our focus over the next six months is to again demonstrate our ability to successfully grow volumes, while improving and sustaining service levels. I am confident we will build that track record. These efforts are critical to our success in the back half of 2022 and beyond, and our core to our long-term strategy of serve, grow, win together. With that, let\u2019s open up the line for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question today comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.\nJustin Long: Thanks and good morning. I wanted to ask about the OR guidance. Back in early June, you made an adjustment and we are getting another adjustment today. So just curious what changed in the last month? Is this service related? Is it the economy maybe a little bit of both? And then just thinking about the quarterly cadence of the OR in the back half? Is there any color you can provide on how you are thinking 3Q plays out relative to 4Q? Thanks.\nLance Fritz: Yeah. Well, let me start, Jennifer, and then maybe you finish us up. So, Justin, clearly, as the quarter progressed and as we exited the quarter and came to the third quarter, there\u2019s a few headwinds that either continued or didn\u2019t debate as we would expected. So, one is, while we are recovering the network, we had anticipated the pace being a little quicker, and more importantly, we had anticipated volume coming on sooner as the network improved and getting the volume back is really the primary driver of improving our operating ratio and really shoring up the financials in total. In addition, fuel didn\u2019t behave kind of like what we had hoped it would and there were some other inflationary pressures that that added to it, but I\u2019d say those first points are the big points.\nJennifer Hamann: Yeah. And then, I would also say, as we close out the quarter, you make some of those quarterly adjustments and you heard me reference that $35 million casualty change. That, obviously, is a pretty big swing factor. But things like that, as well as sequential improvements that we are seeing in our operations, that gives us the confidence in how we are thinking about the back half of the year to have that improvement, as we sequentially improve our operations, see volumes growth that\u2019s going to help us produce those stronger financial metrics in the back half of 2022. So I think that\u2019s an important way to think about it, Justin.\nJustin Long: Okay. And on the cadence in the back half, I guess, the guidance basically implies that you go from a 60 OR in the first half to something around a 56 in the second. Do you expect it to be pretty even 3Q to 4Q?\nJennifer Hamann: There\u2019s different factors in both. Certainly, sequentially, as I mentioned, we are going to expect to improve, obviously, you get into the fourth quarter, you tend to see lighter volume and you maybe can get some weather. So, we will see exactly how that plays out. But what we are focused on is sequential improvement. You will see improvement in the third quarter from the second quarter. Certainly, I don\u2019t know that you will actually see year-over-year improvement in the third quarter. We think that\u2019s probably a little bit of a stretch. But certainly when you get to the fourth quarter, we are looking at year-over-year improvement, altogether, then to in the second half.\nJustin Long: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nJennifer Hamann: You bet.\nLance Fritz: Thank you, Justin.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi. Good morning. Just following along with in Justin\u2019s line of commentary, in terms of that incremental, it sounded like the volume piece was the bigger contributor. So I am just trying to understand between service and volume improvement, kind of what you need to see there to get that incremental margin in the back half. Just any more color there?\nLance Fritz: Yeah. So I will start, Allison. What we need to see is exactly what we outlined earlier this morning and that is continued improvement in our service product, so that we can both spool up existing assets like green shuttles, which will generate more loads and very attractive loads in the green world, as well as bring on more assets that can get more loads for us, like coal sets or private cars or system cars. So, bottomline is, what we really need to pay attention to is, are we seeing car velocity improve, are we seeing excess inventory continue to exit the network and are we seeing our locomotive utilization and overall utilization of our assets improve, because that will generate basically what we need to have asset.\nJennifer Hamann: Yeah. Which is more carloads to leverage against that asset.\nLance Fritz: Correct. Yeah.\nAllison Poliniak: Got it. And then just in line with that that volume, I know, Kenny said, there were sort of numbers of volume impact, obviously, from the metering. Any thought -- any way you can quantify what that impact was, so assuming that\u2019s going to come back online in a second half?\nKenny Rocker: Yeah. Allison, the way we look at it and think about it is, if you look at where we were in the first quarter, we were up, call it, 4%. We would have expected that sort of a run rate going into the second quarter. So if you had to frame it, you should frame it in that light.\nAllison Poliniak: Great. Thank you.\nLance Fritz: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nTom Wadewitz: Yeah. Good morning. I wanted to ask about, I think, purchase services costs would seem pretty elevated and I wonder if there is, were there kind of transitional costs, one-off type of costs, you would have good visibility to that improving in second half. Just maybe some thoughts on that and kind of how we think about network efficiency approving, affecting -- how we look at operating costs in second half? Thank you.\nJennifer Hamann: Sure. Yeah. In terms of the purchase services, you are right, it was elevated. One thing to remember is, we did have a $35 million good guide last year. So that\u2019s part of that year-over-year comparison. But as we are bringing more of locomotives on, that, certainly there\u2019s a cost to maintain that larger fleet. You saw the locomotive productivity numbers that, Eric showed, so that really is an opportunity in the second half. And then also, when you think about our loop subsidiary and purchase transportation costs, we are seeing particularly the automotive business come back on, which is a big part of their business. That\u2019s where you see some of that purchase transportation flow through is in that purchase services line.\nLance Fritz: Eric, maybe you want to, because I heard in Tom\u2019s question costs that existed in the second quarter and how they come out in the third quarter and fourth quarter.\nEric Gehringer: Yeah. Absolutely. So picking up where Jennifer left off, the customer focus on most right now, they all relate to that gaining and the velocity that we have demonstrated in the second quarter. The opportunity we see in the immediate future is the locomotive side. If you look back in our first quarter earnings report, we had reported adding in about 150 locomotives. We have been working just in the last two weeks to start to reverse that and be very thoughtful about taking that out. We want to make sure that those get put into our add ready status, so that we can continue to adjust for variability, but also be able to meet the second half growth forecast. So that\u2019s a big opportunity for us, Lance.\nTom Wadewitz: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nLance Fritz: Yeah. Thank you, Tom.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed you are your question.\nScott Group: Hey. Thanks. Good morning, guys. I want to ask just a bigger picture question. I think, some people are questioning the success or maybe the sustainability of PSR. But if you look in 2Q, your headcount from pre-PSR is down 25%, 30%, volume is down about 7%? Is there some potential that you need to get that headcount back closer to those pre-PSR levels to get the service back? And I guess, I want to understand what you would think this means for the OR that we were supposed to do a 55 this year on our way to a lower -- low-to-mid 50s OR in a couple of years? Are those just the wrong numbers to be thinking about now for the OR overtime?\nLance Fritz: Yes. Scott, let me start first by saying emphatically that PSR is not the cause of our problems in the second quarter. But when you look at our pre-transformation to today, the -- all of that headcount change is because we took work out of the network. We run one-third fewer trains, which require one-third fewer locomotives and also one-third fewer people running the trains and maintaining the locomotives. So we took work out of the network that didn\u2019t need to be there, because we were touching cars more than we needed to and we had too many special commodity unit trains running around the network. So we transformed the network took that out and we were in fine shape, were the same railroad that we were in 2021 or 2020. I mean. But here\u2019s where we got into trouble, we ran the network tight and we did not recognize the stack up of risks that were in front of us with COVID continuing to impact crew availability, growth coming on and normal weather events, when you run tight, you just don\u2019t have a lot of opportunity to recover quickly. We got into trouble and inventory grew on us, and we had to take some pretty significant measures to fix that and we did in the second quarter. When you look at what we need to do different going forward. It\u2019s not thousands of employees different. It\u2019s hundreds in different ways. We got to get our sports back. We got to run our Boards less tight than we were running them for a while. And we have got to do some other unique and creative things with our labor unions in order to make our crews more available and more productive without them working harder. That can be done. We see clear path for all of that.\nEric Gehringer: But to the other part of your question about does that mean 55 is off the table? Absolutely not. We absolutely believe we have the opportunity to have that 55 OR as we restore our service, bring the volumes back on, as well as the incremental margin targets. So that does not change for us Scott 100%.\nScott Group: Okay. Very helpful. And just, Lance, your comments were helpful. Do you think getting a labor deal done in the next couple of months is going to be a healthier?\nLance Fritz: Yeah. What\u2019s going to be a help about that, Scott, is it takes off the table all the anxiety and conflict of a labor force that hasn\u2019t seen a raise in two and a half or three years. And you put that to bed and then we can get busy on deals that we care about on property, which are really, really important to us.\nScott Group: Thank you, guys.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks, Operator. Hi, everybody. Jennifer, I just want to understand what\u2019s embedded in the back half guidance or the revised full year guidance, because this is now the second time in, I don\u2019t know, 40 days, 45 days that we are revising the full year outlook. And so I just think it would be helpful to understand, if we look at the back half guidance, how much implied service inflection is there, because Kenny and Eric\u2019s team have done a good job kind of addressing the biggest issues early in the quarter and we have seen a big bounce on service. And so, what I want to understand is, if we stay where we are off this improve level, is that enough to get to the back half guidance or embedded in that as a further improvement in service and car miles and things like that, if you can just address that, that would be helpful?\nJennifer Hamann: Sure. So, two things, I mean, you are absolutely right, we have seen a very good rebound in terms of where we were, call it, from the middle of April to where we are today. So we are entering the third quarter in a much better posture than we entered the second quarter and feel good about that. But for us to be able to achieve these targets, we do need to continue to improve, and I think you have heard that from us, we need to continue to improve the fluidity of the network. That means using the assets more effectively, using our crew base better, getting more utilization out of a locomotives, you heard Eric, talk about that, those flow directly to the income statement, when you think about health and benefits, you think about our purchase services, but then we need the volume leverage on top of that. And so those are the things that we are looking at. You get those markers from us every week, so you will be able to track that progress. But we do need to improve from where we sit today to hit the second half targets.\nLance Fritz: Yeah. Jennifer putting a final point\u2026\nAmit Mehrotra: Okay.\nLance Fritz: \u2026Amit. I think what we have talked about is, with the STB and others, we need to see that car velocity start with a 2 -- the 200 type number in the back half of the year, and with that, you will see most of the other metrics move in the right direction.\nAmit Mehrotra: Lance, just related to that, given how important it is to get to that 200 plus car mile velocity per day. There are a few people out there that have many decades of PSR experience that have seen PSR implemented in not just an upcycle but a down cycle and et cetera. Those guys seem to be available on a consultancy basis. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s scope to bring in somebody on a short-term basis to accelerate some of the progress that you have already made, or Eric\u2019s team has already made on the service levels. Is that something that you are considering or looking at doing?\nLance Fritz: Yeah. Actually, Amit, we remain in conversation with all of the contacts that we have created through our PSR journey. And really, they are helpful, but we don\u2019t learn anything necessarily new, right? The issue is aggressively implementing the recovery plan, which we did through the second quarter, demonstrated the movement and keeping that movement up. So, yeah, fundamentally, the approach doesn\u2019t change and we have got the team that can make that happen.\nAmit Mehrotra: Sure. Okay. Very good. Thank you. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nLance Fritz: You are welcome.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.\nBascome Majors: Jennifer, and maybe, Lance, there\u2019s obviously some uncertainty as to what the actual Union wage increases from 2024 are ultimately going to be. Can you share how UP has managed that uncertainty with your accrued so far? And if actual wages were to come in different than those expectations, when do you true that up retroactively and communicate it to people like us prospectively?\nLance Fritz: Jennifer, let me start by talking about wage increases and what we could see, and then you can kind of\u2026\nJennifer Hamann: Yeah.\nLance Fritz: \u2026 talk about how we have accrued, et cetera. So, Bascome, the PEB is going to listen to both sides and then come up with what they think is a reasonable approach to wages. Recall that our package is going to include 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024. And in 2020 and 2021, the markets were tough for wages, right? And in 2020, wage growth was probably near zero. 2021 had accelerated, it\u2019s accelerating in 2022 and I\u2019d expect it probably going to be relatively strong in 2023 before dropping back down. So we have got a good beat on that. We have got a proposal that we will be talking to the PEB that reflects that and I think at the PEB is reasonable and they appear to be knowledgeable and skilled as arbitrators. We will get to a place that we are comfortable with.\nJennifer Hamann: Yeah. Bascome, in terms of time, so once there\u2019s an agreement and we know what those numbers are, we will recognize anything that reflects the backward looking piece immediately if there is anything different there that we need to recognize. In terms of what we are accruing, we are obviously paying attention to the markets, the negotiations and we are keeping pace with that as we look to make those accrual. So we will true-up, if needed, at the time of the agreement.\nBascome Majors: Sure. Thank you for both of that. Lance, just to double check here, it sounds like you are anticipating at least a proposal from the rails anticipating a lower inflation environment in 2021, maybe a higher one in 2022, 2023 and some normalization after that, is that reasonable to think your accruals would directionally reflect that?\nLance Fritz: It\u2019s reasonable to think our proposal in front of PEB reflects that, for sure.\nBascome Majors: Thank you both.\nLance Fritz: Yeah.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Wetherbee: Hey. Great. Thanks. Good morning. I guess as we are thinking about sort of the cadence of volume picking up in the back half of the year. So, obviously, it\u2019s related to service. But, yeah, maybe, Kenny, can we go through some of the segments where you maybe have good visibility to that if there are some incremental changes in the service product that you are offering, you can see a direct result from volume, because I think service has been improving here. I am not sure we have necessarily seen the commensurate improvement in the weekly carloads. Just want to get a sense of maybe some specific points where you feel like, yes, there\u2019s an opportunity coming here, we just need a little bit better product to be able to kind of serve the market?\nKenny Rocker: Yeah. Thanks, Chris. Let\u2019s just walk you through all the markets here. If you look at our Bulk business, we talked about our grain business. We have had a couple good years on the grain side and clearly there is a lot of demand on the export side. So tough comparison versus last year in the fourth quarter, but the demand is there and we know that the crop is there also, which has given us a lot of confidence. On the coal side, you all see the same metrics that I see in terms of natural gas prices, those are going to be strong, for sure, throughout the rest of this year, probably, well, in 2023. On the fertilizer side, there\u2019s still a lot of demand on the export fertilizer side. And then, one of the things is I go to industrial and leave food and refrigerator, Eric and I have been working closely together to do in a second part of the quarter, add a few more of our system cars and here recently in July, we are adding a few more cars. And so as you look at places like metals, where we have win. If you look at some new business that we have coming on with industrial chemicals and plastics, even lumber is an area that and I know there\u2019s a lot of mixed media out there, but the demand is still pretty strong, that car supply will be there too. So you will look at that and then you transition over to our Premium area, where again, we have got a new private asset on our railroad and domestic intermodal will still be stable to strong. And then on the automotive side, dealer inventory still low. It is still at 25 days. And we expect and we have been talking a lot of our customers that they are going to get a better stronger supply of semiconductor chips and there\u2019s a lot of pent-up demand there. So the way I look at it, I am very optimistic about the demand being there and our commercial team being able to win new business to bring it on.\nLance Fritz: And Eric, it\u2019s all about running the network so that we can capture as much as possible.\nEric Gehringer: Yeah. That\u2019s exactly right. And when you think about car velocity and you think about service, they are tied together. And so when we think about our biggest opportunity sitting right in front of us, it\u2019s really about crew availability and we have got some growing tailwinds, right? We have gotten through the third and fourth most impactful holiday of the year. Now that Father\u2019s Day and 4th of July is behind us, we saw a sequential improvement month-after-month during the entire quarter and our recruit rate that generates additional crews for our use. And then of course, we have got the hiring that I covered in my prepared comments that bring me a tremendous amount of confidence especially because 400 of the 500 that are currently in training will be available to us by the end of the third quarter. So all growing tailwinds to be able to increase velocity and deliver the service product that our customers expect.\nChris Wetherbee: I appreciate that. Maybe one quick clarification, just international intermodal is are something that is sort of outside of your control in terms of whether its customers picking up at the port, warehouses having the wrong inventory is creating a logjam that\u2019s sort of creating some of the issues that we hear very publicly about that in terms of dwell on the dock in LA, Long Beach or something else going on there?\nEric Gehringer: Sure. So let\u2019s back up and look at the entire supply chain on that. If you started the West ports and you are looking at their current total box count, clearly it\u2019s as high, if not higher than it was last year. Well, we are focused on besides just the West ports is the inland terminals. What you want to make sure you do is ensure that those inland terminals can remain fluid, right, thinking about Chicago, again, last year. We don\u2019t want to get to the point where we have got an excessive number of trains holding outside of Chicago. And to be clear, for this entire quarter, we haven\u2019t had that. We have remained fluid in Chicago. What\u2019s driving that is the increase chassis time, which turns into a lack of chassis to be able to generate back to the West Coast, to be able to keep the system entirely fluid. So as I look at the network right now, we are prioritizing correctly so for our customers fluidity inside of our intermodal terminal and we need continued improvement on external factors to keep driving the entire supply chain to get better. But, Kenny, you may want to add something?\nKenny Rocker: Yeah. Just you and your team are doing a great job of controlling what you can control. We don\u2019t have control over their international chassis. And so we are working with our customers to make sure that they can get as much efficiency from their own chassis beat as possible.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay. Thanks very much. Appreciate it.\nLance Fritz: Yeah. Thanks, Chris.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC. Please proceed with your question.\nWalter Spracklin: Yeah. Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. So I want to focus on back on the metering and embargoing traffic and I know your Eastern peer yesterday quantified that as kind of a measure of last resort and very extreme in nature. And my question, I guess is, whether are you being more impacted than your peers from structural -- the structural change -- occurrence of the supply chain issues. And perhaps if you can characterize that relative to your closest peer BNSF, they are going to kind of a similar experience. What I am trying to assess here is, the potential for shear loss once things moderate, and obviously, there\u2019s some customer dislocation here and whether when things moderate, that will come back to bite you at all, I know, CPKC is going to bring on new competition next year as well. So any color on where you stand relative to your peers and whether you feel that your return to a better service is matching that of your peers lagging or are you coming ahead of that those your peers in terms of that recovery?\nLance Fritz: Yeah. So, Walter, you can see the data for yourself. Our recovery since April has led the peer group, the US Railroads, certainly, its lead in the West. So our statistics would tell you that we are recovering and I am sure all of our peers are working hard to recover as well and we are not dissatisfied with our pace at this point. In terms of how we use embargoes, we -- it\u2019s evident, if you look at the STB, we use embargoes more than our peer railroads do. And the way we use them is very targeted to a particular destination receiver that is not controlling their inbound volumes. And when our serving yard for that receiver indicates that we have got way more inventory both in route and on hand, then they can handle in a reasonable period of time. That\u2019s when we use embargo. So we use it more than our peers do. I am not sure why they don\u2019t. But it\u2019s a very effective tool for that purpose. Kenny?\nKenny Rocker: Yeah. I mean, you hit it on the head, Lance. I just want to first start off by saying we make unilateral decisions about how we approach the customers and so we are not looking at what someone is doing in the East or the West. And I got to thank our customers, they were right there with us during our process to work through meter in the traffic. Eric, you and your team did a really good job of us working together, providing customers with quantifiable data for where we thought they should be for getting the excess inventory out of line. Those conversations, I don\u2019t want to downplay it, they weren\u2019t -- that some of them were difficult. I think the tail-tail for us are the results. We have had some really strong wins coming out of RFPs, bid, competitive bids, where we have won incremental business. So when we look at it that way, some of the same customers that we had to have these difficult conversations with, we have turned those into positives and incremental bind. So that tells you that, again, we have a really focused and deliberate approach with our customers.\nWalter Spracklin: Okay. Very encouraging. Appreciate that color. Thank you.\nLance Fritz: Yeah. Thank you, Walter.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So, Eric, you mentioned that the hiring trends are up, wanted to hear a little bit more about retention. We have seen just recently a couple of announcements from the East, bumping up the pay for, I guess, new contractors there or new conductors there that are getting qualified. So is that something that you can similarly do or looking at doing. And then for, Kenny, maybe one more thing in the bucket of things you can\u2019t control? Can you just talk more broadly about AB5 and whether or not that\u2019s going to have some sort of impact on the port\u2019s supply chains and if that affects your IMC partners in any way, if that does end up getting implemented?\nEric Gehringer: Yeah. Brian, I will start. Thanks for that question. As you know, our goal this year in total was to bring on 1,400 transportation employees, and as I said, in my prepared comments, we are well on our way to do that. Specific to your comment around, are you seeing increased retention issues or wash outs? We are really not. Both of our rates would be in line with our historical performance. Now, we have done a number of different things around the hiring that\u2019s helped to ensure that that\u2019s the case when we went back and you look at the beginning of the year with some of the changes we made to our training program that in some cases extended parts of it, that was to ensure that the quality of the training program was exactly what our employees needed. At the same time, even just in the last two weeks, we have offered up a new program, were for our new hires, we are actually engaging them to see if they actually want to go work in other locations and they may have otherwise been hired on and that\u2019s providing flexibility that historically we may not have. So we continue to challenge ourselves between the operating team and our workforce resources group to incentivize our new hires to stay with us. We want them to be that 30 year plus employees that we have got across the entire system.\nKenny Rocker: Yeah. So on your question about AB5, I\u2019d say it\u2019s just too soon right now, and it\u2019s a little unclear on the impact. And you are right on, we have been talking to a number of our IMCs out there, and they are seeing the same thing. I mean, a few of them have some of these owner operators, contractors, but it\u2019s just too soon and a little bit unclear to see what that impact will be.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Okay, guys. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it.\nLance Fritz: Yeah. Thank you, Brian.\nOperator: The next question is coming from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nJon Chappell: Thank you. Good morning. Kenny, I think, at the beginning of this year, there was a lot of optimism on the intermodal side, adding Swift, adding Schneider next year, improved supply chain, tight truck market, et cetera. As you think about on-boarding Schneider next year and combining that with some of the service issues we have spoken about and the recovery plan? Do you feel that you are appropriately resourced to meet the growth targets that you were expecting by on-boarding these two huge customers and given some of the macro dynamics that should be supportive to intermodal or do you need to scale back some of your expectations in the medium term?\nKenny Rocker: No. I mean I want to start off by saying that the management team here has really done a great job of being deliberate about our capital expenditures. We have talked about the $600 million that\u2019s going to help us with additional rail sidings with commercial facilities. And I do want to say that this will help all of our intermodal network. So, yes, we are excited about Schneider coming on, but we have got a strong stable when you look at Hub, Knight-Swift and XPO, and some of the IMCs that we have. All of them, the entire network will benefit from it. Eric and I and our teams are just we have got a really rigorous process, planning process and we feel good about the investments that we are making and the ability to onboard those new customers and actually grow with the existing customers.\nEric Gehringer: Yeah. I will echo the exact same confidence. As you think about what the operating department and the marketing sales department are doing together, the last six months of Knight-Swift, which has gone exceptionally well, that\u2019s our continued playbook with Schneider. We are making sure that we take every one of those plays and applying them to Schneider. I will also echo Kenny\u2019s comment about how we think about investment. Kenny, you hit on the infrastructure. We are also doing a lot on the technology side and it doesn\u2019t just benefit Schneider. It benefits all of our customers. If you think about the work just in the last month, we are now through our UP Go app, we are getting about 10,000 comments back from drivers on our intermodal ramps. Those comments range from ideas to improve, to things that they think are going really well. It\u2019s that type of feedback that we can continue to ensure that we are making our ramps as efficient as possible from a driver\u2019s experience for all of our customers. So I am very excited, very confident.\nJon Chappell: Okay. Thank you, Eric. Thanks, Kenny.\nKenny Rocker: Yeah.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Hoexter: Hey. Great. Good morning. Maybe it seems like some momentum you talked about in the latter part of the quarter. But Kenny, volumes are up 1% quarter to-date here, almost one month through the quarter and with about 1% average growth in the first half of the year, just to get to the 4% to 5% growth, Jen, was talking about, it seems like you would have to quickly ramp to upper single digits, especially given the trend of nearly one-third of the quarter in the bag? So, maybe, Kenny, you also mentioned the drop in spot rates in trucking. Maybe could you just revisit that for a bit and maybe walk us through where we should see that rapid ramp? And then, Lance, from your perspective in your seat, I mean, I guess, we are kind of even something that some of us haven\u2019t seen with inflationary backdrop that hasn\u2019t been around for 40 years. How do you think about that in terms of managing the rail and how to adjust?\nKenny Rocker: Yeah. First off, and Eric talked a little bit about this coming out of a 4th of July holiday certainly puts us in a ramp-up capacity or ramp-up scenario. The other part of that is, and I mentioned this is that, we are adding more resources, meaning we are adding in more of the system cars onto our network and so that\u2019s given us a lot more confidence there. And then you mentioned the spot rates and we have got to differentiate the spot rates that we have seen go down versus these contracted rates. We still see if there is a firmness in those contracted rates and there\u2019s a lot to that and a lot of reasons looming. There\u2019s still a number of truckers that need to be hire and that\u2019s in the tens of thousands. We have seen chassis dwell increase. We have seen container dwell increase. So there\u2019s still tightness there. And as our service is improving, we are going to be pricing and we are pricing right now for that in service improvement, especially during all the tightness that we are seeing.\nLance Fritz: Ken, and fundamentally, you are right, we do need to accelerate volumes into the third quarter and we will. We are confident that that will be happening and is starting. In terms of inflation, also correct, it\u2019s a unique environment, right, when you start seeing CPI in the 9% plus range. It\u2019s been a long, long time since we have seen that and probably most of our management team up and down the org chart hasn\u2019t experienced that before. What we are dealing -- what we are doing to deal with that is just being relentless on productivity and efficiency. Notwithstanding what you saw in the second quarter, which was all about recovery and adding the necessary resources and experiencing the necessary costs to recover more quickly than we would otherwise. But overarching that, there\u2019s just a relentless use of technology and process improvement to get productivity out of the network. And one of the things that\u2019s helping us directly with purchased inflation is the Wave process that our supply chain team goes through. We are on our -- I want to say, Wave 11 right now where we take a chunk of our spend and basically deconstruct it with should cost analysis or benchmark analysis and then negotiate with our primary suppliers and looking for new suppliers that can help us find cost reduction, total cost of ownership. And that saved us hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars over the last handful of years, and that\u2019s cumulative as we look forward. So, yeah, you do have to do different things Ken, and it\u2019s a unique environment, right? And it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going to go away anytime soon.\nKen Hoexter: Lance, if I could just clarify one thing, I guess, through this call. It\u2019s not just, I guess, from a UP perspective, this is not just about employees as we heard about last night from an Eastern Rail. I guess you still see this as a lot of operational improvement that you control, and I guess, from Eric\u2019s point of view, it\u2019s not just about adding headcount. Is it -- am I hearing that right?\nLance Fritz: Yeah. Ken, I think, you are hearing it mostly right. Primarily, we do have to get crew availability, which is about hiring and hiring in the right spot to get back to being completely fluid. So that\u2019s an important element. In addition to that, though, you can see in our metrics, terminals are in generally pretty good shape. Terminal dwell is good and there\u2019s, portions of the network that are operating pretty darn well. We have got to get over-the-road more effectively that starts with crew availability, but there are other things that are built into that that can help like continuing to reduce variability events and derailments, things like that.\nKen Hoexter: Thanks for the time. Appreciate the time.\nLance Fritz: Yeah. Thank you, Ken.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Seidl: Thanks, Operator. Lance and team, good morning. I wanted to talk a little bit more on the domestic intermodal side. You mentioned, Kenny, I think that, you are keeping a close eye on sort of declining spot truckload rates and maybe the impacts it might have on domestic intermodal. How should we think about the yields in the back half of the year as we look at the model?\nKenny Rocker: Well, we are 80% through our RFP season and so the prices and increases that we have taken, you are going to see those reflect as the volume improved in domestic intermodal. Again, yeah, we are going to watch it, but it\u2019s just not showing up right now on the contracted side. It\u2019s still a very tight supply chain. We would like to see a few things loosen up in terms of the chassis dwell that\u2019s out there and the container dwell to help with the volume and us capture more of that volume that\u2019s out there. But, again, there\u2019s still a disconnect there between what we are seeing on the spot side and the contractual rates.\nLance Fritz: And Kenny, I mean, that\u2019s just reflective of the fact that, in our contracted world, we chase pricing different than you see the rapid price changes in truck. So that while truck spot rates flew up and are now starting to drop back down, we are still in the kind of the catch-up phase, if you will.\nJason Seidl: And as we look at 4Q, last 4Q, we were sure that the height or the height of the worry about the supply chain, there was probably lot of accessorial charges that a lot of different carriers on the rail or trucking side was adding on. How should we think about that this year as we look to the year-over-year comparisons for 4Q yield in general?\nJennifer Hamann: Yeah. Jason, I mean, you are right. We had seen some elevation in some of those ancillary revenue items because of supply chain. And as we talked kind of at the beginning of the year, and I would say we still see this today there\u2019s opportunities for that to improve in the back half of the year, assuming the supply chain improves as well. So we are watching that, it hasn\u2019t changed much, I would say here in the first half, but would look for some improvement in the back half. I should also mention relative to yields in the back half, we are expecting a little bit more of a negative mix impact in the back half as we see those international and domestic intermodal loadings to pick up relative to some of the rest of the business group, so something else to consider.\nLance Fritz: And all of that\u2019s embedded in.\nJennifer Hamann: Oh! Yeah. Absolutely. And that\u2019s consistent with how we kind of saw the year playing out relative to mix even back in January.\nJason Seidl: Okay. Appreciate the color everyone. Thank you for the time.\nLance Fritz: Yeah. Thank you, Jason.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Ben Nolan with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nBen Nolan: Yeah. Thanks. So, when you talk about certainly the carload growth in the back half of the year, but then, Kenny, I think, you also said that you are expecting incremental growth in 2023. Just curious what kind of broader macroeconomic assumptions that takes into account and really is it -- are you able to just sort of play catch up on the carload side, even if the broader macroeconomic environment were to decline a little bit or how sensitive would that growth be?\nKenny Rocker: Yeah. I mean a lot of this is not being able to catch up with mixed volume. I mean they are probably some low inventories that we will replenish on the coal side. But, again, the fundamentals for natural gas prices, we expect to remain pretty strong in 2023. The same is true with some of the commodities like finished vehicles and auto parts, but layered on all of these are really business development wins. So I can point to business development wins on finished vehicles that were over-the-road, business development wins on auto parts that were over-the-road. And then, again, same is true with our plastics business and our metals business. These are new business wins that are coming on. So that\u2019s how I think about it when I am looking at industrial production as a whole and where we stand and what\u2019s out there for us to capture.\nLance Fritz: Yeah. Ben, regarding kind of what could happen in a recession. I have been talking about a lot of our customers across the different markets and those that are big multinationals and global. Their overall outlook is clouded by the fact that Europe is definitely slowing down pretty dramatically. China is in a bad place right now and they look to the United States markets and they think that hasn\u2019t happened in the U.S. yet. And the impact in commodities that we ship, if a downturn were to occur, might not be as strong as it would be otherwise in a recession, because in recessions in commodities, you get this bullwhip effect, right, where there\u2019s not just in demand destruction, there\u2019s destocking that occurs. A lot of our markets, there\u2019s not destocking to occur, because they are still trying to catch-up on their supply chain stocking issues. So it\u2019s just hard to say, Ben. We have been really trying to parse that out ourselves. And so far, we think that if the U.S. economy slows down, let\u2019s say, it is slowing down. I think our markets are going to be in a place where we are still going to have growth opportunity.\nKenny Rocker: Absolutely.\nBen Nolan: All right. That\u2019s tremendous help. Thank you.\nLance Fritz: Yeah.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just a follow-up here on the domestic intermodal commentary, look, I think, I should completely hear you on the yield difference between you and the truck spot market. But I think the broad consensus, including from trucking companies is that the truck market is loosening here and well into the back half of the year? So when you said earlier that some of these IMC switches between you and your primary competitor are going to be good for everyone. That implies the potential for significant truckload conversion in the back half of the year, kind of what drives that uptick in truck conversion, the time when truck rates really should be falling in the back half?\nKenny Rocker: Yeah. So, remember, we do have a new customer that we are excited about that\u2019s on our property now with Knight-Swift, and we are seeing benefits and wins from there. As our service product improves, we also expect to insert more resources out there to win over-the-road. We also know that there\u2019s over-the-road business that can come back to us on the parcel side. So, again, if you look across the spectrum, there\u2019s still opportunities out there as our service improves, as we add a few more of those resources into the network to grow this business in the second half.\nJennifer Hamann: And I think the other thing, Ravi, just to remember is, there\u2019s a big fuel delta between rail and trucks. And so, certainly, fuel has an impact on our margins, but it has an even larger impact in terms of that cost for people who are shipping by truck. And then, longer term, there\u2019s the ESG benefits that you have heard us talk about. And so, while that\u2019s maybe not shifting the needle much today, longer term we still think that\u2019s a huge opportunity for us.\nLance Fritz: Right. But going back to your question, Ravi, I am not sure, Kenny, that\u2026\nKenny Rocker: Right.\nLance Fritz: \u2026 your requirements in the back half is some kind of rapid acceleration in truck conversion. You just keep on the path you are on, we get our service product continuing to improve and what we need to have happened is happening.\nRavi Shanker: Very helpful. Thanks for the color. And just got one quick follow-up, Lance, I think, there\u2019s some chatter about Congress trying to mandate one person crews for the railroads, kind of any comment on that?\nLance Fritz: Yeah. So I don\u2019t know if Congress is getting involved. They frequently get asked to get involved in the crew size discussion. Our role right now inside of national negotiation is to make sure that either the PEB addresses the question or they address the question by allowing the railroads and labor to continue to negotiate, which we are right now with our unions that are affected on redeploying the conductor from the cab to the ground. We think it\u2019s better for the conductor\u2019s quality of life. They will be great jobs. And of course, there is an efficiency opportunity there. And so we are going to keep pursuing that. So, yes, stay tuned. I think the next big thing that will happen is the STB is pending a rule that they have been working on regarding how many people have to be in the cab of locomotive and we have got our antenna up on that.\nJennifer Hamann: I think you mean FRA.\nLance Fritz: FRA, excuse me. Did I say STB? I am sorry. I meant the FRA.\nRavi Shanker: Very helpful. Thanks, everyone.\nLance Fritz: Yeah. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJordan Alliger: Yeah. Hi. This may be a little redundant. You have probably answered it multiple parts. But in terms of the volume acceleration to sort of high single-digit in the back half of the year? I am just -- to go from basically 1% to that. Just trying to get a sense for how quick volumes can react. And I guess the question is, I know you have opportunity besides the economy and headcount is important? But when you think about altogether, whether it be the economy, headcount, operational changes, what has to happen like first and today in order to be able to get that acceleration to the level that you expect? Because all the things together seem like they need to happen. But I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just a big ramp and I am just trying to understand which is the most critical components to it? Thanks.\nLance Fritz: Sure. Jordan, this is Lance. So I will take you back as recently as June, where you saw seven-day carloads at the beginning of the month in the high 150s, 160 ballpark in the month at 165, 166. So that kind of ramp can happen, will happen, does happen on the railroad and we are capable of it. We just did it. By the way, during June, our service product was improving through that whole month. So we grew and improved service at the same time. In terms of what makes that happen, number one, we have to have crew availability so we can run trains on demand. That\u2019s not just cruise being graduated, which they are every week right now, but it\u2019s also making sure our re-crew rates in the right place and that we are using every crew wisely and that\u2019s in the right place. Our re-crew rates down, first starts are much more efficient. There\u2019s still a lot of room to run on both of those. So that\u2019s the first thing that has to happen. And then after that, it\u2019s all the pick and shovel work of running a much better network from a reliability and a variability perspective. Right now, the good points are terminals are in good shape. We are launching on time on average, all of our network and what we have to do now is get over-the-road better and that\u2019s really about crew availability and variability.\nJordan Alliger: Thank you.\nLance Fritz: Yeah. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research. Please proceed with your question.\nJeff Kauffman: Thank you very much. I appreciate you squeezing me in. It\u2019s been a long call, so I will be quick. You noted that you had jumped on hiring and raising your T&E employee training a little sooner, I think, than some other rails. CSX was griping last night about how they are having attrition issues after training. Norfolk just put a release this morning saying they are raising pay to $25 an hour and adding incentives? When I talk to rail industry people that are hiring, they say, this is Gen Z. They don\u2019t want to work five days a week. They don\u2019t want to be on call before going out in the field. Can you talk a little bit about how the job is changing or what you have done to be maybe a little more successful in hiring and retaining your employees than some of the stories we are hearing?\nEric Gehringer: Sure. Jeff, let me take that one. And I just want to make sure we level set on kind of your opening. So we started hiring back in April of last year. We hired approximately about 250 transportation employees, as well as mechanical engineering last year. And then we have built on that success this year. And as I reported this morning, we remain extremely confident that we can hire the 1,400 transportation employees we need to. Now as part of the job, I am going to tell you that, I think we are about halfway through that journey. Certainly, the last two years to three years, as we have looked at how, do you attract people to the railroad, we have relied on things that have proven to work in the past. So our implementation of an employee referral program, making sure that we are getting the word out inside of our own families and friends, because those people best understand what the railroad really asks of you. They come in day one, understanding those expectations. At the same time, our Workforce Resource Group has done a phenomenal job being in different technical colleges to continue to draw upon people from there with different scholarships. But they are also inside of that, helping to achieve our goals for minority and for women joining the railroad. Now here\u2019s what\u2019s left, right? What\u2019s left, Lance hit on part of it that certain jobs today, if you can take them from a relatively unscheduled process or unscheduled nonstandard schedule and move them to a more standard schedule. Year one, going to improve the retention of the employees you have now. And two, you are going to offer up jobs that have been different than in the past and in doing so, you are going to attract different groups of people than you may have been able to attract in the past. So that\u2019s the work we have in front of us, even just two weeks ago, we launched a new survey in all of our transportation employees to help them further help us understand our quality of life on the job. So you will continue to see us focus on it. We are not struggling as much as maybe some other roads as you characterized it, but it\u2019s still an opportunity we have to keep at the forefront of us.\nJeff Kauffman: Thank you very much.\nLance Fritz: Yeah. Thank you, Jeff.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Vernon: Hey, guys. Good morning and thanks for taking the time. Lance and Kenny a bigger picture question for you on intermodal. You guys have put forward service recovery plans to the STB that are targeting kind of return to low 60s, I think, on-time performance in the intermodal business. I wanted to get a sense from you guys, why is that the right number? It seems like a fairly, I don\u2019t know, not a particularly aspirational set of targets. And is there a way that you guys can be thinking about that business differently that would give you may be a better advantage in terms of accelerating the modal shift off the highway and on the rail?\nLance Fritz: That\u2019s a great question, David. And, clearly, what we have got in our service recovery plan with the STB is not our ultimate end game and so the number that you are referencing for intermodal trip plan compliance isn\u2019t the aspirational end game. Ultimately, in the current environment, when that number is in the mid-80s to high 80s, low 90s, it\u2019s awesome. And where we are right now in the low-to-mid 60s needs work, right? We need improvement. Now having said that, ultimately, what every customer tells us, what they really care about, just do what you say you are going to do. I can adjust. And that\u2019s really what they want from us. So what we are trying to give them right now is markers that they can trust as we move through the back half of the year and use us and use our intermodal product to satisfy their needs, right? We are still -- we can do huge volume at very competitive pricing compared to the alternative mode of truck and we can do it reliably so long as we continue to improve our service product and promise something that we can actually deliver. Kenny?\nKenny Rocker: All I will add is that we are always looking at our customer success metrics. We talk about it often, we engage our customers and that could continue to evolve.\nDavid Vernon: I mean it strikes me as during some of these questions and service reviews with the STB and customers complaining about service, there\u2019s a big disparity around the definition of what rail services. And I mean, as you guys think about how you approach that business and how you contract with customers, is there something that you guys can do to better clarify kind of what that service level would be and maybe even use pricing to incentivize it, because it does occur to me that there is a large customer in UPS that does get good service, obviously, they pay for it. But most other customers that are complaining about things like service, the ambiguity around what is service and that matching of price for service doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s maybe as tight as it could be. Is that something you guys are working on or thinking about at all?\nLance Fritz: Yeah. We absolutely price for the product that we are providing to the customer base. We have got plenty of room to run there to continue doing that, as you point out, more effectively. And the other thing that you are pointing out is process and we are working really hard right now on business process between ourselves and our customers to be crystal clear on what the service product is and what we can do and how much we can do and then helping customers manage their business around that and managing our business around that as we continue to grow and improve our product. So, yeah, there\u2019s a lot of work around that, David, right now.\nDavid Vernon: All right. Thanks guys. I will follow-up couple more follows-ups there. Thanks.\nLance Fritz: Thank you.\nOperator: Our last question is from the line of Jairam Nathan with Daiwa. Please proceed with your question.\nJairam Nathan: Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. I just wanted to follow-up on a few questions that you already answered regarding recessionary and plans there. So I think in the past your interest figure has been pretty nimble in cutting costs in the event of a volume decline. But do you foresee any changes to how you can adjust your labor given the difficulties that you had this year to kind of to get crew availability up. Do you see a different approach in the event of a recession or a volume downturn?\nLance Fritz: Yeah. Jairam, fundamentally the answer is no. We still -- if there were a catastrophic downturn in the industrial economy, the goods economy, we would adjust very quickly to it. Now having said that, on the margin, like we talked about very early in the call, we would be much more thoughtful about where and how much and how we would make those employees available to us when volume returned. So you would probably see marginally some different behavior, but fundamentally, we have the ability and it\u2019s proven to adjust our business to whatever the environment is.\nJairam Nathan: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nLance Fritz: Yeah. Thank you, Jairam.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Lance Fritz for closing comments.\nLance Fritz: Yeah. And thank you again, Rob, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We appreciate it. We appreciate the Q&A with you. We look forward to talking with you again in October to discuss our third quarter results. Until then take care.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Eric Gehringer",
            "content": "Thanks, Kenny, and good morning. Beginning on slide nine, as we discussed in April, we began the quarter with our service product in need of significant improvement. To recover the network and better serve our customers, we implemented decisive measures to reduce inventory levels and restore fluidity. The chart on slide nine shows the current state of operations. We hit a trough in April and have since made steady progress. While the improvement has not been a straight line, because of continued crew challenges and isolated incidents, the team has stayed the course to build momentum and generate positive results. We experienced reduced crew availability from the Father's Day and 4th of July holidays as we expected and planned for. We have, however, recovered from those holiday impacts and return to our prior improvement trajectory. We continue to see the benefits of our hiring initiatives and feel confident in our ability to hire and train approximately 1,400 new transportation employees this year. To-date in 2022, we have graduated 486 employees and have an additional 504 currently in training, with almost 400 of those employees graduating by the end of the third quarter. Although, the hard work is not yet done, I am encouraged by the improvement already made. I would be remiss to not acknowledge the efforts and cooperation from all to the operating and marketing and sales teams within UP, and most importantly, our customers. Our network is in a better state today because of these combined efforts. Now let's review our key performance metrics for the quarter starting on slide 10. The key performance measures for second quarter 2022 continue to trend below 2021 results. We did however strengthen freight car velocity, as well as manifest and auto trip plan compliance sequentially as we move through the quarter. Intermodal trip plan compliance continues to lag results from earlier in the year due to continued supply chain congestion resulting in increased container box dwell and elevated chassis street time. Our attention remains on increasing freight car velocity, which will improve intermodal service performance. Although, the challenges associated with the supply chain will likely persist. Turning now to slide 11, the network efficiency metrics for the quarter illustrate the impact of our network recovery actions. Since the beginning of the year, we have added locomotive to the network, which when coupled with lower train velocity impacts locomotive productivity results for the quarter, declining 12% compared to 2021. As we anticipate volume growth heading into the second half of the year, locomotive productivity will improve with better fleet utilization, as we move more car loads at a greater overall velocity. Second quarter workforce productivity deteriorated slightly down 2% as car miles were essentially flat for the quarter, while employee levels increased. Train length remains flat compared to one year ago. However, train length is up 3% sequentially. The team leveraged train length to improve crew utilization aided by the completion of 10 sightings to-date in 2022. We continue to identify productivity opportunities as we build a more resilient and high quality service product for our customers. Wrapping up on slide 12, we remain committed to the goal of achieving world class safety performance. The improvement in our employee incident metric provides evidence that the enhancements we made to our safety programs are beginning to take hold. While the derailment rates have not yet improved compared to 2021, we continue to educate our workforce to ultimately reduce variability and expense. The swift and decisive initiatives implemented in April reduced congestion and sped up the network, an increase in crew supply will further support these recovery efforts. Looking forward to the second half of 2022, we plan to build on the momentum gained during the second quarter. With that, I will turn it over to Jennifer to review our financial performance. Yeah. Absolutely. So picking up where Jennifer left off, the customer focus on most right now, they all relate to that gaining and the velocity that we have demonstrated in the second quarter. The opportunity we see in the immediate future is the locomotive side. If you look back in our first quarter earnings report, we had reported adding in about 150 locomotives. We have been working just in the last two weeks to start to reverse that and be very thoughtful about taking that out. We want to make sure that those get put into our add ready status, so that we can continue to adjust for variability, but also be able to meet the second half growth forecast. So that's a big opportunity for us, Lance. But to the other part of your question about does that mean 55 is off the table? Absolutely not. We absolutely believe we have the opportunity to have that 55 OR as we restore our service, bring the volumes back on, as well as the incremental margin targets. So that does not change for us Scott 100%. Yeah. That's exactly right. And when you think about car velocity and you think about service, they are tied together. And so when we think about our biggest opportunity sitting right in front of us, it's really about crew availability and we have got some growing tailwinds, right? We have gotten through the third and fourth most impactful holiday of the year. Now that Father's Day and 4th of July is behind us, we saw a sequential improvement month-after-month during the entire quarter and our recruit rate that generates additional crews for our use. And then of course, we have got the hiring that I covered in my prepared comments that bring me a tremendous amount of confidence especially because 400 of the 500 that are currently in training will be available to us by the end of the third quarter. So all growing tailwinds to be able to increase velocity and deliver the service product that our customers expect. Sure. So let's back up and look at the entire supply chain on that. If you started the West ports and you are looking at their current total box count, clearly it's as high, if not higher than it was last year. Well, we are focused on besides just the West ports is the inland terminals. What you want to make sure you do is ensure that those inland terminals can remain fluid, right, thinking about Chicago, again, last year. We don't want to get to the point where we have got an excessive number of trains holding outside of Chicago. And to be clear, for this entire quarter, we haven't had that. We have remained fluid in Chicago. What's driving that is the increase chassis time, which turns into a lack of chassis to be able to generate back to the West Coast, to be able to keep the system entirely fluid. So as I look at the network right now, we are prioritizing correctly so for our customers fluidity inside of our intermodal terminal and we need continued improvement on external factors to keep driving the entire supply chain to get better. But, Kenny, you may want to add something? Yeah. Brian, I will start. Thanks for that question. As you know, our goal this year in total was to bring on 1,400 transportation employees, and as I said, in my prepared comments, we are well on our way to do that. Specific to your comment around, are you seeing increased retention issues or wash outs? We are really not. Both of our rates would be in line with our historical performance. Now, we have done a number of different things around the hiring that's helped to ensure that that's the case when we went back and you look at the beginning of the year with some of the changes we made to our training program that in some cases extended parts of it, that was to ensure that the quality of the training program was exactly what our employees needed. At the same time, even just in the last two weeks, we have offered up a new program, were for our new hires, we are actually engaging them to see if they actually want to go work in other locations and they may have otherwise been hired on and that's providing flexibility that historically we may not have. So we continue to challenge ourselves between the operating team and our workforce resources group to incentivize our new hires to stay with us. We want them to be that 30 year plus employees that we have got across the entire system. Yeah. I will echo the exact same confidence. As you think about what the operating department and the marketing sales department are doing together, the last six months of Knight-Swift, which has gone exceptionally well, that's our continued playbook with Schneider. We are making sure that we take every one of those plays and applying them to Schneider. I will also echo Kenny's comment about how we think about investment. Kenny, you hit on the infrastructure. We are also doing a lot on the technology side and it doesn't just benefit Schneider. It benefits all of our customers. If you think about the work just in the last month, we are now through our UP Go app, we are getting about 10,000 comments back from drivers on our intermodal ramps. Those comments range from ideas to improve, to things that they think are going really well. It's that type of feedback that we can continue to ensure that we are making our ramps as efficient as possible from a driver's experience for all of our customers. So I am very excited, very confident. Sure. Jeff, let me take that one. And I just want to make sure we level set on kind of your opening. So we started hiring back in April of last year. We hired approximately about 250 transportation employees, as well as mechanical engineering last year. And then we have built on that success this year. And as I reported this morning, we remain extremely confident that we can hire the 1,400 transportation employees we need to. Now as part of the job, I am going to tell you that, I think we are about halfway through that journey. Certainly, the last two years to three years, as we have looked at how, do you attract people to the railroad, we have relied on things that have proven to work in the past.

            "name": "Jennifer Hamann",
            "content": "Thanks, Eric, and good morning. Let me start with a look at the walk down of our second quarter operating ratio and earnings per share on slide 14. Union Pacific's earnings per share increased $0.21 to $2.93 and our quarterly operating ratio of 60.2% worsened by 510 basis points. Rapidly rising fuel prices throughout the quarter, the lag on our fuel surcharge program and the widening refining spreads negatively impacted our quarterly operating ratio by 130 basis points, while adding $0.18 to earnings per share. Our operating ratio and EPS were further negatively impacted 380 basis points and $0.02 per share, respectively, as core results reflect the impact of network recovery efforts that more than offset the benefits of our topline growth. Below the line real estate sales and lower state tax rates netted to a year-over-year benefit of $0.05 per share. We close the second half of a land sale with the Illinois Tollway Authority, which we announced in May and then the State of Nebraska changed its corporate tax rate in the quarter. Looking now at our second quarter income statement on slide 15. Operating revenue totaled $6.3 billion, up 14% versus 2021 on a 1% year-over-year volume decline. Operating expense increased 25% to $3.8 billion. Excluding the impact of higher fuel prices expenses were up 11% in the quarter. Second quarter operating income was $2.5 billion, a 1% increase versus last year. Interest expense increased 12% compared to 2021, reflecting higher debt levels. Income tax decrease 2% due to the Nebraska corporate tax rate reduction I just mentioned and contributing to lower second quarter effective tax rate. Net income of $1.8 billion, increased 2% versus 2021, which when combined with share repurchases resulted in earnings per share up 8% to $2.93. Looking more closely at second quarter revenue, slide 16 provides the breakdown of our freight revenue, which totaled $5.8 billion, up 14% versus 2021. Lower year-over-year volume reduced revenue 150 basis points. Fuel surcharge revenue increased freight revenue 11.25 points reflecting the rise in diesel prices. Total fuel surcharge revenue was $976 million in the quarter. Strong pricing gains combined with the positive business mix drove 425 basis points of freight revenue growth, the significant decline in international intermodal volumes contributed positively to mix. However, the usually strong mix impact of year-over-year industrial growth was muted by strength in short-haul rock movements. Overall, the demand environment continues to support actions that yield price dollar exceeding inflation dollars. It's important to note, though, that our network recovery efforts limited our upside for both price and mix as we only count price if we move the cars. Moving on to slide 17, which provides a summary of our second quarter operating expenses where the primary driver of the increased expense was fuel, up 89% on an 87% increase in fuel prices. We saw a dramatic rise in prices through the quarter, paying record highs is a surged from an average of $3.71 per gallon in April to $4.34 per gallon in June. Our fuel consumption rate was relatively flat compared to 2021, as negative productivity was partially offset by a more fuel efficient business mix. Looking further at the expense lines, compensation and benefits expense was up 7% versus 2021. Second quarter workforce levels increased 2%. Management engineering and mechanical workforces grew 1%. While train and engine crews were up 5%, primarily reflecting year-over-year increases in our training pipeline. As you heard from, Eric, strong third quarter graduations position us to support our network recovery efforts and prepare for future growth. Cost per employee increased 5%, as a result of wage inflation and continued elevated costs relating to network inefficiencies that come in the form of higher recruit, overtime and borrow out costs. For the balance of the year, we expect year-over-year increases to be sequentially lower from the second quarter in both the third and fourth quarters. Purchase services and materials expense was up 30%, driven by higher cost to maintain, a larger active locomotive fleet inflation and volume-related purchase transportation expense associated with our loop subsidiary. We also had an unfavorable comparison in the quarter versus 2021, where we called out a $35 million favorable one-time item. Equipment and other rents grew 15%, driven by lower TTX equity income and increased car higher expense related to network congestion. Other expense grew 17% in the quarter, driven by a $35 million increase in casualty expenses associated with adverse adjustments to older claims and increased business travel. For the full year we now expect other expense to be up low-single digits versus 2021. Although, fuel was clearly the driver of higher quarterly costs, the added expense from our service performance resulted in 69% fuel adjusted detrimental margins. Turning to slide 18 and our cash flows. Cash from operations in the first half of 2022 decreased slightly to just under $4.2 billion down 1%. Our cash flow conversion rate was 73% and free cash flow of $1.1 billion declined $727 million. This, of course, includes the impact of $455 million increase cash capital spending and $206 million in higher dividends. Capital spending year-to-date is up 38% versus 2021, which reflects both a more normalized spend trajectory and an increased capital budget for 2022. Year-to-date, we returned $5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This includes a 10% dividend payout increase announced in May, the third such increase in a little over a year's time. And we finished the second quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.8 times, as we continue to maintain a strong investment grade credit rating. Wrapping up on slide 19, as we have discussed this morning, it was a difficult second quarter, but necessary to position ourselves for success in the second half of the year. Importantly, we are demonstrating greater network fluidity as evidenced by the metrics and Kenny just describe for you that there is still solid demand for our services, despite some indications of economic softening. For example, full year industrial production is still forecasted at nearly 5%, but back half 2022 estimates are weaker. Against that backdrop, we expect to be back on track to exceed industrial production in the second half of 2022 and produce full year carload growth of 4% to 5%. As it relates to our operating ratio, the first half performance makes achievement of year-over-year improvement unlikely. However, we do expect year-over-year improvement in the second half of 2022 and a full year operating ratio around 58%. Well, our 2022 results won't match our view coming into the year, we remain committed to our goal of ultimately achieving a 55% operating ratio. We are also revising our guidance for incremental margins, which we now expect to be around 50% for the back half of the year. Beyond 2022, we still expect to achieve our longer term guidance of mid-to-upper 60% incremental margins. Our capital allocation plans remain unchanged, capital spending at $3.3 billion for the year, well within our long-term guidance of below 15% of revenue and we remain committed to leading the industry with our long-term dividend payout ratio and share repurchases on par with 2021. Finally, I feel fortunate to work with such a fantastic team of railroaders at Union Pacific. Every time I return from the field visit, I am energized about the future of our company. Thanks to a great team, we have a bright future ahead. So, with that, I will turn it back to Lance. Yeah. And then, I would also say, as we close out the quarter, you make some of those quarterly adjustments and you heard me reference that $35 million casualty change. That, obviously, is a pretty big swing factor. But things like that, as well as sequential improvements that we are seeing in our operations, that gives us the confidence in how we are thinking about the back half of the year to have that improvement, as we sequentially improve our operations, see volumes growth that's going to help us produce those stronger financial metrics in the back half of 2022. So I think that's an important way to think about it, Justin. There's different factors in both. Certainly, sequentially, as I mentioned, we are going to expect to improve, obviously, you get into the fourth quarter, you tend to see lighter volume and you maybe can get some weather. So, we will see exactly how that plays out. But what we are focused on is sequential improvement. You will see improvement in the third quarter from the second quarter. Certainly, I don't know that you will actually see year-over-year improvement in the third quarter. We think that's probably a little bit of a stretch. But certainly when you get to the fourth quarter, we are looking at year-over-year improvement, altogether, then to in the second half. You bet. Yeah. Which is more carloads to leverage against that asset. Sure. Yeah. In terms of the purchase services, you are right, it was elevated. One thing to remember is, we did have a $35 million good guide last year. So that's part of that year-over-year comparison. But as we are bringing more of locomotives on, that, certainly there's a cost to maintain that larger fleet. You saw the locomotive productivity numbers that, Eric showed, so that really is an opportunity in the second half. And then also, when you think about our loop subsidiary and purchase transportation costs, we are seeing particularly the automotive business come back on, which is a big part of their business. That's where you see some of that purchase transportation flow through is in that purchase services line. Sure. So, two things, I mean, you are absolutely right, we have seen a very good rebound in terms of where we were, call it, from the middle of April to where we are today. So we are entering the third quarter in a much better posture than we entered the second quarter and feel good about that. But for us to be able to achieve these targets, we do need to continue to improve, and I think you have heard that from us, we need to continue to improve the fluidity of the network. That means using the assets more effectively, using our crew base better, getting more utilization out of a locomotives, you heard Eric, talk about that, those flow directly to the income statement, when you think about health and benefits, you think about our purchase services, but then we need the volume leverage on top of that. And so those are the things that we are looking at. You get those markers from us every week, so you will be able to track that progress. But we do need to improve from where we sit today to hit the second half targets. Yeah. Yeah. Bascome, in terms of time, so once there's an agreement and we know what those numbers are, we will recognize anything that reflects the backward looking piece immediately if there is anything different there that we need to recognize. In terms of what we are accruing, we are obviously paying attention to the markets, the negotiations and we are keeping pace with that as we look to make those accrual. So we will true-up, if needed, at the time of the agreement. Yeah. Jason, I mean, you are right. We had seen some elevation in some of those ancillary revenue items because of supply chain. And as we talked kind of at the beginning of the year, and I would say we still see this today there's opportunities for that to improve in the back half of the year, assuming the supply chain improves as well. So we are watching that, it hasn't changed much, I would say here in the first half, but would look for some improvement in the back half. I should also mention relative to yields in the back half, we are expecting a little bit more of a negative mix impact in the back half as we see those international and domestic intermodal loadings to pick up relative to some of the rest of the business group, so something else to consider. Oh! Yeah. Absolutely. And that's consistent with how we kind of saw the year playing out relative to mix even back in January. And I think the other thing, Ravi, just to remember is, there's a big fuel delta between rail and trucks. And so, certainly, fuel has an impact on our margins, but it has an even larger impact in terms of that cost for people who are shipping by truck. And then, longer term, there's the ESG benefits that you have heard us talk about. And so, while that's maybe not shifting the needle much today, longer term we still think that's a huge opportunity for us. I think you mean FRA."

            "content": "Thank you, Lance, and good morning. Second quarter volume was down 1% compared to a year ago. Growth in our industrial was more than offset by a decline in our Premium and Bulk business segments. To improve network fluidity, we make reductions to our active freight car inventory and those efforts had a negative impact on all three of our business groups. In addition, our intermodal volume was down due to continued global supply chain disruptions. Freight revenue was up 14%, driven by higher fuel surcharges, strong pricing gains and a positive mix. Let's take a closer look at each of these business groups. Starting with Bulk, revenue for the quarter was up 10% compared to last year, driven by a 12% increase in average revenue per car, reflecting higher fuel surcharges and solid core pricing gains. Volume was down 1% year-over-year. Coal and renewable carloads grew 2% year-over-year driven by continued favorable natural gas prices and two new contracts wins that started on January 1st. Grain and grain products volume was down 4% due to fewer grain shipments from longer shuttle cycle times, partially offset by increased shipments of biofuels. Fertilizer carloads were down 2% year-over-year due to reduced shipments of sulfur and domestic consumed potash. And lastly, food and refrigerated volume remained flat in the quarter, as inventory reduction efforts eliminate car supply. Moving on to industrial, industrial revenue was up 12% for the quarter, driven by 6% increase in volume and a 7% improvement in average revenue per car, due to higher fuel surcharges and core pricing gains. Overall volume was up, although, we certainly left demand on the table as we took actions to reduce car inventory to improve the network. Energy and specialized shipments were up 2% compared to 2021, driven by improvements across various markets, partially offset by fewer petroleum shipments. Volume for forest products was down 2% year-over-year, primarily driven by our service challenges, although overall demand for forest products remain steady in the quarter. Industrial chemicals and plastics shipments were up 3% year-over-year, due to new business winds and demand within the plastics market. Metals and minerals volumes continue to deliver year-over-year growth. Volume was up 3% compared to last year, primarily driven by growth in construction materials and increase in frac sand shipments and metals business development. Turning to Premium, revenue for the quarter was up 19% on a 5% decrease in volume versus last year. Average revenue per car increased by 26%, due to higher fuel surcharge revenue, core pricing gains and a positive mix of traffic. Automotive volume was up 11% driven by auto parts, which increased 12% and finished vehicles increasing 10%, both driven by strong demand against the software comparison. Intermodal volume went down 8% primarily driven by service challenges and fewer international shipments from continued global supply chain disruptions. Domestic volume was up 1% in the quarter aided by tight truck capacity and private asset growth, offsetting weaker parcel shipments. Now moving to our outlook for the back half of 2022. At a macro level, we will be closely watching our markets to see how rising inflation and interest rates will impact our overall volume. But based on our conversations with customers, I am excited about the opportunities that are in front of us. Let's start out with our Bulk commodity. We expect biofuel shipments to grow due to solid market demand and business development wins. For coal we anticipate continued favorable natural gas prices throughout the year. We know there's more demand available than what we have captured to-date, so our opportunity to better match our resources to that demand and our outlook for grain is also dependent on our service recovery, where we expect cycle times to improve. But we have a tough comp in the fourth quarter, as exports were strong last year. Moving on to industrial, our outlook has not changed. We expect our markets to be stronger than the current industrial production forecast. Customer expansions and business development wins will drive growth in our industrial chemicals and plastics commodity groups. We do not expect to see petroleum shipments return to 2021 level. And lastly for Premium, we are closely monitoring domestic intermodal demand by truck rates of softness. We expect to see improvements to international intermodal with the recovery from the supply chain challenges and pandemic shutdowns in China. However, we will continue to monitor [Technical Difficulty] we maintain fluidity throughout the entire supply chain from the ports to the warehouses. In spite of elevated fuel prices and interest rate increases, we expect automotive growth in the second half of the year to be driven by improving supply of semiconductor chips and pent-up demand. Overall, I am optimistic about the demand environment we see in the marketplace, as we head into the third quarter and you will hear from Eric that we are seeing positive momentum in our service product. I want to thank our operating team and our customers for working together to recover our service levels. As we continue to improve the network, I am confident that we can capture more growth in the back half of the year and into 2023. With that, I will turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance. Yeah. Allison, the way we look at it and think about it is, if you look at where we were in the first quarter, we were up, call it, 4%. We would have expected that sort of a run rate going into the second quarter. So if you had to frame it, you should frame it in that light. Yeah. Thanks, Chris. Let's just walk you through all the markets here. If you look at our Bulk business, we talked about our grain business. We have had a couple good years on the grain side and clearly there is a lot of demand on the export side. So tough comparison versus last year in the fourth quarter, but the demand is there and we know that the crop is there also, which has given us a lot of confidence. On the coal side, you all see the same metrics that I see in terms of natural gas prices, those are going to be strong, for sure, throughout the rest of this year, probably, well, in 2023. On the fertilizer side, there's still a lot of demand on the export fertilizer side. And then, one of the things is I go to industrial and leave food and refrigerator, Eric and I have been working closely together to do in a second part of the quarter, add a few more of our system cars and here recently in July, we are adding a few more cars. And so as you look at places like metals, where we have win. If you look at some new business that we have coming on with industrial chemicals and plastics, even lumber is an area that and I know there's a lot of mixed media out there, but the demand is still pretty strong, that car supply will be there too. So you will look at that and then you transition over to our Premium area, where again, we have got a new private asset on our railroad and domestic intermodal will still be stable to strong. And then on the automotive side, dealer inventory still low. It is still at 25 days. And we expect and we have been talking a lot of our customers that they are going to get a better stronger supply of semiconductor chips and there's a lot of pent-up demand there. So the way I look at it, I am very optimistic about the demand being there and our commercial team being able to win new business to bring it on. Yeah. Just you and your team are doing a great job of controlling what you can control. We don't have control over their international chassis. And so we are working with our customers to make sure that they can get as much efficiency from their own chassis beat as possible. Yeah. I mean, you hit it on the head, Lance. I just want to first start off by saying we make unilateral decisions about how we approach the customers and so we are not looking at what someone is doing in the East or the West. And I got to thank our customers, they were right there with us during our process to work through meter in the traffic. Eric, you and your team did a really good job of us working together, providing customers with quantifiable data for where we thought they should be for getting the excess inventory out of line. Those conversations, I don't want to downplay it, they weren't -- that some of them were difficult. I think the tail-tail for us are the results. We have had some really strong wins coming out of RFPs, bid, competitive bids, where we have won incremental business. So when we look at it that way, some of the same customers that we had to have these difficult conversations with, we have turned those into positives and incremental bind. So that tells you that, again, we have a really focused and deliberate approach with our customers. Yeah. So on your question about AB5, I'd say it's just too soon right now, and it's a little unclear on the impact. And you are right on, we have been talking to a number of our IMCs out there, and they are seeing the same thing. I mean, a few of them have some of these owner operators, contractors, but it's just too soon and a little bit unclear to see what that impact will be. No. I mean I want to start off by saying that the management team here has really done a great job of being deliberate about our capital expenditures. We have talked about the $600 million that's going to help us with additional rail sidings with commercial facilities. And I do want to say that this will help all of our intermodal network. So, yes, we are excited about Schneider coming on, but we have got a strong stable when you look at Hub, Knight-Swift and XPO, and some of the IMCs that we have. All of them, the entire network will benefit from it. Eric and I and our teams are just we have got a really rigorous process, planning process and we feel good about the investments that we are making and the ability to onboard those new customers and actually grow with the existing customers. Yeah. Yeah. First off, and Eric talked a little bit about this coming out of a 4th of July holiday certainly puts us in a ramp-up capacity or ramp-up scenario. The other part of that is, and I mentioned this is that, we are adding more resources, meaning we are adding in more of the system cars onto our network and so that's given us a lot more confidence there. And then you mentioned the spot rates and we have got to differentiate the spot rates that we have seen go down versus these contracted rates. We still see if there is a firmness in those contracted rates and there's a lot to that and a lot of reasons looming. There's still a number of truckers that need to be hire and that's in the tens of thousands. We have seen chassis dwell increase. We have seen container dwell increase. So there's still tightness there. And as our service is improving, we are going to be pricing and we are pricing right now for that in service improvement, especially during all the tightness that we are seeing. Well, we are 80% through our RFP season and so the prices and increases that we have taken, you are going to see those reflect as the volume improved in domestic intermodal. Again, yeah, we are going to watch it, but it's just not showing up right now on the contracted side. It's still a very tight supply chain. We would like to see a few things loosen up in terms of the chassis dwell that's out there and the container dwell to help with the volume and us capture more of that volume that's out there. But, again, there's still a disconnect there between what we are seeing on the spot side and the contractual rates. Yeah. I mean a lot of this is not being able to catch up with mixed volume. I mean they are probably some low inventories that we will replenish on the coal side. But, again, the fundamentals for natural gas prices, we expect to remain pretty strong in 2023. The same is true with some of the commodities like finished vehicles and auto parts, but layered on all of these are really business development wins. So I can point to business development wins on finished vehicles that were over-the-road, business development wins on auto parts that were over-the-road. And then, again, same is true with our plastics business and our metals business. These are new business wins that are coming on. So that's how I think about it when I am looking at industrial production as a whole and where we stand and what's out there for us to capture. Absolutely. Yeah. So, remember, we do have a new customer that we are excited about that's on our property now with Knight-Swift, and we are seeing benefits and wins from there. As our service product improves, we also expect to insert more resources out there to win over-the-road. We also know that there's over-the-road business that can come back to us on the parcel side. So, again, if you look across the spectrum, there's still opportunities out there as our service improves, as we add a few more of those resources into the network to grow this business in the second half. Right. All I will add is that we are always looking at our customer success metrics. We talk about it often, we engage our customers and that could continue to evolve."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today\u2019s presentation are available on Union Pacific\u2019s website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you. Mr. Fritz, you may now begin.\nLance Fritz: Thank you, Rob and good morning and welcome to Union Pacific\u2019s first quarter earnings conference call. With me today in Omaha are Kenny Rocker, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Eric Gehringer, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Jennifer Hamann, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we discuss our first quarter results, I want to reflect on Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The people of Ukraine have had their lives turned upside down and the UP family is holding them close in our thoughts and in our hearts. We have leveraged our resources to help, with a $500,000 donation from our foundation and by matching 2:1, our employees\u2019 gifts to select charities that provide direct aid. I also want to recognize the Union Pacific team for more than their generosity. They are a team dedicated to serving our customers. But recently, our service product has not met our customers\u2019 expectations. You will hear from Eric, we have an action plan in place to recover and it is starting to yield benefits. I am confident in our long-term ability to grow while providing our customers a reliable service product. As they have proven time and again, no matter the challenge, our employees rise to the occasion. Turning to our first quarter results, this morning, Union Pacific is reporting 2022 first quarter net income of $1.6 billion or $2.57 per share. This compares to first quarter 2021 results of $1.3 billion or $2 per share. Our first quarter operating ratio of 59.4% improved 70 basis points versus 2021. Business development and a robust demand environment drove 4% volume growth in the quarter, coupled with strong pricing gains and the positive business mix. However, our service challenges are contributing to higher costs in the quarter. That performance is also having a real impact on our customers and their ability to serve their markets. We must improve to realize the volume growth we expect this year and into the future. So, let me turn it over to Kenny first for an update on the business environment.\nEric Gehringer: Thank you, Lance and good morning. First quarter volume was up 4% compared to a year ago. Solid gains in both our bulk and industrial segments were more than offset by a decline in our premium business group from continued global supply chain disruptions. Freight revenue was up 17%, driven by higher fuel surcharges, strong pricing gains and a positive mix. Let\u2019s take a closer look at each of these business groups. Starting with bulk, revenue for the quarter was up 21% compared to last year, driven by a 12% increase in volume and an 8% increase in average revenue per car, reflecting higher fuel surcharges and solid core pricing gains. Coal and renewable carloads grew 29% year-over-year driven by continued favorable natural gas prices and two new contract wins that started on January 1. Grain and grain products were up 1% in volume due to the increased biofuels production partially offset by fewer grain shipments from longer shuttle cycle times. Fertilizer carloads were up 2% year-over-year due to strong agricultural demand. And lastly, increased shipments of import beer and can goods were the main driver of the 4% increase in food and refrigerated. Moving on to industrial, industrial revenue was up 16% for the quarter, driven by an 11% increase in volume. Average revenue per car also improved 5%, primarily driven by higher fuel surcharges and core pricing gains. Energy and specialized shipments were down 6% compared to 2021 driven by fewer petroleum shipments. Volume for Forest Products grew 7% year-over-year primarily driven by strength in both lumber shipments and paper. Despite rise in interest rates, housing starts continue to be strong, coupled with demand of corrugated boxes and scrap paper. Industrial chemicals and plastic shipments were up 14% year-over-year due to the increased demand and a favorable comp from last year\u2019s gulf swarm that impacted production. Metals and minerals volumes continued to deliver robust year-over-year growth. Volume was up 25% compared to last year, primarily driven by growth in the construction materials, strong steel demand and an increase in frac sand shipments. In addition, we had a favorable comp in our construction market from last year\u2019s storm that I mentioned earlier. Turning to premium, revenue for the quarter was up 14% on a 3% decrease in volume versus last year. Average revenue per car increased by 17% due to higher fuel surcharge revenue, core pricing gains, and a positive mix in traffic. Automotive volume was up 6%, driven by an increase in auto parts as demand recovers. Shipments for finished vehicles were down 3% as a result of ongoing semiconductor shortages. Intermodal volume was down 5%, driven by continued international supply chain disruption. However, domestic volume was up in the quarter, aided by business development wins, tight truck capacity and continued strength in parcel shipments. Now, moving on to our outlook for the rest of 2022, at a micro level, we will be closely watching our markets to see how rising inflation and the global events in both China and Ukraine will impact our overall volume. But as it stands now, here is how we view the outlook across our business lines. Starting with our bulk commodity, we expect fertilizer to grow due to solid market demand, especially on the export side. For coal, we anticipate continued favorable natural gas prices to extend through the year. But when it comes to how much of that demand we can capture, that will depend on how quickly we recover our service levels. We are optimistic on growth with grain products from biofuel demand and business development wins. For grain, we have a tough comp to last year as exports were strong. And like coal, although we expect cycle times to improve, it is dependent on our service recovery. Moving on to industrial markets, we continue to be encouraged by the strength of the forecast for industrial production. This will positively impact many of our markets, like metals. Customer expansions and business development wins will drive growth in our industrial chemicals and plastics commodity groups. We do not expect to see petroleum shipments return to 2021 levels. And lastly, for premium, we expect domestic intermodal to continue its benefit from inventory restocking, retail sales strength, tight truck supply and our business development wins. International intermodal is more uncertain with possible effects from ongoing supply chain challenges and pandemic shutdown in China. For automotive, while we do expect the supply of semiconductor chip to improve throughout 2022, recent events in China and Ukraine may disrupt the supply chain for certain key components. We are keeping an eye on whether this will have an impact on production and stand in close contact with our customers. As I wrap up, I want to share a few insights on how the commercial team is navigating the current service challenges. First, all of our discussions have been centered around what actions we can take to improve service. Eric will provide insight on the levers we are pulling that are in our control. Likewise, the commercial team is asking our customers to help reduce railcar inventory. While those conversations have been difficult, I am encouraged by the high level of engagement and transparency we are having with our customers. With that, I will turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance.\nKenny Rocker: Thanks, Kenny and good morning. As I will discuss in greater detail in a few minutes, our service is not to a level that meets expectations and we acknowledge the impact that deteriorated service levels are having on our customers. We are implementing plans to restore network fluidity and build a safer, more reliable and resilient network. Safety results have been mixed to start the year as we implement enhancements to our safety programs through partnerships and guidance from our external safety consultant. We remain focused on achieving world class safety performance. We value the health and the safety of our employees above all and want all employees to return home safely each day. Now, let\u2019s review our key performance metrics for the quarter, starting on Slide 9. Freight car velocity and the related trip plan compliance measures were lower relative to 2021. Coming into the year, the network was in a more fluid state, seeing improvements in operating metrics and crew availability from reduced COVID infections. In late February, however, while the network was still fragile, episodic events challenge the team and our service product. This led to both decreased velocity and an increase in freight car inventory, particularly private cars, as resources were added to counteract sluggish service and meet growing customer demands. Turning now to Slide 10 although the overall network performance muted most of our efficiency metrics, we continue to operate a more efficient rail network compared to pre-PSR levels. Locomotive productivity declined 6% compared to first quarter 2021 due to locomotive utilization during the quarter. To assist and recover in the network, we also brought additional units online, further impacting our productivity results. First quarter workforce productivity improved 5% to a record 1,056 daily miles per FTE. We continue to hire for growth and normal attrition throughout the network. In 2021, we graduated over 250 new transportation employees with almost 400 employees graduated to-date in 2022. We have a strong training pipeline of roughly 500 employees as we work closer towards our goal of onboarding around 1,400 employees this year. We have, however, been challenged across the Northern region at several locations to meet our hiring targets. And we continue to work with our workforce resources partners to increase our hiring pools in those locations. Train length is essentially flat compared to one year ago. While continued soft international intermodal volumes present a headwind to train length initiatives, we continue to advance train length for coal and manifest trains, which both grew compared to first quarter 2021. These productivity efforts are key to enabling us to recover the network and deliver a better service product for our customers. Turning to Slide 11 and a discussion on our path forward, this chart illustrates the current state of operations. Our operating car inventory levels rose over 20% since the beginning of the year, while our 7-day volume levels remained relatively flat week to week. We are at an inflection point and more critical action is needed. Our terminals remained fluid and our focus on improving over-the-road operations and reducing the number of active trains on the network will ease mainline congestion. To accomplish this, we are taking actions on all fronts by selectively increasing network resources, collaborating with our unions, adjusting transportation plans and working proactively with customers to reduce the private car inventory buildup. The entire team is dedicated to returning the network to a more fluid operating state. Looking beyond some of today\u2019s issues, our goal is to build a more resilient and consistent network to meet the growth needs of our customers. With that, I will turn it over to Jennifer to review our financial performance.\nJennifer Hamann: Thanks, Eric and good morning. Let me start with a look at the first quarter operating ratio and earnings per share on Slide 13. As you heard from Lance, Union Pacific is reporting first quarter earnings per share of $2.57 and a quarterly operating ratio of 59.4%, 70 basis points of improvement. Comparing year-over-year first quarter results, you will recall that Winter Storm Yuri significantly impacted 2021. So in 2022, we have the positive effect to our operating ratio of 160 basis points and $0.16 to earnings per share. Rising fuel prices throughout the quarter, the lag on our fuel surcharge programs and widening spreads between WTI and highway diesel fuel prices negatively impacted our quarterly ratio by 80 basis points, while adding $0.12 per share. Core results were a 10 basis point drag to the operating ratio, but contributed $0.29 to EPS. These core results are indicative of both operational inefficiencies in the quarter as well as the strong top line growth we delivered. Looking now at our first quarter income statement on Slide 14, operating revenue totaled $5.9 billion, up 17% versus 2021 on 4% year-over-year volume growth. Operating expense increased 16% to $3.5 billion. Excluding the impact of higher fuel prices, expenses were up 7% in the quarter. First quarter operating income was a record at $2.4 billion, a 19% increase versus last year. Adjusted for fuel price, first quarter incremental margins totaled 56%. Expectations for full year incrementals are unchanged in the mid-60s, which is the lower end of our Investor Day guidance. Interest expense increased 6% compared to 2021, reflecting increased debt levels, partially offset by a lower effective interest rate. Income tax increased 18% due to higher pre-tax income partially offset by a lower effective tax rate. We now estimate the full year effective tax rate to be around 23.5% as several states have lowered or are expected to lower rates. Net income of $1.6 billion increased 22% versus 2021, which when combined with share repurchases, resulted in earnings per share up 29% to $2.57. Looking more closely at first quarter revenue, Slide 15 provides a breakdown of our freight revenue, which totaled $5.4 billion, up 17% versus 2021. Broad-based volume growth supported by successful business development efforts, as Kenny discussed, contributed 425 basis points. Fuel surcharge revenue of $635 million increased freight revenue 800 basis points as the higher surcharge revenue reflects the significant surge in diesel fuel prices. The robust demand environment continues to support actions that yield price dollars that exceed inflation dollars. These gains combined with the positive business mix to drive 475 basis points of freight revenue growth. Lower intermodal volume, combined with higher industrial shipments, drove the positive mix. Now, let\u2019s move on to Slide 16, which provides a summary of our first quarter operating expenses. As noted earlier, the primary driver of the increased expense was fuel, up 74% on a 59% increase in fuel prices and 9% higher gross ton miles. Our fuel consumption rate was relatively flat compared to 2021 as the favorable business mix was offset by negative productivity. Looking further at the expense lines, compensation and benefits expense was up 7% versus 2021. First quarter workforce levels increased 1% as a 2% increase in our train and engine crews were partially offset by flat management, engineering and mechanical workforces. As you heard from Eric, we continue to hire into our transportation crafts to support network recovery efforts and prepare for future growth. Cost per employee increased 6% as a result of wage inflation as well as higher recrew over time and borrow-out costs related to network inefficiencies partially offset by last year\u2019s weather-related expenses. Given the current operational challenges, we now expect cost per employee to remain elevated into the second quarter. Purchased services and material expense is up 14%, driven by inflation, higher volume-related purchase transportation expense associated with our Loop subsidiary and cost to maintain a larger active locomotive fleet. Equipment and other rents, was up 1% driven by lower TTX equity income. Other expense increased 5% in the quarter, driven by higher state and local taxes and increased business travel. Turning to Slide 17 and our cash flows, cash from operations in the first quarter increased to $2.2 billion from $2 billion in 2021, a 14% increase. Our cash conversion rate was 85% and free cash flow of $657 million declined $146 million. This includes $312 million of increased cash capital spending and $93 million in higher dividends. The cash capital investment reflects both payments from elevated fourth quarter spending as well as a normalized start to our 2022 program. In the quarter, we returned $3.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This includes the $2.2 billion accelerated share repurchase program executed in February. And we finished the first quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.8x as we continue to maintain a strong investment grade credit rating. Wrapping up on Slide 18, I want to start by recognizing that several things have changed since we provided guidance in January, from fuel prices to our operational performance. As we sit here today, those pressures make achievement of around a 55.5% operating ratio unlikely. However, assuming some stabilization in fuel and recovery in our service product, we will still look to achieve our long-term goals of an OR that starts with a 55 this year. Importantly, we are affirming our previously provided 2022 targets for volume, price and incremental margins. Our cash and capital plans also are unchanged. Capital spending remains at $3.3 billion for the year, well within our long-term guidance of below 15% of revenue, and we remain committed to an industry leading dividend payout ratio and share repurchases in line with 2021. Before I turn it back to Lance, I would like to express my appreciation to the Union Pacific team. Working in an outdoor factory is always a challenge, but especially so during winter. Our employees though are undeterred in their desire to safely serve our customers while delivering another quarter of solid financial results. Thank you. With that, I will turn it back to Lance.\nLance Fritz: And thank you, Jennifer. As Eric mentioned, we have had an uneven start to the year with safety, but we are not deterred. We are in the process of implementing changes to our safety programs as a result of our work with experienced safety consultants. I am confident these changes will be a catalyst for world class safety performance. As you heard from Kenny, demand remains robust as our customers see growth opportunities in their businesses. However, we recognize that for growth to be sustainable, we need a reliable and resilient service product that our customers can depend on. Our strategy begins with serve and it is the foundation for achieving long-term success for all stakeholders. Improving our service product has our full and undivided attention. Current challenges aside, we remain enthusiastic about the opportunities that exist this year to win with all of our stakeholders and I am confident that 2022 will be a very successful year. Wrapping up with tomorrow being Earth Day, it feels appropriate to highlight an action we took during the first quarter to protect our planet and advance our journey to net-zero emissions by 2050. In January, we announced plans to purchase 20 battery electric locomotives for use in the yard operations, creating the world\u2019s largest carrier-owned battery fleet in freight service. These locomotives do not use diesel fuel and emit zero emissions. We anticipate the first units will arrive onsite in late 2023 with complete delivery by 2024. With this step, Union Pacific remains a leader on our nation\u2019s path to a sustainable future. So with that, let\u2019s open up the line for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will be coming from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Hoexter: Great. Good morning. Just kind of following up on the \u2013 on your outlook, obviously, it has a lot to do with enhancing hiring to improve the service. Maybe you can talk a little bit about how do you scale that up, Lance? What programs you can do to kind of meet some of these targets? And I guess, Kenny, the breadth of the letter and constraints on the company\u2019s limiting their assets, maybe talk about what \u2013 how that frees up the fluidity of the network as well? Thanks.\nLance Fritz: Yes. Thanks for the questions, Ken. So I will start. In terms of hiring, our hiring pipeline right now is pretty much fully charged at 500. We will be graduating something over 100 each month. That will help us get healthy. It\u2019s not like we need all 1,400 right now. But I would love to be able to add another couple of hundred into the network where we need them right now. That would really help us move our inventory through the pipeline, get it pushed up against our customers where they would like it. And so we are in the middle of doing that. When Eric mentioned some difficult areas, particularly in the northern tier, call it from West of Chicago all the way through Wyoming and into the Pacific Northwest, we are trying a couple of unique things there. One of the things that\u2019s showing really great promise is something called second chance hiring. It\u2019s where we take [indiscernible] of individuals who have made bad life decisions, but are really no longer a threat to society or themselves. And we work with a partner in the community to vet them and then take the best from that group and bring them on board. We have already gone through our first hiring class who are in the middle of training down in Houston and we have expanded that second chance hiring program now to Chicago, L.A., North Platte and it looks like it has great promise in those communities as well. So, there is a number of things we are doing both to make our jobs more attractive, to find bigger pools of talent and to develop talent so that it\u2019s ready to be in the railroad. And at the same time, we have reduced our training program from a timeframe perspective, not a content perspective, down to about 14 weeks, maybe 17 if we have a little bit more training to do in particular areas. So we are doing everything we can to get the pipeline charged and get them out. Kenny?\nKenny Rocker: Yes. Hey, Ken. We sent out a letter to all of our customers. And so that gave us commercially an opportunity to have a conversation with all of our customers and make them aware of what we are trying to accomplish. I want to thank our commercial team and thank the customers for having those engaging conversations. We work with Eric\u2019s team to ensure we had really good data-driven conversations with the customers that could give us the best opportunity to reduce the railcar inventory. And so we have done that. Trust me there have been some difficult conversations. But I will tell you, I have been very encouraged with the initial response from our customers and their willingness to reduce their railcar inventory. So we will continue to have those discussions. We will continue to engage them and be transparent and utilize data.\nKen Hoexter: Thanks, Ken. Thanks, Lance.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.\nJon Chappell: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Eric, we have kind of been hit over the head with labor, labor, labor. It\u2019s the biggest issue. And when we look at the amount of people you are looking to add, relative to the size of your workforce, it\u2019s really not that large. So what are some of the other capacity constraints that are on the network right now? It feels like you exited 1Q maybe in a bit of a worse situation than you entered 1Q and how quickly can you remedy those non-labor issues to kind of help complement the additional headcount and can get you out of the situation a lot quickly \u2013 a lot quicker?\nEric Gehringer: Yes, John. Thank you for the question. And to your point, right now, we have 1,400 people planned for hiring this year. We are on pace to do that. And we feel like based on how we forecast not only the volume we have now, but also the growth that, that\u2019s exactly how many we need to hire. Now, when you think about recovering the system, I mean, that\u2019s bullet number one. You have got to charge pipeline. And as Lance said, we\u2019ve done that. I go then beyond that, and I focus on crews that we have today, and are we being judicious with the use of those crews? You heard Jennifer state, we have opportunities in things like recrewing over time. Those are at the forefront of our efforts right now. Third, I\u2019d go down to locomotives. As you look at the locomotive fleet in the Union Pacific right now, we have the appropriate amount of locomotives on the system. We have opportunities to use them more productively, but they are the right number of locomotives. Then I go down to the transportation plan changes that we\u2019ve made. Those changes have been very specific and targeted towards eliminating the excess inventory off of the system. And then finally, we closed out with where Kenny started, working with our customers in partnership with them to reduce private car inventory. The faster we do all five of those, John, some of which have already been done, the faster we recover the system, and that\u2019s what everyone is focused on right now.\nJon Chappell: Okay, thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hi, good morning, everyone and thanks for taking my question. Lance or Eric, I guess, can you talk to the fluidity situation in L.A., Long Beack? And has that improved in any drastic quite?\nLance Fritz: Let me get started, and then I\u2019ll ask Eric to add a little detail. We are encouraging our international ocean shipping partners to put more of their international boxes on our railroad to ship inland. As Kenny mentioned, that ratio is still lower than it\u2019s been historically. And they are all working towards adding more of that back into our network. But we\u2019re \u2013 we stand ready. The boxes that are pointed at us on dock are not dwelling in an excessive amount of time, and we\u2019d love to have more of those come on to the railroad.\nEric Gehringer: And Brandon, when we look at that at a specific terminal perspective, Lance is exactly right. We not only have dwell right where we need it to be, it\u2019s a solid performance, especially relative to last year. But we also have excess capacity in those terminals. So as we continue to get more volume, we can handle that. Now we still want to be ready for that. So we have continued to put excess resources and an at-the-ready status. So they are not active, but they are available in the L.A. Basin. So as those surges come, we can handle them efficiently.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you.\nLance Fritz: Yes. Thank you, Brandon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question. \nTom Wadewitz: Yes. Good morning. I guess I want to try to understand a little bit what happened. It seemed like, Lance, you \u2013 even going back to the May Analyst Meeting last year, you talked about growth. And you really, I think, executed well against that strategy. But it seems like now you\u2019re almost \u2013 I don\u2019t want to say you\u2019re surprised by the growth, but there obviously have been difficulty handling it. So is there like a surprise on the attrition side? I know railroading is an outdoor sport. So sometimes you get a setback and it takes a while to recover. But I just \u2013 and then also, I feel like your commentary on labor not that long ago was that you had enough labor. So I guess I just wanted to \u2013 I guess, trying to see what might have happened? And then how much of that is ongoing, in particular with attrition? Is that the issue? Is that ongoing? Thank you.\nLance Fritz: That\u2019s a great question, Tom. And let me unpack that for you, let\u2019s say, starting in the back half of last year coming into this year. We talked about, in the back half of last year, really struggling with crew availability, which was mostly we thought COVID-related. We just had not really done a great job in anticipating what COVID would do to crew availability, and we kept kind of struggling with having 300, 400, 500, 800 TE&Y unavailable to us at any given time. But we thought that our hiring pipeline had been charged up to a point where, as we were entering 2022, we\u2019d be able to handle the volumes. And that looked like that was proving out to be the case. When we spoke to you all in January, our operating metrics were improving. We were coming out of the holiday, and we actually felt pretty good about where we were. Now we knew we were fragile, but we thought we could navigate as we brought crews on board. What happened is we were more fragile, I think, than we give ourselves credit for. So in the back half of February, we started getting some body blows from what normally happens in winter. Usually, we have enough excess resources to be able to bring them to bear and clean out of it. This time around, we didn\u2019t. And as a result, we started getting behind inventory built up, and it\u2019s for the exact reasons that make all the sense in the world. As customers see us slow down, they put in more freight car inventory so that they get their need satisfied. And that then turns into kind of a self-reinforcing negative cycle. And that\u2019s where we are right now. So right now, we\u2019re in a place where we\u2019ve got more train and car inventory on us than we should have, given the volumes, and we\u2019ve got to work that off. And what Eric was talking about is making sure that we use our crews wisely, our power wisely, and our T plan is oriented towards doing that. So that\u2019s exactly where we are. And it\u2019s going to take us a while to work out of it. We\u2019re going to work out of it through the second quarter and into the third quarter. And my anticipation is we\u2019d see increment improvement week after week after week as we\u2019re doing that. Eric, is there anything you want to add to that?\nEric Gehringer: I think you\u2019ve covered it exactly right. We would be most focused on those leading indicators of terminal dwell, car velocity, train velocity and operating inventory. And that\u2019s what we report publicly, so whenever you can continue to see that progress that we will be making a week after week.\nTom Wadewitz: Is there a time frame for when it will be kind of fixed in your view? I guess, that\u2019s third quarter you\u2019re saying?\nEric Gehringer: No, we haven\u2019t guided to a specific time line. I would reinforce the fact that as we see the hiring pipeline, we\u2019re getting about 100 crews every single month. Those 100 crews are incredibly important to the recovery. But so are the other four things that I listed. So what you should know is right now, everyone is focused on that and they are focused on how do we do that as quickly as possible.\nLance Fritz: Yes, Tom, I would point you back to the KPIs that Eric mentioned. You\u2019ll see the recovery happen. You\u2019ll see it in car velocity that we\u2019d publish every week. You\u2019ll see it in terminal dwell that we publish every week, and you\u2019ll see it in overall inventory.\nTom Wadewitz: Okay, thanks for the time.\nLance Fritz: Yes. Thank you, Tom.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your questions.\nJustin Long: Thanks and good morning. I wanted to ask about the OR guidance. Obviously, there is a lot going on in the network operationally. But if I go back to prior pandemic levels, seasonally, you saw about 200 basis points of OR improvement sequentially in the second quarter. When we think about your full year guidance, would it be fair to say that it assumes a similar level of seasonality in the second quarter with the progression to the mid-50s in the back half of the year? Just curious if you can help us think through that quarterly OR cadence assumed in the guidance.\nJennifer Hamann: Yes. Excuse me, thanks, Justin, for that question. I believe you are thinking about it correctly. It really is going to be \u2013 we\u2019ve got to make improvements sequentially in the second quarter and then really leverage that back half as we see stronger volume growth and have greater operational fluidity to be able to hit those targets. Obviously, fuel, we\u2019re assuming some moderation there, but that\u2019s really the operational performance. And the leverage to that volume growth that we know is there, the robust demand that Kenny talked about, I think that\u2019s very important. Now I also have to acknowledge that second quarter of last year was our best quarter ever as a company. And so that\u2019s going to be a very tough comparison for us. And in fact, I would be remiss to say that we think we\u2019re going to see improvement in the second quarter, but sequentially on a year-over-year basis. But sequentially, we should improve, and that will lead to greater improvement in the back half.\nLance Fritz: And support the guidance that you gave overall, which is a 55x for the year.\nJennifer Hamann: Yes.\nJustin Long: And volumes for the second quarter, do you think they\u2019ll be up on a year-over-year basis?\nJennifer Hamann: That\u2019s really going to depend on the pace of the recovery. And \u2013 but I do think when we talked about volumes for the year, again, the first half was going to be driven by the bulk and industrial and the second half was going to be driven by more of that intermodal recovery and automotive recovery. While I think that\u2019s still largely the case, and you heard Kenny talk about the fact that there are some, I\u2019ll say, a little bit of headwinds or potential headwinds in terms of the international intermodal and the automotive recovery with what\u2019s happened in Ukraine and China. But you also have stronger natural gas prices into the back half of the year. So that\u2019s going to support that coal growth. So I still think you have that dynamic of a stronger second half overall in volume than you do in the first half. And in terms of Q2, we just need to really get the network fluid and try to move as much demand that sits there.\nJustin Long: Got it. Thanks for the time.\nJennifer Hamann: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Scott \u2013 sorry, excuse me, Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please proceed with you question.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Jennifer, pricing and mix decelerated a decent amount from Q4. Any thoughts? Is that price or is that mix and any thoughts on how to forecast that? And then just on the operating ratio, I know you\u2019re raising it, worsening it, whatever, by 40 basis points. But I got to think that fuel is more than a 40 basis point headwind to what you thought at the beginning of the year. So is it \u2013 I know we\u2019ve got service issues we\u2019re talking about, but it almost feels like underlying guidance on margin ex fuel or underlying earnings guidance is actually going to be better than what you thought previously. Am I thinking about that right?\nJennifer Hamann: Yes. So let me hit your first question there, Scott, in terms of sequentially. So the pricing environment continues to be very robust. There is really \u2013 that demand environment is there. But you do have \u2013 sequentially, the mix is negative going from fourth quarter to first quarter. And that\u2019s really mix within mix. So yes, bulk and industrial are up intermodal or the premium piece is still down. But when you look at where the growth was on the bulk side, it really was coal, very strong coal growth. But when you look at the arcs relative to the other components of bulk, coal has the lowest arc. So you\u2019ve got that mix within mix impact. And you have a similar story within the industrial side when you look at where the growth was, and industrial strong across the board with the exception of Petroleum, but some of the strongest growth in metals, and that also has your lowest average revenue per car within that group. So that is the story in terms of the yield sequentially. When you look to the OR, fuel is certainly a headwind, but we see that headwind lessening through the year from an OR impact. And so we are looking at both the fuel and the operational performance, but the volume leverage. And that\u2019s the piece that I think maybe I need to stress the most with you all. And that\u2019s the piece that\u2019s within our control and the piece that we\u2019re working very diligently on, when we see stronger volumes coming in the second half, being able to leverage those very well with perhaps a little bit better mix. If you continue to have that industrial growth coming in a little bit stronger, I think that\u2019s how you get to the revised OR guidance.\nScott Group: Okay. Just so I understand that point about fuel, are you assuming the fuel price comes down? Or just that you catch up on the surcharge, and so the OR impact is just naturally less as the year goes on?\nJennifer Hamann: It\u2019s the latter that you say there. It\u2019s really a stabilization in the fuel price. And so we\u2019re catching up. And the fuel was going up a little bit in the second half of last year. So it\u2019s taking those two things together, Scott.\nScott Group: Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.\nLance Fritz: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. \nJordan Alliger: Yes. Hi, just sort of a big-picture question. Obviously, you and others put PSR and PSR methodology into play. And I know things are a bit unprecedented, but do long-term broader adjustments to how you think about precision-scheduled railroading need to take place? And is the resiliency after going through all that a surprise to the negative to you overall? Thanks.\nLance Fritz: Yes. Jordan thanks for asking that question. So unequivocally, PSR has been a benefit to the railroad, even in our current environment. Let\u2019s go back to what it means. It means we try to touch cars the fewest amount of time necessary to satisfy demand for our customers and the customer need. So we don\u2019t do waste work. That by itself allows us to have excess capacity in both the terminals and in our line of road that we can use for other purposes. We also try to deconstruct our specialized networks where that makes sense so that we can have shared trains that are advancing cars more rapidly than it would otherwise. Unequivocally, when you look even at the way we\u2019re operating right now, when we have gotten into trouble prior to PSR, our operation would be worse, demonstrably worse. And we\u2019ve proven through the last 3 years that when we get into trouble in the PSR environment, we can get out of trouble more readily. Now what\u2019s happening right now is, I\u2019ll blame it on us. Shame on us, we got to a place where we did not have the crew availability for when something went wrong to be able to over resource for a short period of time and get it out of the network. And that\u2019s a tough \u2013 it\u2019s not a lesson. It\u2019s a tough situation to be in because we\u2019ve already learned that lesson. So as we look forward, what we have to do is make sure that our business planning processes for resources are rock solid and that we do a better job of making sure that our network and our resources and our plan is tightly coordinated with customers and their need and get them matched up, and match them up over a time frame that is the same as how we can add resources for growth. So yes, unequivocally, PSR is remaining the way to go. It is helping us manage the business right now, and that\u2019s not why we got into trouble.\nJordan Alliger: Thank you.\nLance Fritz: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Jennifer, that 65% incremental margin target for this year, is that compare \u2013 is that ex fuel or headlines? Because I\u2019m trying to understand if it\u2019s comparable to the 56 you did in the quarter or the 45 you did, including kind of a headline basis.\nJennifer Hamann: No, that\u2019s a good clarifying question, Amit. When we talk to the incrementals, we\u2019re always talking about it in terms of normalizing for that fuel price. So that\u2019s comparable to the 56 that we reported here in the first quarter.\nAmit Mehrotra: Okay. Okay. So yes, that\u2019s what I thought. And so the implication is, I mean, it\u2019s going to depend on what revenue growth is, but is the implication is that you guys are going to do a 53 to 55 OR cumulatively over 2Q, 3Q and 4Q, which is a big step-up in the context of kind of these ongoing service issues? One thing I wanted to clarify is the fuel surcharge, obviously, it was up 20% sequentially, but I assume you\u2019re going to take a very big step up in the second quarter, some of the March increase, and then maybe even subsequently third quarter. So I\u2019m just trying to figure out the confidence around the next three quarters. And how much of that bridge, so to speak, of that step-function improvement is that absolutely just fuel surcharge revenue that comes on disproportionately the increase in fuel costs?\nJennifer Hamann: Yes. So I mean, we do still see the price of fuel being a headwind in terms of our OR. As I talked to Scott, we see that lessening through the course of the year, but we don\u2019t see that OR impact flipping and being a tailwind to our OR. So your math that you said in terms of the last three quarters of the year in terms of OR, I don\u2019t know that I would necessarily agree with that. That seems fairly aggressive. But it is about seeing a stability in the fuel prices, which does allow the fuel surcharge, obviously, to catch up a bit.\nLance Fritz: Well, and Jennifer, we also just need to circle back. There is one other predicate on that, and that is we are improving the service product through the quarter and through the back half of the year.\nJennifer Hamann: Absolutely. And that goes back to the commentary about volume leverage.\nLance Fritz: Yes.\nAmit Mehrotra: Great. If I could just sneak in one last one for Lance, which I think is an important question. Obviously, BNSF is making a bigger push into intermodal with its joint venture with Hunt. And Hunt\u2019s obviously the largest IMC out there with a big asset behind them, asset-based behind them. You guys have won a lot of intermodal business recently. Does that change your strategy in terms of what you need to do? Do you need to invest in the intermodal service to compete with this \u2013 your direct competitor that seems to be going all in on really putting a decent amount of investments at play to win more business in intermodal?\nLance Fritz: Yes, Amit, I don\u2019t think it changes fundamentally our strategy in the domestic intermodal world. The BNSF and J.B. Hunt have always been formidable competitors. And what we\u2019ve done, by adding Knight Swift and Schneider along with having XPO and our long-term partner hub working with us, is we\u2019ve got channel partners that can grow very effectively against that. And when you combine that with our EMP and UMAX program for some of the smaller and midsized IMCs, we are fielding a really talented, very compelling story for BCOs to use us. It is no surprise that our primary competitor in BNSF and their primary partner in Hunt are doubling down on how they approach the market. And candidly, that kind of competition between us, our channel partners and them and their channel partners is fantastic for the users, for the customers of domestic intermodal.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Wetherbee: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Maybe a question for Kenny or Lance, I wanted to think about sort of the overall demand environment. Clearly, I think there is business that\u2019s available now that you\u2019re not capable of moving from a service perspective. So, maybe a little bit of perspective on the amount of business that you may be turning away or sort of metering as it stands right now. And then thinking a bit bigger picture, what do we think the outlook is really for the rest of the year? I guess there is a question of overall consumer activity and the pace of demand as the rest of the year plays out. So I want to get a sense of what you\u2019re hearing from the customers in terms of expansion or contraction plans as they think about the rest of the year. Obviously, we\u2019re hopeful that as service comes back, there will remain demand being relatively strong, but I want to get a sense of what you\u2019re hearing on the ground?\nLance Fritz: Yes, Kenny, do you want to handle that?\nKenny Rocker: Yes. Thanks, Chris. You\u2019ve set aside some of the macro things that we\u2019re delving on. We\u2019re keeping an eye on the inflation rates that are out there. Obviously, there have been some ups and starts with COVID disruptions in China. But when I look across each of our business teams, it\u2019s a very optimistic story. You look at our coal business, we talked about the two wins. None of us would have predicted that natural gas prices are as high as they are and are going to sustain where they are. Our grain business has been very strong. Last year was very strong. I tell you, the upside there is on the biofuels market and the grain products area, which is great. And then as we look throughout the rest of the year, we expect that export fertilizer demand will stay there. On the industrial side, really same story, I mean we have got some business development wins, but we\u2019ve also just got some structural things that are helping us out. Metals has been very strong. There have been some expansions on the plastic side. Those markets are still recovering and have been very strong. We will keep an eye on housing starts. The inventories are still low. There is still a backlog of houses that need to be built, so our lumber and our paper business has been strong. And then on the premium side, our auto parts and finished vehicles business still is not where it should be. It\u2019s improving. We talk to some customers. Car dealership inventories are around 24, 25 days. We see that improving as we move throughout the year. On our international intermodal side, the amount that\u2019s going IPI has improved or improved in the first quarter. We had some customers in here recently. We\u2019re expecting them to turn on more of that volume. So the things that we can control, we feel really good about \u2013 domestic intermodal has been up, as I mentioned in my commentary. So from what we can control, we feel good about. We just got to keep an eye on some of these other things that are out of our control.\nLance Fritz: And Kenny, I want to brag on your team for a moment. You\u2019re doing really tremendous work on business development, on pure business development, the singles and doubles, where we bring on a customer, we grow with an existing customer through service enhancement and enhancing the overall customer experience. Even in the context of the service issues that we\u2019re facing right now from a service product perspective, behind the scenes, the overall customer experience, we continued to invest in that and continue to make progress.\nKenny Rocker: Yes. They are out there and engaging the customer.\nLance Fritz: Yes.\nChris Wetherbee: Thanks for the color. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I do want to follow-up on the domestic intermodal expectations into the back half, because it\u2019s kind of based on what you said about the competition with the BN as well as expectations for the truck market to loosen in the back half of the year, I\u2019m kind of starting a little bit if what the tailwind is on the domestic intermodal side that will get that to accelerate in the back half of the year? So are there new contracts coming on kind of what gets that to go up? So that\u2019s question number one. And question number two is if you can give us a little bit of a sneak peek into the STB hearing in a few days, kind of obviously, you guys have spoken a lot about service challenges and everything you\u2019re doing right now. But what do you think is going to be the outcome on that curing? Thank you.\nLance Fritz: Kenny, why don\u2019t you handle the back half domestic intermodal question, and I\u2019ll get to the STB after you\u2019re done.\nKenny Rocker: Yes. Thanks, Ravi. A couple of questions there, and it sounds like demand and also the pricing environment. We\u2019re about 40%, almost close to halfway through our bid sessions on the domestic side, and it\u2019s been favorable versus last year. Last year was also a pretty a strong, solid year. Now the spot rates have gone down here recently. So we\u2019ve got to keep an eye on that. But I\u2019ll tell you, the overall demand has not changed. And so we\u2019re going to continue to look at that over the next a few weeks as we\u2019re in those competitive bids. Again, we brought on the night swift business, but we do have more volume that coming on as we look at the back half of the year. The other thing is that we just need the supply chain to work itself out. Chassis dwell is still not really where it should be. The dwell of containers is not really where it should be. So we will see some improvement there. And then you made some comments about our primary competitor in the West. And I want to echo what Lance said. The pie is much larger than the primary competitors in the West. And we\u2019ve had so much investment as you look at the ramps in Inland Empire, Twin Cities, everything we\u2019re doing with GPS. We want to compete with truck, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on.\nLance Fritz: Yes. And as we improve the service product, Kenny, get that reliable, we\u2019re in great position to take more trucks off the highway. It just makes all the sense in the world, including an ESG perspective. Ravi, your question on the STB hearing clearly, the entire rail industry is in a place where we\u2019re as a collective, not providing the kind of service that our customers demand. The STB appropriately is hearing from customers and want to talk about it. That\u2019s what next week is all about. We\u2019re well prepared for those conversations and to share with the STB how we\u2019re investing and planning to continue to improve and recover and then be stable going forward and reliable and consistent. And I think that\u2019s going to be a great opportunity to have that discussion. We\u2019re going to encourage the STB not to make rush or knee-jerk decisions in this environment. There are some things on their docket that I would guess, I would imagine, somebody will advocate as solutions. And that from our perspective, this is all about getting our labor right, getting utilization right, making sure the other resources are ready and then executing. It\u2019s not much more complex than that right now.\nRavi Shanker: It sounds good. Thank you both.\nLance Fritz: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC. Please proceed with your question.\nWalter Spracklin: Thanks very much. Hi. Good morning everyone. So Lance, you mentioned over resourcing or the ability to over resource. And I guess my question is really, if that is limited only to your ability to ramp up labor, or are you looking at ways? And do you feel like you need to look at ways to extend your capacity from an infrastructure standpoint, be it on track and locomotives and so on? It just goes back to the STB, some of the discussions Chairman is having about, the lack of railroad ability to invest or the historical decision not to invest that is leading to the lack of available capacity. And I wonder how would you respond to that and particularly, if it\u2019s just a labor problem or if you need some more capacity and investment in your network as well?\nLance Fritz: Yes, Walter, we take a great exception to anyone that points at our historic track record and says we are under investing in our railroad, right, when you spend $3 billion, $4 billion a year, that\u2019s not under-investing. And look at the statistics, look at the facts. You go back 4 years or 5 years, we would have 800 or 900 trains on our network at any given time. Today, we are overloaded by plan at 700. That number should really be 600. And our network has had incremental investment put into it. That\u2019s what I mean by making sure we have excess resources. We have done that through the implementation of PSR in terms of, we have excess terminal capacity that we can use by having mothballed certain terminals that we no longer needed in the T-plan. We have got plenty of line-of-road capacity that we can use, and we continue to invest there so that we can continue to grow out efficiency, safety, productivity and growth in targeted areas. So, when I am talking like that, I am really talking about the more fungible resources like crews and locomotives. And locomotives were in great shape, right. We have a strategy where we have at-the-ready locomotives positioned around the network, so that we can fire them up when they are needed and then put them back once we have gotten out of the situation. So, it\u2019s really \u2013 to your point, Walter, it\u2019s really back down to crews. Historically, we have had boards, alternative work and training service boards where we would be able to have people not going to furlough but go into kind of a quasi status where they are still getting paid, they are still getting resources from us, their benefits package in its entirety. And that allows us to call them back more quickly if something happens in a demand profile that we didn\u2019t expect. We need to get back to a place where we have got those kinds of resources available to us, and we are looking at all of those. But job one that we talked about, first and foremost, is making sure we get crew utilization and crew availability and total crewing right, so that we can handle the volume we have got in front of us and the growth that\u2019s coming.\nWalter Spracklin: I think that\u2019s a great answer. And do you think that\u2019s resonating with the STB, or what is your sense that, that answer will kind of give you some \u2013 at least some time to kind of prove it out over the coming quarters and years, or do you see risk that they may take action to force you to invest in capacity above and beyond all the capacity investments you just mentioned?\nLance Fritz: Walter, I am an optimist, and I am hopeful that the facts, which support what I just talked about, speak to the STB. And we are effective at communicating that.\nWalter Spracklin: Thank you very much for the time. I appreciate it.\nLance Fritz: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Vernon: Sorry. Two questions for you on the domestic intermodal side again. Eric, as you are resourcing the network right now, obviously, Kenny\u2019s team has done a good job bringing over some fairly big accounts in 2023, will you have enough capacity by the end of the year to accommodate that, or will there still be an incremental growth required in resource into 2023 to accommodate that, those intermodal share wins?\nEric Gehringer: Yes. So, thank you for the question. David, we will have the capacity to be able to host that additional volume. Now as we have been working through the on-boarding process, that\u2019s part of that process is to ensure that we are making the necessary investments. And it\u2019s not always capital investments. Oftentimes, it\u2019s just process improvements. For example, considering the fact of Knight-Swift and Schneider now having their own chassis, and how do we think about that and optimize our terminals to account for that? When I am out on the railroad, I see the output of those efforts. When I see us getting near completion on our G4 gantry cranes, when I see us buy an additional lift equipment, the work that we are doing on the Inland Empire and the Twin Cities Intermodal Terminal, those are all in response, not just Knight-Swift and Schneider, but to the entire volume and growth that we see coming and being ready for all of our customers to benefit from that.\nDavid Vernon: Alright. Thanks for that. And then maybe just as a quick follow-up. When we think about the 20%, 30%, 40% growth in the domestic container fleet we are going to be seeing over the next couple of years, it sounds like a lot of private equipment is being added. What do you guys think that your intermodal franchise is going to look like from an equipment perspective 3 years, 4 years, 5 years down the road? Are you also going to be resourcing containers into the UMAX and the EMP programs, or are you going to be allowing your channel partners to make those investments in trailing capacity? Thanks.\nLance Fritz: Kenny, do you want to handle that?\nKenny Rocker: Yes. I mean we feel really good about our strategy to go in and invest in our equipment that we have out there with EMP and UMAX. I talked about the GPS earlier. You have heard me talk about the chassis investment. We see that we can win across the board. We can win with the private asset side and with the IMC community, and we want to grow that pie. And so that\u2019s how we are thinking about it. As other private asset carriers are out there, we will engage them on their strategy. But clearly, we don\u2019t want to put any limits on anything that would inhibit growth.\nLance Fritz: I would guess, Kenny, given the growth that we are seeing first through Knight-Swift, then with Schneider and the continued growth of Hub, it\u2019s probably fair to say the ratio of privates versus EMP, UMAX on us grows towards the private side.\nKenny Rocker: That\u2019s good. Yes.\nDavid Vernon: Alright. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So clearly, a lot depends on service improvement here in the next couple of quarters. Just wanted to get your sense, Lance or Eric, about just the risk to the plan, what are you really focused on? What are you really worried about? And then, Lance, you did mention a few things on how to get this more sustainable in the future. There will always be labor and volume variability. But is there something else you feel like that UP or maybe the industry overall needs to get better at in terms of being able to manage these ebbs and flows a bit better and then being able to grow from there?\nLance Fritz: Well, why don\u2019t I start with the back half of that question, Brian, and then I will turn it over to Eric on the front half in terms of some of the bumps in the night that you are planning for, that you are mitigating. So, in terms of how to be more resilient and robust, there is a lot to that question. Some of it is our direct control. Some of it has to be in partnership with our customers. So, what\u2019s in our direct control, we have to make sure that our jobs are more flexible and more attractive and easier to hire into. So, one thing that we are in the middle of right now as an industry is trying to get to a place where two people in the cab or a locomotive are not mandated and negotiate with our union partners on moving one of those people onto the ground. That doesn\u2019t sound like much, but that one person on the ground can turn into a shift job and stay at home as they are doing their work. That\u2019s a huge lifestyle benefit to that person as opposed to going over the road, staying away from home and then coming back and being called at potentially all hours of the day. So, that \u2013 it\u2019s not obvious how that connects back into being more reliable, more resilient, more consistent, but there is an obvious connection from our perspective. There is other things like that, that are smaller that we need to do. I talked about oughts and getting back to a place where we have not excess manpower sitting around, but our labor force, our craft professionals are more flexible to go to where the work is and do the work when it\u2019s needed and still have an enhancement in their work-life balance. So, there is a lot of work that we have to do with our unions on property and negotiation and national in negotiation and then just in how we design our boards and our team plan and our work overall. Eric, do you want to handle that first part?\nEric Gehringer: Yes. So, Brian, as you think about the recovery and what are we doing to de-risk that, I would first start off with just the basic fundamentals of, we are coming out of winter. We are coming out of a period of time where we have seen higher variability. As we come into spring, it\u2019s a period of time in which we have been more consistent, especially with the impact of weather. Second, we have mentioned it a couple of times, but it\u2019s really the most important thing as we sit here right now. If you look at previous times of service challenges, it\u2019s been in our terminals. We have been able to get the volume to the terminals, but then the volume in the terminal starts to slow the terminal. That\u2019s not the case right now. The case right now is that we have fluid terminals, both our large terminals, our serving yards and our locals getting to customers. That must stay that way. So, the way we think about bringing trains into the terminals and landing them on time, but also properly space so we can handle it, so we don\u2019t get a backlog. That\u2019s de-risking it. If you look at another way as we talked about crews, we are in the crew-preserving mode right now. We want to make sure that every crew we call counts. One of the ways we do that is with train length. So, if you go back all the way to January, we were sitting around 9,000 feet on a system average. We added 200 feet to that in January, another 200 feet in February and March and another 150 feet year-to-date. That\u2019s de-risking the recovery. That\u2019s ensuring that we are taking every opportunity we can to minimize the number of trains out on line of road. So, it\u2019s all activities like that, and that\u2019s what the entire team is focused on.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Alright. Thank you, Eric. That\u2019s very helpful. Lance, if you can just give us some quick thoughts on the CPKC merger. I think the responses back from CP are due tomorrow. So, any updates on the concerns that UP has voiced in that would be helpful. Thank you.\nLance Fritz: Yes. Brian, I would just reiterate what our concerns are. It really boils down to three things that we think we need remedies for. The first is for our customers to continue to enjoy the kind of access they have to and from Mexico we need certainty on price that\u2019s competitive from the border into Mexico. We think about that like prop rates. Second, we need to maintain what we have today with the KCS, and that is fair treatment, equal treatment at the border crossings on the bridge. And third, the KCS and CP have talked about a significant spike in converting truck to train and moving it on our trackage rights through Houston. Houston is a congested area. It\u2019s a \u2013 it\u2019s not congested in a bad way. It\u2019s a high-volume area that requires a lot of attention. If you introduce another 8 or 10 trains a day into that network in a rapid period without having the capital in place first, it will tilt Houston, and we can\u2019t accept that. So, we want to make sure that if they are going to execute that plan and it\u2019s going to increase the amount of train traffic through Houston, the capital is spent in advance, so it doesn\u2019t crater Houston as a result.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Thank you, Lance. I appreciate it.\nLance Fritz: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi, good morning. You had mentioned a number of notable steps, obviously, towards your sustainability target. But as you are having conversations with new business development, I guess one, is that being recognized? And then as a part of that, is that becoming increasingly important in their decision to execute with UNP towards an agreement? Just any thoughts there?\nLance Fritz: Yes. Thank you, Allison. Kenny, do you want to take that?\nKenny Rocker: Yes. We have a number of customers that have always wanted to know where we are on ESG and sustainability component. And we are seeing in the RFPs and the formal RFP more focus there. Those customers are typically in the petrochem area, more customers that have \u2013 that are, I will call them, consumer-facing type customers. So, we do know that it\u2019s in their methodology. I will tell you the other thing is that our commercial team is sitting down with our customers and walking through the value that we provide by them moving Union Pacific and actually selling that. So, yes, it\u2019s more awareness on the customer part and more proactive engagement from our commercial team to fill that as part of our value proposition.\nAllison Poliniak: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Seidl: Hi. Thank you, operator. Lance and team, good morning. I wanted to go back a little bit to the intermodal side. As you think about your base case scenario on the international side, what\u2019s in it in terms of potential clogging up of the supply chain again? We have talked to a bunch of people, and there seems to be some worry here that we have had a bunch of black swan events over the last couple of years. Now we got another one with China ports just withholding all these shipments coming in. If they all come back to the ports at once, I don\u2019t think a lot of people have confidence that they are going to be able to handle it. What\u2019s UP set up like into the summer? And how do you think you are going to handle that?\nLance Fritz: Let me start, and then I want to turn it over to Eric and Kenny to kind of add a bit more detail. But I want to, Jason, focus in on the partner side with railroad, what we need to depend on so that the network doesn\u2019t get overwhelmed. I am in part in agreement with you that we are not yet in a place where labor and distribution centers and warehouses and dray truck companies is at a place where it could take an onslaught of significant volume in the international intermodal space. So, that we still need more hiring and more labor available in local truck companies and dray companies and in distribution centers. But Kenny and Eric, what about us?\nKenny Rocker: Yes. The \u2013 I mean I think you hit it on the head, I would say. And I am looking at Eric as I say that we feel good about the condition of our intermodal network as it stands today. We have been working very closely with the customers to make sure that we have a really clear forecast of what\u2019s coming towards us. We have been through the technology where we can to do that. But yes, these tough are out of China. We have got to keep an eye on it because there is going to be another slug of containers that are coming to us.\nEric Gehringer: And one of our biggest opportunities that we have been leveraging really for now almost a full year is we are active members on the White House Working Committee that allows us to interact with all the different stakeholders on the West ports. And what it is providing us is even better transparency into different events that are happening up chain that it comes down to us, it allows us to understand weeks, sometimes months out, on who we have to think about resourcing for that. And we will continue to be active in that because it continues to help the entire industry out in the West Coast.\nJason Seidl: Okay. So, if I had to sum that up, an onslaught of freight would still be difficult to handle, but now you guys have better visibility than you did, let\u2019s say, a year ago throughout the system?\nLance Fritz: That\u2019s fair.\nEric Gehringer: Yes, absolutely fair.\nJason Seidl: Okay. I want to follow-up real quickly, getting back to the STB for a second. There was obviously hearings out there on reciprocal switching. I am not going to make any prognostication on where that\u2019s going to go. But just wanted to in terms of your exposure in terms of your total business, what percent of your business would be exposed to reciprocal switching that would come to the U.S.?\nLance Fritz: That\u2019s hard to nail down and give you a number right now. All I would say is we are concerned and deeply engaged with the STB to help them understand what reciprocal switching \u2013 we will call it forced open access, could do and what it couldn\u2019t do. It is not a wholesale remedy to, for instance, remedy fix current supply chain problems, right. What forced open access would do is we put switching in places where it isn\u2019t right now. It would increase dwell time on freight cars. And those are two things that we absolutely don\u2019t need. Now that\u2019s not to say that there can be a circumstance where it might make sense for somebody, and it already does exist in very limited areas where we have agreed with other railroads that a reciprocal switch is needed or where the STB has mandated it through conditions on previous transactions. So, we continue to work with the STB to help them understand our concerns, what \u2013 how it could help, how it couldn\u2019t help and then get to a place where, if there is action taken, it\u2019s sensible.\nJason Seidl: Thanks guys. I appreciate the time as always.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Ben Nolan with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nBen Nolan: Thanks. So, I have sort of a two-part question maybe for Kenny. First, on the coal, the ramp-up that you guys have seen has been pretty remarkable, but you talked about higher natural gas prices, incentivizing more. I was curious for what is your ability to sort of continue to toggle up there? And then similarly, what\u2019s the ability of your customers to also toggle up? And then on the petroleum side, I guess I am a little surprised that there is not more volume growth in that market given how much drilling activity there is and everything else just domestically around the oil and gas side, maybe a little color on that.\nKenny Rocker: Yes. Thanks a lot, Ben. Yes, on the coal side, again, you have got two different things. You have got some business development wins and you also have the natural gas prices. Certainly, we didn\u2019t predict last year that the natural gas prices would be in the $7 range. And as it stands here today, I will tell you, I \u2013 it\u2019s encouraging that, that forecast is throughout the rest of the year. As we talk to our customers, we don\u2019t see that they have made any capital investment per se in terms of trying to get more of that out of the ground. But we do know that they have done quite a bit of hiring to get more utility and get more product out. And so we are working with them on that, and we stay very connected with Eric\u2019s team from a forecast perspective. And then yes, I understand your perspective with petroleum. And what you should think about is just a part of that, that\u2019s not here this year is our crude oil business. And those spreads between Canada and call it, the Gulf for Texas are just not where it should be. And so that\u2019s the impact that you are seeing there. We do see, to your point, the drilling show up in other commodities. We are seeing a lot of drilling pipe, OCTG, that\u2019s moving. I talked about the frac sand. There are some other industrial chemicals that go into the drilling process that we are seeing. So, that\u2019s where that\u2019s showing up on our railroad.\nLance Fritz: And Kenny, in that context, the heat of that market doesn\u2019t look like it did the last super strong cycle we had in places, like the Permian and the Eagle Ford. There seems to be a little bit more discipline on capital spending, and they are slower in walking up production.\nKenny Rocker: Absolutely.\nBen Nolan: Alright. I appreciate the color. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Vertical. Please proceed with your question.\nJeff Kauffman: Thank you very much and thanks for squeezing me in here. A lot\u2019s been asked about short-term and service and short-term disruptions. Kenny, I want to focus a little longer term, really on three things. Number one, given the instability off the West Coast, we have seen a lot of shippers go to the East Coast. So, the first part of this is how do you see that playing out? And what are your customers telling you longer term? And then secondly, I know Lance was talking about the company\u2019s donation to the efforts in Ukraine. But as we talk longer term, are any of your customers approaching you and saying, \u201cListen, what\u2019s going on out there has changed the ability to move product around the globe. How can Union Pacific help us?\u201d And then the topic of re-shoring, which I know hasn\u2019t really happened to a large degree yet. But in the long run, I know a lot of customers are rethinking this. So, maybe talk about those three areas opportunities, say, over a 2-year, 3-year, 4-year period for UP.\nKenny Rocker: It\u2019s interesting that you would bring that up on the international intermodal side. It\u2019s hard to tell what\u2019s going to be a one-off versus a permanent change from, I will call it, directional shipment of international intermodal. We have worked with an international carrier here where we do have a move that\u2019s coming East to West. And so we are excited about that move. And again, we will see what happens there from a permanent basis. Yes, I believe that some of the global disruptions will make our customers think about where they source from. And we are hearing more conversations about near-shoring. We have not seen those investments to really mirror those conversations. And then as you \u2013 I think the last question was about the Ukraine and those thoughts there, we are always talking to our customers about solutions that we can provide them. So, when you think about the six border access, Mexico is clearly one. I just gave you an example of going from East to West. We still feel very good about our products moving off the West Coast, and we have got really solid relationship from anything that wants to come out of Canada. So, we are prepared. We have got $600 million in investment on our intermodal network. So, we are prepared for more growth.\nJeff Kauffman: Okay. That\u2019s all I have. Thanks.\nLance Fritz: Thank you, Jeff.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question today will come from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nCherilyn Radbourne: Thanks very much and good morning. Just a quick one for me. As we start to move towards peak season, I was just hoping you could talk about the current state of the Chicago Gateway, both in terms of your own terminals, but also your interchanges with the other rails, rage capacity and so forth.\nEric Gehringer: Sure. Yes. Cherilyn, so if we look at our \u2013 I want to speak specifically to Chicago first, but the same would be true as we look at Memphis and as we look at even New Orleans. Right now, those all remain fluid from an intermodal perspective. That doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t work through challenges on a day-to-day basis as we work through interchange issues. But we have strong relationships with the other carriers. We work through those issues. And right now, I am very happy with where those terminals are. If we were asking about one I am most focused on, it\u2019s just simply New Orleans, and it\u2019s always one that we are focused on the most because it\u2019s such a tight amount of track and operations in a really small area, but otherwise, no concerns at this point.\nCherilyn Radbourne: Thank you for the time.\nLance Fritz: Alright. Thank you, Cherilyn.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Lance Fritz for closing comments.\nLance Fritz: Alright. Thank you, Rob, and thank you all for engaging with us this morning and for your questions. We are looking forward to talking with you again in July to discuss our second quarter results. Until then, take care.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Eric Gehringer",
            "content": "Thank you, Lance and good morning. First quarter volume was up 4% compared to a year ago. Solid gains in both our bulk and industrial segments were more than offset by a decline in our premium business group from continued global supply chain disruptions. Freight revenue was up 17%, driven by higher fuel surcharges, strong pricing gains and a positive mix. Let's take a closer look at each of these business groups. Starting with bulk, revenue for the quarter was up 21% compared to last year, driven by a 12% increase in volume and an 8% increase in average revenue per car, reflecting higher fuel surcharges and solid core pricing gains. Coal and renewable carloads grew 29% year-over-year driven by continued favorable natural gas prices and two new contract wins that started on January 1. Grain and grain products were up 1% in volume due to the increased biofuels production partially offset by fewer grain shipments from longer shuttle cycle times. Fertilizer carloads were up 2% year-over-year due to strong agricultural demand. And lastly, increased shipments of import beer and can goods were the main driver of the 4% increase in food and refrigerated. Moving on to industrial, industrial revenue was up 16% for the quarter, driven by an 11% increase in volume. Average revenue per car also improved 5%, primarily driven by higher fuel surcharges and core pricing gains. Energy and specialized shipments were down 6% compared to 2021 driven by fewer petroleum shipments. Volume for Forest Products grew 7% year-over-year primarily driven by strength in both lumber shipments and paper. Despite rise in interest rates, housing starts continue to be strong, coupled with demand of corrugated boxes and scrap paper. Industrial chemicals and plastic shipments were up 14% year-over-year due to the increased demand and a favorable comp from last year's gulf swarm that impacted production. Metals and minerals volumes continued to deliver robust year-over-year growth. Volume was up 25% compared to last year, primarily driven by growth in the construction materials, strong steel demand and an increase in frac sand shipments. In addition, we had a favorable comp in our construction market from last year's storm that I mentioned earlier. Turning to premium, revenue for the quarter was up 14% on a 3% decrease in volume versus last year. Average revenue per car increased by 17% due to higher fuel surcharge revenue, core pricing gains, and a positive mix in traffic. Automotive volume was up 6%, driven by an increase in auto parts as demand recovers. Shipments for finished vehicles were down 3% as a result of ongoing semiconductor shortages. Intermodal volume was down 5%, driven by continued international supply chain disruption. However, domestic volume was up in the quarter, aided by business development wins, tight truck capacity and continued strength in parcel shipments. Now, moving on to our outlook for the rest of 2022, at a micro level, we will be closely watching our markets to see how rising inflation and the global events in both China and Ukraine will impact our overall volume. But as it stands now, here is how we view the outlook across our business lines. Starting with our bulk commodity, we expect fertilizer to grow due to solid market demand, especially on the export side. For coal, we anticipate continued favorable natural gas prices to extend through the year. But when it comes to how much of that demand we can capture, that will depend on how quickly we recover our service levels. We are optimistic on growth with grain products from biofuel demand and business development wins. For grain, we have a tough comp to last year as exports were strong. And like coal, although we expect cycle times to improve, it is dependent on our service recovery. Moving on to industrial markets, we continue to be encouraged by the strength of the forecast for industrial production. This will positively impact many of our markets, like metals. Customer expansions and business development wins will drive growth in our industrial chemicals and plastics commodity groups. We do not expect to see petroleum shipments return to 2021 levels. And lastly, for premium, we expect domestic intermodal to continue its benefit from inventory restocking, retail sales strength, tight truck supply and our business development wins. International intermodal is more uncertain with possible effects from ongoing supply chain challenges and pandemic shutdown in China. For automotive, while we do expect the supply of semiconductor chip to improve throughout 2022, recent events in China and Ukraine may disrupt the supply chain for certain key components. We are keeping an eye on whether this will have an impact on production and stand in close contact with our customers. As I wrap up, I want to share a few insights on how the commercial team is navigating the current service challenges. First, all of our discussions have been centered around what actions we can take to improve service. Eric will provide insight on the levers we are pulling that are in our control. Likewise, the commercial team is asking our customers to help reduce railcar inventory. While those conversations have been difficult, I am encouraged by the high level of engagement and transparency we are having with our customers. With that, I will turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance. Yes, John. Thank you for the question. And to your point, right now, we have 1,400 people planned for hiring this year. We are on pace to do that. And we feel like based on how we forecast not only the volume we have now, but also the growth that, that's exactly how many we need to hire. Now, when you think about recovering the system, I mean, that's bullet number one. You have got to charge pipeline. And as Lance said, we've done that. I go then beyond that, and I focus on crews that we have today, and are we being judicious with the use of those crews? You heard Jennifer state, we have opportunities in things like recrewing over time. Those are at the forefront of our efforts right now. Third, I'd go down to locomotives. As you look at the locomotive fleet in the Union Pacific right now, we have the appropriate amount of locomotives on the system. We have opportunities to use them more productively, but they are the right number of locomotives. Then I go down to the transportation plan changes that we've made. Those changes have been very specific and targeted towards eliminating the excess inventory off of the system. And then finally, we closed out with where Kenny started, working with our customers in partnership with them to reduce private car inventory. The faster we do all five of those, John, some of which have already been done, the faster we recover the system, and that's what everyone is focused on right now. And Brandon, when we look at that at a specific terminal perspective, Lance is exactly right. We not only have dwell right where we need it to be, it's a solid performance, especially relative to last year. But we also have excess capacity in those terminals. So as we continue to get more volume, we can handle that. Now we still want to be ready for that. So we have continued to put excess resources and an at-the-ready status. So they are not active, but they are available in the L.A. Basin. So as those surges come, we can handle them efficiently. I think you've covered it exactly right. We would be most focused on those leading indicators of terminal dwell, car velocity, train velocity and operating inventory. And that's what we report publicly, so whenever you can continue to see that progress that we will be making a week after week. No, we haven't guided to a specific time line. I would reinforce the fact that as we see the hiring pipeline, we're getting about 100 crews every single month. Those 100 crews are incredibly important to the recovery. But so are the other four things that I listed. So what you should know is right now, everyone is focused on that and they are focused on how do we do that as quickly as possible. Yes. So, thank you for the question. David, we will have the capacity to be able to host that additional volume. Now as we have been working through the on-boarding process, that's part of that process is to ensure that we are making the necessary investments. And it's not always capital investments. Oftentimes, it's just process improvements. For example, considering the fact of Knight-Swift and Schneider now having their own chassis, and how do we think about that and optimize our terminals to account for that? When I am out on the railroad, I see the output of those efforts. When I see us getting near completion on our G4 gantry cranes, when I see us buy an additional lift equipment, the work that we are doing on the Inland Empire and the Twin Cities Intermodal Terminal, those are all in response, not just Knight-Swift and Schneider, but to the entire volume and growth that we see coming and being ready for all of our customers to benefit from that. Yes. So, Brian, as you think about the recovery and what are we doing to de-risk that, I would first start off with just the basic fundamentals of, we are coming out of winter. We are coming out of a period of time where we have seen higher variability. As we come into spring, it's a period of time in which we have been more consistent, especially with the impact of weather. Second, we have mentioned it a couple of times, but it's really the most important thing as we sit here right now. If you look at previous times of service challenges, it's been in our terminals. We have been able to get the volume to the terminals, but then the volume in the terminal starts to slow the terminal. That's not the case right now. The case right now is that we have fluid terminals, both our large terminals, our serving yards and our locals getting to customers. That must stay that way. So, the way we think about bringing trains into the terminals and landing them on time, but also properly space so we can handle it, so we don't get a backlog. That's de-risking it. If you look at another way as we talked about crews, we are in the crew-preserving mode right now. We want to make sure that every crew we call counts. One of the ways we do that is with train length. So, if you go back all the way to January, we were sitting around 9,000 feet on a system average. We added 200 feet to that in January, another 200 feet in February and March and another 150 feet year-to-date. That's de-risking the recovery. That's ensuring that we are taking every opportunity we can to minimize the number of trains out on line of road. So, it's all activities like that, and that's what the entire team is focused on. And one of our biggest opportunities that we have been leveraging really for now almost a full year is we are active members on the White House Working Committee that allows us to interact with all the different stakeholders on the West ports. And what it is providing us is even better transparency into different events that are happening up chain that it comes down to us, it allows us to understand weeks, sometimes months out, on who we have to think about resourcing for that. And we will continue to be active in that because it continues to help the entire industry out in the West Coast. Yes, absolutely fair. Sure. Yes. Cherilyn, so if we look at our \u2013 I want to speak specifically to Chicago first, but the same would be true as we look at Memphis and as we look at even New Orleans. Right now, those all remain fluid from an intermodal perspective. That doesn't mean that we don't work through challenges on a day-to-day basis as we work through interchange issues. But we have strong relationships with the other carriers. We work through those issues. And right now, I am very happy with where those terminals are. If we were asking about one I am most focused on, it's just simply New Orleans, and it's always one that we are focused on the most because it's such a tight amount of track and operations in a really small area, but otherwise, no concerns at this point."

            "name": "Jennifer Hamann",
            "content": "Thanks, Eric and good morning. Let me start with a look at the first quarter operating ratio and earnings per share on Slide 13. As you heard from Lance, Union Pacific is reporting first quarter earnings per share of $2.57 and a quarterly operating ratio of 59.4%, 70 basis points of improvement. Comparing year-over-year first quarter results, you will recall that Winter Storm Yuri significantly impacted 2021. So in 2022, we have the positive effect to our operating ratio of 160 basis points and $0.16 to earnings per share. Rising fuel prices throughout the quarter, the lag on our fuel surcharge programs and widening spreads between WTI and highway diesel fuel prices negatively impacted our quarterly ratio by 80 basis points, while adding $0.12 per share. Core results were a 10 basis point drag to the operating ratio, but contributed $0.29 to EPS. These core results are indicative of both operational inefficiencies in the quarter as well as the strong top line growth we delivered. Looking now at our first quarter income statement on Slide 14, operating revenue totaled $5.9 billion, up 17% versus 2021 on 4% year-over-year volume growth. Operating expense increased 16% to $3.5 billion. Excluding the impact of higher fuel prices, expenses were up 7% in the quarter. First quarter operating income was a record at $2.4 billion, a 19% increase versus last year. Adjusted for fuel price, first quarter incremental margins totaled 56%. Expectations for full year incrementals are unchanged in the mid-60s, which is the lower end of our Investor Day guidance. Interest expense increased 6% compared to 2021, reflecting increased debt levels, partially offset by a lower effective interest rate. Income tax increased 18% due to higher pre-tax income partially offset by a lower effective tax rate. We now estimate the full year effective tax rate to be around 23.5% as several states have lowered or are expected to lower rates. Net income of $1.6 billion increased 22% versus 2021, which when combined with share repurchases, resulted in earnings per share up 29% to $2.57. Looking more closely at first quarter revenue, Slide 15 provides a breakdown of our freight revenue, which totaled $5.4 billion, up 17% versus 2021. Broad-based volume growth supported by successful business development efforts, as Kenny discussed, contributed 425 basis points. Fuel surcharge revenue of $635 million increased freight revenue 800 basis points as the higher surcharge revenue reflects the significant surge in diesel fuel prices. The robust demand environment continues to support actions that yield price dollars that exceed inflation dollars. These gains combined with the positive business mix to drive 475 basis points of freight revenue growth. Lower intermodal volume, combined with higher industrial shipments, drove the positive mix. Now, let's move on to Slide 16, which provides a summary of our first quarter operating expenses. As noted earlier, the primary driver of the increased expense was fuel, up 74% on a 59% increase in fuel prices and 9% higher gross ton miles. Our fuel consumption rate was relatively flat compared to 2021 as the favorable business mix was offset by negative productivity. Looking further at the expense lines, compensation and benefits expense was up 7% versus 2021. First quarter workforce levels increased 1% as a 2% increase in our train and engine crews were partially offset by flat management, engineering and mechanical workforces. As you heard from Eric, we continue to hire into our transportation crafts to support network recovery efforts and prepare for future growth. Cost per employee increased 6% as a result of wage inflation as well as higher recrew over time and borrow-out costs related to network inefficiencies partially offset by last year's weather-related expenses. Given the current operational challenges, we now expect cost per employee to remain elevated into the second quarter. Purchased services and material expense is up 14%, driven by inflation, higher volume-related purchase transportation expense associated with our Loop subsidiary and cost to maintain a larger active locomotive fleet. Equipment and other rents, was up 1% driven by lower TTX equity income. Other expense increased 5% in the quarter, driven by higher state and local taxes and increased business travel. Turning to Slide 17 and our cash flows, cash from operations in the first quarter increased to $2.2 billion from $2 billion in 2021, a 14% increase. Our cash conversion rate was 85% and free cash flow of $657 million declined $146 million. This includes $312 million of increased cash capital spending and $93 million in higher dividends. The cash capital investment reflects both payments from elevated fourth quarter spending as well as a normalized start to our 2022 program. In the quarter, we returned $3.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This includes the $2.2 billion accelerated share repurchase program executed in February. And we finished the first quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.8x as we continue to maintain a strong investment grade credit rating. Wrapping up on Slide 18, I want to start by recognizing that several things have changed since we provided guidance in January, from fuel prices to our operational performance. As we sit here today, those pressures make achievement of around a 55.5% operating ratio unlikely. However, assuming some stabilization in fuel and recovery in our service product, we will still look to achieve our long-term goals of an OR that starts with a 55 this year. Importantly, we are affirming our previously provided 2022 targets for volume, price and incremental margins. Our cash and capital plans also are unchanged. Capital spending remains at $3.3 billion for the year, well within our long-term guidance of below 15% of revenue, and we remain committed to an industry leading dividend payout ratio and share repurchases in line with 2021. Before I turn it back to Lance, I would like to express my appreciation to the Union Pacific team. Working in an outdoor factory is always a challenge, but especially so during winter. Our employees though are undeterred in their desire to safely serve our customers while delivering another quarter of solid financial results. Thank you. With that, I will turn it back to Lance. Yes. Excuse me, thanks, Justin, for that question. I believe you are thinking about it correctly. It really is going to be \u2013 we've got to make improvements sequentially in the second quarter and then really leverage that back half as we see stronger volume growth and have greater operational fluidity to be able to hit those targets. Obviously, fuel, we're assuming some moderation there, but that's really the operational performance. And the leverage to that volume growth that we know is there, the robust demand that Kenny talked about, I think that's very important. Now I also have to acknowledge that second quarter of last year was our best quarter ever as a company. And so that's going to be a very tough comparison for us. And in fact, I would be remiss to say that we think we're going to see improvement in the second quarter, but sequentially on a year-over-year basis. But sequentially, we should improve, and that will lead to greater improvement in the back half. Yes. That's really going to depend on the pace of the recovery. And \u2013 but I do think when we talked about volumes for the year, again, the first half was going to be driven by the bulk and industrial and the second half was going to be driven by more of that intermodal recovery and automotive recovery. While I think that's still largely the case, and you heard Kenny talk about the fact that there are some, I'll say, a little bit of headwinds or potential headwinds in terms of the international intermodal and the automotive recovery with what's happened in Ukraine and China. But you also have stronger natural gas prices into the back half of the year. So that's going to support that coal growth. So I still think you have that dynamic of a stronger second half overall in volume than you do in the first half. And in terms of Q2, we just need to really get the network fluid and try to move as much demand that sits there. You bet. Yes. So let me hit your first question there, Scott, in terms of sequentially. So the pricing environment continues to be very robust. There is really \u2013 that demand environment is there. But you do have \u2013 sequentially, the mix is negative going from fourth quarter to first quarter. And that's really mix within mix. So yes, bulk and industrial are up intermodal or the premium piece is still down. But when you look at where the growth was on the bulk side, it really was coal, very strong coal growth. But when you look at the arcs relative to the other components of bulk, coal has the lowest arc. So you've got that mix within mix impact. And you have a similar story within the industrial side when you look at where the growth was, and industrial strong across the board with the exception of Petroleum, but some of the strongest growth in metals, and that also has your lowest average revenue per car within that group. So that is the story in terms of the yield sequentially. When you look to the OR, fuel is certainly a headwind, but we see that headwind lessening through the year from an OR impact. And so we are looking at both the fuel and the operational performance, but the volume leverage. And that's the piece that I think maybe I need to stress the most with you all. And that's the piece that's within our control and the piece that we're working very diligently on, when we see stronger volumes coming in the second half, being able to leverage those very well with perhaps a little bit better mix. If you continue to have that industrial growth coming in a little bit stronger, I think that's how you get to the revised OR guidance. It's the latter that you say there. It's really a stabilization in the fuel price. And so we're catching up. And the fuel was going up a little bit in the second half of last year. So it's taking those two things together, Scott. No, that's a good clarifying question, Amit. When we talk to the incrementals, we're always talking about it in terms of normalizing for that fuel price. So that's comparable to the 56 that we reported here in the first quarter. Yes. So I mean, we do still see the price of fuel being a headwind in terms of our OR. As I talked to Scott, we see that lessening through the course of the year, but we don't see that OR impact flipping and being a tailwind to our OR. So your math that you said in terms of the last three quarters of the year in terms of OR, I don't know that I would necessarily agree with that. That seems fairly aggressive. But it is about seeing a stability in the fuel prices, which does allow the fuel surcharge, obviously, to catch up a bit. Absolutely. And that goes back to the commentary about volume leverage."

            "name": "Kenny Rocker",
            "content": "Thanks, Kenny and good morning. As I will discuss in greater detail in a few minutes, our service is not to a level that meets expectations and we acknowledge the impact that deteriorated service levels are having on our customers. We are implementing plans to restore network fluidity and build a safer, more reliable and resilient network. Safety results have been mixed to start the year as we implement enhancements to our safety programs through partnerships and guidance from our external safety consultant. We remain focused on achieving world class safety performance. We value the health and the safety of our employees above all and want all employees to return home safely each day. Now, let's review our key performance metrics for the quarter, starting on Slide 9. Freight car velocity and the related trip plan compliance measures were lower relative to 2021. Coming into the year, the network was in a more fluid state, seeing improvements in operating metrics and crew availability from reduced COVID infections. In late February, however, while the network was still fragile, episodic events challenge the team and our service product. This led to both decreased velocity and an increase in freight car inventory, particularly private cars, as resources were added to counteract sluggish service and meet growing customer demands. Turning now to Slide 10 although the overall network performance muted most of our efficiency metrics, we continue to operate a more efficient rail network compared to pre-PSR levels. Locomotive productivity declined 6% compared to first quarter 2021 due to locomotive utilization during the quarter. To assist and recover in the network, we also brought additional units online, further impacting our productivity results. First quarter workforce productivity improved 5% to a record 1,056 daily miles per FTE. We continue to hire for growth and normal attrition throughout the network. In 2021, we graduated over 250 new transportation employees with almost 400 employees graduated to-date in 2022. We have a strong training pipeline of roughly 500 employees as we work closer towards our goal of onboarding around 1,400 employees this year. We have, however, been challenged across the Northern region at several locations to meet our hiring targets. And we continue to work with our workforce resources partners to increase our hiring pools in those locations. Train length is essentially flat compared to one year ago. While continued soft international intermodal volumes present a headwind to train length initiatives, we continue to advance train length for coal and manifest trains, which both grew compared to first quarter 2021. These productivity efforts are key to enabling us to recover the network and deliver a better service product for our customers. Turning to Slide 11 and a discussion on our path forward, this chart illustrates the current state of operations. Our operating car inventory levels rose over 20% since the beginning of the year, while our 7-day volume levels remained relatively flat week to week. We are at an inflection point and more critical action is needed. Our terminals remained fluid and our focus on improving over-the-road operations and reducing the number of active trains on the network will ease mainline congestion. To accomplish this, we are taking actions on all fronts by selectively increasing network resources, collaborating with our unions, adjusting transportation plans and working proactively with customers to reduce the private car inventory buildup. The entire team is dedicated to returning the network to a more fluid operating state. Looking beyond some of today's issues, our goal is to build a more resilient and consistent network to meet the growth needs of our customers. With that, I will turn it over to Jennifer to review our financial performance. Yes. Hey, Ken. We sent out a letter to all of our customers. And so that gave us commercially an opportunity to have a conversation with all of our customers and make them aware of what we are trying to accomplish. I want to thank our commercial team and thank the customers for having those engaging conversations. We work with Eric's team to ensure we had really good data-driven conversations with the customers that could give us the best opportunity to reduce the railcar inventory. And so we have done that. Trust me there have been some difficult conversations. But I will tell you, I have been very encouraged with the initial response from our customers and their willingness to reduce their railcar inventory. So we will continue to have those discussions. We will continue to engage them and be transparent and utilize data. Yes. Thanks, Chris. You've set aside some of the macro things that we're delving on. We're keeping an eye on the inflation rates that are out there. Obviously, there have been some ups and starts with COVID disruptions in China. But when I look across each of our business teams, it's a very optimistic story. You look at our coal business, we talked about the two wins. None of us would have predicted that natural gas prices are as high as they are and are going to sustain where they are. Our grain business has been very strong. Last year was very strong. I tell you, the upside there is on the biofuels market and the grain products area, which is great. And then as we look throughout the rest of the year, we expect that export fertilizer demand will stay there. On the industrial side, really same story, I mean we have got some business development wins, but we've also just got some structural things that are helping us out. Metals has been very strong. There have been some expansions on the plastic side. Those markets are still recovering and have been very strong. We will keep an eye on housing starts. The inventories are still low. There is still a backlog of houses that need to be built, so our lumber and our paper business has been strong. And then on the premium side, our auto parts and finished vehicles business still is not where it should be. It's improving. We talk to some customers. Car dealership inventories are around 24, 25 days. We see that improving as we move throughout the year. On our international intermodal side, the amount that's going IPI has improved or improved in the first quarter. We had some customers in here recently. We're expecting them to turn on more of that volume. So the things that we can control, we feel really good about \u2013 domestic intermodal has been up, as I mentioned in my commentary. So from what we can control, we feel good about. We just got to keep an eye on some of these other things that are out of our control. Yes. They are out there and engaging the customer. Yes. Thanks, Ravi. A couple of questions there, and it sounds like demand and also the pricing environment. We're about 40%, almost close to halfway through our bid sessions on the domestic side, and it's been favorable versus last year. Last year was also a pretty a strong, solid year. Now the spot rates have gone down here recently. So we've got to keep an eye on that. But I'll tell you, the overall demand has not changed. And so we're going to continue to look at that over the next a few weeks as we're in those competitive bids. Again, we brought on the night swift business, but we do have more volume that coming on as we look at the back half of the year. The other thing is that we just need the supply chain to work itself out. Chassis dwell is still not really where it should be. The dwell of containers is not really where it should be. So we will see some improvement there. And then you made some comments about our primary competitor in the West. And I want to echo what Lance said. The pie is much larger than the primary competitors in the West. And we've had so much investment as you look at the ramps in Inland Empire, Twin Cities, everything we're doing with GPS. We want to compete with truck, and that's what we're focused on. Yes. I mean we feel really good about our strategy to go in and invest in our equipment that we have out there with EMP and UMAX. I talked about the GPS earlier. You have heard me talk about the chassis investment. We see that we can win across the board. We can win with the private asset side and with the IMC community, and we want to grow that pie. And so that's how we are thinking about it. As other private asset carriers are out there, we will engage them on their strategy. But clearly, we don't want to put any limits on anything that would inhibit growth. That's good. Yes. Yes. We have a number of customers that have always wanted to know where we are on ESG and sustainability component. And we are seeing in the RFPs and the formal RFP more focus there. Those customers are typically in the petrochem area, more customers that have \u2013 that are, I will call them, consumer-facing type customers. So, we do know that it's in their methodology. I will tell you the other thing is that our commercial team is sitting down with our customers and walking through the value that we provide by them moving Union Pacific and actually selling that. So, yes, it's more awareness on the customer part and more proactive engagement from our commercial team to fill that as part of our value proposition. Yes. The \u2013 I mean I think you hit it on the head, I would say. And I am looking at Eric as I say that we feel good about the condition of our intermodal network as it stands today. We have been working very closely with the customers to make sure that we have a really clear forecast of what's coming towards us. We have been through the technology where we can to do that. But yes, these tough are out of China. We have got to keep an eye on it because there is going to be another slug of containers that are coming to us. Yes. Thanks a lot, Ben. Yes, on the coal side, again, you have got two different things. You have got some business development wins and you also have the natural gas prices. Certainly, we didn't predict last year that the natural gas prices would be in the $7 range. And as it stands here today, I will tell you, I \u2013 it's encouraging that, that forecast is throughout the rest of the year. As we talk to our customers, we don't see that they have made any capital investment per se in terms of trying to get more of that out of the ground. But we do know that they have done quite a bit of hiring to get more utility and get more product out. And so we are working with them on that, and we stay very connected with Eric's team from a forecast perspective. And then yes, I understand your perspective with petroleum. And what you should think about is just a part of that, that's not here this year is our crude oil business. And those spreads between Canada and call it, the Gulf for Texas are just not where it should be. And so that's the impact that you are seeing there. We do see, to your point, the drilling show up in other commodities. We are seeing a lot of drilling pipe, OCTG, that's moving. I talked about the frac sand. There are some other industrial chemicals that go into the drilling process that we are seeing. So, that's where that's showing up on our railroad. Absolutely. It's interesting that you would bring that up on the international intermodal side. It's hard to tell what's going to be a one-off versus a permanent change from, I will call it, directional shipment of international intermodal. We have worked with an international carrier here where we do have a move that's coming East to West. And so we are excited about that move. And again, we will see what happens there from a permanent basis. Yes, I believe that some of the global disruptions will make our customers think about where they source from. And we are hearing more conversations about near-shoring. We have not seen those investments to really mirror those conversations. And then as you \u2013 I think the last question was about the Ukraine and those thoughts there, we are always talking to our customers about solutions that we can provide them. So, when you think about the six border access, Mexico is clearly one. I just gave you an example of going from East to West. We still feel very good about our products moving off the West Coast, and we have got really solid relationship from anything that wants to come out of Canada. So, we are prepared. We have got $600 million in investment on our intermodal network. So, we are prepared for more growth."

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jim Vena, Chief Executive Officer for Union Pacific. Mr. Vena, you may now begin.\nJim Vena: Thanks, Rob. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Union Pacific's fourth quarter and full year results. I'm joined in Omaha by our Chief Financial Officer, Jennifer Hamann, our Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Kenny Rocker and our Executive Vice President of Operations, Eric Gehringer. The Union Pacific team is executing our multiyear strategy to lead the industry in safety, service and operational excellence. Our fourth quarter shows a lot of what's possible and demonstrate that we're on the right path to achieving those goals. We exited 2023 with strong momentum, which gives me great confidence that we have a winning strategy. There's work to do, but we're building the foundation for future success. Now let's turn to Slide 3. This morning, Union Pacific reported 2023 fourth quarter net income of $1.7 billion or $2.71 per share. This compares to 2022 fourth quarter net income of $1.6 billion or $2.67 per share. Fourth quarter operating revenue was flat as increased volumes and core pricing gains were offset by lower fuel surcharge revenue and business mix. Expenses year-over-year were also flat as lower fuel expenses and productivity gains were offset by inflation, volume-related costs and higher casualty expenses. Our fourth quarter operating ratio of 60.9% improved 10 basis points versus last year. And more importantly, we demonstrated strong sequential OR improvement of 250 basis points from the third quarter. We are taking the right actions to increase the efficiency of our railroad while also improving service for our customers. Key to our strategy is excelling in what we control. We made great progress in those areas this quarter. That provides further proof that we're on the right path for future success. So with that, let me hand it over to Jennifer to provide more details on the fourth quarter and full year financials.\nJennifer Hamann: Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Let's begin by walking through our fourth quarter income statement on Slide 5. Starting with the top line. Operating revenue of $6.2 billion was flat versus 2022 on a 3% volume increase. Breaking it down further, freight revenue totaled $5.8 billion, up 1%. The biggest driver of freight revenue in the quarter was fuel. Lower year-over-year fuel prices reduced fuel surcharge revenue and impacted freight revenue 375 basis points as fuel surcharges declined $180 million versus 2022 to $795 million. Volume growth in the quarter contributed positively, adding 350 basis points to freight revenue, and the combination of price and mix also was positive, increasing freight revenue, 75 basis points as solid core pricing gains were mostly offset by an unfavorable business mix. Intermodal shipments up 5% contributed heavily to the mix dynamic. Wrapping up the top line, other revenue decreased 13%, driven by lower accessorial and subsidiary revenue. Switching to expenses, we provided expense details for both fourth quarter and full year in our appendix slides. But let me hit some of the highlights. Against our 3% volume growth, operating expense of $3.8 million was flat. Digging deeper into a few of the expense lines, compensation and benefits expense was flat compared to 2022. Fourth quarter workforce levels decreased 2%, while our active TE&Y workforce was flat against the 3% volume growth. This solid level of workforce productivity mostly offset wage inflation as cost per employee only increased 1% in the fourth quarter. Fuel expense in the quarter decreased 11% on a 15% decrease in fuel prices from $3.70 per gallon to $3.16. Our fuel consumption rate deteriorated 3% as we moved a less fuel-efficient business mix with increased intermodal shipments and fewer coal moves. Finally, other expense grew 20% as a result of higher casualty costs and the comparison to 2022, which included insurance recoveries. Coming out of COVID, we had a sizable case backlog that we largely worked through the last couple of years. Importantly, we do not see these elevated expenses as a reflection of a long-term trend, particularly with our intense focus on improving safety. Fourth quarter operating income was flat at $2.4 billion. Below the line, other income increased $16 million due to higher real estate gains. Fourth quarter net income of $1.7 billion and earnings per share of $2.71, both improved 1% versus 2022. Our operating ratio of 60.9% improved 10 basis points year-over-year and 250 basis points sequentially. Moving to Slide 6 with a quick recap of full year 2023 results. Revenue of $24.1 billion declined 3% driven by reduced fuel surcharges, business mix and lower volumes, partially offset by core pricing gains. Operating income totaled $9.1 billion and our full year operating ratio of 62.3% deteriorated 220 basis points. Earnings per share of $10.45 decreased 7% versus 2022 and then reflecting the impact of our overall financial results, return on invested capital declined 180 basis points to 15.5%. Turning to shareholder returns and the balance sheet on Slide 7. Full year 2023 cash from operations totaled $8.4 billion, down roughly $1 billion from 2022. The combination of lower net income and nearly $450 million of labor agreement payments were the main drivers. Free cash flow and our cash flow conversion rate also reflected those impacts. We returned $3.9 billion to shareholders in 2023 through dividends and share repurchases. Our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio finished the year at three times as we continue to prioritize a strong balance sheet and be A rated by our 3 credit agencies. While 2023 was a difficult year, I'm pleased with the progress we've made over the last several months to improve our service and productivity. We believe this performance marks an inflection point as efforts to improve the efficiency of our railroad through safety, service and operational excellence is starting to be reflected in our financials. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Kenny to provide some comments on 2023 and kick off our commentary on 2024.\nKenny Rocker: Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning. You just heard from Jennifer that freight revenue was up 1% in the quarter as our volume gains of 3% were partially offset by lower fuel surcharges. So let's jump right into the business teams to recap the market drivers on the revenue slide. Starting with bulk, revenue for the quarter was flat compared to 2022, driven by a 3% increase in volume, offset by a 2% decrease in average revenue per car. Core pricing gains were more than offset by lower fuel surcharges and the unfavorable impact of low natural gas prices on our index-based coal contracts. Fertilizer shipments grew compared to 2022 as demand for fuel application was strong due to lower nitrogen prices. Grain product shipments were up for the quarter as our team secured new feedstock opportunities for renewable diesel production in Louisiana and California. Additionally, ethanol shipments increased with our improved service. Lastly, coal continued to be challenged in the fourth quarter due to mild weather and decreased coal competitiveness from low natural gas prices. Industrial revenue was up 4% in the quarter, driven by a 3% increase in volume. Core pricing gains in the quarter were mostly offset by lower fuel surcharges and a negative mix in volume. Business development in our petroleum and LPG commodity segments contributed to the growth. Demand improved for our plastics business in both export and domestic markets. However, sand volumes were negatively impacted by softer natural gas prices that reduced drilling in the Eagle Ford Basin and increased utilization of in-basin sand in the DJ Basin. Premium revenue for the quarter was down 3% on a 4% increase in volume and a 7% decrease in average revenue per car from lower fuel surcharges and truck market pressures. Automotive volumes were negatively impacted by the UAW strike, but those decreases were mostly offset by dealer inventory replenishment and business development wins that I mentioned on the last quarter's call. Intermodal volumes were positive in the quarter, driven by stronger West Coast imports, domestic business development wins and strengthen our Mexico volumes. Now let's start talking about 2024. Here are some key economic indicators that we're watching this year on Slide 10. These are S&P's forecast from their January report, and you'll notice that it shows a mixed picture for 2024. Industrial production looks to be flat. Housing starts are expected to remain challenged, but demand for auto continues to be strong. Turning to Slide 11. Here is our 2024 outlook as we see it today for the key markets we serve. Starting with bulk, we anticipate continued challenges in coal as natural gas futures remain volatile and inventories are high. Domestic grain is relatively stable, but we are keeping a watchful eye on export demand. On a brighter note, we expect fertilizer to be strong as repair that Canpotex Portland facility are now complete and commodity prices remain competitive moving into the spring season. And growth within biofuels continues to be driven by strong demand outlook, combined with a heavy focus on capturing new business, including incremental volume secured from Minnesota and Iowa origins. Moving on to Industrial. The construction market will be challenged to exceed last year's record volumes as we're seeing softness in parts of the market. However, we foresee the petroleum and petrochem market remaining favorable due to our focus on business development. And finally, for premium on the international intermodal side, we expect the market to improve year-over-year, but a contract we lost earlier in 2023 will negatively impact our 2024 volumes. On the domestic side, we are staying close with our customers who have indicated that they'll see a soft start to the year. Nonetheless, our strong service product sets us up to handle market demand. And for automotive, we will see strength in this market with improved OEM production and business development wins. In summary, the economic environment continues to look muted in 2024, particularly in the first half. We're off a slower start in January based on severe winter storms and market challenges we're seeing in coal and intermodal. But I am encouraged that we expect to see growth in some markets with our strong focus on business development. For the second half, we are well prepared to handle the demand if the market and economy improves. We continue to make significant capital investments on both the carload and intermodal front to capture more freight over the road. Those investments, along with our unmatched service offerings and improved service products from Eric's team create a winning environment for our customers. I'm excited for the opportunities in front of us, and our commercial team is ready to help our customers win in the marketplace. And with that, I'll turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance.\nEric Gehringer: Thank you, Kenny, and good morning. Moving to Slide 13. To start, I want to express my appreciation to the team for their relentless focus on improving our service product and driving network efficiency. It's thanks to their efforts that our network showed tremendous fluidity and reliability during the fourth quarter. Freight car velocity improved 14% to 217 miles per day compared to fourth quarter 2022. Increased train velocity and a reduction in terminal dwell drove that performance. Service was strong during the quarter as we saw a significant 12-point improvement in both intermodal and manifest and auto trip plan compliance. In addition to trip plan compliance, we have hundreds of customer-specific performance metrics that also showed great improvement throughout the quarter. Most importantly, we are delivering the service we sold to our customers, which is critical to our long-term growth strategy. While winter is here and has certainly brought its challenges, the railroad overall is very healthy, and I'm confident the team will continue its positive momentum. Safety continues to be the foundation of everything we do. During the quarter, we delivered improved derailment performance through our investments in technology and process. We remain focused on the critical actions that drive real change. So everyone goes home safely each day. Now let's review our key efficiency metrics for the quarter on Slide 14. During the fourth quarter, we saw year-over-year improvement across all of our efficiency metrics. Locomotive productivity improved 14% versus fourth quarter 2022 and 9% sequentially as we continue to identify and execute on opportunities to utilize the fleet more efficiently. Throughout the second half of 2023, we stored nearly 500 units from our operable fleet. Workforce productivity improved 4% compared to fourth quarter 2022. With a strong crew base, we are focused on effectively managing workforce levels to the demands of the business. However, challenges do remain from scheduled work agreements that in the near term, require additional employees. Train length improved 2% compared to fourth quarter 2022 as we continue to remove car touch points from the system. In total, throughout 2023, we were successful in extending train length as improvements in the second half more than offset the declines in intermodal shipments. We remain persistent in our focus on train length to drive productivity while providing a better service product to our customers. As we move into 2024, we will continue to transform our railroad through a variety of technology initiatives and targeted capital investments designed to further improve safety, improve our service product, enhance resource utilization and ultimately lower our cost structure. So to wrap up, let's review our capital outlook for 2024 on Slide 15. We are targeting capital spending of $3.4 billion in 2024. Similar to 2023, we will support safe and productive operations by investing in our infrastructure and renewing our older assets. This includes modernizing locomotives and acquiring freight cars to support replacement and growth opportunities. We are also investing in technology and terminal and mainline capacity projects to improve productivity. Specific to our technology investments, we recently cut over NetControl, replacing our 50-year-old transportation management system. This cutover positions us to use real-time analytics to open new capabilities for Union Pacific and our customers. Great work led by our technology team. On the growth front, we will continue to invest in projects that expand our intermodal footprint and support business development in targeted high-growth areas such as Inland Empire, Kansas City and Phoenix to name a few. So with that, I'll turn it back to Jennifer to lay out our initial financial thoughts for 2024.\nJennifer Hamann: Thanks, Eric. Turning to Slide 17. Let me start by pointing out that we added a new appendix slide that contains several of the 2024 modeling assumptions that should be helpful to everyone in framing our current expectations. As you heard from Kenny, it's a difficult market to forecast, as economic indicators show a muted and uncertain economy. Throwing a couple of other variables such as what the Fed might or might not do with interest rates and a presidential election, and we've got an interesting year ahead. On top of the macro pressures, lower coal demand and some lost international intermodal business are expected to negatively impact our volume. And as you've seen in the weekly carload data, January is off to a slow start as cold temperatures across our system impacted operations and volume with first quarter volume down 9% year-to-date. I am confident, however, that our strong and improving service product will allow us to capture available demand. We clearly demonstrated that in the fourth quarter as we took advantage of the unexpected but short-term surge in intermodal. More certain than the economy is our expectation to generate pricing dollars in excess of inflation dollars even with ongoing headwinds from certain intermodal contracts. With those pressures, we do not expect price to be accretive to margins in this year. Key for UP in 2024 is our ability to control the controllables by driving a strong safety culture, making ongoing service gains and improving network efficiency. We're confident that regardless of the demand environment, we will take the necessary actions to run a more efficient network. Finally, with capital allocation, there is no change to our long-term strategy. We are investing $3.4 billion back into the railroad as Eric detailed. Next, we prioritize our industry-leading dividend payout and then excess cash will be returned to shareholders through share repurchases. However, given first quarter debt maturities of $1.3 billion, we will not be repurchasing shares in the first quarter. It's always difficult in late January to make predictions for the year ahead, and this year is no different. There are clearly ongoing challenges from a macro and inflationary perspective. What is very encouraging though, as we start out 2024 is our momentum, which you've heard us mention several times today. We demonstrated with our fourth quarter performance, what's possible, and we look forward to further improvement in the year ahead. With that, let me turn it back to Jim.\nJim Vena: Thank you, Jennifer. Let's turn to Slide 19. Before we get to your questions, I'd like to quickly summarize what you've heard from our team. Kenny outlined our view on the upcoming year. Our volume outlook today reflects headwinds from lost business, coal demand and relatively soft economic forecast. Much of that is out of our control. We are mitigating these impacts through business development and value creation by providing great service to our customers. Eric described the progress we've made to return our service levels to industry best, while there's work to do, the team made consistent improvement through the quarter to exit in a very fluid state. Obviously, winter is here, but that's part of railroading. I judge our success by how we minimize the impact on our customers and how quickly we recover the network. So far, we've grown - we've shown great resiliency. Finally, as Jennifer laid out, our productivity and pricing gains will be key to overcoming ongoing inflationary pressures in 2024 as well as the soft economy. While many unknowns remain, I'm confident we'll succeed in the areas we control. We've got plenty of opportunities this year to improve safety, service and operational excellence. As you heard me say in October, I came back to Union Pacific to win. My vision and the opportunity I see for this company has not changed. We have the right team and strategy in place to grow this railroad long term, and I'm very confident we'll see a better Union Pacific in the future. We're now ready to take your questions. Rob?\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Vena. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Wetherbee: Thanks. Good morning. Maybe if I could ask just sort of the outlook for 2024. As you sit here, it sounds like a muted macro environment is keeping you cautious. But I guess when you think about the opportunities that you have, can volume be up this year? I know some of the macro indicators that you highlighted are muted, but they are still positive. So curious about volume growth. And I guess, in that context, with pricing maybe not necessarily being accretive to margin. Is there enough in that volume and some of the cost efficiencies that you guys are working on to get margin expansion?\nJennifer Hamann: So Chris, maybe let me start and then Kenny can give you some more color. I mean we're just not going to give you a number in terms of what we think can happen with volumes because of what you yourself said. There's just a lot of uncertainty, and we just don't think it's prudent sitting here at the end of January to give you some sort of a forecast based on hopes for a second half recovery. Do we hope that, that will happen? And are we going to work diligently to move every piece of business that's there? Absolutely. And I think you really saw what the network can do with our fourth quarter performance, but we just need to see a little more certainty. And hopefully, that plays out through the year, and we can provide that. But sitting here today, we just don't see that. But Kenny, maybe talk about your margin...\nKenny Rocker: I talked about it in my opening comments, there's a mixed bag of opportunities that are in front of us. We feel really good about the biofuels market. That market is growing. Demand is growing. We're capturing business in those markets. On the industrial side, we've had some record year on the construction side, still be a strong year. But as we are coming out of the gate with weather, that's going to be a little bit challenged for us. We feel really good about our petrochem business and wins that we've had from a business development perspective. On the petroleum and LPG side, those are all positive for us. On our premium business, again, those are really economic driven. And so we'll be looking to see what happens with demand overall. I talked about the international intermodal side and the loss there. We feel really encouraged by our ability to win on the auto side. And you heard us talk about Volkswagen [ph] win in last quarter. And so as there's a lot of demand there and the forecast for growth there, we really feel good about that market.\nChris Wetherbee: Anything on the margins?\nJennifer Hamann: I'm sorry?\nJim Vena: Margins?\nChris Wetherbee: Anything on the margins?\nJennifer Hamann: On margins. Again, I'm not - this might become a broken record, I hope not. But I mean, we are not going to give specific guidance. I mean we're going to do everything we can as much as we can. And again, you saw what we did in the fourth quarter. But every kind of other guidance I would give is going to be predicated on what I think is going to happen with volumes, and we just don't have that clarity. And I don't think it's prudent to do that sitting here today.\nChris Wetherbee: Got it. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it.\nJim Vena: Chris, let me just maybe just try to put this all into a box of the way we're thinking. It's very difficult for us to look forward and say this is exactly the way the year is going to go. More important to me and the team is, what have we done operationally? And what are we doing to provide Kenny and the entire team, the capability to go out there and maximize what's available for us and what we can bring on to this railroad. And for me, that's the single most important thing. I think what we've shown is the capability to flex up. We have the assets to be able to flex up. We have the capacity to be able to flex up. And if we continue to drive the efficiency of the railroad, which I expect we will, then what we do is we win in the marketplace. And whatever is out there, we're going to compete against everybody else, trucks and other railroads, and we think we have a winning model, so that's the challenge we have. And it would be truly there would be a mistake for us to come out and say, because I can't tell what's going to happen, like Jennifer pointed out with the inputs and the effects from interest rates and everything else that's happening in the economy. But I'm very comfortable that we are going to maximize what's available for Union Pacific and win.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nWalter Spracklin: Yes. Thanks very much, operator. Good morning, everyone. On the intermodal side, I know there was a business loss there. And - but looking at some of the statistics in LA Long Beach, there seems to be a really good uptick in volumes into those regions or that region. Red Sea impact, perhaps East Coast is down. Kenny, are you seeing that there is new business coming that way? And could that be a nice offset to any business loss? Or could it create an opportunity for a business - more business wins as more volume shifts to LA Long Beach and perhaps the fluidity of LA Long Beach is that keeping pace with the new volume mix coming its way?\nKenny Rocker: Yes. So thank you, Walter. We spent a lot of time looking at the global supply chains in the canals and so forth. I'll tell you right now in the near term, we haven't seen any significant shifts. We've been talking to our - the vessel carrier owners. We know they put in tariffs, our customers have put in tariffs to go over the Panama Canal, for example. And so we've been working with them to move as much as we can with the network that we have, with the match-back opportunities that we have, with the reload opportunities that we have, with the new products that we have on the - with the Houston lanes that Eric has given us to give our customers every reason to go to the West Coast. So what we have seen is we are seeing more going IPI, and we have a very efficient service network to accomplish that. We're happy about the customers that we have that have been able to grow in that market. And then finally, we have a great network where the service, we're able to capture that and get all of that business that's out there.\nJim Vena: That' true, Kenny as we think about that because to your point, you can't predict the future with entire clarity. It's another reminder, Walter of the fact that when we talk about having a buffer and you look at what we did in the fourth quarter, we generated the ability to make sure we have that buffer. That buffer in locomotives, that buffer in railcars positioned in LA. So in the event the volume is there, we've supported Kenny's team to be able to actually capture it.\nWalter Spracklin: And the fluidity in the terminals right now? Is it - how would you assess that?\nKenny Rocker: Very fluid. As you saw in the fourth quarter, 14% improvement in car velocity doesn't come unless you've got very fluid operations. Now to Jim's point, are there opportunities? Of course, there are. In fact, I'll talk about those as we go through this. But overall, right now, yes, very fluid.\nWalter Spracklin: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. So it seems like you're framing this as there's things we can control and things we can't control. It strikes me that over time, the industry has been able to have some control over price. And you're talking about inflation up 5% and right now, yield x fuel is only up 1%, right? So it just seems we need more price. Can we get more price? I don't know. How do we think about that? And then can you just clarify like this international intermodal contract, when did we lose that? Because it sounded like it happened sometime in '23, but we just - we're seeing really good intermodal growth. So I'm a little confused with why we're flagging this is such a big issue right now. Thank you.\nKenny Rocker: Thanks, Scott, I got both of those. Thank you. So first of all, you're exactly right. Prices are controllable. And let me make this clear. It's not like we are jumped up here and waited till January 1 to look at price. We've been going down this path here for a few months. You've heard Jennifer and I say that we have a set amount, call it, almost half that we can touch from a pricing standpoint. Our commercial team has really been very effective sitting down with customers, talking to them about the improved service product, talking to them about our increased inflationary pressures that we saw from the labor side and how Eric is leveraging that to improve the service products that we give them. They're seeing the same input. They're seeing the same increases. I've been meeting with customers. And so they know that. So yes, we control a portion of that, and so we've been very focused on articulating that story. I think you had a question on the international side. And yes, you're correct. We lost some of that earlier in the year, last year. The bulk of that will still be working through in 2024.\nJennifer Hamann: But just to your question, Scott, I think what Kenny is talking about with that loss, that kind of goes to our discipline when it comes to price and making sure that the business that's on our railroad is running at acceptable margins. Sometimes that doesn't happen and we might lose a piece of business.\nKenny Rocker: Yes. I mean with the service product, when the investments that you heard Eric talk about this morning, the margins have to be acceptable to be on the network.\nJim Vena: Well, I hate to always recap these, and I won't. But let me recap this, Scott for you. So inflation, when I was - the first call that I had in October, I was pretty clear that we are going to deal with the inflationary pressure that is presented for us that we have to tackle, and we're doing it two ways. We are dealing with it on a price - from the price side, and we're also dealing with it on the efficiency side. And I think we have a clear view. This is not a short-term 3 months you can fix it on the price side and even on the efficiency side, we've seen improvements in efficiency, and you can see that from the number. And I think there's more available for us on the efficiency side from how we operate our trains, the fluidity and the terminals, how we use our people, and we did a really good job. The team did a fantastic job in the fourth quarter, and I expect it to get better as we go through the year. So those two things we're tackling head on. We're not being shy about it. We're being straight. I've met with a lot of customers in groups and in small and I've been clear about what the pressures are and what we're going to do about it moving forward. But at the end, we want our customers to win in the marketplace. We want them to win. So we're being smart about how we price and what level and it's different for different marketplaces, and that's how we're handling it. But I'm excited. I think we overcome this year, by the end of the year, we'll see ourselves in a different position.\nScott Group: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nTom Wadewitz: Yeah, good morning. So Jim, you've seen - you realized a very fast and positive response in terms of the rail network operations since you've been at UP. Where do you think you're at in terms of kind of further improvements? So I don't know if you want to look at like locomotives, what the active fleet is and where it can go to. Maybe if you could comment a little bit on headcount. I think that the headcount was down pretty meaningfully sequentially. So I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of kind of are we at the stable level now after that really quick improvement? Or our headcount and active locomotive fleet going to have further steps down as we go into '24?\nJim Vena: Well, listen, thanks for the question. So the way I see it is this. I think there's more on the railroad to become more efficient. And the concentration is a little different than the last time I was here and a little different than what we just were able to do in the fourth quarter. I think there's opportunity in speed and car velocity that will help us be able to move the railcars faster, use a few less locomotives and be able to keep the network more fluid. But the real big piece for us and what we're going to concentrate on, and we think there's a capability to be much better is how fast we operate our terminals and the fluidity through the terminals to be able to have the products. Now it's just not in the transportation piece. We are looking at ways on the engineering side, how we do maintenance, how we do capital work on the mechanical side, how we - what it costs us to perform overhauls, every piece of the network is still there. So I think there's still more left on that piece to be able to do.\nTom Wadewitz: Can you offer a thought on how that translates to headcount? Do we think headcount goes down further? Or is it kind of stable at current level?\nJim Vena: Well, the challenge we have with headcount is we signed some collective agreements and you live with what was given to you. And some of those collective agreements put pressure on headcount. They put pressure on - from both the time off, the sick benefit time off that we provided. We had some weekends when the football game were on that we have like an extra 15%, 20% people all got sick at the same time. So we need to be able to figure out how to deal with that, and we'll do that as we move ahead. It must have been a real bad weekend, right? At the same time as one of their playoff games was on. But at the end of the day, those are stumbling - those are blocks that we have to get over this year. And what we showed in the fourth quarter is with all that, all the pluses and all the headwinds we had on headcount, we were able to keep the headcount and reduce it overall in the company. And there is no reason for us not to continue to do that. We will look for every opportunity. And sorry, I can't give you a specific number because this is a moving target. As we move ahead, we're implementing new agreements through this year. So it will be noisy. It won't be a straight tangent down. The scope won't be perfect. It will be a little up and down, but I'm very comfortable that we have the programs, the processes in place to be able to correct that and have the way which is less people handling the same amount of business.\nTom Wadewitz: Great. Thank you.\nJim Vena: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nJon Chappell: Thank you. Good morning. I was going to ask this anyway. I guess it's a perfect follow-up and maybe it's just reading between the lines. So when Eric mentioned some of the challenges remaining from the work agreements that required additional employees, I mean, it was noticeable to me that you stressed near term. So is this just - is there a time where this anniversaries, where you could be a lot more flexible based on the volume environment? Or was the stress on near term kind of related to what you were just mentioning, Jim, you're putting programs in place, you're trying to address it and that you hope at some point, you can kind of reverse that trend?\nJim Vena: Yes. In the - in 2024, we have dates of implementation for the agreements that we have not implemented completely. And those are pressures on the number of people that we would need to operate. So that will be through 2024, and that's why I've always talked about this is a - I see this as a 2-year adjustment to the railroad to be able to get there. But we do have programs in place as we implement, we run into things if we operate as efficiently as I think we can, we'll mitigate that. You mitigate it by running less trains, having more cars on the same trains. We grow. We put more cars on the same trains instead of starting more. We use the people and the facilities that we have more efficiently. So - but it's a 2024 headwind for us that we are going to overcome just like we did in the fourth quarter.\nJennifer Hamann: Well, just a reminder, Jon, we only have the work rest [ph] agreement in place with the BLET. We're still negotiating with SMART-TD.\nJim Vena: Correct.\nJon Chappell: Okay. Thank you, Jennifer. Thanks, Jim.\nJim Vena: You're welcome.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nJim Vena: Good morning.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks. Hey, guys. Hey, morning. Congrats on the good results. Jennifer, I want to come back to the 5% inflation. So you've got a $15 billion cost structure that basically translates to like $750 million of higher costs in '24. I assume that's a gross number because you've done - you guys have done a phenomenal job actually lowering the cost structures as we move from 3Q to 4Q. So is there any help you can give us in terms of how you think about that gross 5% translates to kind of like a net cost number in the context of the revenue outlook?\nJennifer Hamann: Yes. No. I mean, you've got that exactly right, Amit. The 5% is the gross number. So that's our challenge, right, and opportunity is to offset that with productivity. And so that's where you heard Jim talk, you heard Eric mention, we have those opportunities in virtually every cost category, I'll put depreciation aside, that's kind of fixed for the year. But we absolutely have opportunities to offset that in terms of how we run the railroad. And I think just think about wage inflation and think about fourth quarter. So we had wage inflation first half of this year. Our wages are going to be up 4%. For our Union Personnel [ph] it's going to go to 4.5% in the second half, but our cost per employee was only up 1% in the fourth quarter. So that's productivity that's enabling us to offset some of that. And so that's the task of this management team, and that's those controllables that we talked about, and that's where we're very much focused.\nAmit Mehrotra: But is there any help? Like, I mean, can you offset half of it? Can you offset 40% of it? Like because that's obviously critical to understanding the EBIT and the margin outlook, which I know is highly uncertain, but at least give us some sense of how much you can offset that gross number by in your opinion?\nJennifer Hamann: You also know, Amit, that the volumes play a role in that in terms of how we're able to leverage and build longer trains and have more work to put up against some of those inflationary costs. So that's our challenge, but I'm really not going to be able to give you any more than that.\nAmit Mehrotra: Okay. I thought I'd try anyways. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.\nJennifer Hamann: Thank you.\nJim Vena: Good question. Nice try. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi, good morning. So obviously, service is improving here. Just in terms of customer engagement, any color on sort of the pipeline of opportunities? Is it starting to accelerate? Are there unique opportunities? And I guess along with that, are you seeing any improvement in some of the conversion of some opportunities out there? Just any thoughts. Thanks.\nJim Vena: Allison, let me start and then Kenny, please jump in. So if we look at this railroad that we are blessed with that we operate, and I think you've seen some of the steps we've taken is you have to provide a level of service that we sold to our customers, and that's our goal, and we work real hard every day to do that. We operate the railroad very efficiently. Where's the opportunity? We have a mix of traffic that's available to us that originates on our railroad, so when I go around the entire railroad, I'm very comfortable that we offset and we have the capability to offset and we are tackling, whether it's that industrial complex all the way from New Orleans to Brownsville, Texas, whether it's the grain, whether it's the soda ash, whether it's the intermodal at the West Coast and our speed. We are able to provide speed for customers that require speed and not all of them do. We can go from LA to Texas, a close to 2,000 mile journey and we do that in 48 hours. So that's truck like. So - and our service that we put on from Mexico going into Eastern Canada, partnering with CN and ourselves into the East plus into Chicago is unparalleled. We can do it as fast as anybody. So there's lots of opportunity out there for us. And what we have to do is with good service, the customers will see what's possible, and they will want to partner with Union Pacific and grow their business with us versus anybody else. Kenny?\nKenny Rocker: Yes. So first of all, we have a robust business development pipeline. It's a healthy one. It's an encouraging one. We're excited about the pipeline in front of us, so a lot of opportunities there. The main thing I want to start with is our service product is in a strong position. And so as we talk about the service that we sold to customers, you look at some of the markets, just to get a little bit more detail here. Look at coming out of Mexico, that's a service product that Eric has given us daily. That's undisputed and unmatched coming out of Mexico. It's the fastest product. It's also a product that is on time. You look at the West Coast and someone asked me a question earlier, we're blessed with a network where we can pitch and we can catch. We can pitch coming out of the West Coast as we onboard and on dock. We've got a strong IPI. We can catch in the Inland Empire. We built that up. We put investments there, and we've shared with you that we've got plans to really grow in that area. And with the network and the service product we have, we're expecting to grow. If you look at the carload side, you've heard us talk about some of the wins in the auto side. I talked about the petrochem side. That's a great network down in the Gulf Service Park [ph] is improving. Our commercial leaders, commercial teams are sitting out there and talking to customers about taking a little bit more truck off the road. So we're bullish on getting out there and growing as the service product is there, and we're investing in the network.\nAllison Poliniak: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good morning. And thanks for taking my question. Eric, I wanted to come back to you because I think in response to an earlier question, you spoke about, there's still more to come on things like velocity and train length. And then I think Jim even alluded to some local service plan changes. So do you want to elaborate a little bit more on where you see productivity gains this year?\nEric Gehringer: Absolutely. So you mentioned car velocity, so let's start there. As you're thinking about 2024 and what's in front of us, you saw what we did in the fourth quarter, a 14% improvement, 217 miles per day. That becomes a floor. A floor that is we work every single day, as was mentioned before, we're working to improve that. Now if you peel that back and you say, okay, within that, where do you see the biggest opportunities? You mentioned train length, so we can start there. Train length is an opportunity, always has been and candidly always will be because the railroad is dynamic. Train length comes in two forms. The first one, Kenny just gave a great example of Inland Empire, where we're bringing more volume onto the railroad. I already have an existing train, and we can just tack it onto the back of that. The other way that it comes is in our actual transportation plan changes that we make. An example of that is the one that Kenny brought up with Mexico. When you think about that being two trains before and now we're consolidating that traffic into one, it allows us to drive productivity that way. After that, the fluidity drives our locomotive fleet. There's other factors, but at the very core of it, it is about fluidity. We took out 500 units out of the system in the second half of last year, a little bit because of volume, but the vast, vast majority of it because of fluidity, continuing that work allows us to continue to rightsize the fleet. And we don't talk a lot about purchase services on these calls, but purchase service is a big opportunity for us, whether you're thinking about how many vehicles do we have on this railroad to operate it, whether we think about how much fuel that we're using. We also have opportunities on the casualty side. As Jennifer has mentioned many times before, it's an opportunity all the way from the safety side. That's why we're so focused on safety as well as even as we think about our service product, right? We have teams that are dedicated to making sure that the freight that we haul is successfully hauled from origin to destination without being damaged and how do we drive down any claims that we have. So it is a target-rich environment, and we are doing everything every day to capitalize on that.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.\nBascome Majors: Following up on the locomotive piece earlier, you talked about storing 500 units and having a 9% sequential increase in productivity. Jim, as you look forward a bit further, can you talk about how you think about UP's fleet renewal strategy for locomotives over the next, call it, 3 to 5 years? And how at this point is some of the regulations that California is proposing impacting the way that you think strategically about that significant investment for the railroad? Thank you.\nJim Vena: Bascome, I think it's a great question. If you looked at the bottom line, we have enough locomotives that we would not have to look in the planning period of 3 years out that we would have to purchase any locomotives. But we always look at the greenhouse gas emissions of our locomotives, what we need to do to be able to invest to make them more efficient, both on a fuel spend and greenhouse gas emissions. So I think we will target certain capital expenditures. It's not in the plan this year, and we'll look at it again to see where we are. We're testing new innovative ways to have propulsion. So we'll continue to do that and invest in locomotives that can be hybrid that are able to work out there for us. So and in certain situations, we can implement it. But I don't see the requirement is that we do not have to spend money. But bottom line is we know that we will invest in our fleet. And we don't want to have the oldest fleet in the network. So we'll continue to invest in renewing the fleet as we move ahead, but it will not happen in 2024.\nBascome Majors: Thank you.\nJim Vena: You're welcome, Bascome,\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Hoexter: Hey, good morning and congrats on solid and rapid results here. Just want to check, I guess you're not changing that you don't need volume gains to get margin improvement. Is that right? Am I hearing that right? And then your thoughts on outpacing normal sequential shifts into the first quarter, should we still expect that like you did in the fourth quarter, given the weather or accelerating gains? And then just a side one, Kenny, I just want to understand, are you - can you talk about the scale of the intermodal loss in '24? Did we see it in the fourth quarter? Or is that all coming? And can you talk scale? I guess that was a surprise, I think, to everybody so far.\nJim Vena: Okay. So three questions, Ken. That was very good. I like - so why don't we start...\nJennifer Hamann: Where are we going to start?\nJim Vena: Why don't we start with the contract is real simple. The contract was lost early in 2023, and the business has actually lost starting January 1 correct, Ken?\nKenny Rocker: That's true. We'll still see the bulk of it still showing up in 2024.\nJim Vena: So that's the challenge. It's a 2024 issue. And it was early in 2023 that we lost that business.\nJennifer Hamann: Yes. And if I can, in terms of your margin questions, again, not going to give you any specifics there. We have three levers, as you know, that we use to attack and generate profitability. It's volume, price and productivity. You've heard us talk about the fact in my prepared comments that price were all positive in excess of inflation dollars is not going to be accretive to margins here in 2024. We are unsure about the volume picture. There's a lot of puts and takes, as you heard, and we know we've got some headwinds from a contract loss in coal. And so the lever that we are most confident about and have ultimate control over is the productivity side. And so you're right, we have shown in periods of declining volumes in the past that we can through productivity and price generate margin improvement. But we're not giving you a guidance on what - any kind of magnitude of volume changes. So I don't want to try to get into that game of linking x amount of volume with x amount of productivity and margin. The thing that you will see from us in our results, regardless of what happens with volume is that we're performing better. We're running better. We're running more efficiently and driving productivity. And whether that results in positive or negative in the financial picture is going to be a function of some of that volume and how that plays out through the quarter and through the year. First quarter, in particular, is going to be a bit of a challenge for us. Volume, yes, and the weather, you heard us talk about that. But a couple of other things just to remind everyone of in terms of a year-over-year comparison. Last year, we had about $100 million, a little over $100 million real estate transaction that was in our earnings. And we also had a very strong fuel benefit in the first quarter of last year and helped our margins by, I think, almost 2 points and about $0.25. So I just want to remind everybody of those kind of year-over-year comparison pressures.\nKen Hoexter: Appreciate the multiple part answers to my one question. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.\nJustin Long: Thanks. And maybe taking a shot at asking that question a little bit differently, Jim, you've now been at the company for roughly a couple of quarters. Do you have any updated thoughts on the size of the total productivity opportunity going forward? And roughly how much of that is dependent on volume growth. If we want to make our own assumption that volumes are flattish this year, hypothetically, is that a scenario where you can still see meaningful margin expansion year-over-year?\nJim Vena: Listen, I think it was a well-framed question. I like it because it gets to the crux of who we are at Union Pacific and what the vision is and what our goals and objectives are. I'm very clear on it. I think we are going to have quarters just like the first quarter, but maybe we don't see as much of a sequential improvement as we would like because of the pressures of what we had in January so far with weather, and I'm not sure what's going to happen. I've been around for way too long to forecast what's going to happen when winter is on and when we come through spring and everything that can happen then. But fundamentally, I see us as having a best operating ratio in the industry. And that's what we're driving towards, and we'll get there. And I see it in the future, and the future is not so far that it's cloudy. I see it clearly in what we have to do. So for me, that's really important. And I don't care whether we - whether the business and the business in the marketplace gives us business or not. But I'll tell you, I'm pretty clear, okay? We have a great railroad. We operate very efficiently. We should win with the customers, and I expect Kenny and his team to deliver. This is not - people want to talk about we lost the business. We need to go replace that and we need to bring it on and we need to do that in the short term, not the long term, without going after making an adjustment on price to go get the business. We have that capability, and we can deliver value to the customer. That's how I think. and I did not come back here. I could have sat at home in Scottsdale or being somewhere doing some exciting hiking or mountaineering, but I decided to come back because I think we could win, and we have the railroad and the network to do that. So the pressure is on this team. The pressure is on Eric to make sure and his entire team to deliver, recover fast like we did with this last winter impact that we had. I expect Kenny to deliver. And I expect Jennifer and the entire team to look for every opportunity, how we monetize what we have as a railroad and win. So I love the question. Perfect. So hopefully, I answered it for you.\nJustin Long: You did. Thanks, Jim.\nJim Vena: You're welcome.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Ben Nolan with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nBen Nolan: Yeah, thanks. Good quarter and by the way, Jennifer, I do like that last slide is helpful. The - my question relates to Mexico. Obviously, that's an initiative that you guys really tried to accelerate last year. And then around the end of the year, there were the border closures. Just thinking through how you expect that business to trend moving forward? And if you're seeing a lot of these reshoring things? Or are some of these interruptions causing any second guessing of that at all?\nJim Vena: So Kenny talk about the business and how we see it? And then if you don't mind, I'm going to answer the piece on the border, okay?\nKenny Rocker: Sure. Yes. I mean, Ben, the near shoring, Israel [ph]. We've seen the billions that have gone in, in all of 2023. These are - a number of them are highly industrial and rail centric, which we find encouraging. I talked about the service product that we have, and we're not waiting around for the near shoring to happen. We've seen some wins with us having the fastest product coming out of Mexico, especially in time-sensitive products like auto parts, again, a daily service. We're reaching into the Midwest. We're reaching into different parts of Canada. And so we're encouraged by that. We're bullish about that. We are talking to customers about that. We're putting as much as we can on the network. And you also saw us create a service product into the Southeast, which we have gained some traction on. So again, coming out of Mexico, it's a great franchise for us. We've got six borders that we can get in and out of Mexico. So great product and great franchise.\nJim Vena: You bet. And on the border, I'm disappointed that the border was shut down, and I do not think that's the way to move forward. I think there is a problem. There's a humanitarian issue. I personally went down with some members of the team to go visit. And it's very difficult when you see people crossing the river and the mother with a child coming and then falling into some razor wire. That is not something that anybody should see. But at the end of the day, for us, I think it's more important that the border crossings are fluid, and we are doing everything, investing in systems to make sure we protect the railway crossings that we do not have people crossing on the trains. And we've done a really good job of that. People are not crossing coming across from Mexico into the U.S. or vice versa on the trains, and that's what we will continue to do. And we will work close with customs and we have. Customs understand they have a problem, and we've worked very closely with them, and we will continue to have meetings and discussions so that we will do everything we can to make sure that the rail operation is not impacted as we move forward.\nBen Nolan: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks, everyone. You guys said that you're looking to push on rail length, which is train length is understandable. Just want to see kind of how much room you have to kind of get more leverage there, A, kind of given your efforts already kind of how much more like physical space is there. Also, I think given some of the kind of regulatory scrutiny around train lengths kind of is this something that you guys can do by yourself? Or do you need to get the kind of STB or Congress is going to sign off on it?\nJim Vena: Yes. Thank you for that question. So core to your question is how do we think about train length and how do we execute that? So let's put volume to the side just for a second. Do our trains have capacity for more train length? Absolutely, yes, 100%. The work that we have in front of us that we've been executing now for years and will continue to is to make sure that all of our systems behind the scenes continue to first identify those opportunities. And as we've always been to be exceptionally prudent about actually working through our physics engines and to understand exactly how to build our trains. That's science. And like all science, it evolves. And every quarter, every year, we see new opportunities to be able to keep capitalize on this. So I'm not going to guide you to a specific number, but I'm going to tell you, we see some opportunity there. You'll see us capitalize it in '24, and I'm excited and appreciate what the team is doing to make that happen. Thank you, Ravi.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nJim Vena: Morning, Brian.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hey, good morning, Jim. Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick follow-up first on the work rest rules. Is there anything in your guidance, where you're assuming that SMART-TD actually does come on board? Or so far, you're just assuming that it's the BLE. And then maybe for Kenny, obviously mix is probably harder to forecast than volume, but the two are related. So maybe you can just give us a sense in terms of some of these market pricing adjustments for coal and intermodal that have been more of a headwind than not the last couple of quarters. Is that something that we should anticipate also being a potential headwind into next year? Just curious how much visibility you have on that, knowing that it's probably truck and natural gas dependent. But I guess is that directionally worse in '24 than perhaps it was in '23? Thank you.\nJim Vena: Jennifer, why don't you handle the...\nJennifer Hamann: In terms of the work rest piece, we do have an assumption that we'll come to an agreement probably sometime later in the year. So that's part of our overall thinking.\nKenny Rocker: So you look - you asked the question about intermodal, domestic intermodal. First of all, if you look at where the rates have been, I'll differentiate the spot rates of the last 4 months sequentially, shown, I'll call it, very slow gradual increase, which is encouraging. The same issue on the contractual side, very slow gradual improvement sequentially the last 4 months. So I can't get into saying whether I think over the next 3 months, that's going to continue. We've got a lot of mixed feedback from customers, but encouraged by what we've seen in the past. I've said this before that we have mechanisms in our contracts for our suite of customers to keep them competitive, real time and times like this. And as the market improves, I would just mention some of those indices, it will help us some of those mechanisms that we have to procure a little bit more price and better margin.\nJennifer Hamann: Yes. And Brian, I think you also asked a broader mix question in terms of next year. And obviously, with a lot of unknowns about volume, it's hard to answer that. But the big drivers there really are in the intermodal front. And largely so goes intermodal, so goes the broader mix for UP. We obviously have mix within mix [ph] As I know you're also aware. And so when you think about just the premium category with automotive being very bullish on that as we think about some of the contract wins and what's happening in that market, that may help your overall premium mix, particularly if you've got some down, and then we'll see how the rest of the categories play out. But that's the big swing factor for us in 2024.\nJim Vena: Thanks for the question, Brian.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Okay. I appreciate the thoughts. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJordan Alliger: Yeah. A couple of just real quick follow-ups or clarifications. One, I don't know if I caught the order of magnitude impact of the international intermodal loss, whether it be revenue or volume? And then secondly, what does it mean price not being accretive to margin? Does that mean overall yields would it best be flat? Thanks.\nJennifer Hamann: Yes. For the second part of your question, Jordan, it really just means mathematically, when you look at how the price impacts and is added to the revenue, it does not help your overall operating ratio calculation. Even though it's going to be higher than the inflation.\nJim Vena: So when you do the math, you know that math, right?\nKenny Rocker: So again, we're not going to frame up the magnitude. I can tell you, we're focused on growing the international intermodal network. We've been blessed with a new intermodal terminal there in Phoenix. It's going to open up February 1. I talked about some of the other products that we have coming out of Houston. We've talked about Mexico. So again, we're bullish and we want to make sure that we're moving that product at the appropriate margin, acceptable margin.\nJordan Alliger: Thank you.\nJim Vena: Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Seidl: Thanks, operator. Good morning, everybody. Tacking on to Jordan's question there. If we were to look at pricing and exclude sort of intermodal and sort of the natural gas impacts and some of the linked coal contracts, would pricing be accretive to margin in the remainder of the business? And also, as I look in that near-shoring commentary, how should we think about sort of post '24 in near shoring? Where is that going to show up for you guys? And is there any extra CapEx that might be needed? Thank you.\nJennifer Hamann: Yes, Jason, thanks for the question. We're just not going to get into that final level of detail, but certainly, those are substantial headwinds for us that have been impacting our yields through much of 2023, and the intermodal piece for sure is going to linger into 2024.\nKenny Rocker: Yes. So post 2024, as you look at it, I mentioned a lot of industrial base markets that are going there. Think in terms of auto, think in terms of metals and minerals, think in terms of petrochemical market.\nJason Seidl: Perfect. Appreciate the time, as always, everyone.\nJim Vena: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nJeff Kauffman: Thank you very much. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just a follow-up on the near shoring for Kenny. A lot of the companies we talk to say really all that's been done at this point is concrete has been poured in the ground and some of these facilities have been announced. And really, you're not going to see a lot of this potential until kind of '25, '26, '27? Looking at your industrial development plan and kind of what's out there, do you think - and I'm going to ask you to guess here. Could this be 100 basis points in magnitude to volume on a basis over 3 to 5 years? Could it be larger than that? How should we think about scoping this longer-term industrial development opportunity for UNP?\nKenny Rocker: We're certainly not going to guide on your basis point question. Here's what I will say, though, and I've repeated this, and I want to make sure I hit this pretty hard. We've got a service product coming out of Mexico that is unmatched. It's a daily product. It's the fastest product to getting in and out of the heart of Mexico. We also have 6 gateways, which gives us optionality, which gives our customers optionality, which gives us an opportunity to hit different parts of Mexico. So yes, we feel very bullish about Mexico and the growth, and we've been working from an industrial development perspective with all the stakeholders with all the customers to help bring that on.\nJim Vena: The only thing I would add is with the ownership position we have in the FXC, I think that ties us even to be able to optimize what's available to us as near shoring happens and as we work collaboratively and make it the view as one railroad operationally, it will help us on the efficiency of being able to move the traffic. And I think we're able to offer the customers the best product, and we think it gives us a chance to win a bigger majority of any business that's added to those lanes.\nJeff Kauffman: Thank you very much.\nJim Vena: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Jairam Nathan with Daiwa. Please proceed with your question.\nJairam Nathan: Hi, thanks for taking my question. So just on the casualty and I guess on the other expenses on the last slide, you have flat to down, it looks like casualty will be - would be favorable here. So can you talk about some things that could kind of offset that?\nJennifer Hamann: Yes. On the call, I mentioned the fact that we've had some higher casualty expenses certainly over the last couple of years, and we've been playing some catch up. And so that's really a large part of what's driven the increase in those lines - in that line and the other line. And so we don't expect that to continue because it's not indicative of our safety performance. And in fact, you've heard us talk about being very focused on improving that overall performance. It really is some cleanup and some maybe outsized verdicts, too, just with some of what's going on in the courts. And we think we have some of those big things behind us. So looking forward to a better footing in 2024.\nJairam Nathan: Okay. And finally, just on the CapEx question. Jimmy talked about FXE. In terms of capital additions would FXE be on the same page as you guys in terms of investing in the business?\nJim Vena: Yes, they have the same capability. They do a real good job. I'm on the Board and so is Jennifer, and they have a great plan for 2024 and they invest in their railroad, the same as we do, bottom up, build the plan up to see what you need. So I'm very comfortable that they will invest and have the capability to invest what they need to move forward.\nJairam Nathan: Okay. Thank you.\nJim Vena: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Vernon: Hey, guys, thanks. Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. Sorry?\nJim Vena: I said they put you last David?\nDavid Vernon: It's been happening since the second grade. The last name is V, you should be - you should feel familiar with that process.\nJim Vena: You and I were always called last, I hear you.\nDavid Vernon: Exactly, exactly. So a couple of questions for you here. First, the CapEx moderation, Kenny, you a little bit worried about how that's going to impact you for growth? And then second, given your exposure to the situation down in Mexico, Jim, I'd love to hear your thoughts on what you think the introduction of passenger rail might do down in Mexico in terms of freight flows coming cross-border? Any perspective or insight you can share in terms of the response that FXE I think, had to give to the Mexican government in the last couple of weeks. Thanks.\nJim Vena: So Kenny, let me ask the question. Would we plan our capital, do we ever limit the capital. So you have a problem for growth?\nKenny Rocker: Not at all.\nJim Vena: Perfect. That's the way we look at it. It's that simple, never. So let me clear up this whole, David, because it's a great question. And you know the answer. So you're asking me, and you've heard it before, and I'm very clear on this. We build our capital plan from the bottom up to look at what we need to reinvest in the railroad and every year is a little bit different. Ties, rail equipment. We look at growth and what we've identified of where we need to invest. We're opening February 1, a new intermodal terminal in Phoenix. So we've invested in that. We're a quick turnaround. We don't fool around anymore. That would have been like a 6-month, 1-year discussion. We turned around and in November, said there's a market there. And February 1, we're opening up a place. So we're able to invest quick, and that's the way I look at it. When we built it up, we came up with $3.4 billion. That is not a hard number. If there's an opportunity for us to invest to grow this company or invest that we need to on the replacement and the - what we do every day to operate the railroad, we'll invest. And we never ever skimp on safety, maintenance of the railroad, the capital cost we need and the growth. So we are there. I have no issue. And on the passenger service, listen, I give both the FXE and CPKC. They're saying the right things, and I agree with them. We - there's an interaction when you have passenger service that affects you, but there's nothing that you - that I'm worried about because they can't figure out how to mitigate that and still operate a freight and passenger railroad efficiently. So I'm very comfortable that, that will not have a significant effect or really any effect as they move ahead. I'm sure that they will just move ahead and they'll be operating some passenger service on the railroad. So hopefully, we answered your question, David.\nDavid Vernon: You did. Thanks very much.\nJim Vena: Thanks. Operator, Rob, maybe if I can just soon as we're done with the questions, I wouldn't mind just recapping and if there's a few people on, that's great. And if everybody else has got off, then I'm talking to my team here, and they love to hear the story. So bottom line is, this is - we have a great railroad. We have a franchise that allows us with the business mix to go up and down with - because not one area ever. And you wish 1 year that every segment that we had industrial premium, okay, and the bulk would all grow at one time, that's not the way the world is. I've never seen it in my career. We need to be able to have the resiliency and the capability to react on what's happening. We don't know what's going to happen this year, but I'm telling you, fundamentally, we are on the right track to deliver. The team is engaged. We're excited and we're looking forward to winning this year. We have goals to grow revenue with our service, and we also have goals to be the most efficient operationally railroad in the industry. So I'm looking forward to 2024. I'm excited. The team is excited, and I'm looking forward to talking to all of you in 3 months and see how the first quarter went and to see how we're growing and what we've done at this point. So thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.+",

            "content": "Thank you, Kenny, and good morning. Moving to Slide 13. To start, I want to express my appreciation to the team for their relentless focus on improving our service product and driving network efficiency. It's thanks to their efforts that our network showed tremendous fluidity and reliability during the fourth quarter. Freight car velocity improved 14% to 217 miles per day compared to fourth quarter 2022. Increased train velocity and a reduction in terminal dwell drove that performance. Service was strong during the quarter as we saw a significant 12-point improvement in both intermodal and manifest and auto trip plan compliance. In addition to trip plan compliance, we have hundreds of customer-specific performance metrics that also showed great improvement throughout the quarter. Most importantly, we are delivering the service we sold to our customers, which is critical to our long-term growth strategy. While winter is here and has certainly brought its challenges, the railroad overall is very healthy, and I'm confident the team will continue its positive momentum. Safety continues to be the foundation of everything we do. During the quarter, we delivered improved derailment performance through our investments in technology and process. We remain focused on the critical actions that drive real change. So everyone goes home safely each day. Now let's review our key efficiency metrics for the quarter on Slide 14. During the fourth quarter, we saw year-over-year improvement across all of our efficiency metrics. Locomotive productivity improved 14% versus fourth quarter 2022 and 9% sequentially as we continue to identify and execute on opportunities to utilize the fleet more efficiently. Throughout the second half of 2023, we stored nearly 500 units from our operable fleet. Workforce productivity improved 4% compared to fourth quarter 2022. With a strong crew base, we are focused on effectively managing workforce levels to the demands of the business. However, challenges do remain from scheduled work agreements that in the near term, require additional employees. Train length improved 2% compared to fourth quarter 2022 as we continue to remove car touch points from the system. In total, throughout 2023, we were successful in extending train length as improvements in the second half more than offset the declines in intermodal shipments. We remain persistent in our focus on train length to drive productivity while providing a better service product to our customers. As we move into 2024, we will continue to transform our railroad through a variety of technology initiatives and targeted capital investments designed to further improve safety, improve our service product, enhance resource utilization and ultimately lower our cost structure. So to wrap up, let's review our capital outlook for 2024 on Slide 15. We are targeting capital spending of $3.4 billion in 2024. Similar to 2023, we will support safe and productive operations by investing in our infrastructure and renewing our older assets. This includes modernizing locomotives and acquiring freight cars to support replacement and growth opportunities. We are also investing in technology and terminal and mainline capacity projects to improve productivity. Specific to our technology investments, we recently cut over NetControl, replacing our 50-year-old transportation management system. This cutover positions us to use real-time analytics to open new capabilities for Union Pacific and our customers. Great work led by our technology team. On the growth front, we will continue to invest in projects that expand our intermodal footprint and support business development in targeted high-growth areas such as Inland Empire, Kansas City and Phoenix to name a few. So with that, I'll turn it back to Jennifer to lay out our initial financial thoughts for 2024. Absolutely. So you mentioned car velocity, so let's start there. As you're thinking about 2024 and what's in front of us, you saw what we did in the fourth quarter, a 14% improvement, 217 miles per day. That becomes a floor. A floor that is we work every single day, as was mentioned before, we're working to improve that. Now if you peel that back and you say, okay, within that, where do you see the biggest opportunities? You mentioned train length, so we can start there. Train length is an opportunity, always has been and candidly always will be because the railroad is dynamic. Train length comes in two forms. The first one, Kenny just gave a great example of Inland Empire, where we're bringing more volume onto the railroad. I already have an existing train, and we can just tack it onto the back of that. The other way that it comes is in our actual transportation plan changes that we make. An example of that is the one that Kenny brought up with Mexico. When you think about that being two trains before and now we're consolidating that traffic into one, it allows us to drive productivity that way. After that, the fluidity drives our locomotive fleet. There's other factors, but at the very core of it, it is about fluidity. We took out 500 units out of the system in the second half of last year, a little bit because of volume, but the vast, vast majority of it because of fluidity, continuing that work allows us to continue to rightsize the fleet. And we don't talk a lot about purchase services on these calls, but purchase service is a big opportunity for us, whether you're thinking about how many vehicles do we have on this railroad to operate it, whether we think about how much fuel that we're using. We also have opportunities on the casualty side. As Jennifer has mentioned many times before, it's an opportunity all the way from the safety side. That's why we're so focused on safety as well as even as we think about our service product, right? We have teams that are dedicated to making sure that the freight that we haul is successfully hauled from origin to destination without being damaged and how do we drive down any claims that we have. So it is a target-rich environment, and we are doing everything every day to capitalize on that."

            "name": "Jim Vena",
            "content": "Thanks, Rob. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Union Pacific's fourth quarter and full year results. I'm joined in Omaha by our Chief Financial Officer, Jennifer Hamann, our Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Kenny Rocker and our Executive Vice President of Operations, Eric Gehringer. The Union Pacific team is executing our multiyear strategy to lead the industry in safety, service and operational excellence. Our fourth quarter shows a lot of what's possible and demonstrate that we're on the right path to achieving those goals. We exited 2023 with strong momentum, which gives me great confidence that we have a winning strategy. There's work to do, but we're building the foundation for future success. Now let's turn to Slide 3. This morning, Union Pacific reported 2023 fourth quarter net income of $1.7 billion or $2.71 per share. This compares to 2022 fourth quarter net income of $1.6 billion or $2.67 per share. Fourth quarter operating revenue was flat as increased volumes and core pricing gains were offset by lower fuel surcharge revenue and business mix. Expenses year-over-year were also flat as lower fuel expenses and productivity gains were offset by inflation, volume-related costs and higher casualty expenses. Our fourth quarter operating ratio of 60.9% improved 10 basis points versus last year. And more importantly, we demonstrated strong sequential OR improvement of 250 basis points from the third quarter. We are taking the right actions to increase the efficiency of our railroad while also improving service for our customers. Key to our strategy is excelling in what we control. We made great progress in those areas this quarter. That provides further proof that we're on the right path for future success. So with that, let me hand it over to Jennifer to provide more details on the fourth quarter and full year financials. Thank you, Jennifer. Let's turn to Slide 19. Before we get to your questions, I'd like to quickly summarize what you've heard from our team. Kenny outlined our view on the upcoming year. Our volume outlook today reflects headwinds from lost business, coal demand and relatively soft economic forecast. Much of that is out of our control. We are mitigating these impacts through business development and value creation by providing great service to our customers. Eric described the progress we've made to return our service levels to industry best, while there's work to do, the team made consistent improvement through the quarter to exit in a very fluid state. Obviously, winter is here, but that's part of railroading. I judge our success by how we minimize the impact on our customers and how quickly we recover the network. So far, we've grown - we've shown great resiliency. Finally, as Jennifer laid out, our productivity and pricing gains will be key to overcoming ongoing inflationary pressures in 2024 as well as the soft economy. While many unknowns remain, I'm confident we'll succeed in the areas we control. We've got plenty of opportunities this year to improve safety, service and operational excellence. As you heard me say in October, I came back to Union Pacific to win. My vision and the opportunity I see for this company has not changed. We have the right team and strategy in place to grow this railroad long term, and I'm very confident we'll see a better Union Pacific in the future. We're now ready to take your questions. Rob? Margins? Chris, let me just maybe just try to put this all into a box of the way we're thinking. It's very difficult for us to look forward and say this is exactly the way the year is going to go. More important to me and the team is, what have we done operationally? And what are we doing to provide Kenny and the entire team, the capability to go out there and maximize what's available for us and what we can bring on to this railroad. And for me, that's the single most important thing. I think what we've shown is the capability to flex up. We have the assets to be able to flex up. We have the capacity to be able to flex up. And if we continue to drive the efficiency of the railroad, which I expect we will, then what we do is we win in the marketplace. And whatever is out there, we're going to compete against everybody else, trucks and other railroads, and we think we have a winning model, so that's the challenge we have. And it would be truly there would be a mistake for us to come out and say, because I can't tell what's going to happen, like Jennifer pointed out with the inputs and the effects from interest rates and everything else that's happening in the economy. But I'm very comfortable that we are going to maximize what's available for Union Pacific and win. That' true, Kenny as we think about that because to your point, you can't predict the future with entire clarity. It's another reminder, Walter of the fact that when we talk about having a buffer and you look at what we did in the fourth quarter, we generated the ability to make sure we have that buffer. That buffer in locomotives, that buffer in railcars positioned in LA. So in the event the volume is there, we've supported Kenny's team to be able to actually capture it. Well, I hate to always recap these, and I won't. But let me recap this, Scott for you. So inflation, when I was - the first call that I had in October, I was pretty clear that we are going to deal with the inflationary pressure that is presented for us that we have to tackle, and we're doing it two ways. We are dealing with it on a price - from the price side, and we're also dealing with it on the efficiency side. And I think we have a clear view. This is not a short-term 3 months you can fix it on the price side and even on the efficiency side, we've seen improvements in efficiency, and you can see that from the number. And I think there's more available for us on the efficiency side from how we operate our trains, the fluidity and the terminals, how we use our people, and we did a really good job. The team did a fantastic job in the fourth quarter, and I expect it to get better as we go through the year. So those two things we're tackling head on. We're not being shy about it. We're being straight. I've met with a lot of customers in groups and in small and I've been clear about what the pressures are and what we're going to do about it moving forward. But at the end, we want our customers to win in the marketplace. We want them to win. So we're being smart about how we price and what level and it's different for different marketplaces, and that's how we're handling it. But I'm excited. I think we overcome this year, by the end of the year, we'll see ourselves in a different position. Well, listen, thanks for the question. So the way I see it is this. I think there's more on the railroad to become more efficient. And the concentration is a little different than the last time I was here and a little different than what we just were able to do in the fourth quarter. I think there's opportunity in speed and car velocity that will help us be able to move the railcars faster, use a few less locomotives and be able to keep the network more fluid. But the real big piece for us and what we're going to concentrate on, and we think there's a capability to be much better is how fast we operate our terminals and the fluidity through the terminals to be able to have the products. Now it's just not in the transportation piece. We are looking at ways on the engineering side, how we do maintenance, how we do capital work on the mechanical side, how we - what it costs us to perform overhauls, every piece of the network is still there. So I think there's still more left on that piece to be able to do. Well, the challenge we have with headcount is we signed some collective agreements and you live with what was given to you. And some of those collective agreements put pressure on headcount. They put pressure on - from both the time off, the sick benefit time off that we provided. We had some weekends when the football game were on that we have like an extra 15%, 20% people all got sick at the same time. So we need to be able to figure out how to deal with that, and we'll do that as we move ahead. It must have been a real bad weekend, right? At the same time as one of their playoff games was on. But at the end of the day, those are stumbling - those are blocks that we have to get over this year. And what we showed in the fourth quarter is with all that, all the pluses and all the headwinds we had on headcount, we were able to keep the headcount and reduce it overall in the company. And there is no reason for us not to continue to do that. We will look for every opportunity. And sorry, I can't give you a specific number because this is a moving target. As we move ahead, we're implementing new agreements through this year. So it will be noisy. It won't be a straight tangent down. The scope won't be perfect. It will be a little up and down, but I'm very comfortable that we have the programs, the processes in place to be able to correct that and have the way which is less people handling the same amount of business. Thank you. Yes. In the - in 2024, we have dates of implementation for the agreements that we have not implemented completely. And those are pressures on the number of people that we would need to operate. So that will be through 2024, and that's why I've always talked about this is a - I see this as a 2-year adjustment to the railroad to be able to get there. But we do have programs in place as we implement, we run into things if we operate as efficiently as I think we can, we'll mitigate that. You mitigate it by running less trains, having more cars on the same trains. We grow. We put more cars on the same trains instead of starting more. We use the people and the facilities that we have more efficiently. So - but it's a 2024 headwind for us that we are going to overcome just like we did in the fourth quarter. Correct. You're welcome. Good morning. Good question. Nice try. Thank you. Allison, let me start and then Kenny, please jump in. So if we look at this railroad that we are blessed with that we operate, and I think you've seen some of the steps we've taken is you have to provide a level of service that we sold to our customers, and that's our goal, and we work real hard every day to do that. We operate the railroad very efficiently. Where's the opportunity? We have a mix of traffic that's available to us that originates on our railroad, so when I go around the entire railroad, I'm very comfortable that we offset and we have the capability to offset and we are tackling, whether it's that industrial complex all the way from New Orleans to Brownsville, Texas, whether it's the grain, whether it's the soda ash, whether it's the intermodal at the West Coast and our speed. We are able to provide speed for customers that require speed and not all of them do. We can go from LA to Texas, a close to 2,000 mile journey and we do that in 48 hours. So that's truck like. So - and our service that we put on from Mexico going into Eastern Canada, partnering with CN and ourselves into the East plus into Chicago is unparalleled. We can do it as fast as anybody. So there's lots of opportunity out there for us. And what we have to do is with good service, the customers will see what's possible, and they will want to partner with Union Pacific and grow their business with us versus anybody else. Kenny? Bascome, I think it's a great question. If you looked at the bottom line, we have enough locomotives that we would not have to look in the planning period of 3 years out that we would have to purchase any locomotives. But we always look at the greenhouse gas emissions of our locomotives, what we need to do to be able to invest to make them more efficient, both on a fuel spend and greenhouse gas emissions. So I think we will target certain capital expenditures. It's not in the plan this year, and we'll look at it again to see where we are. We're testing new innovative ways to have propulsion. So we'll continue to do that and invest in locomotives that can be hybrid that are able to work out there for us. So and in certain situations, we can implement it. But I don't see the requirement is that we do not have to spend money. But bottom line is we know that we will invest in our fleet. And we don't want to have the oldest fleet in the network. So we'll continue to invest in renewing the fleet as we move ahead, but it will not happen in 2024. You're welcome, Bascome, Okay. So three questions, Ken. That was very good. I like - so why don't we start... Why don't we start with the contract is real simple. The contract was lost early in 2023, and the business has actually lost starting January 1 correct, Ken? So that's the challenge. It's a 2024 issue. And it was early in 2023 that we lost that business. Listen, I think it was a well-framed question. I like it because it gets to the crux of who we are at Union Pacific and what the vision is and what our goals and objectives are. I'm very clear on it. I think we are going to have quarters just like the first quarter, but maybe we don't see as much of a sequential improvement as we would like because of the pressures of what we had in January so far with weather, and I'm not sure what's going to happen. I've been around for way too long to forecast what's going to happen when winter is on and when we come through spring and everything that can happen then. But fundamentally, I see us as having a best operating ratio in the industry. And that's what we're driving towards, and we'll get there. And I see it in the future, and the future is not so far that it's cloudy. I see it clearly in what we have to do. So for me, that's really important. And I don't care whether we - whether the business and the business in the marketplace gives us business or not. But I'll tell you, I'm pretty clear, okay? We have a great railroad. We operate very efficiently. We should win with the customers, and I expect Kenny and his team to deliver. This is not - people want to talk about we lost the business. We need to go replace that and we need to bring it on and we need to do that in the short term, not the long term, without going after making an adjustment on price to go get the business. We have that capability, and we can deliver value to the customer. That's how I think. and I did not come back here. I could have sat at home in Scottsdale or being somewhere doing some exciting hiking or mountaineering, but I decided to come back because I think we could win, and we have the railroad and the network to do that. So the pressure is on this team. The pressure is on Eric to make sure and his entire team to deliver, recover fast like we did with this last winter impact that we had. I expect Kenny to deliver. And I expect Jennifer and the entire team to look for every opportunity, how we monetize what we have as a railroad and win. So I love the question. Perfect. So hopefully, I answered it for you. You're welcome. So Kenny talk about the business and how we see it? And then if you don't mind, I'm going to answer the piece on the border, okay? You bet. And on the border, I'm disappointed that the border was shut down, and I do not think that's the way to move forward. I think there is a problem. There's a humanitarian issue. I personally went down with some members of the team to go visit. And it's very difficult when you see people crossing the river and the mother with a child coming and then falling into some razor wire. That is not something that anybody should see. But at the end of the day, for us, I think it's more important that the border crossings are fluid, and we are doing everything, investing in systems to make sure we protect the railway crossings that we do not have people crossing on the trains. And we've done a really good job of that. People are not crossing coming across from Mexico into the U.S. or vice versa on the trains, and that's what we will continue to do. And we will work close with customs and we have. Customs understand they have a problem, and we've worked very closely with them, and we will continue to have meetings and discussions so that we will do everything we can to make sure that the rail operation is not impacted as we move forward. Yes. Thank you for that question. So core to your question is how do we think about train length and how do we execute that? So let's put volume to the side just for a second. Do our trains have capacity for more train length? Absolutely, yes, 100%. The work that we have in front of us that we've been executing now for years and will continue to is to make sure that all of our systems behind the scenes continue to first identify those opportunities. And as we've always been to be exceptionally prudent about actually working through our physics engines and to understand exactly how to build our trains. That's science. And like all science, it evolves. And every quarter, every year, we see new opportunities to be able to keep capitalize on this. So I'm not going to guide you to a specific number, but I'm going to tell you, we see some opportunity there. You'll see us capitalize it in '24, and I'm excited and appreciate what the team is doing to make that happen. Thank you, Ravi. Morning, Brian. Jennifer, why don't you handle the... Thanks for the question, Brian. So when you do the math, you know that math, right? Thank you very much. Thank you. The only thing I would add is with the ownership position we have in the FXC, I think that ties us even to be able to optimize what's available to us as near shoring happens and as we work collaboratively and make it the view as one railroad operationally, it will help us on the efficiency of being able to move the traffic. And I think we're able to offer the customers the best product, and we think it gives us a chance to win a bigger majority of any business that's added to those lanes. Thank you. Yes, they have the same capability. They do a real good job. I'm on the Board and so is Jennifer, and they have a great plan for 2024 and they invest in their railroad, the same as we do, bottom up, build the plan up to see what you need. So I'm very comfortable that they will invest and have the capability to invest what they need to move forward. Thank you. I said they put you last David? You and I were always called last, I hear you. So Kenny, let me ask the question. Would we plan our capital, do we ever limit the capital. So you have a problem for growth? Perfect. That's the way we look at it. It's that simple, never. So let me clear up this whole, David, because it's a great question. And you know the answer. So you're asking me, and you've heard it before, and I'm very clear on this. We build our capital plan from the bottom up to look at what we need to reinvest in the railroad and every year is a little bit different. Ties, rail equipment. We look at growth and what we've identified of where we need to invest. We're opening February 1, a new intermodal terminal in Phoenix. So we've invested in that. We're a quick turnaround. We don't fool around anymore. That would have been like a 6-month, 1-year discussion. We turned around and in November, said there's a market there. And February 1, we're opening up a place. So we're able to invest quick, and that's the way I look at it. When we built it up, we came up with $3.4 billion. That is not a hard number. If there's an opportunity for us to invest to grow this company or invest that we need to on the replacement and the - what we do every day to operate the railroad, we'll invest. And we never ever skimp on safety, maintenance of the railroad, the capital cost we need and the growth. So we are there. I have no issue. And on the passenger service, listen, I give both the FXE and CPKC. They're saying the right things, and I agree with them. We - there's an interaction when you have passenger service that affects you, but there's nothing that you - that I'm worried about because they can't figure out how to mitigate that and still operate a freight and passenger railroad efficiently. So I'm very comfortable that, that will not have a significant effect or really any effect as they move ahead. I'm sure that they will just move ahead and they'll be operating some passenger service on the railroad. So hopefully, we answered your question, David. Thanks. Operator, Rob, maybe if I can just soon as we're done with the questions, I wouldn't mind just recapping and if there's a few people on, that's great. And if everybody else has got off, then I'm talking to my team here, and they love to hear the story. So bottom line is, this is - we have a great railroad. We have a franchise that allows us with the business mix to go up and down with - because not one area ever. And you wish 1 year that every segment that we had industrial premium, okay, and the bulk would all grow at one time, that's not the way the world is. I've never seen it in my career. We need to be able to have the resiliency and the capability to react on what's happening. We don't know what's going to happen this year, but I'm telling you, fundamentally, we are on the right track to deliver. The team is engaged. We're excited and we're looking forward to winning this year. We have goals to grow revenue with our service, and we also have goals to be the most efficient operationally railroad in the industry. So I'm looking forward to 2024. I'm excited. The team is excited, and I'm looking forward to talking to all of you in 3 months and see how the first quarter went and to see how we're growing and what we've done at this point. So thank you very much."

            "content": "Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Let's begin by walking through our fourth quarter income statement on Slide 5. Starting with the top line. Operating revenue of $6.2 billion was flat versus 2022 on a 3% volume increase. Breaking it down further, freight revenue totaled $5.8 billion, up 1%. The biggest driver of freight revenue in the quarter was fuel. Lower year-over-year fuel prices reduced fuel surcharge revenue and impacted freight revenue 375 basis points as fuel surcharges declined $180 million versus 2022 to $795 million. Volume growth in the quarter contributed positively, adding 350 basis points to freight revenue, and the combination of price and mix also was positive, increasing freight revenue, 75 basis points as solid core pricing gains were mostly offset by an unfavorable business mix. Intermodal shipments up 5% contributed heavily to the mix dynamic. Wrapping up the top line, other revenue decreased 13%, driven by lower accessorial and subsidiary revenue. Switching to expenses, we provided expense details for both fourth quarter and full year in our appendix slides. But let me hit some of the highlights. Against our 3% volume growth, operating expense of $3.8 million was flat. Digging deeper into a few of the expense lines, compensation and benefits expense was flat compared to 2022. Fourth quarter workforce levels decreased 2%, while our active TE&Y workforce was flat against the 3% volume growth. This solid level of workforce productivity mostly offset wage inflation as cost per employee only increased 1% in the fourth quarter. Fuel expense in the quarter decreased 11% on a 15% decrease in fuel prices from $3.70 per gallon to $3.16. Our fuel consumption rate deteriorated 3% as we moved a less fuel-efficient business mix with increased intermodal shipments and fewer coal moves. Finally, other expense grew 20% as a result of higher casualty costs and the comparison to 2022, which included insurance recoveries. Coming out of COVID, we had a sizable case backlog that we largely worked through the last couple of years. Importantly, we do not see these elevated expenses as a reflection of a long-term trend, particularly with our intense focus on improving safety. Fourth quarter operating income was flat at $2.4 billion. Below the line, other income increased $16 million due to higher real estate gains. Fourth quarter net income of $1.7 billion and earnings per share of $2.71, both improved 1% versus 2022. Our operating ratio of 60.9% improved 10 basis points year-over-year and 250 basis points sequentially. Moving to Slide 6 with a quick recap of full year 2023 results. Revenue of $24.1 billion declined 3% driven by reduced fuel surcharges, business mix and lower volumes, partially offset by core pricing gains. Operating income totaled $9.1 billion and our full year operating ratio of 62.3% deteriorated 220 basis points. Earnings per share of $10.45 decreased 7% versus 2022 and then reflecting the impact of our overall financial results, return on invested capital declined 180 basis points to 15.5%. Turning to shareholder returns and the balance sheet on Slide 7. Full year 2023 cash from operations totaled $8.4 billion, down roughly $1 billion from 2022. The combination of lower net income and nearly $450 million of labor agreement payments were the main drivers. Free cash flow and our cash flow conversion rate also reflected those impacts. We returned $3.9 billion to shareholders in 2023 through dividends and share repurchases. Our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio finished the year at three times as we continue to prioritize a strong balance sheet and be A rated by our 3 credit agencies. While 2023 was a difficult year, I'm pleased with the progress we've made over the last several months to improve our service and productivity. We believe this performance marks an inflection point as efforts to improve the efficiency of our railroad through safety, service and operational excellence is starting to be reflected in our financials. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Kenny to provide some comments on 2023 and kick off our commentary on 2024. Thanks, Eric. Turning to Slide 17. Let me start by pointing out that we added a new appendix slide that contains several of the 2024 modeling assumptions that should be helpful to everyone in framing our current expectations. As you heard from Kenny, it's a difficult market to forecast, as economic indicators show a muted and uncertain economy. Throwing a couple of other variables such as what the Fed might or might not do with interest rates and a presidential election, and we've got an interesting year ahead. On top of the macro pressures, lower coal demand and some lost international intermodal business are expected to negatively impact our volume. And as you've seen in the weekly carload data, January is off to a slow start as cold temperatures across our system impacted operations and volume with first quarter volume down 9% year-to-date. I am confident, however, that our strong and improving service product will allow us to capture available demand. We clearly demonstrated that in the fourth quarter as we took advantage of the unexpected but short-term surge in intermodal. More certain than the economy is our expectation to generate pricing dollars in excess of inflation dollars even with ongoing headwinds from certain intermodal contracts. With those pressures, we do not expect price to be accretive to margins in this year. Key for UP in 2024 is our ability to control the controllables by driving a strong safety culture, making ongoing service gains and improving network efficiency. We're confident that regardless of the demand environment, we will take the necessary actions to run a more efficient network. Finally, with capital allocation, there is no change to our long-term strategy. We are investing $3.4 billion back into the railroad as Eric detailed. Next, we prioritize our industry-leading dividend payout and then excess cash will be returned to shareholders through share repurchases. However, given first quarter debt maturities of $1.3 billion, we will not be repurchasing shares in the first quarter. It's always difficult in late January to make predictions for the year ahead, and this year is no different. There are clearly ongoing challenges from a macro and inflationary perspective. What is very encouraging though, as we start out 2024 is our momentum, which you've heard us mention several times today. We demonstrated with our fourth quarter performance, what's possible, and we look forward to further improvement in the year ahead. With that, let me turn it back to Jim. So Chris, maybe let me start and then Kenny can give you some more color. I mean we're just not going to give you a number in terms of what we think can happen with volumes because of what you yourself said. There's just a lot of uncertainty, and we just don't think it's prudent sitting here at the end of January to give you some sort of a forecast based on hopes for a second half recovery. Do we hope that, that will happen? And are we going to work diligently to move every piece of business that's there? Absolutely. And I think you really saw what the network can do with our fourth quarter performance, but we just need to see a little more certainty. And hopefully, that plays out through the year, and we can provide that. But sitting here today, we just don't see that. But Kenny, maybe talk about your margin... I'm sorry? On margins. Again, I'm not - this might become a broken record, I hope not. But I mean, we are not going to give specific guidance. I mean we're going to do everything we can as much as we can. And again, you saw what we did in the fourth quarter. But every kind of other guidance I would give is going to be predicated on what I think is going to happen with volumes, and we just don't have that clarity. And I don't think it's prudent to do that sitting here today. But just to your question, Scott, I think what Kenny is talking about with that loss, that kind of goes to our discipline when it comes to price and making sure that the business that's on our railroad is running at acceptable margins. Sometimes that doesn't happen and we might lose a piece of business. Well, just a reminder, Jon, we only have the work rest [ph] agreement in place with the BLET. We're still negotiating with SMART-TD. Yes. No. I mean, you've got that exactly right, Amit. The 5% is the gross number. So that's our challenge, right, and opportunity is to offset that with productivity. And so that's where you heard Jim talk, you heard Eric mention, we have those opportunities in virtually every cost category, I'll put depreciation aside, that's kind of fixed for the year. But we absolutely have opportunities to offset that in terms of how we run the railroad. And I think just think about wage inflation and think about fourth quarter. So we had wage inflation first half of this year. Our wages are going to be up 4%. For our Union Personnel [ph] it's going to go to 4.5% in the second half, but our cost per employee was only up 1% in the fourth quarter. So that's productivity that's enabling us to offset some of that. And so that's the task of this management team, and that's those controllables that we talked about, and that's where we're very much focused. You also know, Amit, that the volumes play a role in that in terms of how we're able to leverage and build longer trains and have more work to put up against some of those inflationary costs. So that's our challenge, but I'm really not going to be able to give you any more than that. Thank you. Where are we going to start? Yes. And if I can, in terms of your margin questions, again, not going to give you any specifics there. We have three levers, as you know, that we use to attack and generate profitability. It's volume, price and productivity. You've heard us talk about the fact in my prepared comments that price were all positive in excess of inflation dollars is not going to be accretive to margins here in 2024. We are unsure about the volume picture. There's a lot of puts and takes, as you heard, and we know we've got some headwinds from a contract loss in coal. And so the lever that we are most confident about and have ultimate control over is the productivity side. And so you're right, we have shown in periods of declining volumes in the past that we can through productivity and price generate margin improvement. But we're not giving you a guidance on what - any kind of magnitude of volume changes. So I don't want to try to get into that game of linking x amount of volume with x amount of productivity and margin. The thing that you will see from us in our results, regardless of what happens with volume is that we're performing better. We're running better. We're running more efficiently and driving productivity. And whether that results in positive or negative in the financial picture is going to be a function of some of that volume and how that plays out through the quarter and through the year. First quarter, in particular, is going to be a bit of a challenge for us. Volume, yes, and the weather, you heard us talk about that. But a couple of other things just to remind everyone of in terms of a year-over-year comparison. Last year, we had about $100 million, a little over $100 million real estate transaction that was in our earnings. And we also had a very strong fuel benefit in the first quarter of last year and helped our margins by, I think, almost 2 points and about $0.25. So I just want to remind everybody of those kind of year-over-year comparison pressures. In terms of the work rest piece, we do have an assumption that we'll come to an agreement probably sometime later in the year. So that's part of our overall thinking. Yes. And Brian, I think you also asked a broader mix question in terms of next year. And obviously, with a lot of unknowns about volume, it's hard to answer that. But the big drivers there really are in the intermodal front. And largely so goes intermodal, so goes the broader mix for UP. We obviously have mix within mix [ph] As I know you're also aware. And so when you think about just the premium category with automotive being very bullish on that as we think about some of the contract wins and what's happening in that market, that may help your overall premium mix, particularly if you've got some down, and then we'll see how the rest of the categories play out. But that's the big swing factor for us in 2024. Yes. For the second part of your question, Jordan, it really just means mathematically, when you look at how the price impacts and is added to the revenue, it does not help your overall operating ratio calculation. Even though it's going to be higher than the inflation. Yes, Jason, thanks for the question. We're just not going to get into that final level of detail, but certainly, those are substantial headwinds for us that have been impacting our yields through much of 2023, and the intermodal piece for sure is going to linger into 2024. Yes. On the call, I mentioned the fact that we've had some higher casualty expenses certainly over the last couple of years, and we've been playing some catch up. And so that's really a large part of what's driven the increase in those lines - in that line and the other line. And so we don't expect that to continue because it's not indicative of our safety performance. And in fact, you've heard us talk about being very focused on improving that overall performance. It really is some cleanup and some maybe outsized verdicts, too, just with some of what's going on in the courts. And we think we have some of those big things behind us. So looking forward to a better footing in 2024."

            "content": "Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning. You just heard from Jennifer that freight revenue was up 1% in the quarter as our volume gains of 3% were partially offset by lower fuel surcharges. So let's jump right into the business teams to recap the market drivers on the revenue slide. Starting with bulk, revenue for the quarter was flat compared to 2022, driven by a 3% increase in volume, offset by a 2% decrease in average revenue per car. Core pricing gains were more than offset by lower fuel surcharges and the unfavorable impact of low natural gas prices on our index-based coal contracts. Fertilizer shipments grew compared to 2022 as demand for fuel application was strong due to lower nitrogen prices. Grain product shipments were up for the quarter as our team secured new feedstock opportunities for renewable diesel production in Louisiana and California. Additionally, ethanol shipments increased with our improved service. Lastly, coal continued to be challenged in the fourth quarter due to mild weather and decreased coal competitiveness from low natural gas prices. Industrial revenue was up 4% in the quarter, driven by a 3% increase in volume. Core pricing gains in the quarter were mostly offset by lower fuel surcharges and a negative mix in volume. Business development in our petroleum and LPG commodity segments contributed to the growth. Demand improved for our plastics business in both export and domestic markets. However, sand volumes were negatively impacted by softer natural gas prices that reduced drilling in the Eagle Ford Basin and increased utilization of in-basin sand in the DJ Basin. Premium revenue for the quarter was down 3% on a 4% increase in volume and a 7% decrease in average revenue per car from lower fuel surcharges and truck market pressures. Automotive volumes were negatively impacted by the UAW strike, but those decreases were mostly offset by dealer inventory replenishment and business development wins that I mentioned on the last quarter's call. Intermodal volumes were positive in the quarter, driven by stronger West Coast imports, domestic business development wins and strengthen our Mexico volumes. Now let's start talking about 2024. Here are some key economic indicators that we're watching this year on Slide 10. These are S&P's forecast from their January report, and you'll notice that it shows a mixed picture for 2024. Industrial production looks to be flat. Housing starts are expected to remain challenged, but demand for auto continues to be strong. Turning to Slide 11. Here is our 2024 outlook as we see it today for the key markets we serve. Starting with bulk, we anticipate continued challenges in coal as natural gas futures remain volatile and inventories are high. Domestic grain is relatively stable, but we are keeping a watchful eye on export demand. On a brighter note, we expect fertilizer to be strong as repair that Canpotex Portland facility are now complete and commodity prices remain competitive moving into the spring season. And growth within biofuels continues to be driven by strong demand outlook, combined with a heavy focus on capturing new business, including incremental volume secured from Minnesota and Iowa origins. Moving on to Industrial. The construction market will be challenged to exceed last year's record volumes as we're seeing softness in parts of the market. However, we foresee the petroleum and petrochem market remaining favorable due to our focus on business development. And finally, for premium on the international intermodal side, we expect the market to improve year-over-year, but a contract we lost earlier in 2023 will negatively impact our 2024 volumes. On the domestic side, we are staying close with our customers who have indicated that they'll see a soft start to the year. Nonetheless, our strong service product sets us up to handle market demand. And for automotive, we will see strength in this market with improved OEM production and business development wins. In summary, the economic environment continues to look muted in 2024, particularly in the first half. We're off a slower start in January based on severe winter storms and market challenges we're seeing in coal and intermodal. But I am encouraged that we expect to see growth in some markets with our strong focus on business development. For the second half, we are well prepared to handle the demand if the market and economy improves. We continue to make significant capital investments on both the carload and intermodal front to capture more freight over the road. Those investments, along with our unmatched service offerings and improved service products from Eric's team create a winning environment for our customers. I'm excited for the opportunities in front of us, and our commercial team is ready to help our customers win in the marketplace. And with that, I'll turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance. I talked about it in my opening comments, there's a mixed bag of opportunities that are in front of us. We feel really good about the biofuels market. That market is growing. Demand is growing. We're capturing business in those markets. On the industrial side, we've had some record year on the construction side, still be a strong year. But as we are coming out of the gate with weather, that's going to be a little bit challenged for us. We feel really good about our petrochem business and wins that we've had from a business development perspective. On the petroleum and LPG side, those are all positive for us. On our premium business, again, those are really economic driven. And so we'll be looking to see what happens with demand overall. I talked about the international intermodal side and the loss there. We feel really encouraged by our ability to win on the auto side. And you heard us talk about Volkswagen [ph] win in last quarter. And so as there's a lot of demand there and the forecast for growth there, we really feel good about that market. Yes. So thank you, Walter. We spent a lot of time looking at the global supply chains in the canals and so forth. I'll tell you right now in the near term, we haven't seen any significant shifts. We've been talking to our - the vessel carrier owners. We know they put in tariffs, our customers have put in tariffs to go over the Panama Canal, for example. And so we've been working with them to move as much as we can with the network that we have, with the match-back opportunities that we have, with the reload opportunities that we have, with the new products that we have on the - with the Houston lanes that Eric has given us to give our customers every reason to go to the West Coast. So what we have seen is we are seeing more going IPI, and we have a very efficient service network to accomplish that. We're happy about the customers that we have that have been able to grow in that market. And then finally, we have a great network where the service, we're able to capture that and get all of that business that's out there. Very fluid. As you saw in the fourth quarter, 14% improvement in car velocity doesn't come unless you've got very fluid operations. Now to Jim's point, are there opportunities? Of course, there are. In fact, I'll talk about those as we go through this. But overall, right now, yes, very fluid. Thanks, Scott, I got both of those. Thank you. So first of all, you're exactly right. Prices are controllable. And let me make this clear. It's not like we are jumped up here and waited till January 1 to look at price. We've been going down this path here for a few months. You've heard Jennifer and I say that we have a set amount, call it, almost half that we can touch from a pricing standpoint. Our commercial team has really been very effective sitting down with customers, talking to them about the improved service product, talking to them about our increased inflationary pressures that we saw from the labor side and how Eric is leveraging that to improve the service products that we give them. They're seeing the same input. They're seeing the same increases. I've been meeting with customers. And so they know that. So yes, we control a portion of that, and so we've been very focused on articulating that story. I think you had a question on the international side. And yes, you're correct. We lost some of that earlier in the year, last year. The bulk of that will still be working through in 2024. Yes. I mean with the service product, when the investments that you heard Eric talk about this morning, the margins have to be acceptable to be on the network. Yes. So first of all, we have a robust business development pipeline. It's a healthy one. It's an encouraging one. We're excited about the pipeline in front of us, so a lot of opportunities there. The main thing I want to start with is our service product is in a strong position. And so as we talk about the service that we sold to customers, you look at some of the markets, just to get a little bit more detail here. Look at coming out of Mexico, that's a service product that Eric has given us daily. That's undisputed and unmatched coming out of Mexico. It's the fastest product. It's also a product that is on time. You look at the West Coast and someone asked me a question earlier, we're blessed with a network where we can pitch and we can catch. We can pitch coming out of the West Coast as we onboard and on dock. We've got a strong IPI. We can catch in the Inland Empire. We built that up. We put investments there, and we've shared with you that we've got plans to really grow in that area. And with the network and the service product we have, we're expecting to grow. If you look at the carload side, you've heard us talk about some of the wins in the auto side. I talked about the petrochem side. That's a great network down in the Gulf Service Park [ph] is improving. Our commercial leaders, commercial teams are sitting out there and talking to customers about taking a little bit more truck off the road. So we're bullish on getting out there and growing as the service product is there, and we're investing in the network. That's true. We'll still see the bulk of it still showing up in 2024. Sure. Yes. I mean, Ben, the near shoring, Israel [ph]. We've seen the billions that have gone in, in all of 2023. These are - a number of them are highly industrial and rail centric, which we find encouraging. I talked about the service product that we have, and we're not waiting around for the near shoring to happen. We've seen some wins with us having the fastest product coming out of Mexico, especially in time-sensitive products like auto parts, again, a daily service. We're reaching into the Midwest. We're reaching into different parts of Canada. And so we're encouraged by that. We're bullish about that. We are talking to customers about that. We're putting as much as we can on the network. And you also saw us create a service product into the Southeast, which we have gained some traction on. So again, coming out of Mexico, it's a great franchise for us. We've got six borders that we can get in and out of Mexico. So great product and great franchise. So you look - you asked the question about intermodal, domestic intermodal. First of all, if you look at where the rates have been, I'll differentiate the spot rates of the last 4 months sequentially, shown, I'll call it, very slow gradual increase, which is encouraging. The same issue on the contractual side, very slow gradual improvement sequentially the last 4 months. So I can't get into saying whether I think over the next 3 months, that's going to continue. We've got a lot of mixed feedback from customers, but encouraged by what we've seen in the past. I've said this before that we have mechanisms in our contracts for our suite of customers to keep them competitive, real time and times like this. And as the market improves, I would just mention some of those indices, it will help us some of those mechanisms that we have to procure a little bit more price and better margin. So again, we're not going to frame up the magnitude. I can tell you, we're focused on growing the international intermodal network. We've been blessed with a new intermodal terminal there in Phoenix. It's going to open up February 1. I talked about some of the other products that we have coming out of Houston. We've talked about Mexico. So again, we're bullish and we want to make sure that we're moving that product at the appropriate margin, acceptable margin. Yes. So post 2024, as you look at it, I mentioned a lot of industrial base markets that are going there. Think in terms of auto, think in terms of metals and minerals, think in terms of petrochemical market. We're certainly not going to guide on your basis point question. Here's what I will say, though, and I've repeated this, and I want to make sure I hit this pretty hard. We've got a service product coming out of Mexico that is unmatched. It's a daily product. It's the fastest product to getting in and out of the heart of Mexico. We also have 6 gateways, which gives us optionality, which gives our customers optionality, which gives us an opportunity to hit different parts of Mexico. So yes, we feel very bullish about Mexico and the growth, and we've been working from an industrial development perspective with all the stakeholders with all the customers to help bring that on. Not at all."

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation will be available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jim Vena, Chief Executive Officer for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Vena, you may now begin.\nJim Vena: Rob, thank you very much, and good morning, and good morning to everyone that's joined us, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Union Pacific's Third Quarter Results. I'm joined in Omaha by our Chief Financial Officer, Jennifer Hamann; our Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Kenny Rocker and our Executive Vice President of Operations; Eric Gehringer. It's been a busy couple of months since we joined in Union Pacific. I'm very excited to be back to come back to work with over 40 years of railroading experience, including two years here at UP. I know this railroad, I understand the opportunity. To win, you need a strong management team, the right culture, and a great franchise, and that's the goal, win and be the best in the industry. Since I started, I've spoken with employees, customers, regulators, community officials and investors. And my message has been consistent. It starts with safety. Our goal is to be the safest railroad in North America. That's the standard we should set for ourselves. We also expect to be the best in service and operational excellence. Service is delivering what we sold to our customers. Operational excellence is using our resources and assets as efficiently as possible. It's being mindful of our cost and developing our people. A key early initiative of mine is to drive decision-making lower in the organization. This means reducing layers and simplifying how we work. We need to deliver value with speed. This is a cultural change to empower our people. We recognize that our business volumes fluctuate and weather presents its challenges. So we will always keep a buffer of resources to manage those situations. This commitment to safety, service and operational excellence will lead to growth. And for you, our owners, that generates industry-leading returns. There's work to be done, but the entire team understands our strategy for success. Now let's discuss third quarter results, starting on slide three. This morning, Union Pacific reported 2023 third quarter net income of $1.5 billion or $2.51 per share. This compares to 2022 third quarter net income of $1.9 billion or $3.05 per share. Our third quarter operating revenue declined 10%, reflecting lower fuel surcharge revenue, reduced volumes and decreased other revenue. Expenses also were lower year-over-year driven by fuel expense and last year's onetime charge for labor agreement. But there's an ongoing mismatch in our cost structure, resulting in an operating ratio of 63.4% as we continue to be challenged by inflation, including pressure from new labor agreements and higher casualty costs. Additionally, the lag on our fuel surcharge program negatively impacted results as fuel prices rose during the quarter. No doubt about it. It was a tough quarter, but I'm pleased with the positive productivity we're quickly gaining. Our service performance also is strengthening as we're positioning ourselves to meet customer demand while at the same time, storing assets. I'll let Eric and Kenny discuss both in more detail. Ultimately, we're taking the right actions to build from here. So with that, let me hand it to Jennifer to provide more details on the third quarter financials.\nJennifer Hamann: Thanks, Jim, and good morning. I'm going to discuss our third quarter results by walking through the income statement on slide five. Starting with operating revenue of $5.9 billion, down 10% versus last year on a 3% year-over-year volume decline. Breaking it down further, as illustrated in the appendix slides, freight revenue totaled $5.5 billion, down 9% versus 2022. Total fuel surcharge revenue of $637 million declined $515 million from last year. The impact of lower year-over-year fuel prices as well as the lag in our surcharge programs reduced freight revenue 8%. The combination of price and mix increased freight revenue, 150 basis points as solid core pricing gains were partially offset by an unfavorable business mix. Increased short-haul rock moves and fewer lumber carloads outweighed the impact of moving fewer low average revenue per car intermodal shipments. In addition, our pricing gains continue to include the impact of certain coal and intermodal contracts that are more reflective of current market conditions. Wrapping up the top line, other revenue decreased 13% versus last year, driven by a $70 million year-over-year reduction in accessorials. Switching to expenses, where again, more detailed information can be found in the appendix. Operating expense of $3.8 billion declined 4%, driven by lower fuel prices, last year's onetime charge for labor agreements and volume-related costs. Digging deeper into a few of the expense lines, compensation and benefits expense decreased $77 million versus 2022, which does include last year's $114 million onetime labor charge. Third quarter workforce levels increased 3% and our active TE&Y workforce is up 2% as we graduated new train crew personnel during the quarter. At this point, with our train crews more appropriately staffed, our training pipeline is shrinking. Today, we have just over 500 employees in training, down more than 50% from last quarter's pipeline of roughly 1,200. Excluding the impact of last year's labor charge, cost per employee was essentially flat in the third quarter as we are starting to generate better overall productivity. As a result, we now expect full year cost per employee to be up closer to 3%. Both third quarter and full year cost per employee reflect elevated workforce levels and better crew efficiency, partially offset by wage inflation, which includes $20 million in the third quarter from paid sick leave. Fuel expense in the quarter decreased 25% on a 21% decrease in fuel prices from $3.96 a gallon to $3.12. Our fuel consumption rate was flat, but showed positive momentum through the quarter as we stored locomotives and improved freight car velocity. Finally, other expense grew 18%, primarily related to continued pressure in casualty costs. It also reflects the impact of onetime write-offs as highlighted in the financial walk down slide on 22 in the appendix. The resulting outcome is third quarter operating income of $2.2 billion, down 17% versus last year. Below the line, other income decreased $18 million driven by last year's $35 million gain from a real estate transaction. Interest expense increased 6%, reflecting higher average debt levels. Income taxes are lower in the quarter on reduced income and lower tax rates that resulted in a $41 million deferred tax expense reduction. Similar to last year's $40 million tax reduction, we again had three states cut corporate income tax rates in the third quarter. Net income of $1.5 billion declined 19% versus 2022, which when combined with a lower average share count resulted in an 18% decrease in earnings per share to $2.51. Third quarter operating ratio increased 3.5 points to 63.4%. Core results, which include the impact of inflation, lower volumes and cost inefficiencies accounted for the majority of the year-over-year change. Turning now to slide six and cash flows. Year-to-date, cash from operations totaled $6 billion, a decrease of roughly $1 billion from 2022. The combination of lower net income and nearly $450 million of labor payments were the main drivers. Free cash flow and our cash flow conversion rate also were impacted. Year-to-date, we've returned a little more than half of the cash generated or $3.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and we finished the third quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio up slightly from 2022 levels at three times as we continue to be A rated by our three credit agencies. Wrapping up now on slide seven. The overall financial story and outlook for the remainder of 2023 is largely unchanged. We're facing a demand environment where we don't expect full year volumes to exceed industrial production. We do, however, still expect to generate pricing dollars in excess of inflation dollars. Although as we've discussed through the year, not to the level that offsets the negative impact of elevated costs on our operating ratio. Fuel also remains a headwind on earnings per share, although moderating from the $0.34 negative EPS impact in the third quarter to approximately $0.10 of negative year-over-year impact in the fourth quarter. And that assumes fuel prices in the fourth quarter are around $3.30 a gallon. And significant inflation headwinds remain primarily in the form of the new labor agreements. We expect similar levels for fourth quarter paid sick leave expense to third quarter and the impact of the BLET work rest agreements will primarily be seen through elevated force levels. Finally, our capital plan is coming in a little bit higher at $3.7 billion. All that said, the important takeaway from today's results and our view of tomorrow is that we're making gains from maximizing growth opportunities and repricing our business to improving service and generating productivity, we're striving to build on the current momentum as we end 2023 and enter 2024 on a path to further financial improvement. With that, I'll turn it over to Kenny to give us a view of the business environment.\nKenny Rocker: Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning. You just heard from Jennifer that freight revenue declined 9% with a 3% decrease in volume for the third quarter. Let's jump right into the business team to recap the market drivers on the revenue side. Starting with Bulk. Revenue for the quarter was down 10% compared to last year, driven by a 6% decrease in average revenue per car due to lower fuel surcharges and a 4% decline in volume. Grain exports were softer than last year due to tight supply. Coal volume was down 5% for the quarter by continued decline for the use of coal and electricity generation combined with competitive pressures from lower natural gas prices. Lastly, we saw a reduction in import beer carloads due to the increased utilization of larger railcars, which creates value for both the customer and Union Pacific. Industrial revenue was down for the quarter driven by a 6% decrease in average revenue per car. Core pricing gains in the quarter were offset by lower fuel surcharges and a negative mix in volumes. Softer decline for lumber and corrugated boxes continue to be a challenge, but our relentless focus on business development is driving excellent growth in our Rock network that supports construction of new emerging LNG facilities along the Texas Gulf and growth in the petroleum products for both domestic and Mexico energy reform. Premium revenue for the quarter was down 12% on a 4% decrease in volume and a 9% decrease in average revenue per car from fuel surcharges in a challenging truck market. Automotive volumes were positive with continued strength in OEM production and dealer inventory replenishment for finished vehicles and auto parts. In addition, a robust business development pipeline like winning both wagon shipments from the Texas Gulf enabled us to outperform the market in the quarter. Intermodal volumes were down in the quarter, primarily driven by softness in parcel segment and weak imports on the West Coast. However, domestic truckload volume was slightly up driven by business development wins and strengthen our Mexico shipments. Turning to slide 10. Here is our outlook for the fourth quarter as we see it today. Starting with bulk, we anticipate continued challenges in coal as natural gas futures remain volatile. We are watching grain closely as we enter the export season. Crops have been harvested right now and increased supplies will be available to move. US soybean export sales have started out floor than forecasted. However, we have an improved service product this year to capture more available demand. Lastly, our forecast for renewable biofuel feedstock continues to remain strong. We see solid demand in this market and continue to capture new business. We recently landed opportunities with projects coming online soon in Iowa, Louisiana and Nevada. Moving onto Industrial. The economic forecast for industrial production looks to stay depressed in the fourth quarter. However, we expect petroleum and construction markets to remain favorable due to our focus on business development. And finally, for premium, we are staying close with our intermodal customers in this challenging demand environment. We've seen a seasonal uptick at the beginning of the quarter and we believe our improved service product positions us well to handle market demand. In addition, we expect automotive growth to continue, driven by strong OEM production and elevated shippable ground count. However, we are watching closely the ongoing UAW negotiations and the negative impact they are having on fourth quarter volumes as the strikes persist. In summary, we are fortunate to have a diverse portfolio that allows us to see positive momentum in some of our commodities. The team remains focused on what we can control. and I'm proud of the progress we've made in such a challenging market. We have a strong pipeline of opportunities that we're actively pursuing by leveraging our great franchise and extending our reach with transload, interline and short line partners. We are winning new business and I am confident that with our improved service product, we can open up more doors to new profitable growth opportunities. With that, I'll turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance.\nEric Gehringer: Thank you, Kenny, and good morning. Starting on slide 12. As Jim mentioned, safety is the foundation of everything we do, and our goal is to lead the industry. Union Pacific can be the best because we've been there before. We have exceptional people and the entire team is focused on returning every employee home safely every day. While our progress has been encouraging, we must continue to improve technology and strive to provide best practices to the industry and the communities that we serve. Safety impacts every facet of our business, our employees, customers, communities and shareholders and we are committed to world-class safety performance. Closely aligned with our goal of industry-leading safety, we are confident in our ability to lead the industry in both service and operational excellence. In late August, the southwestern portion of our network was challenged by a series of intense weather events that caused widespread flash flooding and washouts. However, through the bold and relentless efforts of our team, we were able to quickly respond and rapidly restore operations. Despite the weather headwinds, our performance metrics improved year-over-year. We look to maintain that positive momentum as the vast majority of our metrics in the month of September represented our best performance year-to-date. Freight car velocity improved 5% this quarter versus last year. Throughout the last several weeks, we have maintained a freight car velocity of around 210 miles per day. The impact of increased freight car velocity can be felt by our customers through the benefit of improved trip plan compliance, both intermodal and manifest and auto TPC saw a sizable 13 and 6 point year-over-year improvement, respectively. We will continue our work to deliver the service we sold to our customers. Now let's review our key efficiency metrics for the quarter on slide 13. The team is continuing to take actions to right-size resources to align with current volumes and run an even more efficient network. This incorporates Jim's strategy of empowering our people closest to the work and removing layers to increase the speed of decision-making. Locomotive productivity improved 4% versus last year, as we continue to identify opportunities to utilize the fleet more efficiently. The third quarter marked both our lowest active high horsepower fleet size and the highest quarterly locomotive productivity number since the first quarter of 2022. Workforce productivity, which includes all employees, was down 6% versus last year, reflecting the impact of volume declines, coupled with increased workforce levels. Leveraging a larger workforce, we have reduced borrow outs to the lowest total of the year and slowed hiring. We remain firmly focused on effectively managing our workforce levels and recognize the importance of balancing our resources as we plan for the future. Train length improved 1% compared to third quarter 2022, despite lower volumes in our intermodal business. By putting more product on fewer trains, we have increased train length across our system by over 500 feet or 6% since January of this year. Our focus on train length is paying dividends, and we are continuing our work to further improve this measure. While our service product demonstrated noticeable improvement, there are more opportunities to improve the efficiency of our locomotive fleet, increased workforce productivity and maximize train length. We must sustain momentum across all of our operating metrics as we exit the year. So with that I'll turn it back to Jim.\nJim Vena: Thank you, Eric. Turning to slide 15. Before we get to your questions, I'd like to quickly summarize what we've -- you've heard from our team. Jennifer walked you through the inflationary pressure we continue to face broadly throughout our cost structure, but more specifically from new labor agreements. These are real hurdles that will require price generation and productivity to overcome. Kenny outlined a challenging volume environment, one with price spots like construction and biofuels, but ultimately is being overwhelmed by soft consumer markets. Despite this environment, the team is leveraging our business development pipeline to bring new business to the railroad. And finally, from Eric, you heard that we're improving safety, service and efficiency. We exited the quarter with great momentum. September was a very strong month across all of our operating metrics and the momentum continues today, but we're still nowhere near what I believe we can deliver. There's still plenty of room to improve. I came back to win and I could see the opportunity at Union Pacific. In a short period, we've increased the urgency across all facets of our strategy. The ultimate outcome is better service for our customers, which drives growth for the railroad by aligning the team with a strategy of safety, service and operational excellence, we will win. We're now ready to take your questions. Rob?\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will be from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Hoexter: Hey, good morning, and congrats on the new role, Jim. Jim, maybe just starting there on operations and Eric, is this -- what is changing here or what needs to change? Is it the plan? Is it -- you have too much equipment -- maybe talk a little bit about what metrics you focus on as you get started or productivity. You threw out there, there were too many locomotives, maybe provide some numbers and targets and thoughts on how you get there? Thanks.\nJim Vena: And nice to be back and nice to hear your voice again, and I'll let Eric jump in, in a minute, but because he's the operating person. He's responsible. He is the person I'm going to keep accountable for to make sure we drive it. But what metrics do I look at? I haven't changed. A successful railroad is always fluid, make sure that you operate in a manner where you don't impact the network because of decisions you made with the kind of service that you've sold and the way you use your assets and people and whether you have the capacity on the railroad. So when I look at Union Pacific, what do I look at, at a high level, I look at do we have the physical plant to be able to handle the traffic and be able to handle the ups and downs that every railroad or knows happens with weather who thought we were ever going to get a hurricane in the West Coast, okay? That's always an Eastern seaboard issue more and a Gulf issue, but not Western, but I think we did as a team, we did a great job of recovering. So you need a strong network, and we have the capacity there. We'll continue to invest to make sure. So that's important to me. And we have to make sure that we have a buffer of people and assets so that we're ready for the ups and downs the business that happens because I wish it was flat line Ken and you know it as well as I do. You've been following the railroads for a long time. So let me go on because this is an important question is what do I look at? I look at -- in the morning, first thing when I get up, I'd probably get about 100 different touch points on the railroad, all in one spreadsheet. But what I actually look at is I look at revenue first. Where are we financially? What was our volume like? And what kind of -- where the revenue is? And if it's not good, the next call is to Kenny. Okay? Then the next thing I look at is car velocity. It's an end-to-end measure tells me how well the railroad is doing. 210 is a good number, but nowhere near what's possible. So Eric's got has done a great job so far, but we need to push more. Then it's -- then you continue to look at the fluidity numbers. How well we are at crew changes, how the intermodal terminals, how fast we're getting to pad, how fast we're allowing the truckers to go through. So there's a lot of metrics that we look at that most people probably haven't heard me talk about, but I thought I'd give you a little broader view of what I look at. And then after you do that, there's the asset issue. How many cars per carload, the locomotives. So we've got over 500 locomotives parked. And those 500 are ready to go locomotives. So we could turn them on in a short period of time. We've got some place in strategic locations if we need them on the network to keep the service level that we sold. On top of that, we have more locomotives that are stored for longer term. So we're in good shape on assets. We spool up this railroad to operate at the level that is possible with the type of business that we have. And I think it's a win-win for us Ken and that's what I look at every morning. Eric, do you want to add anything?\nEric Gehringer: When we think about recap in the quarter, Ken, you start thinking about we did make great progress in the quarter from a fluidity perspective to Jim's point. And when you think about what did we do with that, we were able to store approximately 300 locomotives during the quarter. We're able to reduce our recrew rate. We took down our borrow out to the lowest level we've had all year. Now we continue to face the headwind from a workforce productivity of some of our agreements. So clearly, the challenge that we've given ourselves and we continue to challenge ourselves with is how do you work to overcome that productivity headwind. So when you think about things like some of the agreements that we've signed that actually allow us to remove certain people off of certain jobs across the system. We work to continue to reduce the fleet even more as we grow train length. I'm super proud of the team for the train length they've grown since January. There's still more opportunity there. When I think about remote control locomotives have been able to reduce some of our gain productivity and some of that, that's an opportunity for us. And the list goes on and now, we probably could talk about it for an hour. So I'm very excited about it. I think this is just the beginning.\nJim Vena: Thanks for the question. Appreciate it.\nKen Hoexter: Great. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Fadi Chamoun with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nFadi Chamoun: Yeah, good morning, and welcome back, Jim. I mean a quick question. I think we've heard this in the past many times and maybe from you Jim, it's first, you have to fix kind of the engine and ultimately energize the commercial momentum. And I think the success story around the industry really are in that vein where a collaboration between operation and commercial have been a big catalyst for that. So my question is in terms of fixing the engine and you talked about car velocity, where do you think kind of you are for the network that you have in that process? And what is ultimately the right kind of goal from a car velocity perspective from an asset velocity perspective for UP, where are you in that process? And as we go into 2024, can you kind of make progress can you improve operating ratio even if volume or flat or the economy is muted and there is no momentum on that front?\nJim Vena: So Fadi, I like the question because it frames exactly what -- when I came back to work the challenges that I could see the first challenge we had was inflation, both input costs plus labor costs and some of the collective agreements we signed. Every CEO that comes in always wants to blame people beforehand. That's not the way I look at it. That's the challenge. I knew what I would get myself into. So we do -- how do we fix that piece is as we drive and look for efficiency, and there's efficiency there. Usually, I don't give a -- and you know that, Fadi, I don't forecast numbers. But I'll tell you, I'll be disappointed if that car velocity doesn't return to where it was before that we had in 2020. There's no reason for us to not be low 220s. So that's about as far as I'm going to get on that number. If I look at the other piece that we have to do and Kenny is all over it and his team is, we know that we can't through efficiency and productivity recover everything in the long-term. But what we can do is we can price properly for what the service that we're providing to our customers, and Kenny's all over that. And that's going to take a little bit of time, and I'll let Kenny later on talk about this. But -- so the way I look at it is those two things, if we do them right, and let's leverage this railroad that we have, okay? We're a 70-mile an hour railroad. There's only one other railroad in North America that runs their freight trains at 70 miles an hour, okay? So let's leverage that. And you could see that when we changed the service out of Mexico because we want to leverage Mexico to grow our business in and out. And by doing that and providing customers a service that from the border, nobody can beat us to Chicago. We have the fastest service of anybody, especially with the new train service that we have on. So we should leverage that. Now not everybody wants speed, so we have to make sure that we're consistent. We also have to leverage our network. I love the places we serve and where we can take our customers to. I love the way our origination customers are and the number we have in the variety crossing all market segments. And if we do that, Fadi, we become the most efficient railroad. Operationally, we -- I've always said this, and I will continue to say it. We will have the best margin railroad in North America, best operating ratio, best margin, whichever way you want to look at it, I'm comfortable with that. And we give a chance for the customers that are with us to win and we look to move customers that are using other modes, including trucks that look at the railroad as their way that they want to win. So I'm happy. I didn't come back to work to lose. I came back to win. I was more than comfortable. Most people in my age are thinking about doing other things. In fact, I had a trip to K2 plant. And when the opportunity came up and we agreed with the Board on what the strategy was and what we wanted to do moving forward, I said, listen, I'm all in. Let's go. So I've been working hard with the team and I'm pushing them hard. At the end of the day, we need to make decisions quicker. We need to react quicker. We need to quit having so many layers that slow down the decision-making, and with that, we end up winning, Fadi. Hopefully, I answered your question. I know it was a long answer. And maybe there won't be any other questions after this.\nFadi Chamoun: Appreciate it. Thanks.\nJim Vena: Okay.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Seidl: Thank you, Operator. Good morning, Jim, welcome back, Jennifer, Kenny and Eric. Wanted to focus a little bit on sort of the inflation and pricing dynamic that we have going on here currently. Is this just a case for waiting until we can get to repricing some more of the contracts as we move through and seeing sort of better fluidity in the railroad? And are we just sort of in for a few tough quarters here in terms of comps?\nJim Vena: Kenny, go ahead.\nKenny Rocker: Yes. Thanks for that question. No, we're not waiting. We're repricing these contracts right now in real time. We're having some very clear and direct conversations with customers. The commercial team is doing an excellent job of really articulating what took place from a labor standpoint and these costs and specifically how what we're doing and what Eric is doing on his side, how we'll benefit our customers. Now I'll tell you that our customers are seeing some of the same pressures and it's playing out in their markets that way too. The other thing, and Jennifer talked about this a little bit we're investing a lot of money here. We're investing $3.7 billion. We don't lose an opportunity to share that with customers and talk about the value that they get from those investments. And so you look at that, you look at the improved service product that Eric is delivering us. We have no problem looking at our customers in eye talking to them about pricing the value that's there.\nJennifer Hamann: And Kenny just to remind Jason and others. So we can't access all of our contracts immediately from a price standpoint. So we do have, call it, half of our book of business is in multiyear contracts. So to your question, Jason, it does take us a bit to work through and reprice those contracts. But Kenny and team are very focused at every opportunity they get, they're having that conversation and they're winning in the marketplace with higher prices.\nJason Seidl: And Jennifer could you remind us how they renew through the course of '24 what percent?\nJennifer Hamann: So we've not talked about 2024, but in general, call it, half of our book is multiyear contracts, 25% is tariff and the other 25% or so are contracts that are a year or less in duration.\nJason Seidl: Okay. Fair enough. I appreciate the time.\nJim Vena: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks very much. Hi, Jim. Hi, Jennifer. Hi, everyone. Jennifer, can you talk about, I guess, OR expectations as we move from 3Q to 4Q, obviously, the fuel headwind I think that gets even better sequentially. You talked about year-over-year, but I think it actually gets a little bit better sequentially. You're moving 8,000 more carloads per week. It's only two weeks into the quarter, so I don't want to get ahead of myself, but we're seeing some decent sequential volume growth. So could you talk about that? And then, Jim, just related to Jim and Eric, actually, you talked about getting car velocity up to 220 miles per day. You've already had great improvement on that in recent months and that has corresponded nicely to kind of this improvement in volume. Should we think that, that increase to 220 allows you to essentially move more volume that's waiting to be moved and we can see kind of a corresponding increase in kind of the seven-day carloadings? And how do you get comfortable? How do you get us comfortable that the added volume doesn't drive service challenges, which historically has been the case for all railroads. So if you can just talk about that as well. Thank you.\nJennifer Hamann: I'll maybe start off and address your question, at least the question about sequential OR improvement. As I've said in my prepared remarks, we're looking to build off the momentum that we have here as we ended out the third quarter and take that into the fourth quarter. And so without making any guide relative to what fourth quarter volumes are going to do, to your point, we're off to a good start, very pleased by that. But we're going to operate as efficiently as we can. And we do think we have an opportunity to have sequential gains going from third quarter to fourth quarter on the OR basis. It's going to take hard work by the team. It's going to take continued gains in terms of how we're operating the railroad and driving efficiency, but that's absolutely the goal that we're looking at. Jim, do you want to maybe hit the rest of this question about freight car velocity.\nJim Vena: So what -- the reason I use car velocity is it truly is that end-to-end number that gives you a great indication. And it's not the only indicator, but it gives you an indicator. So I like the question. You said, can you handle an increase in business and are you leaving business behind? I wish we were leaving business behind. I really do and we are not. And we will look for everything we can to get more business. The railroad and railroads get themselves in trouble when they lose sight of what the fundamentals are for an increase in business. Increasing business can come in a lot of different ways. One is it can be bulk, which adds people adds locomotives as puts more pressure on the capacity. And we built this railroad that has the capacity, which you always have to concentrate on and usually is the limiting factor when you increase especially on the carload business is how well your terminals and what the capacity is on the terminals. And when I was here last time, we worked on in the Houston area and invested a lot of money to make sure that, that terminal has the capacity to grow with the products that we handle in the industrial landscape. And it's important for us and we are going through a process to make sure that every car has the least amount of touch points, fluidity is king. And that we can handle the most cars per employee within all those terminals and we have the gap that allows us to be able to react when the business comes up. If you add an extra intermodal train or you add an extra 1,000 feet on one of our locomotive trains. That's an easier fix again, as long as the terminals, whether it's G4 in Chicago or it's the Dallas terminals have the capability to handle it in an expeditious manner the same way. I think we have it with all the business that Kenny's promised me, okay? Is as we have the capacity, but we will invest and make sure we try to stay ahead of the curve on the fluidity on our terminals. And if we drive the terminals properly because that's usually your limiting factor more so than what the physical plant is out in the railroad and we keep that buffer of people so that we have the people to react. I'm not real worried about if we go up another 10,000 carloads. In fact, what a challenge to have. So Kenny, your job to bring it on. So thank you very much for the question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJordan Alliger: Hi. Thanks. I think Intermodal is often viewed as critical or key long-term growth engine for the industry. Are you now in a position do you think to start taking more share from trucks with trip plan compliance moving higher? And if not, what still needs to happen to get intermodal to grow, obviously, other than the macro, is it more service from you? Do truck rates have to move up? Can you give some thoughts around that? Thank you.\nJim Vena: Kenny, if I can just start real quick, and then I'll pass it over to you. The price is important. You have to have the right price that allows you, but service has to be consistent. And a few weeks is not good enough for any customer to say, how's the railroad do it? If I was a customer, I'd be looking at -- are you consistent in your service? And when you get impacted because our car velocity will drop with some weather events through the winter. This is not a game where you can forecasted to be at a 220 level all the time. We're going to have some impact. Sometimes it will be higher, sometimes lower. It's how fast we recover. If we can do that and we can show shippers that we have the capability to deliver their products in a consistent manner, recover fast, then I think we have the opportunity. But it takes time. No one's going to believe you the first time you show up and say, wow, we did had a great September. Well, how about January? How was that? And how was 2022? I think they have memories of that. Kenny?\nKenny Rocker: Just to build on what Jim mentioned, let me just level fit. First, we've got a really strong stable of customers private assets, customers that are on our network along with our own railroad assets with EMP UMAX and so -- what that does is that provides optionality for the BCO. So that's the first thing that we are appreciative of. Next as you look at all the product development that we're investing, investing in a little bit more expansion in Kansas City, the new product development with Twin Cities, Inland Empire. You look at the discussion around Eric really improved product around coming into and out of Mexico. That's been great for us. But setting aside this macro thing as our service improves, really, the North Stars going over the road. You've heard us say by our estimation that we've got a pretty low market share in terms of overall rail coming into and out of Mexico, and that's ripe for more penetration and we're inserting more products out there. We announced that we've got a product to the Southeast that we're taking advantage of. And so very bullish, we're on offense and we're clear-eyed about growing there.\nJim Vena: Thanks for the question, Jordan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Thanks. Good morning. Welcome back Jim. Just wanted to ask more about visibility to the cost inflation on labor side specifically into '24. Obviously, it's been a challenge, but it's going to get will be a little bit more challenging next year, I think of the 4.5% increased bonus and maybe some work rest rules around SMART-TD. So maybe Jennifer you can give us some sense as to how much visibility you have for the cost inflation side when it comes to labor. And then Jim, would just love to get your thoughts on perhaps just the broader regulatory picture. Obviously, UP had some challenges with the regulator on embargoes. Last year, there was a FRA letter about some of the infections. So UP has been under the microscope a little bit. Just wanted to see how you perceive that as you're new into the seat? Thank you.\nJennifer Hamann: We're talking about inflation. I mean we're still in the process of putting together our 2024 plan, but you hit some of the key ones there, Brian, in terms of July 1 is the last of the scheduled wage increases for the craft professionals from the PEB and that's 4.5%. Obviously, there will be wage increases on the non-agreement side as well. So there will be labor inflation pressures. You mentioned the work rest. And so those are all -- while there are pressures, there are opportunities, right, for us to look at how we can be more productive in how we do every part of our business. And so that's one of the things we always challenge the team with is how can we chip away at inflation. It's not just Kenny's job from a price standpoint. It's all of our jobs as we look to drive productivity and work more efficiently. Purchased services and materials, that's an area that also has seen some pretty heavy inflation over the last couple of years. The labor piece of that probably will continue. As the labor market stays tight, probably we'll continue to see more pressure as well. Beyond that, if I think about fuel, obviously, driven by energy markets, we have opportunities there to be more efficient on the equipment rent side. That's where car velocity certainly can play a role for us as we speed up the network, turn the assets more efficiently. And then the last one I'll mention is the other expense line, which, as you know, has been pressured the last year or so on the casualty side, and that's some higher verdicts, higher awards. And that's probably something that's going to be around for a bit. That's why that's the corollary benefit to us running a safer railroad is taking those incidents off the table. We want everybody to go home safe. We want our customers' freight to arrive undamaged but then it flows through from a cost standpoint as well. So those are kind of the big buckets that I'll outline for you. And obviously we'll talk in more specifics when we put the plan together and talk to you in January.\nJim Vena: You bet. So Brian, listen, good article on the cars per employee. I think it was a great comparison and it shows where the opportunity is. So well done on that. I enjoyed reading that last night, one of the last things I did before I went to bed. You asked about the regulatory agencies and how the relationship is. I think it's best to describe it like this. With the FRA, we're aligned. We have the exact same goal. And I like that the FRA wants to come out and look at the railroad to see if our safety management system is proper. We're getting -- we're using the railroad in the proper manner and that we're safe. So I love that. I have no issue with it. And I have a good relationship. I've reached out good relationship with the FRA, but it's not my relationship that's the most important is how we deal with things out in the field. We're professional. We look for ways to improve, and we work with the FRA because they get to look at other railroads. And when they give us some feedback, we need to take it to see how we improve. So I think that's the way the relationship. And on the STB, there's lots going on, and I won't discuss the specifics, but I grew up in Canada working on a railroad that had inter-switching for a distance, and I know what the pluses and minuses are there. I don't see anything as we're moving forward, and we'll give our feedback because I think we want to make sure that we don't impact our customers and what we serve and slow down the railroads because of a regulatory framework. So we have to be careful because our customers compete with people with other, of course, within the US, other modes, but they also compete in the world. There's products that we move for customers that go around the world that if we wreck the efficiency of the railroads, it's a mistake. And I know the STB does not want that. What they want is they want to make sure that we have good service. And that's the best way for us to make sure that the regulatory environment doesn't affect us is we provide good service if we provide the service that we sold to our customers, then we win. So I'm very comfortable with the relationship. I think we need to continue to communicate, and we both. We have the same end goal with the STB and the FRA. So Brian, I think it's -- the relationship is good. We'll take the feedback, and we'll see where we can improve.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Thank you, Jim. Thank you.\nJim Vena: Thank you, Brian.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good morning and welcome back, Jim. So it sounds like we want to get more price more productivity, but we still have inflation. You said you want to get to best-in-class margin. I guess we got to get improvement first. So when do you think you can start improving margins again? And then separately, Jennifer, the buyback has just been a big part of the earnings growth for a long time. Is this a temporary pause, more of a prolonged change, now you're thinking about the buyback? Any thoughts there? Thank you.\nJim Vena: Jennifer, why don't you answer the first piece of Scott's question.\nJennifer Hamann: Sure. No. This is not a change in our philosophy around capital allocation, Scott, as we talked back in July. This is just looking at cash flows, looking at the balance sheet and taking a temporary pause. You heard me mention that our debt-to-EBITDA levels are around three times here at the end of the quarter, a little bit elevated from where they have been historically. And so our job is to hit on the things you mentioned earlier with the price, productivity, grow the business and generate more EBITDA, generate more cash flow and resume our share repurchase program.\nJim Vena: And Scott, on the second piece is, the last time I showed up in January 14th of 2019 versus August 14th of this year is the railroad is more efficient. It did not back up to the place where it was before. It was very easy pickings to go park a 1000 locomotives. So we don't have that. But what we do have is we still have productivity. I see productivity across everything that we do from how management works, how many people we need to operate the railroad to how well we use our assets. So it won't be quite as large. It won't be the $1.3 billion that we did last time, but there is productivity gain that we can do. So with that, it's going to take a little bit longer. Some of these changes that I see will not be as quick. I won't be able to go to North Platte and Park 90 locomotives because we had them parked outside the diesel shop first day. But there is ways for us to speed it up and there's still locomotives that we can park and make sure that they're used efficiently. So it will take us a little bit longer. And stay tuned with us and you'll see hopefully incremental changes to our numbers that will tell you that we're headed the right way. And there'll be ups and downs. There is no advantage of budgeted some things we can't control. I really don't know what's going to happen to the economy next year. Are we going to have a recession? Are we not going to have a recession? I'm hoping we -- the country does not have a recession and that would help us. So hopefully, I answered your question, Scott.\nScott Group: Thank you, guys.\nJim Vena: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC. Please proceed with your question.\nWalter Spracklin: Thanks very much, operator, and welcome back, Jim. I know when you first came back and you just mentioned locomotive storage employee productivity improvement, we're really a key focus for you very successful on that. They had some pretty quick turnarounds. Just wondering now, you're in the seat, you probably have multiyear views here and whether you can grab some longer-term kind of structural efficiency objectives. And I'm referring here to things like comp yards and things that take a little longer time to address that perhaps you didn't look at immediately when you first were in the role that that you may be looking at here now. I'm just wondering if when you look at the hump yards that Union Pacific has on its network, do you think they're right aligned? Or do you see some opportunity to reduce some of those or any other infrastructure assets that are on the network?\nJim Vena: Walter, nice talking to you again and good question. So the real world, the way I look at it is there's nothing wrong with hump yards, but they have to fit into the fluidity and the touch points of how many times we touch cars and how many cars we actually have to handle. And hump yards are okay. So at this point, with the way the network is as far as getting into that detail is good. What I don't like that I've seen is our put through is not as fast. Our dwell needs to drop our dwell and the amount of time that we have railcars in yards at the intermodal terminals at intermediate points will drive productivity gains so that we are able to have more fluidity and that's real important to me. Now when I came back last time I came with one goal, I came back, I came to work drive operational efficiency. I didn't look at the rest of the company very much and the rest of the company needs to be looked at. And that's what we're doing now. So everything that we did operationally, we are going to look at what we've done. And 1 example is the delayering exercise, you can't have 9 levels from the CEO to the people who actually do the work and expect that the message is clear, the decisions are made clear, and there isn't some hiccup in the decision stops. And I want to drive it so that we have way less layers. And that means with less layers, the people out in the field are empowered to make the right decision, which trained the hump, which trained the switch? How we move the cars? What are we doing to customers? What are we doing for scheduling? How are we loading? Is our loading pattern, right? So many things that we can do. And if we do that, they're better at it than us, Walter. There's no way that Jim Vena, even though I think I'm a decent operator, I could go operate the hump yard, maybe when I retire next time we become just a hump yard operator in one place and see how well because I think a few people would love me to go out there and see if I'm as good as I say sometimes, okay? But at the end of the day, that's what's important. And that's one of the things. That's a big change this dealer and exercise that we're going through and stay tuned, we'll announce what the findings are as we move ahead.\nWalter Spracklin: Looking forward to hearing about it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nThomas Wadewitz: Yes. Good morning, and Jim, I also wanted to say welcome back. I think the -- this is a bit of a high-level question, and I'm guessing the answer is kind of both. But wanted to see if you could give some color on how we should look at the opportunity in terms of being a volume story or a cost story. I mean you clearly did a lot with cost last time in 2019, 2020. You are talking a lot about productivity. But what's the -- what's really the more important lever for operating income growth in the next couple of years? Is this a little bit of productivity and a lot of volume? And then I guess to the extent that there's the productivity side, is that driven by headcount reduction? Or is that really more other cost buckets like locomotive costs, car costs, that type of thing? Thank you.\nJim Vena: Good question. Why don't we start with, Kenny, why don't you talk about the opportunity on the growth side, the pricing side and what we have -- what we're looking forward to?\nKenny Rocker: So we talked a little bit about it in terms of markets like our biofuels very bullish on our construction and autos, I mean, just set aside the strike that's going on now. I talked about the business development win, but it's still holding up from a demand environment. We need the strike to come back. And then we've talked about international intermodal. Now we've had a little bit of what I'll call a seasonal bump, we'll call it peak season. And you've heard me say we haven't had one in a few years, so it's nice to see one. But on the domestic side, also there's just still a tremendous amount of over-the-road share that there. We think it's in the low teens that's in between out of Mexico and then the Mexico in terms of over-the-road share that we should be gathering. Eric is out there getting up more improved products. We've got a lot of optionality out of Mexico. We see that as a growth engine. As some of these consumer-facing products improve. We've always said that we felt good about our petrochem business. Industrial chem is also included in that. So if you look across the line, there's a lot of upside, and we're very bullish on the volume growth is there.\nJim Vena: So Eric, why don't you talk about it? Because the question is great. It's -- there's no advantage of but that we have to grow the business. We have the price and take care of what's happened to us inflation-wise and leverage our network, but productivity, what do you see your piece of it?\nEric Gehringer: Absolutely. We talked about productivity really differentiated into two buckets to some of our commentary already this morning, there's no easy productivity, but this most straightforward productivity is when you get that volume, how do you leverage it on the existing network that we have, the existing trains we have the whole idea of being volume variable plus. The other bucket of productivity is how we actually do the work. So when we think about our locomotive shops, our mechanical shops or our engineering games, for example, on the non-op side, it's a real challenge to them to say, hey, you still need to do the important work, how you do it more efficiently. So when we think about going into a locomotive facility and making sure that we balance the headcount to the exact number of locomotives they have to the forecasted number to being really thoughtful about how do we use that material in there to being thoughtful about how do we think about redoing cores. I mean there's infinite areas of opportunity within each one of our departments to be able to look deep into the business, deep into the work and really find those opportunities. To Jim's point, it's a little bit harder work than it was a few years ago, but it's still work that we know how to do and work that we'll be successful doing that.\nJim Vena: And I know neither one of them wanted to touch it, they always leave those things for me that people is going to be one. We look for cost savings on what our input costs are. And of course, it's much more difficult on -- in the inflationary place that we find ourselves in this country, but we're going to look for every opportunity to use less so that we can save costs that way. And on headcount, absolutely, we're going to use attrition to rightsize the company as much as we can to what we know now, we've identified where we want to get to. So it will be through attrition mostly, and we'll move ahead from there. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Vernon: Hey, good morning, guys. So I wanted to talk a little bit about -- I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the earnings leverage we should have from some of the intermodal agreements you guys are signing, obviously, the Falcon service, the partnership with NS. How should we be thinking about the profile from a margin perspective of that traffic coming on, particularly early here as truck rates remain low and it seems like intermodal companies are out there just counting the service to take some share? And then maybe a bigger picture, Jim, could you talk a little bit about how you see the competitive dynamic for UP changing post the CP/KC acquisition. We've heard a lot from Lance in the past on this, but I don't think we've had a chance to hear you talk about how that acquisition creates risks or opportunities for Union Pacific from your perspective? Thank you.\nJim Vena: Okay, Jennifer.\nJennifer Hamann: Thank, David, for that question. You've heard us talk about margins before in terms of the -- when we look at it, where you see some of the greatest margin pressure relative to our book of business is in that business that's truck competitive. And we certainly are in a truck competitive market today. But that's also our opportunity that you've heard us talk about in terms of tremendous growth, and we know that there's leverage in margins from volume growth that can help drive greater productivity. And as we are building a better service product, certainly, as we provide better service, there's a price for that service. And we look to price to that to be able to meet that customer demand. I don't know, Kenny, if you want to add anything to that?\nKenny Rocker: No. The only thing I'd say is that as we're looking in the current environment, we're certainly keeping our customers competitive with mechanisms that we have in our contracts, and we are clear out about as the markets change, they're stable now as they get a little bit more tighter, demand strengthen, we'll see upside from a price perspective, which should show up in margin.\nJim Vena: And on the competitive dynamic and the specific example of CP/KC. So I think they're a great railroad. I think they have a great network. I think they're a leader, Keith, he's a friend. I've known him for a long time, and he's smart, knows out a railroad. So he knows how to balance safety service, asset utilization, cost control and developing is people, same thing as we do. So the competition is, and I like it. There's nothing wrong with little competition. So I want to win, he wants to win. There's no advantage of us that the CPKC, if it's origination, the destination on their railroad we have a competitive disadvantage. But the advantage we have is we've got this great network. We go through 23 states. We serve the population in the US, we have fast access. We have a 70-mile hour railroad. We're fast. And if we have to be, if that's what we sold was fast, we can do that. And you can see it when we move our parcel business as we're doing and getting up to their peak period coming up towards Christmas. So all those things plus we have access into Mexico, broader access than one or two places. We go into the -- into Mexico, from the West Coast all the way east in a number of locations. And we have a strong partner in FXC. And as you know, we own 26% of them and that helps us. So I'm excited. CP/KC is going to make it difficult and we're going to make it difficult. Now I don't chase price. This is not a price discussion. It's about a service and access to markets and how we do it. And I'll walk away from business if somebody wants to lower their price. Go ahead, take the business, I'll bring in a business that fits our network that makes sense. So that's how I think of competitors, and I could have that discussion about all the other railroads. I want us all to be really good and strong.\nDavid Vernon: So are you seeing a potential volume risk from a diversion standpoint?\nJim Vena: Kenny?\nKenny Rocker: No, we're going out there. We feel good about the service product. We're going head on. We're ready to compete. Again, the North Star, and I said this earlier, it's over-the-road. So we're on office and we're starting off well.\nDavid Vernon: All right. Thank you, guys.\nJim Vena: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question will be coming from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi. Good morning. Hi, Kenny, can you expand a little bit on that over-the-road opportunity? Is it something that you're seeing build a lot more in the pipeline today? I know you had talked about some of your customers wanting to see maybe more reliable service before that sort of conversion happens in terms of those opportunities? But any color on how we should think about progression in terms of today versus the multiyear out? Thanks.\nKenny Rocker: Yes. So again I mentioned roughly mid-teens call it 15% that our estimation that's moving rail out of there. We see that as the right opportunity to go after that over-the-road products. We've got to revise more competitive, faster service product that Eric is delivering on in the high 90 percentile for what we've scheduled that too. And we have seen some wins. We have seen some over-the-road wins come early. We've added extra products that I talked about going into the Southeast. Remember, we're moving, Allison, our products seven days a week. That's in a few days a week and customers like that. And we see it as the right spot to go after and grow.\nAllison Poliniak: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\nChristian Wetherbee: Thanks. Good morning. So we noticed that headcount was down sequentially for the first time in a while, and Jim, you noted using attrition here. So maybe thinking about the next couple of quarters, should we expect head count to stay relatively flat, maybe come down a little bit as you use attrition? And then maybe asked a different way, how much volume do you think you can manage with current headcount? So as we hopefully see a recovery in freight as we move forward, is there an opportunity to leverage this existing workforce to drive more productivity without adding heads?\nJim Vena: Chris, nice to hear your voice again. There's so many pluses and minuses, additions or subtractions. We still haven't fully implemented the 11 and 4 deal on scheduling with BLET. And we haven't concluded negotiations with SMART-TD on what that does. So we have to see how that goes. The general way I see it, though, is that we do want to see a more productive workforce in the company as we move ahead. But I would be remiss to tell you without those collective agreements in place of exactly what the time line is. But you know me by now that I always look at what do we need of the railroad and is at the right level to be productive with it. So I'll do everything I can. But with those outstanding items, we still -- there's -- I just can't give you a black-and-white answer of what the time line is and how fast those changes go to where I want to take it. It might take a little bit longer than when -- if we didn't have those deals in place.\nJennifer Hamann: Yes. But Jim, I do think it's safe to say, once we have those deals implemented and we're working to drive the productivity. Our long-term view is that we can grow volumes faster than we grow headcount.\nJim Vena: Absolutely.\nChristian Wetherbee: Okay. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it.\nJim Vena: Thanks, Chris.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good morning, and congrats, Jim. So Jim, I guess, I think if we look back over the last number of CEOs at Union Pacific, the disappointment that I think probably all of them would share would be lack of relative volume growth and as I'm looking at my model here, I think RTMs this year are probably going to end up being down more than like 25% from where this company peaks way back in 2006. So as much as we're talking about service and the ability to grow and the pipeline looks strong, like we've heard that before. So what is different looking forward with you as CEO at Union Pacific that you think you can really capture some of that market opportunity?\nJim Vena: Well, I'm going to repeat myself, but it truly is, you have to have the fundamentals, you have to provide the service. You have to see what's happening. And I think we can grow faster than what the economy gives us. And that's our goal and that's where we're going to drive it judge me in a year, okay? I want the Board to judge me. I want the shareholders to judge me and the team, and I think we're there. I think we can do that. Do we have some headwinds? Absolutely. You know the industry as well as I do. Coal is always an issue that we have to deal with. But the rest of the products that we have, we're going to go after it. We're going to go get it. We're going to bring it on in the right place. And if we grow not as fast as we want, we're going to price properly for the service we're providing. So I think it's a win-win, and let's talk next year. I'll put it on my calendar. You can ask me the question of how we're doing, okay.\nBrandon Oglenski: Will do, Jim. Thanks.\nJim Vena: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jonathan Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nJonathan Chappell: Thank you. Good morning. Kenny, we've talked about a lot of things as it relates to intermodal, new services, best wins, conceptually there should be some share shift back to the West Coast, hopefully, after a couple of years of losses there. But the truckload market on the over-the-road opportunity continues to bounce along this bottom. So how competitive is the pricing dynamic within intermodal, whether it's your new services relative to other rail options or relative to truck. And how do you manage then the capacity you're willing to commit to these new kind of growth alternatives when you do have maybe a competitive pricing landscape that's more difficult at this point of the cycle?\nKenny Rocker: Yes. First of all, it's great that we put the investments in for our intermodal network. You've heard me mention them. I won't go over them again, but it does start there. Obviously, the service matters. We've been deliberate about making sure we can insert optionality on that domestic intermodal product, and we've done that. You've heard us talk about the strong stable we have as you look at Hub and Schneider and if -- and FTG that's there, our rail product with EMP, UMAX, and we've invested in that fleet from a GPS perspective, invested in the ramp. So we're prepared from that standpoint. You -- I think your question is a little bit about how we keep them competitive. And I've talked about that in terms of, again, we have mechanisms to make sure that our customers regardless IMCs, private assets are competitive. And what we want to be is just nimble and quick and change with the market so that we can get that margin and price improvement as we move along.\nJonathan Chappell: Thanks, Ken.\nJim Vena: Great. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.\nBascome Majors: Jim, you said you had about 500 locomotives parked. I was curious just high level, how do you think about the locomotive strategy at UP versus what you inherited? I know you've got a big order for refurbishment that will go out several years. But just strategically, longer term, how are refurbished locomotives performing? Where do you see your CapEx going over the next three, five, seven years to satisfy both the service needs you have and the emissions targets you put out there? Thank you.\nJim Vena: Okay. So we'll continue to invest in our locomotives. And Bascome, we'll always make sure that we have the right locomotive and make them as fuel efficient as possible so that we can save fuel when we're operating. No advantage or buts that's what we'll continue to do. And as far as where the CapEx, we're not ready now, but I'm pretty sure that you'll see our CapEx be in at a different starting point next year than where we were this year. And that's how I view it and stay tuned. And when we get into January, we'll give you the numbers of what our plan is for next year. Thanks, Bascome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nJeffrey Kauffman: Thank you very much, Jim, welcome back and congratulations. You've answered this a couple of different ways, but let me come at this in terms of what's different from 2019 since you came back. I think you talked a little bit about what's different at the railroad, but maybe talk about in terms of the customer expectations in the market or kind of where volume is, where business is and how the railroad in your view, needs to adapt?\nJim Vena: Well, I think railroading, the basic foundation of railroad hasn't changed from 2019. How we look at the business at Union Pacific, how fast we are making decisions needs the change. When I showed up, I asked Kenny to give me a number of customers that I could talk to at a high level and talk about what our services, what our plan was. And one of them said to me that they wanted to invest a lot of money to be able to build out because there was expansions going on in the soda patch -- soda ash patch. So at the end of it, it was taking us over a year to give them a decision on whether we could do that. We need to change that. And if we change that and we were able to make the decision in four days, I got it. We can't make decisions in four days all the time, but we sure can make them in a few weeks instead of months. That's really important. That's a change in the way we want to do business. And the customers, the feedback was, there's opportunity for them to win in their marketplace, the customers that we have. So we need to build on that. And that's really important. The foundation is the same. We're going to operate a very efficient railroad, having a buffer, the fundamentals -- the five key fundamentals of how you operate the railroad, I'm not changing from. It's true, it's tested, it wins, it puts us in the right place. I'm not changing. And -- but we need to be consistent with our customers, work better for them to grow, and we win. So I'm looking forward to the challenge. One big difference between 2019 and now, my wife is still mad at me that I went back to work, okay? But other than that, everything else is good.\nJeffrey Kauffman: Awesome. Well best of luck to you. Thank you.\nJim Vena: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Hello, everybody. Just a follow-up on the Mexico and Falcon service commentary. Jim or Kenny, when you talk to customers kind of who are looking to potentially convert from truck or can convert from another railroad. How important is speed in their equation relative to an overall value proposition? I mean you said that you're at a bit of a structural disadvantage kind of given the interchange versus your peer, but what can you do from an overall value prop to kind of be competitive and kind of work against that structure? Does it [indiscernible] if you will.\nJim Vena: Yes. Listen, I probably wasn't clear. I don't think structurally we have any issue with any competitor. I just wanted to give due to CP/KC, if you're an origination railroad just like us, if we originate in Salt Lake and we're going to Boise, Idaho, it's pretty hard for somebody to compete against us, another railroad. That's all I was saying. At the end of the day, I think we compete against anybody because of the network we have, the speed we have and what we're capable to open up for markets. Kenny?\nKenny Rocker: So first of all, we know our customers. We know that automotive OEM with auto part for production is different than, say, an FAK business of -- contain our pillars. They are different. What differentiates us in that sense, I talked about the revised service product that is going to help us with customers that are speed sensitive. The fact that we have every day per week service, that's going to help us because that matters also. The fact that we have a group of private asset owners, and we also have our own containers to go into Mexico, that makes a difference. So again, we know our customers and those are the things that we talk to our customers about as we're winning business over the road.\nRavi Shanker: Great. Thank you.\nJim Vena: Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question is from the line of Justin Long from Stephens. Please proceed with your question.\nJustin Long: Thanks. Good morning. Jennifer, you talked about comp per employee being up about 3% this year, but I wasn't sure if that included the impact of the abnormal labor costs from last year. So how do you expect comp per employee to trend sequentially into the fourth quarter? And as we move into 2024, do you think this is an area where the productivity opportunity has potential to fully offset the inflation headwinds we're seeing?\nJennifer Hamann: So thanks for the question, Justin. In terms of your first question, when we talk about comp per employee, we do try to make it apples-to-apples. So we take out any of the one-timers. In terms of looking at it sequentially, as we go into the fourth quarter, there's probably a couple of things going on there to think about and consider. One is, as we're continuing to take people out of training classes, put them into full-time positions on the railroad. There's a little bit higher costs associated with that. And then just some of the OE capital mix that you get in the fourth quarter as you wind down some of the capital programs that can put a little pressure on there as well. Looking long-term, again, productivity and being able to offset cost inflation with productivity is always one of our objectives. Certainly, it's hard and a very high inflation environment, but that's our opportunity as well. That gives us the opportunity to really look critically at the work that's being done and make sure that we're being as efficient as we possibly can be. And I think you've heard on the call today, we see opportunities across the board, whether you're talking about how we're maintaining our locomotive fleet, how we're looking at our back-office functions, how we're managing the transportation employees. We have opportunities to be more efficient there.\nJim Vena: Well, listen, thanks, everyone, and let me tie this up, and I really appreciate everybody taking the time this morning to join us and talk about Union Pacific. And I think the team that's with me here has done a great job of explaining what we do, but let me summarize it real quick. Our goals are clear. It's about safety, service and operating excellence. That's how we win. And we're going to be really good at operations. We're going to provide consistent service to what we sold, every customer has a different level of service they required. Some of them is fast, some of them is sustainable. Some of it is making sure you're consistent. We're going to leverage the railroad. We're going to do everything we can to leverage the physical plant that we have. We're going to be efficient on how we do it. We are going to deal with stakeholders at all levels in a professional manner and listen to their inputs and see what we can do. I think we can win. This is not going to be a short-term fix that -- you'll see it. But what you should notice is as we go through the next quarters, you will see us improve and when we get to the right place with the inputs that we have in this railroad. I'm excited. The team is excited. We're moving fast and again, thank you very much, everyone, for joining us, and we'll talk to you all in the next quarter, if not some time before. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Thank you, Kenny, and good morning. Starting on slide 12. As Jim mentioned, safety is the foundation of everything we do, and our goal is to lead the industry. Union Pacific can be the best because we've been there before. We have exceptional people and the entire team is focused on returning every employee home safely every day. While our progress has been encouraging, we must continue to improve technology and strive to provide best practices to the industry and the communities that we serve. Safety impacts every facet of our business, our employees, customers, communities and shareholders and we are committed to world-class safety performance. Closely aligned with our goal of industry-leading safety, we are confident in our ability to lead the industry in both service and operational excellence. In late August, the southwestern portion of our network was challenged by a series of intense weather events that caused widespread flash flooding and washouts. However, through the bold and relentless efforts of our team, we were able to quickly respond and rapidly restore operations. Despite the weather headwinds, our performance metrics improved year-over-year. We look to maintain that positive momentum as the vast majority of our metrics in the month of September represented our best performance year-to-date. Freight car velocity improved 5% this quarter versus last year. Throughout the last several weeks, we have maintained a freight car velocity of around 210 miles per day. The impact of increased freight car velocity can be felt by our customers through the benefit of improved trip plan compliance, both intermodal and manifest and auto TPC saw a sizable 13 and 6 point year-over-year improvement, respectively. We will continue our work to deliver the service we sold to our customers. Now let's review our key efficiency metrics for the quarter on slide 13. The team is continuing to take actions to right-size resources to align with current volumes and run an even more efficient network. This incorporates Jim's strategy of empowering our people closest to the work and removing layers to increase the speed of decision-making. Locomotive productivity improved 4% versus last year, as we continue to identify opportunities to utilize the fleet more efficiently. The third quarter marked both our lowest active high horsepower fleet size and the highest quarterly locomotive productivity number since the first quarter of 2022. Workforce productivity, which includes all employees, was down 6% versus last year, reflecting the impact of volume declines, coupled with increased workforce levels. Leveraging a larger workforce, we have reduced borrow outs to the lowest total of the year and slowed hiring. We remain firmly focused on effectively managing our workforce levels and recognize the importance of balancing our resources as we plan for the future. Train length improved 1% compared to third quarter 2022, despite lower volumes in our intermodal business. By putting more product on fewer trains, we have increased train length across our system by over 500 feet or 6% since January of this year. Our focus on train length is paying dividends, and we are continuing our work to further improve this measure. While our service product demonstrated noticeable improvement, there are more opportunities to improve the efficiency of our locomotive fleet, increased workforce productivity and maximize train length. We must sustain momentum across all of our operating metrics as we exit the year. So with that I'll turn it back to Jim. When we think about recap in the quarter, Ken, you start thinking about we did make great progress in the quarter from a fluidity perspective to Jim's point. And when you think about what did we do with that, we were able to store approximately 300 locomotives during the quarter. We're able to reduce our recrew rate. We took down our borrow out to the lowest level we've had all year. Now we continue to face the headwind from a workforce productivity of some of our agreements. So clearly, the challenge that we've given ourselves and we continue to challenge ourselves with is how do you work to overcome that productivity headwind. So when you think about things like some of the agreements that we've signed that actually allow us to remove certain people off of certain jobs across the system. We work to continue to reduce the fleet even more as we grow train length. I'm super proud of the team for the train length they've grown since January. There's still more opportunity there. When I think about remote control locomotives have been able to reduce some of our gain productivity and some of that, that's an opportunity for us. And the list goes on and now, we probably could talk about it for an hour. So I'm very excited about it. I think this is just the beginning. Absolutely. We talked about productivity really differentiated into two buckets to some of our commentary already this morning, there's no easy productivity, but this most straightforward productivity is when you get that volume, how do you leverage it on the existing network that we have, the existing trains we have the whole idea of being volume variable plus. The other bucket of productivity is how we actually do the work. So when we think about our locomotive shops, our mechanical shops or our engineering games, for example, on the non-op side, it's a real challenge to them to say, hey, you still need to do the important work, how you do it more efficiently. So when we think about going into a locomotive facility and making sure that we balance the headcount to the exact number of locomotives they have to the forecasted number to being really thoughtful about how do we use that material in there to being thoughtful about how do we think about redoing cores. I mean there's infinite areas of opportunity within each one of our departments to be able to look deep into the business, deep into the work and really find those opportunities. To Jim's point, it's a little bit harder work than it was a few years ago, but it's still work that we know how to do and work that we'll be successful doing that."

            "name": "Jim Vena",
            "content": "Rob, thank you very much, and good morning, and good morning to everyone that's joined us, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Union Pacific's Third Quarter Results. I'm joined in Omaha by our Chief Financial Officer, Jennifer Hamann; our Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Kenny Rocker and our Executive Vice President of Operations; Eric Gehringer. It's been a busy couple of months since we joined in Union Pacific. I'm very excited to be back to come back to work with over 40 years of railroading experience, including two years here at UP. I know this railroad, I understand the opportunity. To win, you need a strong management team, the right culture, and a great franchise, and that's the goal, win and be the best in the industry. Since I started, I've spoken with employees, customers, regulators, community officials and investors. And my message has been consistent. It starts with safety. Our goal is to be the safest railroad in North America. That's the standard we should set for ourselves. We also expect to be the best in service and operational excellence. Service is delivering what we sold to our customers. Operational excellence is using our resources and assets as efficiently as possible. It's being mindful of our cost and developing our people. A key early initiative of mine is to drive decision-making lower in the organization. This means reducing layers and simplifying how we work. We need to deliver value with speed. This is a cultural change to empower our people. We recognize that our business volumes fluctuate and weather presents its challenges. So we will always keep a buffer of resources to manage those situations. This commitment to safety, service and operational excellence will lead to growth. And for you, our owners, that generates industry-leading returns. There's work to be done, but the entire team understands our strategy for success. Now let's discuss third quarter results, starting on slide three. This morning, Union Pacific reported 2023 third quarter net income of $1.5 billion or $2.51 per share. This compares to 2022 third quarter net income of $1.9 billion or $3.05 per share. Our third quarter operating revenue declined 10%, reflecting lower fuel surcharge revenue, reduced volumes and decreased other revenue. Expenses also were lower year-over-year driven by fuel expense and last year's onetime charge for labor agreement. But there's an ongoing mismatch in our cost structure, resulting in an operating ratio of 63.4% as we continue to be challenged by inflation, including pressure from new labor agreements and higher casualty costs. Additionally, the lag on our fuel surcharge program negatively impacted results as fuel prices rose during the quarter. No doubt about it. It was a tough quarter, but I'm pleased with the positive productivity we're quickly gaining. Our service performance also is strengthening as we're positioning ourselves to meet customer demand while at the same time, storing assets. I'll let Eric and Kenny discuss both in more detail. Ultimately, we're taking the right actions to build from here. So with that, let me hand it to Jennifer to provide more details on the third quarter financials. Thank you, Eric. Turning to slide 15. Before we get to your questions, I'd like to quickly summarize what we've -- you've heard from our team. Jennifer walked you through the inflationary pressure we continue to face broadly throughout our cost structure, but more specifically from new labor agreements. These are real hurdles that will require price generation and productivity to overcome. Kenny outlined a challenging volume environment, one with price spots like construction and biofuels, but ultimately is being overwhelmed by soft consumer markets. Despite this environment, the team is leveraging our business development pipeline to bring new business to the railroad. And finally, from Eric, you heard that we're improving safety, service and efficiency. We exited the quarter with great momentum. September was a very strong month across all of our operating metrics and the momentum continues today, but we're still nowhere near what I believe we can deliver. There's still plenty of room to improve. I came back to win and I could see the opportunity at Union Pacific. In a short period, we've increased the urgency across all facets of our strategy. The ultimate outcome is better service for our customers, which drives growth for the railroad by aligning the team with a strategy of safety, service and operational excellence, we will win. We're now ready to take your questions. Rob? And nice to be back and nice to hear your voice again, and I'll let Eric jump in, in a minute, but because he's the operating person. He's responsible. He is the person I'm going to keep accountable for to make sure we drive it. But what metrics do I look at? I haven't changed. A successful railroad is always fluid, make sure that you operate in a manner where you don't impact the network because of decisions you made with the kind of service that you've sold and the way you use your assets and people and whether you have the capacity on the railroad. So when I look at Union Pacific, what do I look at, at a high level, I look at do we have the physical plant to be able to handle the traffic and be able to handle the ups and downs that every railroad or knows happens with weather who thought we were ever going to get a hurricane in the West Coast, okay? That's always an Eastern seaboard issue more and a Gulf issue, but not Western, but I think we did as a team, we did a great job of recovering. So you need a strong network, and we have the capacity there. We'll continue to invest to make sure. So that's important to me. And we have to make sure that we have a buffer of people and assets so that we're ready for the ups and downs the business that happens because I wish it was flat line Ken and you know it as well as I do. You've been following the railroads for a long time. So let me go on because this is an important question is what do I look at? I look at -- in the morning, first thing when I get up, I'd probably get about 100 different touch points on the railroad, all in one spreadsheet. But what I actually look at is I look at revenue first. Where are we financially? What was our volume like? And what kind of -- where the revenue is? And if it's not good, the next call is to Kenny. Okay? Then the next thing I look at is car velocity. It's an end-to-end measure tells me how well the railroad is doing. 210 is a good number, but nowhere near what's possible. So Eric's got has done a great job so far, but we need to push more. Then it's -- then you continue to look at the fluidity numbers. How well we are at crew changes, how the intermodal terminals, how fast we're getting to pad, how fast we're allowing the truckers to go through. So there's a lot of metrics that we look at that most people probably haven't heard me talk about, but I thought I'd give you a little broader view of what I look at. And then after you do that, there's the asset issue. How many cars per carload, the locomotives. So we've got over 500 locomotives parked. And those 500 are ready to go locomotives. So we could turn them on in a short period of time. We've got some place in strategic locations if we need them on the network to keep the service level that we sold. On top of that, we have more locomotives that are stored for longer term. So we're in good shape on assets. We spool up this railroad to operate at the level that is possible with the type of business that we have. And I think it's a win-win for us Ken and that's what I look at every morning. Eric, do you want to add anything? Thanks for the question. Appreciate it. So Fadi, I like the question because it frames exactly what -- when I came back to work the challenges that I could see the first challenge we had was inflation, both input costs plus labor costs and some of the collective agreements we signed. Every CEO that comes in always wants to blame people beforehand. That's not the way I look at it. That's the challenge. I knew what I would get myself into. So we do -- how do we fix that piece is as we drive and look for efficiency, and there's efficiency there. Usually, I don't give a -- and you know that, Fadi, I don't forecast numbers. But I'll tell you, I'll be disappointed if that car velocity doesn't return to where it was before that we had in 2020. There's no reason for us to not be low 220s. So that's about as far as I'm going to get on that number. If I look at the other piece that we have to do and Kenny is all over it and his team is, we know that we can't through efficiency and productivity recover everything in the long-term. But what we can do is we can price properly for what the service that we're providing to our customers, and Kenny's all over that. And that's going to take a little bit of time, and I'll let Kenny later on talk about this. But -- so the way I look at it is those two things, if we do them right, and let's leverage this railroad that we have, okay? We're a 70-mile an hour railroad. There's only one other railroad in North America that runs their freight trains at 70 miles an hour, okay? So let's leverage that. And you could see that when we changed the service out of Mexico because we want to leverage Mexico to grow our business in and out. And by doing that and providing customers a service that from the border, nobody can beat us to Chicago. We have the fastest service of anybody, especially with the new train service that we have on. So we should leverage that. Now not everybody wants speed, so we have to make sure that we're consistent. We also have to leverage our network. I love the places we serve and where we can take our customers to. I love the way our origination customers are and the number we have in the variety crossing all market segments. And if we do that, Fadi, we become the most efficient railroad. Operationally, we -- I've always said this, and I will continue to say it. We will have the best margin railroad in North America, best operating ratio, best margin, whichever way you want to look at it, I'm comfortable with that. And we give a chance for the customers that are with us to win and we look to move customers that are using other modes, including trucks that look at the railroad as their way that they want to win. So I'm happy. I didn't come back to work to lose. I came back to win. I was more than comfortable. Most people in my age are thinking about doing other things. In fact, I had a trip to K2 plant. And when the opportunity came up and we agreed with the Board on what the strategy was and what we wanted to do moving forward, I said, listen, I'm all in. Let's go. So I've been working hard with the team and I'm pushing them hard. At the end of the day, we need to make decisions quicker. We need to react quicker. We need to quit having so many layers that slow down the decision-making, and with that, we end up winning, Fadi. Hopefully, I answered your question. I know it was a long answer. And maybe there won't be any other questions after this. Okay. Kenny, go ahead. Thank you. So what -- the reason I use car velocity is it truly is that end-to-end number that gives you a great indication. And it's not the only indicator, but it gives you an indicator. So I like the question. You said, can you handle an increase in business and are you leaving business behind? I wish we were leaving business behind. I really do and we are not. And we will look for everything we can to get more business. The railroad and railroads get themselves in trouble when they lose sight of what the fundamentals are for an increase in business. Increasing business can come in a lot of different ways. One is it can be bulk, which adds people adds locomotives as puts more pressure on the capacity. And we built this railroad that has the capacity, which you always have to concentrate on and usually is the limiting factor when you increase especially on the carload business is how well your terminals and what the capacity is on the terminals. And when I was here last time, we worked on in the Houston area and invested a lot of money to make sure that, that terminal has the capacity to grow with the products that we handle in the industrial landscape. And it's important for us and we are going through a process to make sure that every car has the least amount of touch points, fluidity is king. And that we can handle the most cars per employee within all those terminals and we have the gap that allows us to be able to react when the business comes up. If you add an extra intermodal train or you add an extra 1,000 feet on one of our locomotive trains. That's an easier fix again, as long as the terminals, whether it's G4 in Chicago or it's the Dallas terminals have the capability to handle it in an expeditious manner the same way. I think we have it with all the business that Kenny's promised me, okay? Is as we have the capacity, but we will invest and make sure we try to stay ahead of the curve on the fluidity on our terminals. And if we drive the terminals properly because that's usually your limiting factor more so than what the physical plant is out in the railroad and we keep that buffer of people so that we have the people to react. I'm not real worried about if we go up another 10,000 carloads. In fact, what a challenge to have. So Kenny, your job to bring it on. So thank you very much for the question. Kenny, if I can just start real quick, and then I'll pass it over to you. The price is important. You have to have the right price that allows you, but service has to be consistent. And a few weeks is not good enough for any customer to say, how's the railroad do it? If I was a customer, I'd be looking at -- are you consistent in your service? And when you get impacted because our car velocity will drop with some weather events through the winter. This is not a game where you can forecasted to be at a 220 level all the time. We're going to have some impact. Sometimes it will be higher, sometimes lower. It's how fast we recover. If we can do that and we can show shippers that we have the capability to deliver their products in a consistent manner, recover fast, then I think we have the opportunity. But it takes time. No one's going to believe you the first time you show up and say, wow, we did had a great September. Well, how about January? How was that? And how was 2022? I think they have memories of that. Kenny? Thanks for the question, Jordan. You bet. So Brian, listen, good article on the cars per employee. I think it was a great comparison and it shows where the opportunity is. So well done on that. I enjoyed reading that last night, one of the last things I did before I went to bed. You asked about the regulatory agencies and how the relationship is. I think it's best to describe it like this. With the FRA, we're aligned. We have the exact same goal. And I like that the FRA wants to come out and look at the railroad to see if our safety management system is proper. We're getting -- we're using the railroad in the proper manner and that we're safe. So I love that. I have no issue with it. And I have a good relationship. I've reached out good relationship with the FRA, but it's not my relationship that's the most important is how we deal with things out in the field. We're professional. We look for ways to improve, and we work with the FRA because they get to look at other railroads. And when they give us some feedback, we need to take it to see how we improve. So I think that's the way the relationship. And on the STB, there's lots going on, and I won't discuss the specifics, but I grew up in Canada working on a railroad that had inter-switching for a distance, and I know what the pluses and minuses are there. I don't see anything as we're moving forward, and we'll give our feedback because I think we want to make sure that we don't impact our customers and what we serve and slow down the railroads because of a regulatory framework. So we have to be careful because our customers compete with people with other, of course, within the US, other modes, but they also compete in the world. There's products that we move for customers that go around the world that if we wreck the efficiency of the railroads, it's a mistake. And I know the STB does not want that. What they want is they want to make sure that we have good service. And that's the best way for us to make sure that the regulatory environment doesn't affect us is we provide good service if we provide the service that we sold to our customers, then we win. So I'm very comfortable with the relationship. I think we need to continue to communicate, and we both. We have the same end goal with the STB and the FRA. So Brian, I think it's -- the relationship is good. We'll take the feedback, and we'll see where we can improve. Thank you, Brian. Jennifer, why don't you answer the first piece of Scott's question. And Scott, on the second piece is, the last time I showed up in January 14th of 2019 versus August 14th of this year is the railroad is more efficient. It did not back up to the place where it was before. It was very easy pickings to go park a 1000 locomotives. So we don't have that. But what we do have is we still have productivity. I see productivity across everything that we do from how management works, how many people we need to operate the railroad to how well we use our assets. So it won't be quite as large. It won't be the $1.3 billion that we did last time, but there is productivity gain that we can do. So with that, it's going to take a little bit longer. Some of these changes that I see will not be as quick. I won't be able to go to North Platte and Park 90 locomotives because we had them parked outside the diesel shop first day. But there is ways for us to speed it up and there's still locomotives that we can park and make sure that they're used efficiently. So it will take us a little bit longer. And stay tuned with us and you'll see hopefully incremental changes to our numbers that will tell you that we're headed the right way. And there'll be ups and downs. There is no advantage of budgeted some things we can't control. I really don't know what's going to happen to the economy next year. Are we going to have a recession? Are we not going to have a recession? I'm hoping we -- the country does not have a recession and that would help us. So hopefully, I answered your question, Scott. Thank you. Walter, nice talking to you again and good question. So the real world, the way I look at it is there's nothing wrong with hump yards, but they have to fit into the fluidity and the touch points of how many times we touch cars and how many cars we actually have to handle. And hump yards are okay. So at this point, with the way the network is as far as getting into that detail is good. What I don't like that I've seen is our put through is not as fast. Our dwell needs to drop our dwell and the amount of time that we have railcars in yards at the intermodal terminals at intermediate points will drive productivity gains so that we are able to have more fluidity and that's real important to me. Now when I came back last time I came with one goal, I came back, I came to work drive operational efficiency. I didn't look at the rest of the company very much and the rest of the company needs to be looked at. And that's what we're doing now. So everything that we did operationally, we are going to look at what we've done. And 1 example is the delayering exercise, you can't have 9 levels from the CEO to the people who actually do the work and expect that the message is clear, the decisions are made clear, and there isn't some hiccup in the decision stops. And I want to drive it so that we have way less layers. And that means with less layers, the people out in the field are empowered to make the right decision, which trained the hump, which trained the switch? How we move the cars? What are we doing to customers? What are we doing for scheduling? How are we loading? Is our loading pattern, right? So many things that we can do. And if we do that, they're better at it than us, Walter. There's no way that Jim Vena, even though I think I'm a decent operator, I could go operate the hump yard, maybe when I retire next time we become just a hump yard operator in one place and see how well because I think a few people would love me to go out there and see if I'm as good as I say sometimes, okay? But at the end of the day, that's what's important. And that's one of the things. That's a big change this dealer and exercise that we're going through and stay tuned, we'll announce what the findings are as we move ahead. Good question. Why don't we start with, Kenny, why don't you talk about the opportunity on the growth side, the pricing side and what we have -- what we're looking forward to? So Eric, why don't you talk about it? Because the question is great. It's -- there's no advantage of but that we have to grow the business. We have the price and take care of what's happened to us inflation-wise and leverage our network, but productivity, what do you see your piece of it? And I know neither one of them wanted to touch it, they always leave those things for me that people is going to be one. We look for cost savings on what our input costs are. And of course, it's much more difficult on -- in the inflationary place that we find ourselves in this country, but we're going to look for every opportunity to use less so that we can save costs that way. And on headcount, absolutely, we're going to use attrition to rightsize the company as much as we can to what we know now, we've identified where we want to get to. So it will be through attrition mostly, and we'll move ahead from there. Thanks for the question. Okay, Jennifer. And on the competitive dynamic and the specific example of CP/KC. So I think they're a great railroad. I think they have a great network. I think they're a leader, Keith, he's a friend. I've known him for a long time, and he's smart, knows out a railroad. So he knows how to balance safety service, asset utilization, cost control and developing is people, same thing as we do. So the competition is, and I like it. There's nothing wrong with little competition. So I want to win, he wants to win. There's no advantage of us that the CPKC, if it's origination, the destination on their railroad we have a competitive disadvantage. But the advantage we have is we've got this great network. We go through 23 states. We serve the population in the US, we have fast access. We have a 70-mile hour railroad. We're fast. And if we have to be, if that's what we sold was fast, we can do that. And you can see it when we move our parcel business as we're doing and getting up to their peak period coming up towards Christmas. So all those things plus we have access into Mexico, broader access than one or two places. We go into the -- into Mexico, from the West Coast all the way east in a number of locations. And we have a strong partner in FXC. And as you know, we own 26% of them and that helps us. So I'm excited. CP/KC is going to make it difficult and we're going to make it difficult. Now I don't chase price. This is not a price discussion. It's about a service and access to markets and how we do it. And I'll walk away from business if somebody wants to lower their price. Go ahead, take the business, I'll bring in a business that fits our network that makes sense. So that's how I think of competitors, and I could have that discussion about all the other railroads. I want us all to be really good and strong. Kenny? Thank you. Chris, nice to hear your voice again. There's so many pluses and minuses, additions or subtractions. We still haven't fully implemented the 11 and 4 deal on scheduling with BLET. And we haven't concluded negotiations with SMART-TD on what that does. So we have to see how that goes. The general way I see it, though, is that we do want to see a more productive workforce in the company as we move ahead. But I would be remiss to tell you without those collective agreements in place of exactly what the time line is. But you know me by now that I always look at what do we need of the railroad and is at the right level to be productive with it. So I'll do everything I can. But with those outstanding items, we still -- there's -- I just can't give you a black-and-white answer of what the time line is and how fast those changes go to where I want to take it. It might take a little bit longer than when -- if we didn't have those deals in place. Absolutely. Thanks, Chris. Well, I'm going to repeat myself, but it truly is, you have to have the fundamentals, you have to provide the service. You have to see what's happening. And I think we can grow faster than what the economy gives us. And that's our goal and that's where we're going to drive it judge me in a year, okay? I want the Board to judge me. I want the shareholders to judge me and the team, and I think we're there. I think we can do that. Do we have some headwinds? Absolutely. You know the industry as well as I do. Coal is always an issue that we have to deal with. But the rest of the products that we have, we're going to go after it. We're going to go get it. We're going to bring it on in the right place. And if we grow not as fast as we want, we're going to price properly for the service we're providing. So I think it's a win-win, and let's talk next year. I'll put it on my calendar. You can ask me the question of how we're doing, okay. Thank you. Great. Thanks for the question. Okay. So we'll continue to invest in our locomotives. And Bascome, we'll always make sure that we have the right locomotive and make them as fuel efficient as possible so that we can save fuel when we're operating. No advantage or buts that's what we'll continue to do. And as far as where the CapEx, we're not ready now, but I'm pretty sure that you'll see our CapEx be in at a different starting point next year than where we were this year. And that's how I view it and stay tuned. And when we get into January, we'll give you the numbers of what our plan is for next year. Thanks, Bascome. Well, I think railroading, the basic foundation of railroad hasn't changed from 2019. How we look at the business at Union Pacific, how fast we are making decisions needs the change. When I showed up, I asked Kenny to give me a number of customers that I could talk to at a high level and talk about what our services, what our plan was. And one of them said to me that they wanted to invest a lot of money to be able to build out because there was expansions going on in the soda patch -- soda ash patch. So at the end of it, it was taking us over a year to give them a decision on whether we could do that. We need to change that. And if we change that and we were able to make the decision in four days, I got it. We can't make decisions in four days all the time, but we sure can make them in a few weeks instead of months. That's really important. That's a change in the way we want to do business. And the customers, the feedback was, there's opportunity for them to win in their marketplace, the customers that we have. So we need to build on that. And that's really important. The foundation is the same. We're going to operate a very efficient railroad, having a buffer, the fundamentals -- the five key fundamentals of how you operate the railroad, I'm not changing from. It's true, it's tested, it wins, it puts us in the right place. I'm not changing. And -- but we need to be consistent with our customers, work better for them to grow, and we win. So I'm looking forward to the challenge. One big difference between 2019 and now, my wife is still mad at me that I went back to work, okay? But other than that, everything else is good. Thank you. Yes. Listen, I probably wasn't clear. I don't think structurally we have any issue with any competitor. I just wanted to give due to CP/KC, if you're an origination railroad just like us, if we originate in Salt Lake and we're going to Boise, Idaho, it's pretty hard for somebody to compete against us, another railroad. That's all I was saying. At the end of the day, I think we compete against anybody because of the network we have, the speed we have and what we're capable to open up for markets. Kenny? Thanks for the question. Well, listen, thanks, everyone, and let me tie this up, and I really appreciate everybody taking the time this morning to join us and talk about Union Pacific. And I think the team that's with me here has done a great job of explaining what we do, but let me summarize it real quick. Our goals are clear. It's about safety, service and operating excellence. That's how we win. And we're going to be really good at operations. We're going to provide consistent service to what we sold, every customer has a different level of service they required. Some of them is fast, some of them is sustainable. Some of it is making sure you're consistent. We're going to leverage the railroad. We're going to do everything we can to leverage the physical plant that we have. We're going to be efficient on how we do it. We are going to deal with stakeholders at all levels in a professional manner and listen to their inputs and see what we can do. I think we can win. This is not going to be a short-term fix that -- you'll see it. But what you should notice is as we go through the next quarters, you will see us improve and when we get to the right place with the inputs that we have in this railroad. I'm excited. The team is excited. We're moving fast and again, thank you very much, everyone, for joining us, and we'll talk to you all in the next quarter, if not some time before. Thank you very much."

            "name": "Jennifer Hamann",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim, and good morning. I'm going to discuss our third quarter results by walking through the income statement on slide five. Starting with operating revenue of $5.9 billion, down 10% versus last year on a 3% year-over-year volume decline. Breaking it down further, as illustrated in the appendix slides, freight revenue totaled $5.5 billion, down 9% versus 2022. Total fuel surcharge revenue of $637 million declined $515 million from last year. The impact of lower year-over-year fuel prices as well as the lag in our surcharge programs reduced freight revenue 8%. The combination of price and mix increased freight revenue, 150 basis points as solid core pricing gains were partially offset by an unfavorable business mix. Increased short-haul rock moves and fewer lumber carloads outweighed the impact of moving fewer low average revenue per car intermodal shipments. In addition, our pricing gains continue to include the impact of certain coal and intermodal contracts that are more reflective of current market conditions. Wrapping up the top line, other revenue decreased 13% versus last year, driven by a $70 million year-over-year reduction in accessorials. Switching to expenses, where again, more detailed information can be found in the appendix. Operating expense of $3.8 billion declined 4%, driven by lower fuel prices, last year's onetime charge for labor agreements and volume-related costs. Digging deeper into a few of the expense lines, compensation and benefits expense decreased $77 million versus 2022, which does include last year's $114 million onetime labor charge. Third quarter workforce levels increased 3% and our active TE&Y workforce is up 2% as we graduated new train crew personnel during the quarter. At this point, with our train crews more appropriately staffed, our training pipeline is shrinking. Today, we have just over 500 employees in training, down more than 50% from last quarter's pipeline of roughly 1,200. Excluding the impact of last year's labor charge, cost per employee was essentially flat in the third quarter as we are starting to generate better overall productivity. As a result, we now expect full year cost per employee to be up closer to 3%. Both third quarter and full year cost per employee reflect elevated workforce levels and better crew efficiency, partially offset by wage inflation, which includes $20 million in the third quarter from paid sick leave. Fuel expense in the quarter decreased 25% on a 21% decrease in fuel prices from $3.96 a gallon to $3.12. Our fuel consumption rate was flat, but showed positive momentum through the quarter as we stored locomotives and improved freight car velocity. Finally, other expense grew 18%, primarily related to continued pressure in casualty costs. It also reflects the impact of onetime write-offs as highlighted in the financial walk down slide on 22 in the appendix. The resulting outcome is third quarter operating income of $2.2 billion, down 17% versus last year. Below the line, other income decreased $18 million driven by last year's $35 million gain from a real estate transaction. Interest expense increased 6%, reflecting higher average debt levels. Income taxes are lower in the quarter on reduced income and lower tax rates that resulted in a $41 million deferred tax expense reduction. Similar to last year's $40 million tax reduction, we again had three states cut corporate income tax rates in the third quarter. Net income of $1.5 billion declined 19% versus 2022, which when combined with a lower average share count resulted in an 18% decrease in earnings per share to $2.51. Third quarter operating ratio increased 3.5 points to 63.4%. Core results, which include the impact of inflation, lower volumes and cost inefficiencies accounted for the majority of the year-over-year change. Turning now to slide six and cash flows. Year-to-date, cash from operations totaled $6 billion, a decrease of roughly $1 billion from 2022. The combination of lower net income and nearly $450 million of labor payments were the main drivers. Free cash flow and our cash flow conversion rate also were impacted. Year-to-date, we've returned a little more than half of the cash generated or $3.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and we finished the third quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio up slightly from 2022 levels at three times as we continue to be A rated by our three credit agencies. Wrapping up now on slide seven. The overall financial story and outlook for the remainder of 2023 is largely unchanged. We're facing a demand environment where we don't expect full year volumes to exceed industrial production. We do, however, still expect to generate pricing dollars in excess of inflation dollars. Although as we've discussed through the year, not to the level that offsets the negative impact of elevated costs on our operating ratio. Fuel also remains a headwind on earnings per share, although moderating from the $0.34 negative EPS impact in the third quarter to approximately $0.10 of negative year-over-year impact in the fourth quarter. And that assumes fuel prices in the fourth quarter are around $3.30 a gallon. And significant inflation headwinds remain primarily in the form of the new labor agreements. We expect similar levels for fourth quarter paid sick leave expense to third quarter and the impact of the BLET work rest agreements will primarily be seen through elevated force levels. Finally, our capital plan is coming in a little bit higher at $3.7 billion. All that said, the important takeaway from today's results and our view of tomorrow is that we're making gains from maximizing growth opportunities and repricing our business to improving service and generating productivity, we're striving to build on the current momentum as we end 2023 and enter 2024 on a path to further financial improvement. With that, I'll turn it over to Kenny to give us a view of the business environment. And Kenny just to remind Jason and others. So we can't access all of our contracts immediately from a price standpoint. So we do have, call it, half of our book of business is in multiyear contracts. So to your question, Jason, it does take us a bit to work through and reprice those contracts. But Kenny and team are very focused at every opportunity they get, they're having that conversation and they're winning in the marketplace with higher prices. So we've not talked about 2024, but in general, call it, half of our book is multiyear contracts, 25% is tariff and the other 25% or so are contracts that are a year or less in duration. I'll maybe start off and address your question, at least the question about sequential OR improvement. As I've said in my prepared remarks, we're looking to build off the momentum that we have here as we ended out the third quarter and take that into the fourth quarter. And so without making any guide relative to what fourth quarter volumes are going to do, to your point, we're off to a good start, very pleased by that. But we're going to operate as efficiently as we can. And we do think we have an opportunity to have sequential gains going from third quarter to fourth quarter on the OR basis. It's going to take hard work by the team. It's going to take continued gains in terms of how we're operating the railroad and driving efficiency, but that's absolutely the goal that we're looking at. Jim, do you want to maybe hit the rest of this question about freight car velocity. We're talking about inflation. I mean we're still in the process of putting together our 2024 plan, but you hit some of the key ones there, Brian, in terms of July 1 is the last of the scheduled wage increases for the craft professionals from the PEB and that's 4.5%. Obviously, there will be wage increases on the non-agreement side as well. So there will be labor inflation pressures. You mentioned the work rest. And so those are all -- while there are pressures, there are opportunities, right, for us to look at how we can be more productive in how we do every part of our business. And so that's one of the things we always challenge the team with is how can we chip away at inflation. It's not just Kenny's job from a price standpoint. It's all of our jobs as we look to drive productivity and work more efficiently. Purchased services and materials, that's an area that also has seen some pretty heavy inflation over the last couple of years. The labor piece of that probably will continue. As the labor market stays tight, probably we'll continue to see more pressure as well. Beyond that, if I think about fuel, obviously, driven by energy markets, we have opportunities there to be more efficient on the equipment rent side. That's where car velocity certainly can play a role for us as we speed up the network, turn the assets more efficiently. And then the last one I'll mention is the other expense line, which, as you know, has been pressured the last year or so on the casualty side, and that's some higher verdicts, higher awards. And that's probably something that's going to be around for a bit. That's why that's the corollary benefit to us running a safer railroad is taking those incidents off the table. We want everybody to go home safe. We want our customers' freight to arrive undamaged but then it flows through from a cost standpoint as well. So those are kind of the big buckets that I'll outline for you. And obviously we'll talk in more specifics when we put the plan together and talk to you in January. Sure. No. This is not a change in our philosophy around capital allocation, Scott, as we talked back in July. This is just looking at cash flows, looking at the balance sheet and taking a temporary pause. You heard me mention that our debt-to-EBITDA levels are around three times here at the end of the quarter, a little bit elevated from where they have been historically. And so our job is to hit on the things you mentioned earlier with the price, productivity, grow the business and generate more EBITDA, generate more cash flow and resume our share repurchase program. Thank, David, for that question. You've heard us talk about margins before in terms of the -- when we look at it, where you see some of the greatest margin pressure relative to our book of business is in that business that's truck competitive. And we certainly are in a truck competitive market today. But that's also our opportunity that you've heard us talk about in terms of tremendous growth, and we know that there's leverage in margins from volume growth that can help drive greater productivity. And as we are building a better service product, certainly, as we provide better service, there's a price for that service. And we look to price to that to be able to meet that customer demand. I don't know, Kenny, if you want to add anything to that? Yes. But Jim, I do think it's safe to say, once we have those deals implemented and we're working to drive the productivity. Our long-term view is that we can grow volumes faster than we grow headcount. So thanks for the question, Justin. In terms of your first question, when we talk about comp per employee, we do try to make it apples-to-apples. So we take out any of the one-timers. In terms of looking at it sequentially, as we go into the fourth quarter, there's probably a couple of things going on there to think about and consider. One is, as we're continuing to take people out of training classes, put them into full-time positions on the railroad. There's a little bit higher costs associated with that. And then just some of the OE capital mix that you get in the fourth quarter as you wind down some of the capital programs that can put a little pressure on there as well. Looking long-term, again, productivity and being able to offset cost inflation with productivity is always one of our objectives. Certainly, it's hard and a very high inflation environment, but that's our opportunity as well. That gives us the opportunity to really look critically at the work that's being done and make sure that we're being as efficient as we possibly can be. And I think you've heard on the call today, we see opportunities across the board, whether you're talking about how we're maintaining our locomotive fleet, how we're looking at our back-office functions, how we're managing the transportation employees. We have opportunities to be more efficient there."

            "name": "Kenny Rocker",
            "content": "Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning. You just heard from Jennifer that freight revenue declined 9% with a 3% decrease in volume for the third quarter. Let's jump right into the business team to recap the market drivers on the revenue side. Starting with Bulk. Revenue for the quarter was down 10% compared to last year, driven by a 6% decrease in average revenue per car due to lower fuel surcharges and a 4% decline in volume. Grain exports were softer than last year due to tight supply. Coal volume was down 5% for the quarter by continued decline for the use of coal and electricity generation combined with competitive pressures from lower natural gas prices. Lastly, we saw a reduction in import beer carloads due to the increased utilization of larger railcars, which creates value for both the customer and Union Pacific. Industrial revenue was down for the quarter driven by a 6% decrease in average revenue per car. Core pricing gains in the quarter were offset by lower fuel surcharges and a negative mix in volumes. Softer decline for lumber and corrugated boxes continue to be a challenge, but our relentless focus on business development is driving excellent growth in our Rock network that supports construction of new emerging LNG facilities along the Texas Gulf and growth in the petroleum products for both domestic and Mexico energy reform. Premium revenue for the quarter was down 12% on a 4% decrease in volume and a 9% decrease in average revenue per car from fuel surcharges in a challenging truck market. Automotive volumes were positive with continued strength in OEM production and dealer inventory replenishment for finished vehicles and auto parts. In addition, a robust business development pipeline like winning both wagon shipments from the Texas Gulf enabled us to outperform the market in the quarter. Intermodal volumes were down in the quarter, primarily driven by softness in parcel segment and weak imports on the West Coast. However, domestic truckload volume was slightly up driven by business development wins and strengthen our Mexico shipments. Turning to slide 10. Here is our outlook for the fourth quarter as we see it today. Starting with bulk, we anticipate continued challenges in coal as natural gas futures remain volatile. We are watching grain closely as we enter the export season. Crops have been harvested right now and increased supplies will be available to move. US soybean export sales have started out floor than forecasted. However, we have an improved service product this year to capture more available demand. Lastly, our forecast for renewable biofuel feedstock continues to remain strong. We see solid demand in this market and continue to capture new business. We recently landed opportunities with projects coming online soon in Iowa, Louisiana and Nevada. Moving onto Industrial. The economic forecast for industrial production looks to stay depressed in the fourth quarter. However, we expect petroleum and construction markets to remain favorable due to our focus on business development. And finally, for premium, we are staying close with our intermodal customers in this challenging demand environment. We've seen a seasonal uptick at the beginning of the quarter and we believe our improved service product positions us well to handle market demand. In addition, we expect automotive growth to continue, driven by strong OEM production and elevated shippable ground count. However, we are watching closely the ongoing UAW negotiations and the negative impact they are having on fourth quarter volumes as the strikes persist. In summary, we are fortunate to have a diverse portfolio that allows us to see positive momentum in some of our commodities. The team remains focused on what we can control. and I'm proud of the progress we've made in such a challenging market. We have a strong pipeline of opportunities that we're actively pursuing by leveraging our great franchise and extending our reach with transload, interline and short line partners. We are winning new business and I am confident that with our improved service product, we can open up more doors to new profitable growth opportunities. With that, I'll turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance. Yes. Thanks for that question. No, we're not waiting. We're repricing these contracts right now in real time. We're having some very clear and direct conversations with customers. The commercial team is doing an excellent job of really articulating what took place from a labor standpoint and these costs and specifically how what we're doing and what Eric is doing on his side, how we'll benefit our customers. Now I'll tell you that our customers are seeing some of the same pressures and it's playing out in their markets that way too. The other thing, and Jennifer talked about this a little bit we're investing a lot of money here. We're investing $3.7 billion. We don't lose an opportunity to share that with customers and talk about the value that they get from those investments. And so you look at that, you look at the improved service product that Eric is delivering us. We have no problem looking at our customers in eye talking to them about pricing the value that's there. Just to build on what Jim mentioned, let me just level fit. First, we've got a really strong stable of customers private assets, customers that are on our network along with our own railroad assets with EMP UMAX and so -- what that does is that provides optionality for the BCO. So that's the first thing that we are appreciative of. Next as you look at all the product development that we're investing, investing in a little bit more expansion in Kansas City, the new product development with Twin Cities, Inland Empire. You look at the discussion around Eric really improved product around coming into and out of Mexico. That's been great for us. But setting aside this macro thing as our service improves, really, the North Stars going over the road. You've heard us say by our estimation that we've got a pretty low market share in terms of overall rail coming into and out of Mexico, and that's ripe for more penetration and we're inserting more products out there. We announced that we've got a product to the Southeast that we're taking advantage of. And so very bullish, we're on offense and we're clear-eyed about growing there. So we talked a little bit about it in terms of markets like our biofuels very bullish on our construction and autos, I mean, just set aside the strike that's going on now. I talked about the business development win, but it's still holding up from a demand environment. We need the strike to come back. And then we've talked about international intermodal. Now we've had a little bit of what I'll call a seasonal bump, we'll call it peak season. And you've heard me say we haven't had one in a few years, so it's nice to see one. But on the domestic side, also there's just still a tremendous amount of over-the-road share that there. We think it's in the low teens that's in between out of Mexico and then the Mexico in terms of over-the-road share that we should be gathering. Eric is out there getting up more improved products. We've got a lot of optionality out of Mexico. We see that as a growth engine. As some of these consumer-facing products improve. We've always said that we felt good about our petrochem business. Industrial chem is also included in that. So if you look across the line, there's a lot of upside, and we're very bullish on the volume growth is there. No. The only thing I'd say is that as we're looking in the current environment, we're certainly keeping our customers competitive with mechanisms that we have in our contracts, and we are clear out about as the markets change, they're stable now as they get a little bit more tighter, demand strengthen, we'll see upside from a price perspective, which should show up in margin. No, we're going out there. We feel good about the service product. We're going head on. We're ready to compete. Again, the North Star, and I said this earlier, it's over-the-road. So we're on office and we're starting off well. Yes. So again I mentioned roughly mid-teens call it 15% that our estimation that's moving rail out of there. We see that as the right opportunity to go after that over-the-road products. We've got to revise more competitive, faster service product that Eric is delivering on in the high 90 percentile for what we've scheduled that too. And we have seen some wins. We have seen some over-the-road wins come early. We've added extra products that I talked about going into the Southeast. Remember, we're moving, Allison, our products seven days a week. That's in a few days a week and customers like that. And we see it as the right spot to go after and grow. Yes. First of all, it's great that we put the investments in for our intermodal network. You've heard me mention them. I won't go over them again, but it does start there. Obviously, the service matters. We've been deliberate about making sure we can insert optionality on that domestic intermodal product, and we've done that. You've heard us talk about the strong stable we have as you look at Hub and Schneider and if -- and FTG that's there, our rail product with EMP, UMAX, and we've invested in that fleet from a GPS perspective, invested in the ramp. So we're prepared from that standpoint. You -- I think your question is a little bit about how we keep them competitive. And I've talked about that in terms of, again, we have mechanisms to make sure that our customers regardless IMCs, private assets are competitive. And what we want to be is just nimble and quick and change with the market so that we can get that margin and price improvement as we move along. So first of all, we know our customers. We know that automotive OEM with auto part for production is different than, say, an FAK business of -- contain our pillars. They are different. What differentiates us in that sense, I talked about the revised service product that is going to help us with customers that are speed sensitive. The fact that we have every day per week service, that's going to help us because that matters also. The fact that we have a group of private asset owners, and we also have our own containers to go into Mexico, that makes a difference. So again, we know our customers and those are the things that we talk to our customers about as we're winning business over the road."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website.  At this time, it's now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Mr. Fritz, you may begin. \nLance Fritz : Thank you, Rob, and good morning and welcome to Union Pacific's second quarter earnings conference call. With me today in Omaha are Kenny Rocker, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Eric Gehringer, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Jennifer Hamann, our Chief Financial Officer. We're also joined by our newly elected Independent Chair of the Board of Directors, Mike McCarthy, who will take a couple of minutes to address the announcements we made this morning regarding my successor and our Board.  Mike, the floor is yours. \nMichael McCarthy : Thanks, Lance. This morning, the Board of Directors announced that Jim Vena will be appointed the next Chief Executive Officer of Union Pacific. The Board has also appointed Jim to the Board of Directors. Jim brings a strong rail operations background at Union Pacific with over 40 years of experience. This includes two successful years as our Chief Operating Officer from 2019 to 2020. After a comprehensive search process, it was clear Jim's track record of operating excellence was unparalleled and he was the right candidate for the job. Jim will start as CEO on August 14, and we look forward to welcoming him back to Union Pacific.  The Board also announced that Beth Whited will be appointed President of Union Pacific. Beth has over 35 years of experience at our company and has held leadership roles across multiple departments. Recently, she has led our strategy, sustainability and workforce resource teams with great success.  Going forward, the operations, finance, marketing and sales, supply chain and technology functions will report directly to Vena. Whited will report to Vena, and her responsibilities will include the strategy, workforce resources, sustainability, law, corporate relations and government affairs functions.  In addition to these management changes, the Board is appointing two new Board members: Doyle Simons, former President and Chief Executive Officer of Weyerhaeuser; and John Wiehoff, former Chairman, President and CEO of C.H. Robinson. Both bring to our Board a wealth of skill sets, including operational expertise from leading large industrial public companies.  As Lance indicated, as part of these changes, we are adopting a corporate governance best practice by splitting the role of company CEO and Board Chair. With my election, the Independent Chair, Director, Sheri Edison, will take over leadership of the Corporate Governance, Nominating and Sustainability Committee.  In addition, the Board has created a new committee, Safety and Service Quality, which will have responsibility to review, evaluate and monitor compliance with safety programs and provide oversight of the company's service performance. Director Jane Lute will lead this committee.  The Board is very pleased to make these announcements today, which represent a continued commitment to Board refreshment to ensure that we have the right mix of skills and experience to oversee the company. We are confident that these new appointments set Union Pacific up for long-term value creation.  Before I turn it back over to Lance, I would like to thank him for his leadership these past eight years. His accomplishments are many. And over the next few weeks, we will properly celebrate them. Most importantly, though, his leadership has set our company up for great success for the years to come.  Thank you, Lance. And I'll turn it back over to you. \nLance Fritz : Thanks, Mike. We appreciate your leadership throughout the process. And I'm pleased to welcome back Jim to Union Pacific, and I'm confident that the company has the right leaders to advance the hard work that's underway.  Now let's turn to the business of the call and second quarter results. This morning, Union Pacific reported 2023 second quarter net income of $1.6 billion or $2.57 per share. This compares to 2022 second quarter net income of $1.8 billion or $2.93 per share. Our second quarter operating ratio of 63% was up 280 basis points versus 2022 primarily driven by lower revenue, inflationary pressures and the previously disclosed onetime ratification bonus payment.  Throughout the quarter, we provided our customers with a more consistent and reliable service product while generally meeting the demand that was available to us. Eric will discuss in more detail the progress we've made, but the bottom line is that the actions we've taken to strengthen our crew resources are improving the railroad.  We also acted during the quarter to increase the efficiency of our network by rightsizing our locomotive fleet using crews more efficiently and making sequential improvements in train length. We finished the quarter with our resources better aligned with current volumes.  As you'll hear from Kenny, while several of our markets showed growth, consumer-facing markets remained soft and drove the volume decline. However, the strength of our business development efforts enabled us to mitigate the macro impact and outperform our peers.  So let me turn it over to Kenny to provide more color on the business environment. \nKenny Rocker: Thank you, Lance, and good morning. For the second quarter, volume was down 2% driven by weak market conditions in our premium and bulk business groups. Freight revenue declined 5% driven by lower fuel surcharges and a [2% decrease in volume. However, we generated solid core pricing gains in the quarter to help offset some of those challenges].  Let's take a closer look at each of these business groups. Starting with bulk. Revenue for the quarter was down 3% compared to last year, driven by a 2% decrease in average revenue per car due to lower fuel surcharges and a 1% decline in volume. Grain and grain products volume was up 1% due to increased demand and business wins for renewable diesel feedstocks, coupled with strong shipments of domestic grain. A soft U.S. export grain market partially offset these gains.  Fertilizer carloads decreased by 9% in the quarter due to an outage at a customer facility that reduced export potash shipments. Food and refrigerated volume was down 8% due to reduced beer imports early in the quarter, but those shipments eventually improved by June. In addition, drought conditions from the prior growing season negatively impacted both fresh and can shipments.  And lastly, coal and renewables volume was flat year-over-year. Low natural gas prices and reduced electricity demand from mild weather negatively impacted shipments, but that was offset by a favorable comparison to 2022. With our service improvements and additional resources, we are currently meeting available demand.  Moving on to industrial. Industrial revenue was flat for the quarter driven by a 1% improvement in volume, offset by a 1% decline in average revenue per car. Core pricing gains in the quarter were offset by lower fuel surcharges and a negative mix in volume. Industrial chemicals and plastics volume was up 2% year-over-year, driven by increased plastic shipments, partially offset by lower industrial chemical shipments due to challenged industrial production levels and reduced housing demand.  Metals and minerals volumes continue to deliver year-over-year growth. Volume was up 2% compared to last year primarily driven by growth in construction materials and increased frac sand shipments along with new business development wins. Forest products volume declined 13% year-over-year driven by challenging market conditions in housing and repair and remodel, coupled with lower corrugated box demand. However, energy and specialized shipments were up 2% versus last year driven by strong business development and increased demand for LPG and petroleum products.  Turning to premium. Revenue for the quarter was down 11% on a 4% decrease in volume compared to last year. Average revenue per car decreased by 8%, reflecting lower fuel surcharge revenues. Automotive volumes were positively driven by continued strength in OEM production and inventory replenishment for finished vehicles and auto parts.  Domestic intermodal wins were offset by a weak freight and parcel market driven by higher inventory and the shift in consumer behavior as people spend more towards services than goods. International shipments were down due to decreased imports on the West Coast.  So turning to Slide 7. Here is our outlook for the rest of 2023 as we see it today. Starting with our bulk commodities. There is uncertainty in our second half coal outlook as the inventories have been restocked, but extreme heat is driving up near-term demand and starting to push up natural gas prices. We expect near-term grain shipment to be challenged with tighter U.S. grain supply impacting volumes. However, with improved operations and recent rain improving new crop supply forecast, we remain optimistic about our opportunity to move incremental grain carloads in the fourth quarter.  In addition, we expect our forecast for biofuel shipments of renewable diesel and their associated feedstocks to remain strong. We see solid market demand and continue to capture new business as production expands.  Moving on to industrial. The forecast for industrial production is down in the back half of 2023. Demand for forest products will also remain below 2022 levels. And despite some good business development wins on the metal side, it has been offset by a weaker-than-expected market. However, we expect to see continued strength in construction with new business wins.  And finally, for premium. We expect challenges in the intermodal market from continued inventory destocking, inflationary pressures and ongoing shift in consumer spending from goods to services. However, on the international side, we continue to outpace U.S. West Coast import market as customers shift more business to IPI. For automotive, we expect growth to continue driven by strong OEM production and high shippable ground count.  So to wrap up, it's hard to say when the economy will begin to recover in certain sectors, but our diverse portfolio allows us to see positive momentum in many of our commodities. The team remains focused on winning new business and has a strong pipeline of opportunities with a great track record for closing deals.  With that, I'll turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance. \nEric Gehringer : Thank you, Kenny, and good morning. Starting on Slide 9. As always, safety remains job #1 at Union Pacific, and we are committed to ensuring the safety of our employees, our customers and the communities that we serve. Freight rail is the safest way to transport goods over land, and Union Pacific is doing its part to be even safer through ongoing investments in our network, employees, technology and communities. That is evidenced by our safety performance, which continues to show improvement.  Through the first half of the year, our reportable derailment rate and personal injury rate both improved, a direct result of our enhanced training programs and strong safety culture of ownership and personal accountability.  Now let's review our key performance metrics for the quarter, starting on Slide 10. This quarter, through the team's hard work, we made improvements both year-over-year and sequentially across key metrics that drive the customer experience. Freight car velocity improved 8% to 202 miles per day compared to the second quarter 2022. This improved fluidity and resiliency was on display as we exceeded 200 daily car miles for 10 consecutive weeks during the quarter.  While the current business mix is a headwind, there remain opportunities for continued improvement. Trip plan compliance cites sizable 17 and 8-point year-over-year improvement in intermodal and manifest and auto TPC, respectively. Improved network fluidity as evidenced by faster freight car velocity, train velocity and lower terminal dwell drove those improvements.  Turning to Slide 11 to review our network efficiency metrics. With the demand picture weaker, the team is taking action to right-size resources to align with current volumes. For example, beginning in April, we took actions to remove locomotives from our active fleet, storing around 200 units through the quarter. While there is still room for progress, locomotive productivity improved 2% both sequentially and year-over-year even as our gross ton miles declined 1%.  Although greater crew availability is supporting solid service metrics, the impact of our hiring can be seen in our workforce productivity. To date, we have graduated approximately 1,200 TE&Y employees and have a strong pipeline of nearly 775 in training. These higher workforce levels, coupled with weaker volumes, resulted in a 5% decline in workforce productivity. However, with more crew resources, we were able to lower recrew rates and reduce our borrow-outs by roughly half during the quarter.  We continue to drive productivity with train length as evidenced by our sequential improvement of 2%. While down 1% year-over-year, this is good progress when you consider the headwinds soft intermodal was presented to our train length initiatives. There are many more opportunities ahead for improved efficiency of our railroad. From redeploying brake persons to improving fuel efficiency, growing train length and rightsizing our locomotive fleet, there is productivity to be captured.  Wrapping up on Slide 12. The well-being and quality of life for our employees remains a top priority, and we continuously collect feedback, collaborate and look for solutions with our workforce. The historic agreements listed on Slide 12 represent results of our work together. Let's talk through each one of them in detail.  Starting with paid sick leave. We now have ratified our tentative agreements with all 13 of our labor unions and this important quality-of-life initiative. The employee benefit is evident as they receive more paid time off to take care of themselves and their families. For the company, this definitely improves the attractiveness of our jobs but is additional labor expense that will need to be offset.  Next, our crew consent agreement with SMART-TD provides greater scheduling flexibility and the ability to redeploy break or switch persons to work either in or outside the yard. More specifically, for our employees, it provides an expedited path for brake persons to become conductors and ultimately engineers if they so desire.  For the company, it allows us to now reduce brake persons where the work does not require the third person, allowing us to partially offset short-term hiring demand. It also sets the stage to establish ground-based enhanced utility positions with fixed days off and greater certainty about their weekly assignments through scheduled shift work.  Finally, TE&Y work rest provides engineers and conductors with a more predictable work schedule, which enhances the quality of life for our employees and their families. Currently, we have a ratified agreement with our engineers that provides an 11 days on, 4 days off work schedule, and we are currently negotiating work rest with our conductors.  For the company, this enables the railroad to better manage staffing levels as we receive a more predictable, available workforce. That reduces labor and failure costs, which combined support more consistent and reliable service, enabling long-term growth. We also believe it will improve our retention rate, reducing hiring expenses and loss productivity.  Now these agreements come with a cost, which Jennifer will detail more later. As we implement them, we expect a larger training pipeline in the near term as well as elevated workforce levels in the future. When fully implemented, our current forecast is an additional 400 to 600 employees. Ultimately, the long-term benefit of these agreements is the positive impact on our employees and the service we provide for our customers. That enhanced service product will allow us to win in the marketplace.  So to close, I would like to express my appreciation to both our customers for their support and the marketing and sales team for their continuous work to capture available demand and win in the new -- win new business.  With that, I will turn it over to Jennifer to review our financial performance. \nJennifer Hamann : Thanks, Eric, and good morning. Let me start with a look at the walk-down of our second quarter operating ratio and earnings per share on Slide 14, where we've outlined the major drivers. In the June 13 8-K, we disclosed a onetime ratification payment related to our SMART-TD brake person agreement. That $67 million bonus increased our operating ratio 110 basis points and reduced our EPS $0.09.  Falling fuel prices during the quarter and the lag on our fuel surcharge recovery programs positively impacted our operating ratio 200 basis points and added $0.04 to EPS. While improved operations generally allowed us to meet demand during the quarter, that demand was softer and the combination of an elevated training pipeline, inflation and negative mix, all impacted our core results. Below the line, we net to a $0.07 EPS reduction from lower Nebraska State tax rates in 2023, as was noted in that same June 8-K, and a large 2022 real estate sale.  Looking now at our second quarter income statement on Slide 15. Operating revenue totaled $6 billion, down 5% versus last year on a 2% year-over-year volume decline. Included in that is a $34 million reduction in accessorials related to lower intermodal volume and faster equipment turns.  Operating expense of $3.8 billion was flat resulting in second quarter operating income of $2.2 billion, which is down 12% versus last year. Other income decreased $70 million driven by the 2022 real estate sale I mentioned earlier. Interest expense increased 7%, reflecting higher debt levels. Net income of $1.6 billion declined 14% versus 2022, which when combined with share repurchases, resulted in a 12% decrease in earnings per share to $2.57.  Now looking more closely at our second quarter revenue. Slide 16 provides a breakdown of our freight revenue, which totaled $5.6 billion, down 5% versus 2022. Lower year-over-year volume reduced revenue 175 basis points. Total fuel surcharge revenue of $707 million was $269 million less versus last year. The impact of falling fuel prices as well as the lag in our surcharge programs reduced freight revenues 425 basis points.  The combination of price and mix in the quarter increased freight revenue 150 basis points. This gain reflects the strong pricing we secured while also recognizing some headwinds from certain coal and intermodal contracts where the pricing is more reflective of current market conditions. Mix in the quarter remained negative as fewer lumber shipments and more short-haul rock shipments outweighed the positive impact of lower intermodal.  Turning now to Slide 17 and a look at second quarter operating expenses, which totaled $3.8 billion. Compensation and benefits expense increased $177 million versus 2022 with nearly 40% of that amount reflecting the brake person agreement. Second quarter workforce levels increased to 4%. Although total transportation employees were up 7%, the active TE&Y workforce is only up 1%, which is a result of our robust hiring and elevated training pipeline.  Excluding the impact of the onetime bonus payment, cost per employee increased 5% in the second quarter, and we expect it to be up 3% to 4% for the full year. Both second quarter and full year cost per employee reflect the impact of that larger training pipeline as well as better crew efficiency, which are partially offsetting wage inflation. I'll provide more details on the impact of our new agreements here in just a bit.  Fuel expense in the quarter increased 29% on a 29% decrease in fuel prices. Purchased services and materials expense increased 5% driven by inflation, partially offset by decreased subsidiary drayage expense and more moderate locomotive repair expenses as we stored locomotives in the quarter. Equipment and other rents was up 8%, reflecting higher lease expense for new freight cars secured to support business volumes and lower equity income, slightly offset by lower car hire as we improve cycle times and move less volume. Other expense grew 6%, primarily related to increased environmental remediation accruals as well as persistently elevated casualty costs.  Turning to Slide 18 and our cash flows. Cash from operations in the first half of 2023 decreased to $3.9 billion from $4.2 billion in 2022. The primary driver was $445 million of payments related to labor union agreement. These payments also impacted free cash flow and our cash flow conversion rate.  Year-to-date, we returned $2.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And we finished the second quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 200 -- excuse me, to 2022 levels at 2.9x as we continue to be A-rated by our three credit agencies.  Wrapping up on Slide 19. As you've heard from the team, we're pleased that the service product is enabling us to meet available demand. Unfortunately, as you heard from Kenny, consumer-facing markets like intermodal and lumber remains soft. Additionally, the outlook for coal has weakened since the start of the year but with some near-term opportunities given the extreme heat.  Although we still expect to outpace industrial production in certain markets, weak demand for consumer goods has pushed our full year volume outlook below current industrial production estimates, which are slightly positive. Unchanged is our expectation to generate pricing dollars in excess of inflation dollars. To date, we've made great progress repricing our business to reflect the impact of higher inflation, and that momentum will continue.  As it relates to fuel prices, I should point out that the tailwind we've experienced these past 24 months is now expected to shift to a headwind both on the operating ratio and EPS front. Assuming fuel prices remain relatively stable, this will likely represent a negative second half impact of around $0.50 per share.  Eric provided some great context on our labor agreements. And although they clearly come with some upfront cost, we see opportunities as well. Starting with the sick leave agreements. Our current forecast is that they will add roughly $50 million to labor expense in the second half of 2023, which is reflected in the cost per crew numbers I quoted earlier. We view these costs as added inflationary pressures that we will reflect in our pricing.  For the brake person agreement, we've already seen the impact of that upfront payment. Our expected payback period is roughly two years as it allows us to redeploy crew personnel, save on costly borrow-out positions as well as reduce our current hiring needs. Implementation of the BLET work rest agreement will start over the next month or so with completion likely in 2024. For this year, we estimate the work rest implementation will cost upwards of $20 million.  The challenge in putting a finer point on that estimate is both timing and forecasting employee behavior. We don't yet have an agreement with SMART-TD, and we are still working through some technology and logistics before we start the rollout. And while we certainly expect better availability, better service and more flexibility with our crew boards, providing more access to time off likely adds employees and expense. The exact math depends on how employees utilize this greater flexibility as well as how we translate better predictability into increased levels of productivity and service that ultimately drive profitable growth on our railroad.  Looking at our 2023 capital allocation. Our capital plan remains $3.6 billion. We also plan to maintain our current dividend of $1.30 per quarter as reflected in our dividend announcement this morning. However, we have paused share repurchases and don't expect to be back in the market for the remainder of 2023.  While there's no change to our long-term capital allocation strategy, which is first dollar into the business, industry-leading dividend payment and excess cash to shares, we recognize our cash flows are impacted in the current environment with volumes and costs.  Wrapping up, we are well positioned to operate a better railroad in the second half of 2023 and for the long term, our strong fundamentals are unchanged and will allow us to generate significant value for our owners as team UP drives service, growth and improved profitability.  So with that, I'll turn it back to Lance. \nLance Fritz : Thank you, Jennifer. As you've heard from the team, the first half of this year has been about laying a foundation for future success. Key to that foundation is safety and the quality of life of our employees, and I'm pleased with the progress we've been making on both those fronts.  As you heard from Eric, we continue to make the railroad safer, while improvements in our safety metrics are critical. More encouraging are the positive strides we're making in our safety culture. The team has great momentum across our safety programs, which gives me great pride as I step away.  I'm also encouraged by the progress we've made to address quality-of-life issues with our craft professionals, reaching historic labor agreements around paid sick leave, crew redeployment and scheduled work. These agreements drive employee engagement and productivity to produce a better service product for our customers.  As I wrap up time as CEO of Union Pacific, I'd like to express my deep appreciation to the Board and shareholders of UP for giving me the privilege of leading the company for the past eight years. I'm proud of how the team has positioned Union Pacific to thrive for the years ahead, and I'm pleased to say that we provided great value all along the way.  Union Pacific is truly a special place. It's full of hard-working, dedicated railroaders who embrace the daily task of Building America. It's been my greatest honor to lead this team. Their commitment to be the best for our communities, our customers, our investors and for each other is remarkable. 160-plus years of success began and continues with our exceptional employees. I can't wait to see what they accomplish next. \nJennifer Hamann : Thank you, Lance. And on behalf of the employees of Union Pacific, let me offer our gratitude and appreciation for your leadership. We wish nothing but the best for you and your family as you embark on the next chapter.  Before we begin Q&A, I'd like to lay out a couple of guidelines for the call. In the interest of time and to accommodate everyone, please limit yourself to one question and one question only. Second, we understand that there's great interest in the leadership changes that were announced this morning, and we look forward to those discussions. However, today's call is to discuss our quarterly results. So please focus your questions on the business of the earnings call.  So with that, Rob, we are ready for your first question. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. \nAllison Poliniak: Just want to talk through intermodal. I know there's obviously consumer weakness there. But is that -- I guess, the pace of the decline moderating for you some? And I guess, with sort of the improved service that you're starting to see in that interest back on the West Coast port, should we start to see or expect to see some of those business wins start to accelerate for you? Just any color just thinking that maybe intermodal starts to perform better for you in the face of even the consumer declines? \nKenny Rocker: Allison, you look at it, I'll let you know, we're really staring down at consumer spending. And it's been flat last few months, maybe several months. But it's differentiated as you look at goods versus services, we're clearly seeing, and I talked about it in my opening remarks, less on the goods and more on the services.  The other thing that we're looking is just what's happening with demand, and we're looking at that in terms of some of the contract rates would better flatten out in the spot rates that have inched up a little bit. The fact that we have a really strong intermodal service product is a benefit for us. We're encouraged as a company, I'm encouraged as the commercial leader that even though the imports have been down 23% year-to-date, we're only down a couple of percentage points.  And talking to our customers, we also believe that they will be shifting a little bit more back to the West Coast port. That's going to be a gradual shift. That will be a little bit more throughout 2023 and probably into 2024. But clearly, we're positioned here for the upside. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. \nJon Chappell : I'm not sure this is for Jennifer or Kenny. But Jennifer, you mentioned in your comments you're making great progress in repricing business to some of these inflationary headwinds that you're facing. Can you give us an idea as to, one, kind of where you stand in repricing the book of business to a lot of these new labor deals? And kind of just in a softer macro backdrop, how these conversations are going and your confidence in your ability to fully offset the cost? \nJennifer Hamann : Yes, Jon, thanks for that question. I'll start and then pitch it to Kenny. So just as a reminder, when you think about our book of business, call it, 25% or so is spot rates. You've got another, call it, 30%, 35% or so that is one year or less in duration types of contracts or arrangement, and the rest then are multiyear deals. So there is a cadence to which we're able to touch actively all of our business.  Kenny, do you want to maybe talk about the market? \nKenny Rocker: Yes. Jon, the commercial team has done an excellent job articulating the need for some of the inflationary pressures even if you want to call it the labor priors that are there and really inserting our service product along with those discussions.  Now candidly, in a very pragmatic way, our customers empathize with that. They are taking the same price increases in their markets. So they understand what we need to accomplish. There's a tremendous amount of resources that were committed to on the CapEx side, which will help out with a consistent and reliable service. So we feel very good. There's full confidence and price and above inflation in making sure we cover those costs. \nOperator: Our next question is from Chris Wetherbee with Citi. \nChris Wetherbee : Congrats, Lance on the next stage of your career here. I guess wanted to take a minute and talk a little bit about sort of resources and where you think you are. I know, Eric, you talked about pulling some cost levers that were around locomotives and other assets. But Jennifer, what should we expect with head count as we move forward? And sort of when are you appropriately staffed for what you think the volume outlook might be, not just for this quarter but maybe the next several quarters? \nJennifer Hamann : Yes. So I'll maybe let Eric talk about how he feels about crew staffing levels. But just overall, in terms of our head count, we think as you look to the back half of the year, it's probably going to be, I'll call it, flattish or so from where we're at right now. We're continuing to hire and train and make sure that we've got a good robust pipeline so that we're able to serve our customers appropriately. But just from an absolute FTE basis, that's kind of how we see things in the back half. \nEric Gehringer : Yes. And just picking up from there, Chris. Clearly, what you've seen in our performance is that we have reduced the amount of hiring that we've been doing now. We stay very connected with Kenny as in his outlook, both for the fourth quarter as well as 2024, and we're going to continue to adjust as we have to what that demand is.  It's the same way I view the locomotive work that was accomplished during the quarter. And the team stored 200 locomotives. And if you actually look for now and this month, we're actually above 200. We're treating it the exact same way. So the demand that's out there, find your resource base accordingly. \nLance Fritz : We should be crystal clear as well, Jennifer and Eric, Chris, that there's still work to be done. When we look into the third and fourth quarter, Eric outlined some of it in his prepared comments, but we are not yet volume-variable with what we're seeing in the marketplace. We took a step towards that in the second quarter. We got to keep taking steps in the third and fourth. \nOperator: The next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. \nJustin Long : Lance, congrats from my end as well. I wanted to ask a question about the outlook for the second half. You mentioned fuel being a headwind and in addition to that, the labor cost. Do you think EPS in the second half will be lower than the first half? And then maybe, Jennifer, you could comment on the run rate for these labor-related costs as we move into 2024. I'm just curious if we can take this $50 million to $70 million and annualize it or if that is expected to change? \nLance Fritz : Jennifer, why don't I start? We're not going to provide some incremental or new guidance as regards earnings into the back half. But Jennifer, you did a good job of outlining what the headwinds are, and why don't we unpack that a little bit? \nJennifer Hamann : Yes. I mean, certainly, the one headwind we did size for you is the $0.50 impact, the negative year-over-year impact we expect to see on EPS from fuel in the third and fourth quarters. In terms of moving into 2024, so if you think about that $50 million from the sick leave agreements that I mentioned, most of those agreements were really effective in the second half. We had our non-ops that started a little bit in the first half. So I think you can think about that as being something that will carry over and repeat itself in the first half of 2024.  Beyond that, in terms of the implementation of work rest, we're really reluctant to -- and really, it would be difficult for us to size that more precisely because it is going to depend on the timing of how we roll that out as well as the employee behavior that we see with that. And so that's something that we'll just keep you updated, but I want to make sure you do understand that, that will be a bit of a headwind. But as we get greater clarity of that as we go through our rollout and start that rollout and obviously, we still need to get SMART-TD done as well, we'll be in conversation about that. \nLance Fritz : So Justin, I think as we look into the back half of this year, improving productivity, the hiring pipeline tones down a little bit, but we're still hiring. It probably looks like year-over-year about equal, I think, is what Jennifer was saying.  Not sure what's going on in the marketplace. So we got to we've got to do everything we can to capture all the business that's available to us. And then fuel is going to be a real headwind in the back half.  Offsetting that, we get a tailwind from implementing the brake person agreement. And as we implement the work rest schedule, I am confident that generates both productivity and service product improvement. The issue is timing and magnitude. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. \nBrandon Oglenski : Lance, congrats on career here. And I guess, I know you guys want to ask about the quarter, but just looking back, Lance, over your course of being at Union Pacific, what do you think went really right? And what do you think maybe could have been done better to keep track maybe with potentially more volume growth looking back?  And maybe looking forward, what do you think are the biggest challenges or opportunities for the industry, maybe not even just UNP? The technology, is it regulation, is it M&A? Would love to get your thoughts. \nLance Fritz : Yes, Brandon, thank you for that question. And we'll try to keep this to be the only question on that. So I'll try to make the answer fulsome. In terms of what am I proud of, what did I think we got right as a team, one is I love the team that we've assembled. It's world-class. I love the work that we've done on sustainability. I love the fact that we are an inclusive workforce. You can see it in our Board. You can see it on our management team.  I like the progress that we've made on safety. We've got more to do there. And I love the fact that we transitioned from our previous transportation model and way of running the railroad to a PSR model that's a better service product for our customers.  In terms of what we needed to do better, we were not consistent and reliable through my 8.5 years of serving as the Chairman, President and COO. And that needs to be remedied. As we look into the future, that's exactly what we need to continue to do. We've got a strategy, serve, grow, win together, that's built off the foundation of consistent and reliable service.  I am confident we're oriented, organized and capable of doing that. We've got to prove it to our customers. Because Brandon, our customers tell us, as we demonstrate reliability, there's more of their order book available to us, plus there's more market participants that will start doing business with us. That's the unlock for growth. And growth is the unlock for significant value creation in the future for everybody, for all of our stakeholders. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Ravi Shankar with Morgan Stanley. \nRavi Shanker : Again, from me as well, congrats, Lance, on a great career. Just on the volume guide itself, can you confirm just how much that kind of volume outlook did move? Because you did -- you're now going to be kind of below a raised benchmark. So just trying to get a sense of kind of how much that did move.  And also, is industrial production the right benchmark for your kind of volume growth in the long term just given the consumer exposure here? Or do we have to look at some combination of IP plus GDP? \nLance Fritz : Jennifer, do you want to start that? \nJennifer Hamann : Yes, I can start it. So you raised a good point, Ravi. I mean we do think looking backwards certainly that industrial production has been a better gauge. But you're right, we have great franchise diversity, which we've talked to and Kenny mentioned too. And with the growing intermodal portfolio, there are certainly components of that. But it's really driven by consumer spending, and a lot of that consumer spend on industrial production. So it's hard to really separate from that.  But in terms of what's changed from where we started the year, certainly, coal is something that with natural gas prices falling as it did late January, early February, that certainly took a big chunk of that demand away from us. Now you've heard us talk about the heat and you're seeing that, you're seeing maybe a little bit of inflection in natural gas prices. So we're watching that.  The other piece, though, is on that consumer side. Onboarding a new intermodal customer coming into the year, we expected that to be a big tailwind to our volumes. And just the way that, that consumer spending and consumer goods purchases has dropped, that's just had a really outsized impact. \nKenny Rocker: All I'll say is that we're looking at consumer spending by the week. And I feel very encouraged that we have onboarded over the last couple of years a couple of transformative customers on to our domestic intermodal network. And so as we see that movement move up, we're in a great position. And so that's encouraging for us as a company. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. \nBrian Ossenbeck : First, just wanted to follow up on price to the labor inflation. Do you think getting rate is enough to offset those costs? Do you need to get some productivity benefits from the work rest, the brake men and then possibly, even the utility rule? And then just for Kenny, can you just comment more about price/mix? You mentioned specifically the coal and intermodal pricing were resetting lower in the quarter. Does that continue throughout the rest of the year? You can give some parameters in terms of how to think about that plus mix in the back half. \nLance Fritz : Kenny, why don't I start with the -- what about the agreements and getting price and productivity out of them. The short answer, Brian, is we are confident that we can continue to price above inflation. We've just seen a few agreements like paid sick leave add to the inflation in our comp and benefits. And Kenny's team is tasked now to get out there and make sure that we recoup that.  In terms of productivity, the brake person agreement is just a clear path on productivity. We can reduce 3 people to 2 people on crews where we don't need 3 people, and we can either redeploy them or lower our hiring demands. So that clearly, just in that one example -- there are other examples like in work rest, Brian, we'll be able to get productivity out of that.  Today, there's a percentage of our workforce when they're called to take a train, they are not available to us. And we don't know that before we call them. And that creates failure cost and disruption in the network. I'm going to presume, and I think the experience where work rest schedules are in place, that unpredictability dropped dramatically. When that happens, we get better the utilization of our assets and we lower failure costs from the network. So the only question for us is order of magnitude and when as we implement. \nKenny Rocker: So yes, a couple of things here. Let's just take hold for first up. Yes. And you've heard us talk about this. We do have a couple of mechanisms that are in place that allow us and our customers to be competitive with natural gas prices. One of the things that we have seen out there is the fact that there has been a little slight uptick in terms of demand based on the extreme heat that we've seen. We've seen that also impact again in the near term natural gas prices out there. So we're seeing more demand out there.  We're working closely with Eric and his team as we speak to add more sets and add more inventory into the network. And we're looking at the 4 curves that you just see, how long that will last. So we're always looking at that, and we're looking at that by the week.  Switching to domestic intermodal on the pricing side. we like the fact that we have our customers that are competitive in the marketplace and that we're competitive against truck. Some of those mechanisms will go up, I think, tightened in a Loup market like where we are now, it might move down a little bit. But the key is to make sure that we can capture the volume against truck and make sure that we're competitive. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Fadi Chamoun with BMO Capital. \nFadi Chamoun : Congratulations, Lance. Question on the opportunity for volume. Like if you think about a zero GDP environment over the next, say, 12 months, what can service improvement deliver in terms of growth? Where are maybe some of the verticals you think that you can make a difference in the service level and ultimately start to see more idiosyncratic opportunities to grow the business? \nKenny Rocker: Yes, Fadi, thanks for the question. Let's just walk through -- if you look at our outlook slide, and I'll supplement that with a few more specifics on our biodiesel, the renewable diesel market, we've got seven different facilities on us. We're going to land another facility here by the end of the year. We're very encouraged by that. That's a key part of our growth strategy. And we mentioned that a couple of years ago, during Investor Day, very proud of our commercial team for securing that.  Construction, our rock business, for example, those are areas where Eric's team is just delivering great service, and it's showing up in terms of carloads. We're adding a few more sets there. We're seeing more carloads that are coming on because of that, and some of that is market-related. There's just more infrastructure that's out there.  If you talk about the service product, we look at auto parts coming out of Mexico. We've seen a pretty fast and upcoming grower -- growing EV producer that we're growing with on the auto parts side that we're excited about. We've secured a new automotive OEM on our line back in the spring that has brought business to us. That same OEM will be bringing on business in the first quarter. So we're pretty excited there.  And then kind of last but not least, I'll just say that overall, the team has been engaged on bringing new business in different ways. We have a new industrial park that's going to be landing on us in the Buckeye, Arizona area. So that's great. And we've got a customer that will be doing reusable plastics, so just you think about the ESG connection. So we can create our own business development with the service that I mentioned with Eric, and we're excited about it. \nLance Fritz : And it's proven, Kenny, your BD pipeline is up, what? \nKenny Rocker: It's up around 20% to 25%. So the team is just doing a fabulous job going out there and expanding the market better. \nLance Fritz : And that's in a down volume market. \nKenny Rocker: That's in a down market. And so I will say we're pumped up about it. \nLance Fritz : That's good. \nFadi Chamoun : And I'm surprised you didn't mention intermodal as being one of the opportunities that service gets better. Is this because the truck market competitiveness right now? You need a little bit of support there? Or is there more to it than that? \nKenny Rocker: Okay. Well, you're going to get me riled up today. So first of all, we talked about a couple of transformative wins that we feel good about. I'll tell you, as a management team, bringing on Inland Empire, which is a new product, bringing on a new Port Houston service product that Eric has given us with 5 new lanes, bringing on Twin Cities. Absolutely, we feel good about domestic intermodal. At some point, you need demand to be there. What you're hearing me say is that we're prepared as that demand comes on. And we're adding new products, we're adding new services, we're adding new customers. We're excited. \nLance Fritz : Kenny, at the risk of making this drag on too long, you should mention Falcon Premium too. \nKenny Rocker: So let me back up and just say there's been a lot of debate out there, Lance, in the marketplace. And we feel very good about the service products that we have with Falcon Premium. On a broader sense, there are other Class 1s associated with that. So it's not just one Class 1. It's the other Class 1s that we're interacting with too that we feel good about.  We've got a shorter route structure. We've got a better schedule. We've got the relationship with the customers. Eric and his team are continuously improving that service product. So we're encouraged how that looks in the future. \nOperator: The next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. \nAmit Mehrotra : Lance, congrats all your success. Wish you the best. I guess, Eric and Jennifer, I know borrow-outs have been pretty expensive. And I think last time we checked, you had like 250 borrow-outs in the network. Can you just give us an update on that? It feels like maybe that's an opportunity over the next six to nine months.  And just generally, in terms of nonfuel costs, it feels like the network is running a little bit heavy on nonfuel costs. I know there's obviously cost inflation and labor inflation, some idiosyncratic things. But as maybe the volume comes back and you can come much more volume-variable, is there an opportunity to kind of hold the line on the nonfuel cost structure given some of the positive things that you can do on the borrow-outs and kind of other cost items that are proving more stubborn right now? \nEric Gehringer : Yes. Thank you for the question. Let's back up in time, as we came into the year when we think about our first quarter earnings report, we were talking about borrow-outs. In the context of while we were making great progress in our hiring, we still have pockets of the system, specifically about 7 locations, where we were utilizing borrow-outs because of the difficulty to hire.  Now in any given year, there's some level of borrow-outs used even in just dealing with seasonality, for example, the grain harvest that comes in the fall. If you look at the quarter, what we've reported is that we've taken our borrow-out count down by 50%, approximately. Now that is a process that continues. As we look for volume to continue to grow, we have those as options. But as we're looking every week, to your point, to control our cost, those are ones that we adjust literally on a weekly basis.  There may be a place as we fast-forward three months, four months, six months, where you may use them and very small numbers. But our goal is to reduce our borrow-outs as quickly as we possibly can.  As far as the nonfuel cost, it follows the same recipe that we've shared before, One, we just finished talking about it, which is how we think about our labor costs and ensuring that we're being conscious of that. Two, you go to your next expensive cost or, at least outside of fuel, is you're going to look at your locomotive fleet. The reduction that we've made in the quarter is a strong move in the right direction. The reduction we've been made in July is another strong move on top of that, and we look forward to reporting to that in future quarters. So all eyes on we want to grow the business, and we need to be volume-variable until we see more of that growth coming. \nJennifer Hamann : Yes. And Amit, just to build on what Eric is saying there is, if you look across all of our cost categories, setting depreciation side, we know we have opportunities within all of those to be more efficient. As we continue to improve cycle times, that has a very direct flow-through in terms of our car hire expenses on the purchased services and materials side.  Eric mentioned the locomotives, but there's other opportunities we have in there to work on our cost. And even comp and benefits with some of the headwinds that we know we have, there's opportunities to be more productive and use that crew base more efficiently.  And to your point, volume can certainly be a friend when it comes to the cost structure. But I think the fact that you've seen us make some progress as volumes are going down, and you saw us build train length even as volumes came down and in particular, intermodal volume, those are the things that we're going to keep working on here -- well, always, but certainly in the back half of the year to continue to drive better efficiency and get better alignment between the resources and the cost structure and the volumes that we're moving. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. \nBascome Majors : Lance, as you wrap up your eight years as UP's Chairman, President, and CEO, how do you expect the push and pull of the senior decision-making process between marketing operations and HR change with those roles split between 3 people and Beth elevated from just leaving the HR and sustainability efforts into that newly stand-alone President position? \nLance Fritz : Yes, Bascome, thanks for the question. First, you got to note, Jim Vena is our CEO. He runs the company, that reports to Jim. So I don't anticipate any meaningful dislocations or push-pull created by org structure. And having said that, there's some natural creative tension in the business all the time. There's creative tension between the operating team and the commercial team. There can be creative tension between the team that is controlling versus the team that's spending.  Just -- you can name any number. The most important thing is we've got a fabulous operating executive joining us as our CEO. He's got a great track record, and he's going to be laser-focused on making sure that we're providing the best service product to our customers so that we can translate it into growth. He's going to do a very good job of making sure the team works together.  We're working well together today. I anticipate we'll be working well together a month from now. And Beth's role is going to be making sure that she's supporting all of that effort effectively through workforce resources through the work we do with communities, through the work we do in DC. So I anticipate better, not worse, as we move forward. \nOperator: The next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. \nKen Hoexter : Congrats on its team and the Board on the next steps and on naming Jim as CEO. So many moving parts with the labor agreements. Obviously, Jen ran through some of the cost side from the pay increase last year to what you're now adding on after the main contracts. Maybe -- can you take a minute, walk us through some of the benefits that you see?  And I presume these are all Union Pacific add-ons. Maybe differentiate what is UP add-on versus the industry. And then just thoughts on your outlook. I think you removed the operating ratio from your target. Is there a thought on the scale that you want to put together on costs? Or are we just leaving that off all together? \nJennifer Hamann : Yes. So I'll start off, Ken. So when we did our 8-K in June, we took the operating ratio improvement off the table for the year, and that hasn't changed. Certainly, you heard us talk about some of the headwinds that we have. So we are not -- with the addition of the labor expenses, volumes moving away from us and then obviously, some fuel headwinds relative to OR in the back half of the year, we don't expect year-over-year improvement.  Our task, and I kind of touched on this a little bit with the question from Amit, is to get better from where we sit today. And I'm not going to forecast what our OR is going to be in the back half of the year, but we're going to work really hard to improve each and every day. And that's both in terms of being more productive with that cost structure as well as going out and selling in the marketplace and doing all we can to drive profitability on that side.  I don't know, Eric, you want to... \nEric Gehringer : Yes. And on the agreement side, so if we start with sick days, the opportunity that Lance mentioned obviously reinforce as we see the opportunity to improve the attractiveness of our jobs. And as a result of that, that can have a positive impact on how we do our hiring.  If you go to the brake person deal, clearly, the biggest opportunity there is to reduce brake person labor in line with where the jobs are no longer needed and also allows us to partially offset some of our hiring in the short term. And of course, we get the benefit of establishing a ground-based enhanced utility position.  And as Jennifer pointed out, the payback period on that is approximately two years. And if you look right now, we're about 60% of the way through that implementation. And then certainly on the 11 and 4 scheduled work, it really boils down to improved availability, as Lance pointed out, and more efficiently managing our staff levels with more latitude on how we do that under this new agreement. \nOperator: The next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. \nScott Group : Best of luck to you, Lance. Jennifer, Just wanted to just make sure I understood the answer to that last question. Are you -- so relative to like the 62% adjusted OR in Q2, are you not -- you're just not giving any color? Or are you saying it's probably going to get worse, the OR second half versus at 62%? I'm just not sure what you're trying to message there.  And then just Kenny, CN last night was just -- talked about raising their expectations for the U.S. grain -- upcoming U.S. grain harvest just with some better rain recently. Just your thoughts on how you think about the grain harvest in your territory going forward? \nJennifer Hamann : Yes. So going back to -- you're really asking a sequential question. And again, I -- we had a 63% reported OR. If you're stripping out the brake person agreement, that was 1.1 points in the quarter. If you look at what we have done historically as a company, you tend to see some of your better margins in the third quarter, tends to go up a little bit then in the fourth quarter when you're just thinking about kind of that normal seasonality.  We are going to work to make sequential improvement. I'm not telling you that we're making sequential improvement, but that is the task that has to be ahead of us. We have to work to improve the cost structure. And we've already made some progress. I think you certainly saw that. I know it's a little bit of a messy quarter with all that was going on in it. But when you strip some of the noise out, there was -- particularly when you're comparing first quarter to second quarter, we did make gains, not year-over-year but sequentially, we did make some gains there. So I think that's the way to think about it into the back half of this year. \nKenny Rocker: So Scott, I'd tell you, we look at the weekly crop report and, call it five, maybe six weeks ago, wasn't looking great. And since then, we've had rain in areas that we serve and participate in. So it's looking much better.  You heard in my comments that we think there is an opportunity for incremental grain in the fourth quarter. And so we're steering that down and working with Eric's team to make sure we can capture it. \nOperator: The next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC. \nWalter Spracklin : Best of luck there, Lance, on the future. Just a question here -- wrap up here on coal. I know you'd indicated that, that was an area of discrepancy from where you were looking at before. Really on the -- or the revenue per carload revenue per RTM, that's taken a notable step-down. And I know your peers talked a lot about -- you talked about a 15% decline in their rates on coal. Now a lot of that is tied to export met, which is not in your mix, but you did see a similar type of step-down in sense per RTM. Just wondering if that's something that you expect to continue for the foreseeable future. What's driving it? What could make it change up or down from this point going forward? \nJennifer Hamann : Yes. So Walter, we did mention that in my prepared remarks that, that was a bit of a headwind. And you've heard us talk before that we do have a portion of our coal contracts that have some mechanisms that link that pricing to natural gas pricing. And with what's happened with natural gas pricing, that certainly is flowing through in terms of some of the rates. We did that similar to intermodal in terms of keeping competitiveness for those players that are dispatching into the grid, keeping them competitive. And we're continuing to ship coal. Still profitable for us, but there is some pricing differentials there.  So it really depends on how you see the rest of the year playing out in terms of how that's going to look. But if you just compare last year's nat gas prices to where we're at this year, that tells you there's going to be some ongoing pressure there. \nLance Fritz : Yes. I think the differentiation there is sequential versus year-over-year, and year-over-year is going to continue to see some pressure. Sequential, we've seen as much pressure as we're going to see. \nWalter Spracklin : So kind of flat from this point going forward? \nJennifer Hamann : It should be. I mean, obviously, watch natural gas prices. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with TD Cowen. \nJason Seidl : First off, Lance, good luck in the future, and congrats to both Jim and Beth, if they're listening in. Some quick things. I wanted to look a little bit about regulation. We've seen the FRA now is looking for a public comment period on train weights and lengths. Wanted to know if you guys think this is sort of a precursor for more regulation from them.  And two, maybe if you could talk a little bit about anything anticipated on reciprocal switching. And lastly, squeezing in here, Jennifer, when was the last time you guys didn't repurchase shares in the quarter? \nLance Fritz : Jennifer, you want to go first, then I'll take the others? \nJennifer Hamann : Yes. So I would go back to second and third quarter of 2020 when the pandemic hit and there was such a drop in volumes. We paused our share repurchases then for at least a couple -- I'm pretty sure for the full second quarter, part of the third quarter, I think, is when we restarted that. So we manage the share repurchase piece with our excess cash. And that's always been the flexible part of our shareholder return, and that's how we're managing it today. \nLance Fritz : Yes. And Jennifer, we've been crystal clear that we turbocharged our excess cash by using the capacity of our balance sheet. And that capacity now has been largely used, and it's all about growing cash from operations and operating income at this point. \nJennifer Hamann : Exactly, Lance. And obviously, with some of the earnings pressures we're facing this year, that's not giving us that incremental capacity we've seen. \nLance Fritz : So Jason, talking about what's going on in Congress and at the STB in Congress, the Rail Safety Act, we've been crystal clear about things in there that we think are appropriate. Like there should be additional regulation and laws regarding the preparedness of emergency responders, the information that's at their disposal. We believe the same is true on tank car standards. There's an opportunity to pull forward tank car standard improvements.  And we also think there's room for regulation to step into wayside detection. We've done a ton of things in wayside detection voluntarily. It is not regulated. And if it were to be regulated appropriately, that makes some sense.  There's some things in the Rail Safety Act that don't make sense like coupling train size with safety. On our railroad, mainline and siding derailments are down 25% plus, while train size is up 20% over the last, call it, four years. There's just no correlation in our experience between safety and train size.  And likewise, there's no correlation anywhere in the world between train crew size and safety. That should be left to collective bargaining and what technology enables. So as we look at Congress, that's what we're thinking about. As we look at the STB, as we've said before, we help them understand how the railroad industry works, how our reinvestment works. And when it comes to reciprocal switch or forced open access, we help them understand that, that would have a real negative impact on investment. It would not improve service product, and they should be very, very careful as they think about whether or not that should be implemented and how to implement it. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. \nTom Wadewitz : Lance, wanted to wish you well in the next thing you do, retirement, whatever it is. Let's see. I guess one just clarification. I think, Kenny, you commented earlier on intermodal yields are -- 3Q, are we expecting more sequential pressure on revenue per car in intermodal in 3Q? So that -- just a clarification.  And then the broader question really -- when we look at the industry, I think historically, there was opportunity from productivity and price to improve margins. Certainly, UP did that in a massive way over, I don't know, 15 years, right? But it just seems like there's this inflation in the cost base and pricing's good, but not enough. So do you think it's fair to look forward and say, look, margin improvement is really about volume and without volume, you're -- maybe you have a tough time to improve the margin? And I think that seemed to be true maybe for industry, not just for UP, but I don't know if you have thoughts on that. And then maybe the clarification on intermodal. \nLance Fritz : Yes, Tom, let me start with your essential question about the three legs of the stool. We've forever talked about, we drive margin improvement through productivity, price and the benefit of volume. And to your point, we've leaned heavily on productivity and price historically. And we said we're in a transition where we're going to have to lean more heavily on volume.  But that's not going to be the only leg of that three-legged stool, Tom, when you -- it's still true. While inflation got on us quick, the way our contracts and our business relationships are set, it takes us a while to recoup that inflation through price. Kenny's team has been crystal clear that they own the requirement to do that, and they're following through. But it's going to take a little while.  And on productivity, like we just demonstrated this quarter, we created a new agreement, makes all the sense in the world. It came with a 70 -- roughly $70 million price tag immediately. Implementing it is going to get the payback and will be paid back in about two years. So Tom, the opportunity for productivity, price and volume to still drive margin improvement exists. We're in kind of a unique environment right now regarding timing. And we are, for sure, going to have to rely on volume more heavily going forward. \nKenny Rocker: Yes. Just a short answer. No, we're not expecting increased pricing pressures on that intermodal side of the house. \nTom Wadewitz : Okay. So you think stable revenue per car 3Q versus 2? \nKenny Rocker: That's how you should be thinking about it. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Ben Nolan with Stifel. \nBen Nolan : So Kenny, you mentioned the Falcon Express a little bit ago. I'm curious if you have any early takes. Any -- how are things thus far developing the way that they thought you would or you thought they would? Or any early indications that -- of how you're expecting it to play out over the back half of the year? \nKenny Rocker: I think you're asking, have we seen any success stories? And yes, we've had some early wins. Of course, the focus is over the road. I mean that's the size of the prize. Rail is a very small part of that traffic that's moving out of Mexico or into Mexico. As I also said, as we continue to improve the speed and consistency there, we expect to make more inroads. \nBen Nolan : Okay. And so far, as expected? \nKenny Rocker: Yes. I mean we're getting more reception from customers that are open to opening their books and giving us a shot, for sure. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. \nDavid Vernon : Lance, congratulations and good luck. So Eric, with the 400 to 600 heads that we need to add in for the part time off or paid time-off agreements, how many of those people are going to be on property by the end of this year? And then how should we think about reconciling that with the -- a flat head count number from 2Q? Are we making reductions in operations? Or is it coming out of other areas? \nJennifer Hamann : Yes. So I'll actually jump in on that one. So it is -- when you think about the 400 to 600 incremental that we talked about from the labor agreements, that's incremental from what we would have otherwise been staffing at a given volume level. So that is completely consistent with and taken into account with when we also say, as we look at head count levels now to the end of the year, we think not a whole lot of change. So... \nLance Fritz : So Jennifer, it's for all agreements? \nJennifer Hamann : And it's for all agreements, which, again, we're going to be implementing over not just the back half of this year but well into 2024. \nEric Gehringer : I think we also pointed out in our commentary that, that number is going to be highly impacted by the behavior that comes from these agreements. And we're not ready today to say exactly what that will look like. We'll continue to look to it, though. \nJennifer Hamann : Absolutely. \nLance Fritz : But he had the back half of his question there, which was about offsets and... \nEric Gehringer : Yes. The offsets really haven't changed from the ones that I answered a few moments ago. They really focused on the availability on the 11 and 4 and they focus on the brake person about actually removing brake persons off of positions that are no longer needed. \nDavid Vernon : So if you were to say like how much of the 400 to 600 is in this year versus coming into next year, is it a quarter, is it half? Is there a way to directionally sort of indicate how much is going to be in this year? \nJennifer Hamann : Again, it does depend on what the behavior is. But there will be some amount, maybe 0.25 to 0.50. That's probably not a bad estimate. Sick leave, obviously, that part we have fully done now. So any heads that we think that we need to add for that, that's done.  Obviously, we get offsets this year too with the brake person agreement. So there's a bit of a netting effect. And then it really is pace and timing of the BLET work rest, getting SMART-TD. And of course, we will -- because it's really the training piece of it, right? So we're going to need to -- for BLET, we need to put more engineers in the training pipeline. And with that, you need to continue to hire some conductors. So there will be some portion, 50% might be at the max side, I would say, but probably somewhere in there is a safe bet. \nLance Fritz : And Jennifer, I think you had said this, but your total guidance sequentially for the back half labor being flattish includes all that. \nJennifer Hamann : Yes, it absolutely includes all of that. \nOperator: Our final question is from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. \nJordan Alliger : More of an operational question. Curious, trip plan compliance, where do you think that needs to go both at the manifest intermodal level, but specifically on intermodal. Is the way to think about intermodal conversion accelerating tied to a certain level of trip plan compliance for that? And if so, where do customers really take note and you start to see an acceleration of market share gains? \nEric Gehringer : Yes. Thank you for the question, Jordan. So when you -- we've been very consistent. And when you think about the intermodal TPC, you're talking about a number that starts with an 8. And when you're thinking about manifest and autos, it starts with the 7. Now that's highly informed and continues to be evolving. We went through a very large engagement with our customer base through Kenny's team towards the back end of last year that is informed this year and how we think about that, more specifically to segments within those customers.  Now that work continues because -- and as we've reinforced before, we know that our customers are sensitive, in fact, very sensitive to our service. That's why we're encouraged by the progress we made. And in no way are we saying that our service is where it needs to be now. It was a great step in the right direction. We've got more work to do. \nLance Fritz : Thank you, Jordan, and thank you all for your questions, and thank you for joining us on the call today. We appreciate your interest and your ownership in Union Pacific, and I hope you have a great rest of your day. Take care. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Eric Gehringer",
            "content": "Thank you, Kenny, and good morning. Starting on Slide 9. As always, safety remains job #1 at Union Pacific, and we are committed to ensuring the safety of our employees, our customers and the communities that we serve. Freight rail is the safest way to transport goods over land, and Union Pacific is doing its part to be even safer through ongoing investments in our network, employees, technology and communities. That is evidenced by our safety performance, which continues to show improvement.  Through the first half of the year, our reportable derailment rate and personal injury rate both improved, a direct result of our enhanced training programs and strong safety culture of ownership and personal accountability.  Now let's review our key performance metrics for the quarter, starting on Slide 10. This quarter, through the team's hard work, we made improvements both year-over-year and sequentially across key metrics that drive the customer experience. Freight car velocity improved 8% to 202 miles per day compared to the second quarter 2022. This improved fluidity and resiliency was on display as we exceeded 200 daily car miles for 10 consecutive weeks during the quarter.  While the current business mix is a headwind, there remain opportunities for continued improvement. Trip plan compliance cites sizable 17 and 8-point year-over-year improvement in intermodal and manifest and auto TPC, respectively. Improved network fluidity as evidenced by faster freight car velocity, train velocity and lower terminal dwell drove those improvements.  Turning to Slide 11 to review our network efficiency metrics. With the demand picture weaker, the team is taking action to right-size resources to align with current volumes. For example, beginning in April, we took actions to remove locomotives from our active fleet, storing around 200 units through the quarter. While there is still room for progress, locomotive productivity improved 2% both sequentially and year-over-year even as our gross ton miles declined 1%.  Although greater crew availability is supporting solid service metrics, the impact of our hiring can be seen in our workforce productivity. To date, we have graduated approximately 1,200 TE&Y employees and have a strong pipeline of nearly 775 in training. These higher workforce levels, coupled with weaker volumes, resulted in a 5% decline in workforce productivity. However, with more crew resources, we were able to lower recrew rates and reduce our borrow-outs by roughly half during the quarter.  We continue to drive productivity with train length as evidenced by our sequential improvement of 2%. While down 1% year-over-year, this is good progress when you consider the headwinds soft intermodal was presented to our train length initiatives. There are many more opportunities ahead for improved efficiency of our railroad. From redeploying brake persons to improving fuel efficiency, growing train length and rightsizing our locomotive fleet, there is productivity to be captured.  Wrapping up on Slide 12. The well-being and quality of life for our employees remains a top priority, and we continuously collect feedback, collaborate and look for solutions with our workforce. The historic agreements listed on Slide 12 represent results of our work together. Let's talk through each one of them in detail.  Starting with paid sick leave. We now have ratified our tentative agreements with all 13 of our labor unions and this important quality-of-life initiative. The employee benefit is evident as they receive more paid time off to take care of themselves and their families. For the company, this definitely improves the attractiveness of our jobs but is additional labor expense that will need to be offset.  Next, our crew consent agreement with SMART-TD provides greater scheduling flexibility and the ability to redeploy break or switch persons to work either in or outside the yard. More specifically, for our employees, it provides an expedited path for brake persons to become conductors and ultimately engineers if they so desire.  For the company, it allows us to now reduce brake persons where the work does not require the third person, allowing us to partially offset short-term hiring demand. It also sets the stage to establish ground-based enhanced utility positions with fixed days off and greater certainty about their weekly assignments through scheduled shift work.  Finally, TE&Y work rest provides engineers and conductors with a more predictable work schedule, which enhances the quality of life for our employees and their families. Currently, we have a ratified agreement with our engineers that provides an 11 days on, 4 days off work schedule, and we are currently negotiating work rest with our conductors.  For the company, this enables the railroad to better manage staffing levels as we receive a more predictable, available workforce. That reduces labor and failure costs, which combined support more consistent and reliable service, enabling long-term growth. We also believe it will improve our retention rate, reducing hiring expenses and loss productivity.  Now these agreements come with a cost, which Jennifer will detail more later. As we implement them, we expect a larger training pipeline in the near term as well as elevated workforce levels in the future. When fully implemented, our current forecast is an additional 400 to 600 employees. Ultimately, the long-term benefit of these agreements is the positive impact on our employees and the service we provide for our customers. That enhanced service product will allow us to win in the marketplace.  So to close, I would like to express my appreciation to both our customers for their support and the marketing and sales team for their continuous work to capture available demand and win in the new -- win new business.  With that, I will turn it over to Jennifer to review our financial performance. Yes. And just picking up from there, Chris. Clearly, what you've seen in our performance is that we have reduced the amount of hiring that we've been doing now. We stay very connected with Kenny as in his outlook, both for the fourth quarter as well as 2024, and we're going to continue to adjust as we have to what that demand is.  It's the same way I view the locomotive work that was accomplished during the quarter. And the team stored 200 locomotives. And if you actually look for now and this month, we're actually above 200. We're treating it the exact same way. So the demand that's out there, find your resource base accordingly. Yes. Thank you for the question. Let's back up in time, as we came into the year when we think about our first quarter earnings report, we were talking about borrow-outs. In the context of while we were making great progress in our hiring, we still have pockets of the system, specifically about 7 locations, where we were utilizing borrow-outs because of the difficulty to hire.  Now in any given year, there's some level of borrow-outs used even in just dealing with seasonality, for example, the grain harvest that comes in the fall. If you look at the quarter, what we've reported is that we've taken our borrow-out count down by 50%, approximately. Now that is a process that continues. As we look for volume to continue to grow, we have those as options. But as we're looking every week, to your point, to control our cost, those are ones that we adjust literally on a weekly basis.  There may be a place as we fast-forward three months, four months, six months, where you may use them and very small numbers. But our goal is to reduce our borrow-outs as quickly as we possibly can.  As far as the nonfuel cost, it follows the same recipe that we've shared before, One, we just finished talking about it, which is how we think about our labor costs and ensuring that we're being conscious of that. Two, you go to your next expensive cost or, at least outside of fuel, is you're going to look at your locomotive fleet. The reduction that we've made in the quarter is a strong move in the right direction. The reduction we've been made in July is another strong move on top of that, and we look forward to reporting to that in future quarters. So all eyes on we want to grow the business, and we need to be volume-variable until we see more of that growth coming. Yes. And on the agreement side, so if we start with sick days, the opportunity that Lance mentioned obviously reinforce as we see the opportunity to improve the attractiveness of our jobs. And as a result of that, that can have a positive impact on how we do our hiring.  If you go to the brake person deal, clearly, the biggest opportunity there is to reduce brake person labor in line with where the jobs are no longer needed and also allows us to partially offset some of our hiring in the short term. And of course, we get the benefit of establishing a ground-based enhanced utility position.  And as Jennifer pointed out, the payback period on that is approximately two years. And if you look right now, we're about 60% of the way through that implementation. And then certainly on the 11 and 4 scheduled work, it really boils down to improved availability, as Lance pointed out, and more efficiently managing our staff levels with more latitude on how we do that under this new agreement. I think we also pointed out in our commentary that, that number is going to be highly impacted by the behavior that comes from these agreements. And we're not ready today to say exactly what that will look like. We'll continue to look to it, though. Yes. The offsets really haven't changed from the ones that I answered a few moments ago. They really focused on the availability on the 11 and 4 and they focus on the brake person about actually removing brake persons off of positions that are no longer needed. Yes. Thank you for the question, Jordan. So when you -- we've been very consistent. And when you think about the intermodal TPC, you're talking about a number that starts with an 8. And when you're thinking about manifest and autos, it starts with the 7. Now that's highly informed and continues to be evolving. We went through a very large engagement with our customer base through Kenny's team towards the back end of last year that is informed this year and how we think about that, more specifically to segments within those customers.  Now that work continues because -- and as we've reinforced before, we know that our customers are sensitive, in fact, very sensitive to our service. That's why we're encouraged by the progress we made. And in no way are we saying that our service is where it needs to be now. It was a great step in the right direction. We've got more work to do."

            "name": "Jennifer Hamann",
            "content": "Thanks, Eric, and good morning. Let me start with a look at the walk-down of our second quarter operating ratio and earnings per share on Slide 14, where we've outlined the major drivers. In the June 13 8-K, we disclosed a onetime ratification payment related to our SMART-TD brake person agreement. That $67 million bonus increased our operating ratio 110 basis points and reduced our EPS $0.09.  Falling fuel prices during the quarter and the lag on our fuel surcharge recovery programs positively impacted our operating ratio 200 basis points and added $0.04 to EPS. While improved operations generally allowed us to meet demand during the quarter, that demand was softer and the combination of an elevated training pipeline, inflation and negative mix, all impacted our core results. Below the line, we net to a $0.07 EPS reduction from lower Nebraska State tax rates in 2023, as was noted in that same June 8-K, and a large 2022 real estate sale.  Looking now at our second quarter income statement on Slide 15. Operating revenue totaled $6 billion, down 5% versus last year on a 2% year-over-year volume decline. Included in that is a $34 million reduction in accessorials related to lower intermodal volume and faster equipment turns.  Operating expense of $3.8 billion was flat resulting in second quarter operating income of $2.2 billion, which is down 12% versus last year. Other income decreased $70 million driven by the 2022 real estate sale I mentioned earlier. Interest expense increased 7%, reflecting higher debt levels. Net income of $1.6 billion declined 14% versus 2022, which when combined with share repurchases, resulted in a 12% decrease in earnings per share to $2.57.  Now looking more closely at our second quarter revenue. Slide 16 provides a breakdown of our freight revenue, which totaled $5.6 billion, down 5% versus 2022. Lower year-over-year volume reduced revenue 175 basis points. Total fuel surcharge revenue of $707 million was $269 million less versus last year. The impact of falling fuel prices as well as the lag in our surcharge programs reduced freight revenues 425 basis points.  The combination of price and mix in the quarter increased freight revenue 150 basis points. This gain reflects the strong pricing we secured while also recognizing some headwinds from certain coal and intermodal contracts where the pricing is more reflective of current market conditions. Mix in the quarter remained negative as fewer lumber shipments and more short-haul rock shipments outweighed the positive impact of lower intermodal.  Turning now to Slide 17 and a look at second quarter operating expenses, which totaled $3.8 billion. Compensation and benefits expense increased $177 million versus 2022 with nearly 40% of that amount reflecting the brake person agreement. Second quarter workforce levels increased to 4%. Although total transportation employees were up 7%, the active TE&Y workforce is only up 1%, which is a result of our robust hiring and elevated training pipeline.  Excluding the impact of the onetime bonus payment, cost per employee increased 5% in the second quarter, and we expect it to be up 3% to 4% for the full year. Both second quarter and full year cost per employee reflect the impact of that larger training pipeline as well as better crew efficiency, which are partially offsetting wage inflation. I'll provide more details on the impact of our new agreements here in just a bit.  Fuel expense in the quarter increased 29% on a 29% decrease in fuel prices. Purchased services and materials expense increased 5% driven by inflation, partially offset by decreased subsidiary drayage expense and more moderate locomotive repair expenses as we stored locomotives in the quarter. Equipment and other rents was up 8%, reflecting higher lease expense for new freight cars secured to support business volumes and lower equity income, slightly offset by lower car hire as we improve cycle times and move less volume. Other expense grew 6%, primarily related to increased environmental remediation accruals as well as persistently elevated casualty costs.  Turning to Slide 18 and our cash flows. Cash from operations in the first half of 2023 decreased to $3.9 billion from $4.2 billion in 2022. The primary driver was $445 million of payments related to labor union agreement. These payments also impacted free cash flow and our cash flow conversion rate.  Year-to-date, we returned $2.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And we finished the second quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 200 -- excuse me, to 2022 levels at 2.9x as we continue to be A-rated by our three credit agencies.  Wrapping up on Slide 19. As you've heard from the team, we're pleased that the service product is enabling us to meet available demand. Unfortunately, as you heard from Kenny, consumer-facing markets like intermodal and lumber remains soft. Additionally, the outlook for coal has weakened since the start of the year but with some near-term opportunities given the extreme heat.  Although we still expect to outpace industrial production in certain markets, weak demand for consumer goods has pushed our full year volume outlook below current industrial production estimates, which are slightly positive. Unchanged is our expectation to generate pricing dollars in excess of inflation dollars. To date, we've made great progress repricing our business to reflect the impact of higher inflation, and that momentum will continue.  As it relates to fuel prices, I should point out that the tailwind we've experienced these past 24 months is now expected to shift to a headwind both on the operating ratio and EPS front. Assuming fuel prices remain relatively stable, this will likely represent a negative second half impact of around $0.50 per share.  Eric provided some great context on our labor agreements. And although they clearly come with some upfront cost, we see opportunities as well. Starting with the sick leave agreements. Our current forecast is that they will add roughly $50 million to labor expense in the second half of 2023, which is reflected in the cost per crew numbers I quoted earlier. We view these costs as added inflationary pressures that we will reflect in our pricing.  For the brake person agreement, we've already seen the impact of that upfront payment. Our expected payback period is roughly two years as it allows us to redeploy crew personnel, save on costly borrow-out positions as well as reduce our current hiring needs. Implementation of the BLET work rest agreement will start over the next month or so with completion likely in 2024. For this year, we estimate the work rest implementation will cost upwards of $20 million.  The challenge in putting a finer point on that estimate is both timing and forecasting employee behavior. We don't yet have an agreement with SMART-TD, and we are still working through some technology and logistics before we start the rollout. And while we certainly expect better availability, better service and more flexibility with our crew boards, providing more access to time off likely adds employees and expense. The exact math depends on how employees utilize this greater flexibility as well as how we translate better predictability into increased levels of productivity and service that ultimately drive profitable growth on our railroad.  Looking at our 2023 capital allocation. Our capital plan remains $3.6 billion. We also plan to maintain our current dividend of $1.30 per quarter as reflected in our dividend announcement this morning. However, we have paused share repurchases and don't expect to be back in the market for the remainder of 2023.  While there's no change to our long-term capital allocation strategy, which is first dollar into the business, industry-leading dividend payment and excess cash to shares, we recognize our cash flows are impacted in the current environment with volumes and costs.  Wrapping up, we are well positioned to operate a better railroad in the second half of 2023 and for the long term, our strong fundamentals are unchanged and will allow us to generate significant value for our owners as team UP drives service, growth and improved profitability.  So with that, I'll turn it back to Lance. Thank you, Lance. And on behalf of the employees of Union Pacific, let me offer our gratitude and appreciation for your leadership. We wish nothing but the best for you and your family as you embark on the next chapter.  Before we begin Q&A, I'd like to lay out a couple of guidelines for the call. In the interest of time and to accommodate everyone, please limit yourself to one question and one question only. Second, we understand that there's great interest in the leadership changes that were announced this morning, and we look forward to those discussions. However, today's call is to discuss our quarterly results. So please focus your questions on the business of the earnings call.  So with that, Rob, we are ready for your first question. Yes, Jon, thanks for that question. I'll start and then pitch it to Kenny. So just as a reminder, when you think about our book of business, call it, 25% or so is spot rates. You've got another, call it, 30%, 35% or so that is one year or less in duration types of contracts or arrangement, and the rest then are multiyear deals. So there is a cadence to which we're able to touch actively all of our business.  Kenny, do you want to maybe talk about the market? Yes. So I'll maybe let Eric talk about how he feels about crew staffing levels. But just overall, in terms of our head count, we think as you look to the back half of the year, it's probably going to be, I'll call it, flattish or so from where we're at right now. We're continuing to hire and train and make sure that we've got a good robust pipeline so that we're able to serve our customers appropriately. But just from an absolute FTE basis, that's kind of how we see things in the back half. Yes. I mean, certainly, the one headwind we did size for you is the $0.50 impact, the negative year-over-year impact we expect to see on EPS from fuel in the third and fourth quarters. In terms of moving into 2024, so if you think about that $50 million from the sick leave agreements that I mentioned, most of those agreements were really effective in the second half. We had our non-ops that started a little bit in the first half. So I think you can think about that as being something that will carry over and repeat itself in the first half of 2024.  Beyond that, in terms of the implementation of work rest, we're really reluctant to -- and really, it would be difficult for us to size that more precisely because it is going to depend on the timing of how we roll that out as well as the employee behavior that we see with that. And so that's something that we'll just keep you updated, but I want to make sure you do understand that, that will be a bit of a headwind. But as we get greater clarity of that as we go through our rollout and start that rollout and obviously, we still need to get SMART-TD done as well, we'll be in conversation about that. Yes, I can start it. So you raised a good point, Ravi. I mean we do think looking backwards certainly that industrial production has been a better gauge. But you're right, we have great franchise diversity, which we've talked to and Kenny mentioned too. And with the growing intermodal portfolio, there are certainly components of that. But it's really driven by consumer spending, and a lot of that consumer spend on industrial production. So it's hard to really separate from that.  But in terms of what's changed from where we started the year, certainly, coal is something that with natural gas prices falling as it did late January, early February, that certainly took a big chunk of that demand away from us. Now you've heard us talk about the heat and you're seeing that, you're seeing maybe a little bit of inflection in natural gas prices. So we're watching that.  The other piece, though, is on that consumer side. Onboarding a new intermodal customer coming into the year, we expected that to be a big tailwind to our volumes. And just the way that, that consumer spending and consumer goods purchases has dropped, that's just had a really outsized impact. Yes. And Amit, just to build on what Eric is saying there is, if you look across all of our cost categories, setting depreciation side, we know we have opportunities within all of those to be more efficient. As we continue to improve cycle times, that has a very direct flow-through in terms of our car hire expenses on the purchased services and materials side.  Eric mentioned the locomotives, but there's other opportunities we have in there to work on our cost. And even comp and benefits with some of the headwinds that we know we have, there's opportunities to be more productive and use that crew base more efficiently.  And to your point, volume can certainly be a friend when it comes to the cost structure. But I think the fact that you've seen us make some progress as volumes are going down, and you saw us build train length even as volumes came down and in particular, intermodal volume, those are the things that we're going to keep working on here -- well, always, but certainly in the back half of the year to continue to drive better efficiency and get better alignment between the resources and the cost structure and the volumes that we're moving. Yes. So I'll start off, Ken. So when we did our 8-K in June, we took the operating ratio improvement off the table for the year, and that hasn't changed. Certainly, you heard us talk about some of the headwinds that we have. So we are not -- with the addition of the labor expenses, volumes moving away from us and then obviously, some fuel headwinds relative to OR in the back half of the year, we don't expect year-over-year improvement.  Our task, and I kind of touched on this a little bit with the question from Amit, is to get better from where we sit today. And I'm not going to forecast what our OR is going to be in the back half of the year, but we're going to work really hard to improve each and every day. And that's both in terms of being more productive with that cost structure as well as going out and selling in the marketplace and doing all we can to drive profitability on that side.  I don't know, Eric, you want to... Yes. So going back to -- you're really asking a sequential question. And again, I -- we had a 63% reported OR. If you're stripping out the brake person agreement, that was 1.1 points in the quarter. If you look at what we have done historically as a company, you tend to see some of your better margins in the third quarter, tends to go up a little bit then in the fourth quarter when you're just thinking about kind of that normal seasonality.  We are going to work to make sequential improvement. I'm not telling you that we're making sequential improvement, but that is the task that has to be ahead of us. We have to work to improve the cost structure. And we've already made some progress. I think you certainly saw that. I know it's a little bit of a messy quarter with all that was going on in it. But when you strip some of the noise out, there was -- particularly when you're comparing first quarter to second quarter, we did make gains, not year-over-year but sequentially, we did make some gains there. So I think that's the way to think about it into the back half of this year. Yes. So Walter, we did mention that in my prepared remarks that, that was a bit of a headwind. And you've heard us talk before that we do have a portion of our coal contracts that have some mechanisms that link that pricing to natural gas pricing. And with what's happened with natural gas pricing, that certainly is flowing through in terms of some of the rates. We did that similar to intermodal in terms of keeping competitiveness for those players that are dispatching into the grid, keeping them competitive. And we're continuing to ship coal. Still profitable for us, but there is some pricing differentials there.  So it really depends on how you see the rest of the year playing out in terms of how that's going to look. But if you just compare last year's nat gas prices to where we're at this year, that tells you there's going to be some ongoing pressure there. It should be. I mean, obviously, watch natural gas prices. Yes. So I would go back to second and third quarter of 2020 when the pandemic hit and there was such a drop in volumes. We paused our share repurchases then for at least a couple -- I'm pretty sure for the full second quarter, part of the third quarter, I think, is when we restarted that. So we manage the share repurchase piece with our excess cash. And that's always been the flexible part of our shareholder return, and that's how we're managing it today. Exactly, Lance. And obviously, with some of the earnings pressures we're facing this year, that's not giving us that incremental capacity we've seen. Yes. So I'll actually jump in on that one. So it is -- when you think about the 400 to 600 incremental that we talked about from the labor agreements, that's incremental from what we would have otherwise been staffing at a given volume level. So that is completely consistent with and taken into account with when we also say, as we look at head count levels now to the end of the year, we think not a whole lot of change. So... And it's for all agreements, which, again, we're going to be implementing over not just the back half of this year but well into 2024. Absolutely. Again, it does depend on what the behavior is. But there will be some amount, maybe 0.25 to 0.50. That's probably not a bad estimate. Sick leave, obviously, that part we have fully done now. So any heads that we think that we need to add for that, that's done.  Obviously, we get offsets this year too with the brake person agreement. So there's a bit of a netting effect. And then it really is pace and timing of the BLET work rest, getting SMART-TD. And of course, we will -- because it's really the training piece of it, right? So we're going to need to -- for BLET, we need to put more engineers in the training pipeline. And with that, you need to continue to hire some conductors. So there will be some portion, 50% might be at the max side, I would say, but probably somewhere in there is a safe bet. Yes, it absolutely includes all of that."

            "name": "Kenny Rocker",
            "content": "Thank you, Lance, and good morning. For the second quarter, volume was down 2% driven by weak market conditions in our premium and bulk business groups. Freight revenue declined 5% driven by lower fuel surcharges and a [2% decrease in volume. However, we generated solid core pricing gains in the quarter to help offset some of those challenges].  Let's take a closer look at each of these business groups. Starting with bulk. Revenue for the quarter was down 3% compared to last year, driven by a 2% decrease in average revenue per car due to lower fuel surcharges and a 1% decline in volume. Grain and grain products volume was up 1% due to increased demand and business wins for renewable diesel feedstocks, coupled with strong shipments of domestic grain. A soft U.S. export grain market partially offset these gains.  Fertilizer carloads decreased by 9% in the quarter due to an outage at a customer facility that reduced export potash shipments. Food and refrigerated volume was down 8% due to reduced beer imports early in the quarter, but those shipments eventually improved by June. In addition, drought conditions from the prior growing season negatively impacted both fresh and can shipments.  And lastly, coal and renewables volume was flat year-over-year. Low natural gas prices and reduced electricity demand from mild weather negatively impacted shipments, but that was offset by a favorable comparison to 2022. With our service improvements and additional resources, we are currently meeting available demand.  Moving on to industrial. Industrial revenue was flat for the quarter driven by a 1% improvement in volume, offset by a 1% decline in average revenue per car. Core pricing gains in the quarter were offset by lower fuel surcharges and a negative mix in volume. Industrial chemicals and plastics volume was up 2% year-over-year, driven by increased plastic shipments, partially offset by lower industrial chemical shipments due to challenged industrial production levels and reduced housing demand.  Metals and minerals volumes continue to deliver year-over-year growth. Volume was up 2% compared to last year primarily driven by growth in construction materials and increased frac sand shipments along with new business development wins. Forest products volume declined 13% year-over-year driven by challenging market conditions in housing and repair and remodel, coupled with lower corrugated box demand. However, energy and specialized shipments were up 2% versus last year driven by strong business development and increased demand for LPG and petroleum products.  Turning to premium. Revenue for the quarter was down 11% on a 4% decrease in volume compared to last year. Average revenue per car decreased by 8%, reflecting lower fuel surcharge revenues. Automotive volumes were positively driven by continued strength in OEM production and inventory replenishment for finished vehicles and auto parts.  Domestic intermodal wins were offset by a weak freight and parcel market driven by higher inventory and the shift in consumer behavior as people spend more towards services than goods. International shipments were down due to decreased imports on the West Coast.  So turning to Slide 7. Here is our outlook for the rest of 2023 as we see it today. Starting with our bulk commodities. There is uncertainty in our second half coal outlook as the inventories have been restocked, but extreme heat is driving up near-term demand and starting to push up natural gas prices. We expect near-term grain shipment to be challenged with tighter U.S. grain supply impacting volumes. However, with improved operations and recent rain improving new crop supply forecast, we remain optimistic about our opportunity to move incremental grain carloads in the fourth quarter.  In addition, we expect our forecast for biofuel shipments of renewable diesel and their associated feedstocks to remain strong. We see solid market demand and continue to capture new business as production expands.  Moving on to industrial. The forecast for industrial production is down in the back half of 2023. Demand for forest products will also remain below 2022 levels. And despite some good business development wins on the metal side, it has been offset by a weaker-than-expected market. However, we expect to see continued strength in construction with new business wins.  And finally, for premium. We expect challenges in the intermodal market from continued inventory destocking, inflationary pressures and ongoing shift in consumer spending from goods to services. However, on the international side, we continue to outpace U.S. West Coast import market as customers shift more business to IPI. For automotive, we expect growth to continue driven by strong OEM production and high shippable ground count.  So to wrap up, it's hard to say when the economy will begin to recover in certain sectors, but our diverse portfolio allows us to see positive momentum in many of our commodities. The team remains focused on winning new business and has a strong pipeline of opportunities with a great track record for closing deals.  With that, I'll turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance. Allison, you look at it, I'll let you know, we're really staring down at consumer spending. And it's been flat last few months, maybe several months. But it's differentiated as you look at goods versus services, we're clearly seeing, and I talked about it in my opening remarks, less on the goods and more on the services.  The other thing that we're looking is just what's happening with demand, and we're looking at that in terms of some of the contract rates would better flatten out in the spot rates that have inched up a little bit. The fact that we have a really strong intermodal service product is a benefit for us. We're encouraged as a company, I'm encouraged as the commercial leader that even though the imports have been down 23% year-to-date, we're only down a couple of percentage points.  And talking to our customers, we also believe that they will be shifting a little bit more back to the West Coast port. That's going to be a gradual shift. That will be a little bit more throughout 2023 and probably into 2024. But clearly, we're positioned here for the upside. Yes. Jon, the commercial team has done an excellent job articulating the need for some of the inflationary pressures even if you want to call it the labor priors that are there and really inserting our service product along with those discussions.  Now candidly, in a very pragmatic way, our customers empathize with that. They are taking the same price increases in their markets. So they understand what we need to accomplish. There's a tremendous amount of resources that were committed to on the CapEx side, which will help out with a consistent and reliable service. So we feel very good. There's full confidence and price and above inflation in making sure we cover those costs. All I'll say is that we're looking at consumer spending by the week. And I feel very encouraged that we have onboarded over the last couple of years a couple of transformative customers on to our domestic intermodal network. And so as we see that movement move up, we're in a great position. And so that's encouraging for us as a company. So yes, a couple of things here. Let's just take hold for first up. Yes. And you've heard us talk about this. We do have a couple of mechanisms that are in place that allow us and our customers to be competitive with natural gas prices. One of the things that we have seen out there is the fact that there has been a little slight uptick in terms of demand based on the extreme heat that we've seen. We've seen that also impact again in the near term natural gas prices out there. So we're seeing more demand out there.  We're working closely with Eric and his team as we speak to add more sets and add more inventory into the network. And we're looking at the 4 curves that you just see, how long that will last. So we're always looking at that, and we're looking at that by the week.  Switching to domestic intermodal on the pricing side. we like the fact that we have our customers that are competitive in the marketplace and that we're competitive against truck. Some of those mechanisms will go up, I think, tightened in a Loup market like where we are now, it might move down a little bit. But the key is to make sure that we can capture the volume against truck and make sure that we're competitive. Yes, Fadi, thanks for the question. Let's just walk through -- if you look at our outlook slide, and I'll supplement that with a few more specifics on our biodiesel, the renewable diesel market, we've got seven different facilities on us. We're going to land another facility here by the end of the year. We're very encouraged by that. That's a key part of our growth strategy. And we mentioned that a couple of years ago, during Investor Day, very proud of our commercial team for securing that.  Construction, our rock business, for example, those are areas where Eric's team is just delivering great service, and it's showing up in terms of carloads. We're adding a few more sets there. We're seeing more carloads that are coming on because of that, and some of that is market-related. There's just more infrastructure that's out there.  If you talk about the service product, we look at auto parts coming out of Mexico. We've seen a pretty fast and upcoming grower -- growing EV producer that we're growing with on the auto parts side that we're excited about. We've secured a new automotive OEM on our line back in the spring that has brought business to us. That same OEM will be bringing on business in the first quarter. So we're pretty excited there.  And then kind of last but not least, I'll just say that overall, the team has been engaged on bringing new business in different ways. We have a new industrial park that's going to be landing on us in the Buckeye, Arizona area. So that's great. And we've got a customer that will be doing reusable plastics, so just you think about the ESG connection. So we can create our own business development with the service that I mentioned with Eric, and we're excited about it. It's up around 20% to 25%. So the team is just doing a fabulous job going out there and expanding the market better. That's in a down market. And so I will say we're pumped up about it. Okay. Well, you're going to get me riled up today. So first of all, we talked about a couple of transformative wins that we feel good about. I'll tell you, as a management team, bringing on Inland Empire, which is a new product, bringing on a new Port Houston service product that Eric has given us with 5 new lanes, bringing on Twin Cities. Absolutely, we feel good about domestic intermodal. At some point, you need demand to be there. What you're hearing me say is that we're prepared as that demand comes on. And we're adding new products, we're adding new services, we're adding new customers. We're excited. So let me back up and just say there's been a lot of debate out there, Lance, in the marketplace. And we feel very good about the service products that we have with Falcon Premium. On a broader sense, there are other Class 1s associated with that. So it's not just one Class 1. It's the other Class 1s that we're interacting with too that we feel good about.  We've got a shorter route structure. We've got a better schedule. We've got the relationship with the customers. Eric and his team are continuously improving that service product. So we're encouraged how that looks in the future. So Scott, I'd tell you, we look at the weekly crop report and, call it five, maybe six weeks ago, wasn't looking great. And since then, we've had rain in areas that we serve and participate in. So it's looking much better.  You heard in my comments that we think there is an opportunity for incremental grain in the fourth quarter. And so we're steering that down and working with Eric's team to make sure we can capture it. Yes. Just a short answer. No, we're not expecting increased pricing pressures on that intermodal side of the house. That's how you should be thinking about it. I think you're asking, have we seen any success stories? And yes, we've had some early wins. Of course, the focus is over the road. I mean that's the size of the prize. Rail is a very small part of that traffic that's moving out of Mexico or into Mexico. As I also said, as we continue to improve the speed and consistency there, we expect to make more inroads. Yes. I mean we're getting more reception from customers that are open to opening their books and giving us a shot, for sure."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website.  It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Fritz. You may begin.\nLance Fritz: Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to Union Pacific's first quarter earnings conference call. With me today in Omaha are Kenny Rocker, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Eric Gehringer, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Jennifer Hamann, our Chief Financial Officer. The story of the past quarter for Union Pacific is one of resiliency, battling heavy snow, Arctic temperatures, flooding and tornadoes, the team maintained service levels and exited the quarter on a positive trajectory. Persevering through those harsh conditions, our employees delivered for our customers, which demonstrates again that our people are the foundation for the great things that lie ahead. Turning to the first quarter results. This morning, Union Pacific is reporting 2023 first quarter net income of $1.6 billion or $2.67 per share. This compares to first quarter 2022 results of $1.6 billion or $2.57 per share. Our first quarter operating ratio of 62.1% deteriorated 270 basis points versus 2022 driven by excess costs, inflation and lower volumes. A series of weather events throughout the quarter had a real impact on our ability to capture demand, especially within our coal business as well as added cost to the network. Through those events, our service products showed greater and greater resiliency, quickly rebounding each time as we were better positioned with crew resources to support our customers. And with April month-to-date, freight car velocity is about 200 miles per day. We are operating a network that is positioned for consistent and reliable service. While a more difficult start to the year than expected, it doesn't reduce our expectations for 2023. As you'll hear from the team, all of our goals are still in front of us. Let me turn it over to Kenny for an update on the business environment.\nKenny Rocker : Thank you, Lance, and good morning. Freight revenue for the first quarter increased 4% driven by higher fuel surcharges and solid pricing gains, partially offset by a 1% decline in volume. Bulk volumes were muted in the quarter as weather and service-related challenges impacted shipments. Additionally, weaker market conditions for premium also drove lower volume for the first quarter. However, our strong focus on business development and new business wins partially offset by some of that decline. Let's take a closer look at each of these business groups. Starting with bulk. Revenue for the quarter was up 4% compared to last year, driven by a 7% increase in average revenue per car reflecting higher fuel surcharges and solid core pricing gains. Volume was down 3% year-over-year. Grain and grain products volume was down 1%, driven by weaker export grain shipments as world demand for U.S. grain has softened, coupled with drought impacts affecting supply in UP's served region. Fertilizer carloads were flat in the quarter. Strong export potash was offset by a decline in phosphate volume from weather conditions delaying shipments. Food and refrigerated volume was down 6% due to reduced beer imports and weather conditions negatively impacting both fresh and can shipments. And lastly, coal and renewable volumes was down 4% compared to last year driven by weather interruptions and associated service challenges that impacted our locomotive and crew resources. Moving on to industrial. Industrial revenue was up 5% for the quarter driven by a 5% improvement in average revenue per car due to higher fuel surcharges and core pricing gains. Volume for the quarter was flat. Industrial chemicals and plastics volume was down 2% year-over-year driven by lower industrial chemical shipments due to challenged industrial production and reduced housing demand. Metals and minerals volumes continued to deliver year-over-year growth. Volume was up 3% compared to last year primarily driven by growth in construction materials and increased frac sand shipments, along with new business development wins. Forest products volume declined 19% year-over-year driven by soft housing starts and lower corrugated box demand for nondurable goods shipments. However, energy and specialized shipments were up 6% versus last year driven by strength in demand for LPG and petroleum products. These gains were partially offset by fewer soda ash shipments due to weather and service-related challenges. Turning to Premium. Revenue for the quarter was up 3% on a 1% decrease in volume compared to last year. Average revenue per car increased by 5%, reflecting higher fuel surcharge revenue and core pricing gains. Automotive volumes were positively driven by strengthening OEM production and dealer inventory replenishment for finished vehicles. Domestic intermodal business wins were offset by a weak freight and parcel market, driven by high inventory, increased truck capacity and inflationary pressures. On the international side, despite weakened imports, more container shipped inland versus the first quarter of last year, resulted in year-over-year growth. So now moving on to Slide 7. Here is our outlook for the rest of 2023 as we see it today. Starting with our bulk commodities, we expect grain to be challenged near term as export demand softens and supply tightens throughout this crop year. However, as we look ahead towards the next crop season in late fall, we're encouraged by the initial forecast. For coal, low natural gas prices and a milder winter allow utilities to build more inventory. We are experiencing normal softness through the shoulder months. Looking further out in the year, demand will largely be dependent on natural gas prices and summer weather. Lastly, we expect biofuel shipments of renewable diesel and their associated feedstocks to grow due to solid market demand, new production coming online and business development wins. Moving on to industrial. The forecast for industrial production is to shrink in 2023, and the demand is getting weaker in forest products. However, we expect to see continued strength in construction and metal with new business wins. And finally, for Premium, we expect near-term challenges in the intermodal market from high inventory levels, inflationary pressures and weak consumer spending as people shift back to spend more towards services than goods. We will be closely watching for a potential market uptick in the latter part of the year. In addition, we expect automotive growth to continue, driven by strong OEM production and dealer inventory replenishment. So to wrap up, we are facing economic uncertainty and a tough price environment in a few of our markets, but we expect to see strength in some other commodity areas. Our diverse portfolio allows us to maintain our pricing guidance. To capture more demand, we are working closely with Eric and his team to be agile and have resources available in locations where we need them. I am confident that the team's relentless focus on business development will drive volumes to exceed industrial production this year. With that, I'll turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance.\nEric Gehringer: Thank you, Kenny, and good morning. Starting on Slide 9. We continue to make great strides on safety, as evidenced by our 10% improvement in derailment performance for the first quarter. While encouraging progress on safety, our goal remains a future with zero incidents and zero injuries. We've made progress on derailments by implementing state-of-the-art technology, like Precision Train Builder and our geometry inspection fleet. This is on top of our network of more than 7,000 wayside detection devices and our 24/7 operating practices command center. Further supporting our efforts, in March, the industry announced a set of key safety actions. These include the installation of additional wayside detectors and enhanced standards for how we proactively use and share critical data. In addition, the industry is expanding efforts in first responder training and deploying technology to provide real-time railcar condition monitoring. The railroad industry remains one of the safest transportation modes in the nation. And through our capital renewal program, Union Pacific invests almost $2 billion annually back into its network to further improve safety. Now moving to Slide 10 for a look at our current operational performance. As Lance mentioned, Mother Nature made her presence felt across the Union Pacific network this season, bringing extreme weather in many forms. UP crews in California battled flash flooding, persistent mudslides and heavy snow. The Central Sierras, for example, recorded over 700 inches of snow this season. That's 222% above historical averages. Employees across our central corridor in upper Midwest portions of our system also worked through prolonged blizzards, ice and Arctic temperatures. These events challenged our ability to maintain a fluid operating state on specific portions of the system. However, thanks to the dedication and proactive efforts of our employees, the network quickly recovered after each event. And as the chart on Slide 10 demonstrates, we're exiting the quarter on a positive trajectory versus the congested state we were entering this time last year. Our April month-to-date metrics show a network in a healthier state with freight car velocity at 200 miles per day, intermodal TPC in the high 70s and manifest TPC on the rise as well. That result also reflects our hiring efforts as we focus on backfilling attrition and targeting locations where crew challenges persist. We currently have around 1,000 employees in training, which is an increase of approximately 500 versus last year. In addition, we have utilized borrowed out employees to address hard-to-hire locations and get crews where needed. Now let's review our key performance metrics for the quarter, starting on Slide 11. Sequentially, we held our ground through the obstacles of the quarter. Both freight car velocity and manifest and auto trip plan compliance made slight improvements from last quarter's results. Intermodal trip plan compliance remained effectively flat as we battled resource imbalances driven by weather interruptions. With our current traffic mix, freight car velocity consistently running around 200 to 205 miles per day will strengthen our entire service product, including bulk, manifest and intermodal performance. Turning to Slide 12 to review our network efficiency metrics. Locomotive productivity dropped 5% versus first quarter 2022. However, it remained flat sequentially from last quarter's results as we continue to operate a larger locomotive fleet in an effort to support the recovery of the network. In the second quarter, the team is focused on moving more freight and rightsizing the fleet. To that point, we are in the process of storing over 100 units to at the ready status. First quarter workforce productivity declined 6% to 991 daily miles per FTE driven by an increased number of trainees and lower volumes. Our strong training pipeline supports our ability to capture available demand and future growth while managing and reducing borrowed out employees. As employees graduate from training, we expect productivity to improve. Train length is effectively flat compared to last quarter's results. Lower intermodal traffic, coupled with extreme cold temperatures across the Northern tier of our network presented a headwind to our train length initiatives for the quarter. The team remains committed to strengthening the network while we're covering loss productivity. Wrapping up on Slide 13. The success drivers for 2023 remain unchanged. And the entire team is dedicated to building on the momentum gained as we exited the quarter. We remain committed to addressing employees' quality of life feedback and are pleased with the recent agreements regarding paid sick leave. We will continue to work diligently in finding win-win solutions that enable a strong service product and provide our employees with more consistent work schedules. In addition, as you heard from Kenny, we continue to aggressively look for opportunities to strengthen volumes. With the service product demonstrating resiliency, we have added back train sets and targeted freight cars to the network to capture available demand. I am confident that the foundation we're laying will provide a safer, more consistent and reliable service product to meet the growth needs of our customers. With that, I will turn it over to Jennifer to review our financial performance.\nJennifer Hamann : Thanks, Eric, and good morning. We'll start on Slide 15 with a look at our first quarter income statement. Operating revenue totaled $6.1 billion, up 3% versus 2022 despite a 1% year-over-year volume decline. Other revenue decreased 5%, driven by $30 million of increased subsidiary revenue, which was more than offset by a $50 million reduction in accessorials. Lower intermodal volume and greater supply chain fluidity drove the accessorial decline. Operating expense increased 8% to $3.8 billion, resulting in first quarter operating income of $2.3 billion, down 3% versus last year. Below the line, other income increased $137 million year-over-year, largely driven by a $107 million onetime real estate transaction that contributed $0.14 to earnings per share. Interest expense increased 9%, reflecting higher debt levels. Net income of $1.6 billion was flat versus 2022. But when combined with share repurchases, resulted in a 4% increase in earnings per share to $2.67. Our first quarter operating ratio increased 2.7 points to 62.1%, following fuel prices during the quarter and the lag on our fuel surcharge programs positively impacted our operating ratio by 190 basis points. Core results offset the fuel benefit and were a 460 basis point drag to operating ratio. Included in that is the impact of weather, which is difficult to quantify. But between both lost revenue and additional expense, we estimate to be in excess of $50 million. Now looking more closely at first quarter revenue. Slide 16 provides a breakdown of our freight revenue, which totaled $5.7 billion, up 4% versus last year. Lower year-over-year volume reduced revenue 150 basis points. Total fuel surcharge revenue of $883 million added 475 basis points to freight revenue, reflecting the lag in our programs. The combination of price and mix increased freight revenue 75 basis points as ongoing pricing actions were mostly offset by our business mix. Fewer lumber shipments and more short-haul rock shipments were the primary drivers of the negative mix. Turning now to Slide 17 and a summary of our first quarter operating expenses, which totaled $3.8 billion. Compensation and benefits expense increased 7% versus 2022. First quarter workforce levels increased 4% with transportation employees up 5%, the result of our dedicated hiring efforts over the last 12 to 15 months. Cost per employee only increased 3% in the quarter as wage inflation was partially offset by a larger training pipeline. During the first quarter, we signed agreements with the majority of our labor unions to provide paid sick leave to our employees. These agreements became effective April 1 and represent just under half of our craft professionals. Assuming we are able to reach agreements across the board, we would expect cost per employee to be up mid-single digits for the year, consistent with what we discussed in January. Fuel expense grew 7% on a 9% increase in fuel prices as we moved less freight. Our fuel consumption rate deteriorated 1% as the impact of our fuel conservation efforts was more than offset by reduced network fluidity. Purchased services and materials expense increased 16% driven by maintenance of a 3% larger active locomotive fleet and inflation. Equipment and other rents was up 9% as a result of increased car hire expense related to elevated cycle times, and the other expense line grew 6% related primarily to higher environmental remediation costs. Turning to Slide 18 and our cash flows. Cash from operations in the first quarter decreased to $1.8 billion from $2.2 billion in 2022. The primary driver was Presidential Emergency Board back pay settlements paid in January which totaled $383 million. That payment also impacted our quarterly cash flow conversion rate and free cash flow, with both roughly in line with last year's performance when you exclude that payment. In the quarter, we returned $1.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And we finished the first quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.9x as we continue to be A-rated by our three credit agencies. Wrapping up on Slide 19, we are maintaining our 2023 full year guidance to achieve volumes above industrial production, price gains in excess of inflation and operating ratio improvement. Our plans for capital allocation also are unchanged. As with every year, there are puts and takes to how the year plays out. While 2023 started a bit slower than expected, I need to remind everyone, it is only April 20. We have 8.5 months in front of us and many opportunities with volume, service and productivity. Before I turn it back to Lance, I'd like to express my thanks to the UP team. We are skilled in running the outdoor factory that is our railroad. But Mother Nature seemed very focused on testing those skills this year given the extremes we faced, and yet the team forged ahead, keeping the network fluid and our customers served. Fantastic work by everyone. With that, I'll turn it back to Lance.\nLance Fritz : And thank you, Jennifer. As Eric discussed, we continue to make great strides on safety. Derailments have been in the spotlight recently. The entire industry understands the critical role we play in support of the communities we serve. In fact, since 2000, Union Pacific's mainline derailments are down almost 30%, helping make this past decade the safest for the rail industry. Working collaboratively and proactively, the industry can further improve on that safety record. Looking forward, as you heard from Kenny, consumer-facing markets are in rough shape right now. Importantly, though, there remain opportunities to capture additional demand in a number of markets. The entire team is executing a plan to capture those additional carloads supported by an improved service product. Finally, with Earth Day approaching, I'd like to highlight the actions Union Pacific is taking to protect our planet. At the end of 2022, we released our second annual Climate Action Plan, highlighting updates to achieve our greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. This includes our goal of net zero emissions by 2050. Over the past year, we've turbocharged our locomotive modernization program. We've committed to both battery and hybrid electric locomotive, and we've increased our biodiesel blend to over 5%. And we're being recognized for that work. This past year, Union Pacific was selected as a member of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the first time. And we were the highest ranked railroad in the transportation category on Fortune's most admired companies. Union Pacific is committed to being a sustainability leader, driving long-term value for all of our stakeholders. Before turning to Q&A, as it relates to the CEO search process, the Board is fully engaged in executing its duty to identify the next leader. And I can say from personal experience what a wonderful job it is to be at the helm of a company like Union Pacific. I'll continue to lead the team until the new CEO is identified, and I'm energized by what we can accomplish in the coming months, as well as the great potential this company has for years into the future. With that, let's open up the line for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\nScott Group : Lance, any timing on CEO search? And any thoughts on what you and the Board are looking for? And then Jennifer, margins down 270 basis points. Obviously, we need some nice improvement the rest of the year to get to full year improvement. Can you help us bridge us to that full year improvement? And any thoughts on second quarter? It's an easier comp. Do you think margins inflect positive in Q2? Just any thoughts?\nLance Fritz : Yes. Thank you, Scott. So I'll just circle back to the press release that the Board sent when they announced earlier in the year that we were in the process of identifying a new CEO. They were clear on what they were looking for then, right, a track record and experience in safety, customer service, business development, clear vision on culture and a good operating experience. So they are crystal clear on what they're searching for. And the only update I have for you is we're using an excellent party, external consultant, and they're being very thorough in their search, which is underway.\nJennifer Hamann : So then, Scott, to your question, I mean, you're exactly right. We need to make sequential improvement through the year, and then that needs to become year-over-year improvement at some point for us to be able to meet that guidance. The factors that are going to help drive that, certainly, fuel is something that is looking different to us this year than it did last year. Particularly right now, you saw the 1.9 points that it benefited our OR in the first quarter. That will -- comparison will get a little tougher in the back half. So it may look different than '22 did. But certainly, fuel, I think, is something. But then it's the main levers that you know that we have available to us. It's volume, price and productivity. And of course, volume, it depends a little bit what that is, but we also have pure cost control. So if volumes are something that are not our friend, and we're not able to get that leverage, we also have the ability to control costs through being very careful and diligent in our management.\nLance Fritz : And Jennifer, one last thing. What gives us a ton of confidence as we look into the year is how the network is operating right now. It's in a place where we can get the volume and we can squeeze out the excess cost.\nJennifer Hamann: Absolutely.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS.\nTom Wadewitz : I wanted to ask you about the head count level. I think you know the training pipeline for T&E looks like it's larger but I think that the level of people that you've had that are trained on the system seems like it's been static for a while. And so I'm just wondering what do you think about in terms of where you need to get for TE&Y that are trained in on the system? And I guess, in terms of attrition, has attrition been an ongoing problem has that stabilized? Just thinking about that headcount dynamic and then I guess, how that fits into how you would expect network performance to go from where we are.\nLance Fritz : Yes. So Tom, we entered the year saying total headcount hires addition to the TE&Y would look kind of like what it did in 2022 predicated on our plan for volume. Volume is looking a little cloudy right now to us, certainly in the first quarter in the back half. And so of course, that hiring plan is being looked at and adjusted. Net-net, in the second quarter, you're going to see us add to the active TE&Y headcount coming out of the training pipeline. The question really is what the training pipeline look like for the rest of the year? Having over 1,000 in the pipeline is a very strong pipeline for us. In terms of attrition, we tend to have about a 10% turnover in our TE&Y workforce. That really hasn't changed over the course of the last five years. We don't necessarily see it changing right now. So one of the adjustment factors is if we find ourselves getting out over our skis a little too far, attrition can help us suggest quickly.\nTom Wadewitz : So it sounds like the, I guess, trained level goes up, but overall headcount kind of static as the training pipeline comes down is maybe the best way to look at it.\nJennifer Hamann : I think it really does depend on the volumes to a degree, Scott. And so certainly, as Lance said, the second quarter, I think you certainly see our total head count is going up. It's going to be probably different than last year. First half, we've got the training pipeline loaded in the first half. And I think the question is going to be what does the second half look like.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. \nKen Hoexter : So just -- it looked like the operating service levels were flat -- you mentioned that a couple of times, I guess, Eric did, but velocity was -- really came down the past few weeks, I guess, during the quarter, and then more recently showed a pretty solid rebound, I guess, maybe the last week or two. Is there anything changing with the operating plan? Was this -- I don't know if Eric or Lance, you want to throw in some thoughts? Or was this just kind of the end of some of the weather stretches that you were talking about? Maybe just talk about how operations are doing now and what's changing.\nEric Gehringer : Yes, Ken. Thanks for the question. Your summary is exactly accurate. And it was towards the tail end of winter is really where we were about 3 weeks ago, having come out of that. And with all the work that we've done on the hiring side is amongst other actions, you're seeing the output of having 2 to 3 weeks without weather being that headwind. With [weather] largely, if not entirely, behind us winter, you should expect us, as our customers expect to maintain where we are. We've reinforced that 200 to 205 miles per day. It's what drives our TPC metrics to the level our customers expect.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup.\nChris Wetherbee : Maybe one quick follow-up on the head count point. I guess I'm just curious, given what you guys have been able to do with some degree of service recovery, would you think about pausing sort of the hiring as you sort of reassess volumes depending on sort of how that plays out in the second half of the year? Curious about that. And then maybe on that point for Kenny. Just in terms of like what you're seeing in the month of April, it seems like we've seen March and April be a little bit softer across the board of transport, not necessarily Union Pacific specifically, a little bit softness there. Curious what you're hearing from the customers. Has there been a bit of a spring lull here or maybe that picks up in the near term? Just kind of some thoughts there would be helpful.\nLance Fritz : Chris, this is Lance. I'll start and then turn it over to Kenny on your second question. So let's unpack the headcount question a little bit. We are in much better shape this time, this year versus same time last year. The hiring pipeline is full, but more importantly, we've been filling our classes everywhere we've been looking for people across the railroad for about the last 3 or 4 months. That is very different than our experience last year where we found it very difficult in about crew hubs all in the Northern region to be able to find, candidly, the workforce to be able to hire. So we've been much more aggressive in the back half of last year, ramping up things like hiring bonuses, finding creative, unique ways to create a workforce, a pool to hire from. And that's paying dividends right now.  So you're exactly right in terms of as we look into the year, right now, we're starting to evaluate our original plan for hiring versus what volumes are doing and what the back half of the year balance is going to look like. Our longer-term guidance remains in place, and that is we fully expect to be volume variable and have ultimately our head count grow at less than our volume numbers are growing. But clearly, coming out of last year, we had to fix the ship and get our crew boards healthy, add a little excess -- not excess, add a little factor of safety to the crew board so that we could take events and recover quickly so that our service product was consistent. And we're in that place right now. We're essentially there. We're solving some of the problem with borrow-outs. So hiring is going to have to replace them because they're expensive, and it's a burden on our employees to be borrowed. Out, but we are in much better shape looking into the rest of the year. Kenny?\nKenny Rocker : Yes. Chris, so let's just start off. You look at our coal, we're expecting it to have a seasonal lull this time, the shoulder months that I mentioned. If you look at it last year, natural gas prices were much higher. So this is more of a normal look for domestic intermodal. We'll keep an eye on it. It's a very loose market right now. There's quite a bit of truck capacity that's out there. So we'll be watching that. And then also, last year, if you look at it, our grain business was still pretty strong at the time of year. Now we're seeing more global grain going to places where we exported last year. Now having said all that, looking forward to the rest of the year, hey, we're still bullish about some of these markets that I mentioned, whether it's finished vehicles, the metal, rock that's in our construction area is one and then biofuels.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Ben Nolan from Stifel.\nBenjamin Nolan : Maybe, Kenny, if I could just follow up with that, we've been hearing a whole lot of noise about near-shoring, reshoring, specifically around Mexico. I was curious if you can maybe put a little color around if that's something you're seeing, if there's any notable business wins or anything specific to the moving of manufacturing back to North America that you're hearing from your customers.\nKenny Rocker : We are seeing a little bit of that. We've seen production related to the auto OEMs. There was one pretty large highly public analysis that came out. And with that, you got to remember there's a lot of other inputs that move by rail, whether it's soda ash or the glass, the metals that comes in for the car. That's great for us. Also, in our bulk commodities, on the ag side, we're expecting some new production and receivers out there. So yes, it is looking encouraging, and this is the first time that we're seeing tangible things that we can point toward. So that's a positive for us. I won't go on and on. We enjoy a fabulous network there. I'll leave it at that.\nBenjamin Nolan : Okay. And just to clarify, how should we think about the timing of an impact on that? I mean is this something that could happen near term? Or is this a big picture, longer-term kind of a dynamic?\nKenny Rocker : This is a big picture longer term. I mean, you've got to get time for these locations to actually build up the physical infrastructure there.\nLance Fritz : And not -- but, Ben, it's wonderful to have new production facilities spot in the North American market. We will get our fair share. We have a wonderful franchise to and from Mexico. And any time industry shows up in the North American Continent, it's good for us. It's good for railroads. \nOperator: The next is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. \nJustin Long : I wanted to circle back to the full year guidance. Obviously, the start of the year has been more challenging than you anticipated. So in order to hit your outlook, do we need to see a meaningful positive inflection in the freight market? And if so, when does that need to occur? And then, Kenny, maybe just a clarification on intermodal. I think you said international volumes were up, but I was wondering if you could share the percent change you saw in both international and domestic intermodal.\nJennifer Hamann : I'll take the first part of that question. Again, our guidance relative to volumes is exceeding industrial production. We came into the year, industrial production was forecast to be down about 0.5%. It's actually gotten a tad bit worse. It's now down about 0.7%. So that's not a huge [bump] to exceed. And yes, we started a little weaker, down 1.5 points here in the first quarter. But you just heard Kenny talk about kind of the different markets that are available to us and the fact that, as our service product is improving, we're putting more assets into play to move more carloads, and that's giving us greater flexibility to move those assets around to hit the markets that are available to us. And so we feel quite confident that we will be able to reach that goal as it relates to volumes and the rest of our full year guidance, obviously, which we reiterated. \nKenny Rocker : Yes. I don't think I'm going to break out domestic international here. But what we saw, and I mentioned that just because you do have a more fluid intermodal network on the international side, we don't have a lot of the stack boxes on either end. More of those ocean carriers are moving in one, and we're seeing that. We put in products up against that. That's helping that with our grain facility down there on the Dallas side, with The Katy and they've hit their largest volume record in the first quarter. They just announced they're going to expand. And so we feel good about that, that we can move more of that inland.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs.\nJordan Alliger : Just sort of curious, I think other than volume, you talked about other productivity or cost. Other than fuel expense may be going down, what are some of the other cost levers that you could use to help drive OR to improve over the course of the year? Obviously, volume-dependent, would be things like purchase transport. Just trying to get a sense.\nEric Gehringer : It's a great question, Jordan. So as you think about that and the progress we're seeing right now, it's impacting nearly every one of our cost lines in a positive way. The big ones that we talk about is certainly starting with fleet size. In our prepared comments, I mentioned the fact that we're taking 100 locomotives and then putting them in storage, but they're in a storage state in which they can still be there quickly to gain volume. Next after that, it's all about crew utilization, right, which stretches everything from recrew rates to deadhead -- to how do we think about over time and making sure that we're being judicious with the use of over time. From there, we certainly do, even though you mentioned that we do focus on our fuel consumption. And I'm really encouraged actually by the first quarter because if you look at January, we came out very strong. February was kind of okay, and March was certainly weak, which means with weather behind us, there's no reason that we shouldn't snap right back to that great progress that we saw in January. So it's those others, but I've listed the biggest ones.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with TD Cowen.\nJason Seidl : Two quick things. Kenny, I think you said there were some pricing pressures in a few of your industries. I mean I understand intermodal. Would love to hear what else is being pressured out there. And also in terms of the West Coast port labor situation, how much freight do you think got diverted? And if we get a resolution here, hopefully in the near term, do you think it would come back quickly or it would take some time?\nKenny Rocker : Yes. So before I talk about domestic intermodal, which I think is your question, I just want to reiterate that we've got a broad diverse set of customers and markets that we get the price. And we've said that publicly, call it, approximately roughly half of that business, we get to touch every year outside of just one particular market. Now there is a lag impact to that. But the sales leaders, the commercial teams have done a really fabulous job going out articulating, hey, we're spending quite a bit on CapEx. We're putting quite a few resources out there. They understand what's taken place in the industry with our business on the labor side and the labor negotiations. And candidly, they are experiencing the same inflationary pressure. So you've got that piece. Now talking about domestic intermodal, yes, domestic intermodal has been a pretty loose market, quite a bit of truck capacity that's there. We're seeing it in our bids and RFPs. We've got mechanisms that are in place for our suite of intermodal customers to go out there and compete and win business based on their own strengths and capabilities, which give us confidence. And the other part of that is the fact that as the market tightens up, we can quickly capture that upside.\nLance Fritz: And Kenny, Jason's last question about West Coast ports and ILWU.\nKenny Rocker : Yes. We've been in close contact with the West Coast port, and they believe that there should be an agreement here near term. I'll tell you it's hard to quantify what's been diverted away because of some of these labor challenges. I'll tell you when we look at the order book going out to, I'll call it, the West Coast ports, it looks like the negative delta that we saw year-over-year is becoming less and less.\nJason Seidl : That's good. And you think that there was an agreement, again, knock on wood, because everyone wants that, that you would receive it back quickly or would come back over time?\nKenny Rocker : I think that's just -- I can't be that precise, Jason. We could be positive about it, but to be precise, probably just wouldn't be a good idea.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan.\nBrian Ossenbeck : Kenny, just a follow-up on the pricing reset. Is that kind of going as is expected? Do you still have a little bit more of a lag impact because volumes may be a little bit weaker than you had thought? So I guess is that going to accelerate here? And same sort of question with price/mix. Is that probably the worst you'd expect in the near term here as you look at the different end markets as they're developing?\nKenny Rocker : Yes. Certainly, the way we calculate price volume increasing and improving helps us. So I'll say that also because it is April and not December. We have time to get more of that volume in the play as we move throughout the year. I would not say that there are some markets that are harder to capture price in other than those areas where we have mechanisms in place align with domestic intermodal. We've been very disciplined in our approach to take price. And in some cases, we've all taken some risk there to make sure that we're pricing towards the market.\nLance Fritz : And Kenny, the same -- what you said about domestic intermodal to a lesser degree is truly in coal where you've got natural gas can be a driver of some pricing.\nKenny Rocker : Absolutely. We'll be watching natural gas pretty closely.\nJennifer Hamann : Yes. And to the mix part of your question, Brian, coming into the year, our view is that mix would likely be negative throughout the year, primarily around the fact that we were expecting to see more growth on the intermodal side. Obviously, that's changed a bit. And so looking to the second quarter at least, we're probably expecting a bit of a positive mix. Beyond that, I think it's too soon to say. But I do think that's something that is different as we sit here today than when we came and talked to you in January.\nBrian Ossenbeck : Just a quick follow-up for Lance on the regulatory and legislative side. A lot of noise coming out of D.C. Some of the safety things you mentioned earlier and some of the stats on UP specifically. But what are you most focused on when it comes to the different topics that are being discussed down there. We tend to focus on train lengths. It's obviously an FRA Safety Advisory recently. But I just wanted to hear what was important and what you thought we should focus on when it comes to the various topics being discussed after the safety issues that we've seen in the industry over the last few months?\nLance Fritz : Yes, Brian. That's a great question. So in engaging the legislators in D.C., we help them understand what would actually move the ball in terms of safety, where regulatory effort would make a difference and where it wouldn't. To your point, train length wouldn't. Statistically, on UP, since 2019, train length is up something like 20% in our mainline and siding derailments are down 26%. So there's zero corollary between train length and derailments.  But there are other things that they can help with. We're taking action right now on wayside detection. That's a place where the FRA can step in. Things that we emphasize, that really don't have a corollary impact, another one is crew size and whether conductors are redeployed to the ground. That has no impact on safety around the world empirically. So we just broadly try to help them understand that and stay deeply engaged. This is a deep engagement all the time right now.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.\nAllison Poliniak : I just want to ask on the new business. I guess, first, is there any way -- I know there's a lot of moving parts with volumes, to maybe quantify or help us understand the contribution of the new business wins in volumes. And then second, as part of that, just in terms of the new business pipeline, any notable trends in sort of the conversion that you're seeing in terms of bringing on new business onto the rail?\nKenny Rocker : Yes. It's pretty broad because, obviously, it's in all three of our business teams, meaning if you look at it, biofuels, renewable diesel for us is an emerging market. Been very encouraged by our ability to land new customers, new production sites to move out of the Midwest going into the West, and those are attractive margins to us. On the industrial side, the same thing is true as we look at our metals business and some of the minerals business tied to that. Same as with rock. Those are areas that are positive, and they have structural increases related to population growth down in Texas, Louisiana and the Gulf. And so those are great. And then you are aware -- you are aware, Allison, of some of the new recent wins in our intermodal sector. And again, we feel really blast that we've got a fleet of highly capable customers that can go out and grow business over the road, and it complements very nicely our UMP our UMAX and E&P products that we have in the marketplace.\nAllison Poliniak: And just any color on the conversion trends of the new business opportunities out there?\nKenny Rocker : We see the pipeline is still there. The thing that we're keeping an eye on is are they actually moving the forecasted amount that they initially told us. So no concerns with the pipeline, just a little bit of concern with making sure the volume that they committed to is still there.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank.\nAmit Mehrotra : Jennifer, are earnings going to be up as you move from 1Q to 2Q? Because there's a big fuel benefit in the EPS line in 1Q, and we calculate it like $0.25 or something like that. And a lot of that is going away because of the lag on fuel. And so you're starting kind of from a hole to build back on as you move from 1Q to 2Q. I know there's weather, but I'm just trying to understand if the cadence of earnings growth from 1Q can actually grow in 2Q because of that operating income impact from fuel? And then just related to that, because volume seems to be the fulcrum for all of this, the average weekly volume in the quarter was 152,000 seven-day carloadings, and I think last week, you did under that, and the weather is a lot better. And so I guess the question really is that like when are we going to see -- if weather was a big problem in the quarter, you exited lower than you average for the quarter, when are we actually going to see some of the volumes show up in the weekly carloads?\nJennifer Hamann : Well, so let's start off on the fuel piece. And we agree with your math on the $0.25 for the first quarter. That's exactly right. You have to think about fuel in two pieces, Amit. You have to think about the fuel surcharge piece and then the expense piece. And while in the first quarter, the fuel surcharge piece was a positive, as we look at what our current prices are for fuel right now, call it $3 a gallon when we paid $4 a gallon a year ago, that's going to flip on us. And so that is going to have a different dynamic, but our fuel expense is going to be less as well. And so you really have to think about it in those two parts and separate that out, I would say, in the analysis. The other thing I want to remind everybody about 2Q of last year was we did have an $0.18 benefit from a land sale, Illinois Tollway, and that was in our results. And then we also had $35 million extra in some casualty expenses. So that goes away. So you've got some puts and takes there, but I just want to make sure everybody is thinking of as you're putting that together. Our goal is going to be to continue to drive as much volume as we can across the network, do it as efficiently as we can and improve the service product. And the output of that will be the output of that. I'm not going to give you specific earnings guidance on that. And then to your other question about volumes, I think you need to factor in the Easter holiday. That does have an impact on our volumes. And so while, yes, weather was clearing, we did have a holiday impact there. And I think, again, we're putting the assets into place, and we're going to be moving the volumes that are available to us.\nLance Fritz : Yes. I'm confident what we're talking about in reported numbers this week and beyond.\nAmit Mehrotra : Okay. That's great. And just related to that, Kenny, I don't know if you have a view on intermodal yields. I know fuel, there's a lot of noise in intermodal yields in fuel. But are we holding line on intermodal yields ex fuel? And is that the expectation kind of over the next few quarters?\nKenny Rocker : Yes. And I said this, Amit, we feel really good about the mechanisms we have in place for our customers to go out there and compete and win and retain business based on their capabilities and their strengths. And I also feel good about, again, as the markets move that we'll be able to move more real time with it. And so that's a positive for us.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI.\nJon Chappell : Eric, I want to go back to the productivity, which I seem to go back to every quarter. But just as it relates to getting to these full year targets, one of your peers has kind of laid out what a fluid network could mean from a cost perspective. So is there any way for you to quantify what you think the productivity improvements could contribute in the final three quarters of '23? And also any way for us to kind of understand the timing? You're still digging out of the weather mostly. They're still taking people out of training. Is this like 90% a second half productivity improvement type story? Or can you start to get some significant improvement in 2Q?\nEric Gehringer : Now Jon, thank you for the question. Obviously, we won't guide you to the specifics on the timing of the productivity. What I would reinforce is that based on the performance that we see on the railroad right now, it's bringing me and others greater and greater confidence that we'll see that productivity continue to grow throughout the rest of the year. To say -- as you look into the second quarter, the headwind of winter behind us and the forecast of being able to grow the volume, that's what's going to drive that. Beyond that, I'm not going to guide to it. We're just all focused on making sure that we drive that productivity safely.\nJon Chappell : Any just broad range of numbers? I mean, if we go back to the Investor Day and the starting point there, any way to kind of parse that out even in a broad range?\nJennifer Hamann : No. Jon, I think that would be unwise for us to do that. We are not going to try to pace our productivity improvement. And so we want to do that as fast as we can, as safely as we can while providing a really good service product so that we can ultimately drive greater volumes across the network. That's the real leverage, and it fuels the productivity, quite frankly.\nLance Fritz : Yes. Jon, this is Lance. So just putting a bow on that. Our expectation is, in Q2 with a fluid network, we really squeeze out a bunch of the excess costs created by kind of weather and variability from those events. And then we start stretching our legs beyond Q2 to continue to recover some of the productivity and, ultimately, all of the productivity that we forewent in 2022 and then start growing from there. We've got a fair amount of inflation that's in front of us that we got to offset this year and going into next year. So we're going to be fighting that battle through the whole year as well.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.\nRavi Shanker : So two very quick follow-ups here. One is I know mix was a headwind in the first quarter. But can you confirm that dollar price was above dollar inflation in the first quarter? And kind of if not, kind of how does that trajectory change versus the year? And second, kind of if you're going to have a pretty kind of significant inflection, volumes currently are running down 2.5% year-to-date and you could get to better than down 0.7% for your full year guide, what macro assumption does that involve for the second half of the year? Are you counting on an improvement in macro conditions and/or a restock to get you there? \nJennifer Hamann : I'll hit the first part of your question. And yes, our pricing gains in the first quarter did exceed our inflation. Kenny?\nLance Fritz : Just a second. In terms of macro assumptions, we do not have planned in a recession, right? So a recession would be a problem for us. Absent that, what we need is markets to continue to just behave reasonably, i.e., we need consumers to continue to be healthy spend some. They don't have to go crazy. They just need to not pull in their horns. And we need the industrial economy to continue to do what it's doing. And we need inventory and this whole destocking to calm down after the first quarter, first half. All of those, I think, are pretty reasonable expectations. The wild card would be a recession.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski : My one question for Lance or Eric, your trip plan compliance on manifest remains in like the low 60% level. And I know there's definitional issues, but there are carriers out there delivering much higher than that. So I wonder -- we've talked a lot about service products on this call today. What's the right target for trip plan compliance? And what are the steps to get there?\nEric Gehringer : Yes. So they're focusing on the manifest and autos. When that starts with a 7, so right, 70%, 75%, that's in a place where our customers are giving us feedback that says that we are meeting their expectations. Now as far as steps to get there, you're going to always have manifest and auto lag the intermodal TPC, and it's simply because the cycle time of those cars is longer. It's a conversation we were just having the last two weeks to make sure that we are doing those actions. So when you look at the velocity picking up, that's a tailwind to it. When you look at our use discounts, which means are we making connections in the terminals to the right trains, that's up. Just those two things alone drive TPC in the right direction. And we're driving that as fast as we possibly can because we want to send the message to our customers that we understand first quarter was difficult, but we're in a better place now and it's for their benefit in ours.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC.\nWalter Spracklin : I just want to come back to service levels and the regulatory spotlight. Clearly, the whole industry Union Pacific included, is under a bit of a spotlight from the regulator for the service issues. And when I look back historically, whenever a railroad is needed to promptly address the service issue, operating metrics almost always deteriorate rather than improve. So I don't know if this is best for Jennifer, but I want to come back to that question about are you expecting an OR improvement as early as Q2 based on what you're seeing now? I know you said you saw some pretty good exit trends in Q1, weather is behind you, Easter was more of a -- it was more of a numbers event or a year-over-year numbers event as opposed to anything fundamental. So would you see yourself as on track to achieve Q2 improvement despite your efforts to address service and that, that Q2 improvement should continue through the rest of the year?\nJennifer Hamann : Yes, Walter. I'm going to resist the temptation to give you 2Q guidance and stick with the full year guidance. But you all can do the math. I mean we have to make improvement quickly, and it's got to be sequential. And at some point, obviously, that has to be year-over-year, and that is our focus. And that is our intent, and we're very confident that we will do that.\nWalter Spracklin : Okay. And if -- and barring that then perhaps year-over-year is at risk if you can't see that quickly as the quick turnaround that you're mentioning Jennifer. Is that fair?\nJennifer Hamann : The longer you go into the year with that improvement, it gets more difficult. Yes, I will agree with that.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna.\nBascome Majors : Can you talk a little bit about how your relationships and engagement with the STB has evolved over the last few months? And any expectations of how they'll extend the service period -- sorry, the service oversight period when it expires in a few weeks here? And maybe walking that forward next 12 to 18 months, where do you think their eyes will be most focused? And how do you engage with them as the CPKC deal stops sucking up oxygen in that room?\nLance Fritz : Thank you for the question, Bascome. So we are deeply engaged at the STB. There is an executive level interaction with an STB either staff or member virtually every day, certainly several a week. What is helping in those conversations right now is, demonstrably, the service product is better and customers' temperatures are down. The other thing, if you recall, late last year, there was a hearing at the STB that focused on Union Pacific and our use of embargoes. And we, to the STB and to our customers, more importantly, made the commitment that we're going to both look at how we use embargoes and have an eye towards essentially getting back to a place where they're rare. Year-to-date, this year, 65% reduction in the use, in the last two months 75% reduction as the railroad is getting better. And I have all the confidence in the world that kind of progress is going to continue. So what I expect at this point, the STB is a bit of a wildcard. I won't predict what they do in May as regards the service reporting period. But I know the overall industry and certainly Union Pacific is in a place where our service product is not prompting more scrutiny and significant temperature coming into the STB from customers. And that's their -- that's their purview. That's what they're built for, is to react to customer feedback, and that's what they've done in 2022. So the fact that if we can get customers to a place where they're satisfied with the service product and in good dialogue with us on it, that takes a lot of the pressure out the STB.\nBascome Majors : And maybe the longer-term part of that question over the next 12 to 18 months, where do you think they will focus most? And how do you make sure that your shareholders and customers' interest are protected there?\nLance Fritz : Yes, Bascome. So what we keep an eye on are -- is the fulsome docket that they've got in front of them, things like final offer rate review versus this alternative dispute resolution mechanism, forced open access, the use of revenue adequacy as a rate-setting mechanism, those are things that we're working hard with the STB for them to understand what the ramifications of some of those decision points are, what is and is not justifiable by data and fact. And then, of course, we engage fulsomely with them to help make sure the regulation coming out of the STB makes sense and accomplishes what they're trying to accomplish, which is very good service product and growth in the rail industry. \nOperator: Next question is from the line of Ari Rosa with Credit Suisse. \nAri Rosa : Great. So really quickly, I was wondering what was the real estate transaction. Maybe you could give a bit of color on that? I don't think I saw it. And then, Lance, as you approach perhaps the final months, perhaps quarters of your time as CEO at UP, I was hoping you could just kind of take a bigger picture, step back and reflect on what are the accomplishments you're most proud of and how you think about where you'd like to see the future of the railroad go from here? And in particular, I was hoping you could touch on your thoughts on the ability of UP to grow volume and take share over the next five or 10 years.\nJennifer Hamann : Yes. In terms of the real estate transaction, Ari, it was a fiber optics deal.\nLance Fritz : And Ari, thank you very much for the question and the opportunity to reflect just a moment. If I look back over the last eight years now working on year nine, the thing I'm most proud of is what we as a team have accomplished in terms of moving our transmission plan to a PSR model, doing that over the course of the last four years and doing it in a way where our customers weren't damaged by the transition, they were benefited from it. I think we've done stupendous work on sustainability. As I mentioned in my opening comments, we've done terrific work on diversity, equity and inclusion. We're recognized for that right now in the industry and in our communities. We've done really good work on setting ourselves up to be able to grow. We've got a wonderful stable of partners, IMCs that are world-class in hub, in Schneider and Knight-Swift and XPO in its current form. So I'm really, really pleased with that. As I look into the future, we are poised to be able to grow. We have to be consistent and reliable in our service product. That means we have to get our 5 critical resources right all the time. We got one of them wrong last year, part our issue and part the fact that the world blew up to a degree. But we have to be stable and consistent for our customers. They tell us they want that and they will grow with us as we deliver that. So I know the growth potential is there. Their supply chain want to use rail more, and the concept is really simple and straightforward. It's in our strategy, serve with consistent, reliable service, grow with service product and products that meet our customers' needs. Do that in a way where we are the provider of choice, the partner of choice that allows us to win in the marketplace and do it together with all four of our stakeholders being benefited from it. We think the strategy is sound, and we're ready and executing on it.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein.\nDavid Vernon : Jennifer, a couple of questions for you. Within the guidance that you're giving for a full year OR improvement, is that all just the mechanics of fuel? Or is there some improvement in the underlying business? And then as you think about comp from 2022 to 2023, on a full year basis, can you give us some sort of absolute numbers around inflation and what added cost is being put in there for PTO and additional enhancements to the compensation package?\nJennifer Hamann : So in terms of our inflation guide, we said 4% was our inflation guide for 2023. And we said on the employee side, the comp would to be up mid-single digits. And those things still hold and that takes into account what we have negotiated for and plan to negotiate for in terms of paid sick leave. In terms of how we're going to get there and how we're going to improve, it really is the basis for the service product the pricing. Fuel will be a component. I mean, it obviously is a component in there. But we have the other levers, and that's where we're very much focused. Fuel is going to be what it's going to be. We're going to go after those items that we have the greater control over that's winning new business, pricing it appropriately and moving it efficiently.\nDavid Vernon : And then maybe, Eric, just as a quick follow-up, as you think about the FTE count for the full year, where are you sort of targeting the business to be at year-end 2023?\nJennifer Hamann : I think Lance already answered that question. Our hiring levels for this year are roughly -- we came into the year assuming that they were going to be roughly similar to last year. Attrition is roughly similar in terms of what happens in the back half. We're really watching that from a volume standpoint. \nOperator: Our final question is from the line of Jairam Nathan with Daiwa.\nJairam Nathan : I just had a question on the EV penetration. And as -- do you need to -- does UP need to make investments given the fire risk of batteries within EVs?\nKenny Rocker : I'll say that we have not seen that risk right now. We have very close relationship with the EV leaders we've enjoyed growth there. Our ramps are prepared to handle those EVs, and then we're looking at the forecast and the size and what we need to do anything from an investment perspective and make sure that we can efficiently move those off and on the ramp and do it faithfully.\nLance Fritz : Yes. Jairam, I think fundamentally, the answer is we have not seen a shift in risk based on our shipments of EVs.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Lance Fritz for closing comments. \nLance Fritz : And thank you, Rob, and thank you all for joining us today and for your questions. We're looking forward to talking with our owners again in May at our annual meeting. Until then, take care.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Eric Gehringer",
            "content": "Thank you, Kenny, and good morning. Starting on Slide 9. We continue to make great strides on safety, as evidenced by our 10% improvement in derailment performance for the first quarter. While encouraging progress on safety, our goal remains a future with zero incidents and zero injuries. We've made progress on derailments by implementing state-of-the-art technology, like Precision Train Builder and our geometry inspection fleet. This is on top of our network of more than 7,000 wayside detection devices and our 24/7 operating practices command center. Further supporting our efforts, in March, the industry announced a set of key safety actions. These include the installation of additional wayside detectors and enhanced standards for how we proactively use and share critical data. In addition, the industry is expanding efforts in first responder training and deploying technology to provide real-time railcar condition monitoring. The railroad industry remains one of the safest transportation modes in the nation. And through our capital renewal program, Union Pacific invests almost $2 billion annually back into its network to further improve safety. Now moving to Slide 10 for a look at our current operational performance. As Lance mentioned, Mother Nature made her presence felt across the Union Pacific network this season, bringing extreme weather in many forms. UP crews in California battled flash flooding, persistent mudslides and heavy snow. The Central Sierras, for example, recorded over 700 inches of snow this season. That's 222% above historical averages. Employees across our central corridor in upper Midwest portions of our system also worked through prolonged blizzards, ice and Arctic temperatures. These events challenged our ability to maintain a fluid operating state on specific portions of the system. However, thanks to the dedication and proactive efforts of our employees, the network quickly recovered after each event. And as the chart on Slide 10 demonstrates, we're exiting the quarter on a positive trajectory versus the congested state we were entering this time last year. Our April month-to-date metrics show a network in a healthier state with freight car velocity at 200 miles per day, intermodal TPC in the high 70s and manifest TPC on the rise as well. That result also reflects our hiring efforts as we focus on backfilling attrition and targeting locations where crew challenges persist. We currently have around 1,000 employees in training, which is an increase of approximately 500 versus last year. In addition, we have utilized borrowed out employees to address hard-to-hire locations and get crews where needed. Now let's review our key performance metrics for the quarter, starting on Slide 11. Sequentially, we held our ground through the obstacles of the quarter. Both freight car velocity and manifest and auto trip plan compliance made slight improvements from last quarter's results. Intermodal trip plan compliance remained effectively flat as we battled resource imbalances driven by weather interruptions. With our current traffic mix, freight car velocity consistently running around 200 to 205 miles per day will strengthen our entire service product, including bulk, manifest and intermodal performance. Turning to Slide 12 to review our network efficiency metrics. Locomotive productivity dropped 5% versus first quarter 2022. However, it remained flat sequentially from last quarter's results as we continue to operate a larger locomotive fleet in an effort to support the recovery of the network. In the second quarter, the team is focused on moving more freight and rightsizing the fleet. To that point, we are in the process of storing over 100 units to at the ready status. First quarter workforce productivity declined 6% to 991 daily miles per FTE driven by an increased number of trainees and lower volumes. Our strong training pipeline supports our ability to capture available demand and future growth while managing and reducing borrowed out employees. As employees graduate from training, we expect productivity to improve. Train length is effectively flat compared to last quarter's results. Lower intermodal traffic, coupled with extreme cold temperatures across the Northern tier of our network presented a headwind to our train length initiatives for the quarter. The team remains committed to strengthening the network while we're covering loss productivity. Wrapping up on Slide 13. The success drivers for 2023 remain unchanged. And the entire team is dedicated to building on the momentum gained as we exited the quarter. We remain committed to addressing employees' quality of life feedback and are pleased with the recent agreements regarding paid sick leave. We will continue to work diligently in finding win-win solutions that enable a strong service product and provide our employees with more consistent work schedules. In addition, as you heard from Kenny, we continue to aggressively look for opportunities to strengthen volumes. With the service product demonstrating resiliency, we have added back train sets and targeted freight cars to the network to capture available demand. I am confident that the foundation we're laying will provide a safer, more consistent and reliable service product to meet the growth needs of our customers. With that, I will turn it over to Jennifer to review our financial performance. Yes, Ken. Thanks for the question. Your summary is exactly accurate. And it was towards the tail end of winter is really where we were about 3 weeks ago, having come out of that. And with all the work that we've done on the hiring side is amongst other actions, you're seeing the output of having 2 to 3 weeks without weather being that headwind. With [weather] largely, if not entirely, behind us winter, you should expect us, as our customers expect to maintain where we are. We've reinforced that 200 to 205 miles per day. It's what drives our TPC metrics to the level our customers expect. It's a great question, Jordan. So as you think about that and the progress we're seeing right now, it's impacting nearly every one of our cost lines in a positive way. The big ones that we talk about is certainly starting with fleet size. In our prepared comments, I mentioned the fact that we're taking 100 locomotives and then putting them in storage, but they're in a storage state in which they can still be there quickly to gain volume. Next after that, it's all about crew utilization, right, which stretches everything from recrew rates to deadhead -- to how do we think about over time and making sure that we're being judicious with the use of over time. From there, we certainly do, even though you mentioned that we do focus on our fuel consumption. And I'm really encouraged actually by the first quarter because if you look at January, we came out very strong. February was kind of okay, and March was certainly weak, which means with weather behind us, there's no reason that we shouldn't snap right back to that great progress that we saw in January. So it's those others, but I've listed the biggest ones. Now Jon, thank you for the question. Obviously, we won't guide you to the specifics on the timing of the productivity. What I would reinforce is that based on the performance that we see on the railroad right now, it's bringing me and others greater and greater confidence that we'll see that productivity continue to grow throughout the rest of the year. To say -- as you look into the second quarter, the headwind of winter behind us and the forecast of being able to grow the volume, that's what's going to drive that. Beyond that, I'm not going to guide to it. We're just all focused on making sure that we drive that productivity safely. Yes. So they're focusing on the manifest and autos. When that starts with a 7, so right, 70%, 75%, that's in a place where our customers are giving us feedback that says that we are meeting their expectations. Now as far as steps to get there, you're going to always have manifest and auto lag the intermodal TPC, and it's simply because the cycle time of those cars is longer. It's a conversation we were just having the last two weeks to make sure that we are doing those actions. So when you look at the velocity picking up, that's a tailwind to it. When you look at our use discounts, which means are we making connections in the terminals to the right trains, that's up. Just those two things alone drive TPC in the right direction. And we're driving that as fast as we possibly can because we want to send the message to our customers that we understand first quarter was difficult, but we're in a better place now and it's for their benefit in ours."

            "name": "Jennifer Hamann",
            "content": "Thanks, Eric, and good morning. We'll start on Slide 15 with a look at our first quarter income statement. Operating revenue totaled $6.1 billion, up 3% versus 2022 despite a 1% year-over-year volume decline. Other revenue decreased 5%, driven by $30 million of increased subsidiary revenue, which was more than offset by a $50 million reduction in accessorials. Lower intermodal volume and greater supply chain fluidity drove the accessorial decline. Operating expense increased 8% to $3.8 billion, resulting in first quarter operating income of $2.3 billion, down 3% versus last year. Below the line, other income increased $137 million year-over-year, largely driven by a $107 million onetime real estate transaction that contributed $0.14 to earnings per share. Interest expense increased 9%, reflecting higher debt levels. Net income of $1.6 billion was flat versus 2022. But when combined with share repurchases, resulted in a 4% increase in earnings per share to $2.67. Our first quarter operating ratio increased 2.7 points to 62.1%, following fuel prices during the quarter and the lag on our fuel surcharge programs positively impacted our operating ratio by 190 basis points. Core results offset the fuel benefit and were a 460 basis point drag to operating ratio. Included in that is the impact of weather, which is difficult to quantify. But between both lost revenue and additional expense, we estimate to be in excess of $50 million. Now looking more closely at first quarter revenue. Slide 16 provides a breakdown of our freight revenue, which totaled $5.7 billion, up 4% versus last year. Lower year-over-year volume reduced revenue 150 basis points. Total fuel surcharge revenue of $883 million added 475 basis points to freight revenue, reflecting the lag in our programs. The combination of price and mix increased freight revenue 75 basis points as ongoing pricing actions were mostly offset by our business mix. Fewer lumber shipments and more short-haul rock shipments were the primary drivers of the negative mix. Turning now to Slide 17 and a summary of our first quarter operating expenses, which totaled $3.8 billion. Compensation and benefits expense increased 7% versus 2022. First quarter workforce levels increased 4% with transportation employees up 5%, the result of our dedicated hiring efforts over the last 12 to 15 months. Cost per employee only increased 3% in the quarter as wage inflation was partially offset by a larger training pipeline. During the first quarter, we signed agreements with the majority of our labor unions to provide paid sick leave to our employees. These agreements became effective April 1 and represent just under half of our craft professionals. Assuming we are able to reach agreements across the board, we would expect cost per employee to be up mid-single digits for the year, consistent with what we discussed in January. Fuel expense grew 7% on a 9% increase in fuel prices as we moved less freight. Our fuel consumption rate deteriorated 1% as the impact of our fuel conservation efforts was more than offset by reduced network fluidity. Purchased services and materials expense increased 16% driven by maintenance of a 3% larger active locomotive fleet and inflation. Equipment and other rents was up 9% as a result of increased car hire expense related to elevated cycle times, and the other expense line grew 6% related primarily to higher environmental remediation costs. Turning to Slide 18 and our cash flows. Cash from operations in the first quarter decreased to $1.8 billion from $2.2 billion in 2022. The primary driver was Presidential Emergency Board back pay settlements paid in January which totaled $383 million. That payment also impacted our quarterly cash flow conversion rate and free cash flow, with both roughly in line with last year's performance when you exclude that payment. In the quarter, we returned $1.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And we finished the first quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.9x as we continue to be A-rated by our three credit agencies. Wrapping up on Slide 19, we are maintaining our 2023 full year guidance to achieve volumes above industrial production, price gains in excess of inflation and operating ratio improvement. Our plans for capital allocation also are unchanged. As with every year, there are puts and takes to how the year plays out. While 2023 started a bit slower than expected, I need to remind everyone, it is only April 20. We have 8.5 months in front of us and many opportunities with volume, service and productivity. Before I turn it back to Lance, I'd like to express my thanks to the UP team. We are skilled in running the outdoor factory that is our railroad. But Mother Nature seemed very focused on testing those skills this year given the extremes we faced, and yet the team forged ahead, keeping the network fluid and our customers served. Fantastic work by everyone. With that, I'll turn it back to Lance. So then, Scott, to your question, I mean, you're exactly right. We need to make sequential improvement through the year, and then that needs to become year-over-year improvement at some point for us to be able to meet that guidance. The factors that are going to help drive that, certainly, fuel is something that is looking different to us this year than it did last year. Particularly right now, you saw the 1.9 points that it benefited our OR in the first quarter. That will -- comparison will get a little tougher in the back half. So it may look different than '22 did. But certainly, fuel, I think, is something. But then it's the main levers that you know that we have available to us. It's volume, price and productivity. And of course, volume, it depends a little bit what that is, but we also have pure cost control. So if volumes are something that are not our friend, and we're not able to get that leverage, we also have the ability to control costs through being very careful and diligent in our management. Absolutely. I think it really does depend on the volumes to a degree, Scott. And so certainly, as Lance said, the second quarter, I think you certainly see our total head count is going up. It's going to be probably different than last year. First half, we've got the training pipeline loaded in the first half. And I think the question is going to be what does the second half look like. I'll take the first part of that question. Again, our guidance relative to volumes is exceeding industrial production. We came into the year, industrial production was forecast to be down about 0.5%. It's actually gotten a tad bit worse. It's now down about 0.7%. So that's not a huge [bump] to exceed. And yes, we started a little weaker, down 1.5 points here in the first quarter. But you just heard Kenny talk about kind of the different markets that are available to us and the fact that, as our service product is improving, we're putting more assets into play to move more carloads, and that's giving us greater flexibility to move those assets around to hit the markets that are available to us. And so we feel quite confident that we will be able to reach that goal as it relates to volumes and the rest of our full year guidance, obviously, which we reiterated. Yes. And to the mix part of your question, Brian, coming into the year, our view is that mix would likely be negative throughout the year, primarily around the fact that we were expecting to see more growth on the intermodal side. Obviously, that's changed a bit. And so looking to the second quarter at least, we're probably expecting a bit of a positive mix. Beyond that, I think it's too soon to say. But I do think that's something that is different as we sit here today than when we came and talked to you in January. Well, so let's start off on the fuel piece. And we agree with your math on the $0.25 for the first quarter. That's exactly right. You have to think about fuel in two pieces, Amit. You have to think about the fuel surcharge piece and then the expense piece. And while in the first quarter, the fuel surcharge piece was a positive, as we look at what our current prices are for fuel right now, call it $3 a gallon when we paid $4 a gallon a year ago, that's going to flip on us. And so that is going to have a different dynamic, but our fuel expense is going to be less as well. And so you really have to think about it in those two parts and separate that out, I would say, in the analysis. The other thing I want to remind everybody about 2Q of last year was we did have an $0.18 benefit from a land sale, Illinois Tollway, and that was in our results. And then we also had $35 million extra in some casualty expenses. So that goes away. So you've got some puts and takes there, but I just want to make sure everybody is thinking of as you're putting that together. Our goal is going to be to continue to drive as much volume as we can across the network, do it as efficiently as we can and improve the service product. And the output of that will be the output of that. I'm not going to give you specific earnings guidance on that. And then to your other question about volumes, I think you need to factor in the Easter holiday. That does have an impact on our volumes. And so while, yes, weather was clearing, we did have a holiday impact there. And I think, again, we're putting the assets into place, and we're going to be moving the volumes that are available to us. No. Jon, I think that would be unwise for us to do that. We are not going to try to pace our productivity improvement. And so we want to do that as fast as we can, as safely as we can while providing a really good service product so that we can ultimately drive greater volumes across the network. That's the real leverage, and it fuels the productivity, quite frankly. I'll hit the first part of your question. And yes, our pricing gains in the first quarter did exceed our inflation. Kenny? Yes, Walter. I'm going to resist the temptation to give you 2Q guidance and stick with the full year guidance. But you all can do the math. I mean we have to make improvement quickly, and it's got to be sequential. And at some point, obviously, that has to be year-over-year, and that is our focus. And that is our intent, and we're very confident that we will do that. The longer you go into the year with that improvement, it gets more difficult. Yes, I will agree with that. Yes. In terms of the real estate transaction, Ari, it was a fiber optics deal. So in terms of our inflation guide, we said 4% was our inflation guide for 2023. And we said on the employee side, the comp would to be up mid-single digits. And those things still hold and that takes into account what we have negotiated for and plan to negotiate for in terms of paid sick leave. In terms of how we're going to get there and how we're going to improve, it really is the basis for the service product the pricing. Fuel will be a component. I mean, it obviously is a component in there. But we have the other levers, and that's where we're very much focused. Fuel is going to be what it's going to be. We're going to go after those items that we have the greater control over that's winning new business, pricing it appropriately and moving it efficiently. I think Lance already answered that question. Our hiring levels for this year are roughly -- we came into the year assuming that they were going to be roughly similar to last year. Attrition is roughly similar in terms of what happens in the back half. We're really watching that from a volume standpoint."

            "name": "Kenny Rocker",
            "content": "Thank you, Lance, and good morning. Freight revenue for the first quarter increased 4% driven by higher fuel surcharges and solid pricing gains, partially offset by a 1% decline in volume. Bulk volumes were muted in the quarter as weather and service-related challenges impacted shipments. Additionally, weaker market conditions for premium also drove lower volume for the first quarter. However, our strong focus on business development and new business wins partially offset by some of that decline. Let's take a closer look at each of these business groups. Starting with bulk. Revenue for the quarter was up 4% compared to last year, driven by a 7% increase in average revenue per car reflecting higher fuel surcharges and solid core pricing gains. Volume was down 3% year-over-year. Grain and grain products volume was down 1%, driven by weaker export grain shipments as world demand for U.S. grain has softened, coupled with drought impacts affecting supply in UP's served region. Fertilizer carloads were flat in the quarter. Strong export potash was offset by a decline in phosphate volume from weather conditions delaying shipments. Food and refrigerated volume was down 6% due to reduced beer imports and weather conditions negatively impacting both fresh and can shipments. And lastly, coal and renewable volumes was down 4% compared to last year driven by weather interruptions and associated service challenges that impacted our locomotive and crew resources. Moving on to industrial. Industrial revenue was up 5% for the quarter driven by a 5% improvement in average revenue per car due to higher fuel surcharges and core pricing gains. Volume for the quarter was flat. Industrial chemicals and plastics volume was down 2% year-over-year driven by lower industrial chemical shipments due to challenged industrial production and reduced housing demand. Metals and minerals volumes continued to deliver year-over-year growth. Volume was up 3% compared to last year primarily driven by growth in construction materials and increased frac sand shipments, along with new business development wins. Forest products volume declined 19% year-over-year driven by soft housing starts and lower corrugated box demand for nondurable goods shipments. However, energy and specialized shipments were up 6% versus last year driven by strength in demand for LPG and petroleum products. These gains were partially offset by fewer soda ash shipments due to weather and service-related challenges. Turning to Premium. Revenue for the quarter was up 3% on a 1% decrease in volume compared to last year. Average revenue per car increased by 5%, reflecting higher fuel surcharge revenue and core pricing gains. Automotive volumes were positively driven by strengthening OEM production and dealer inventory replenishment for finished vehicles. Domestic intermodal business wins were offset by a weak freight and parcel market, driven by high inventory, increased truck capacity and inflationary pressures. On the international side, despite weakened imports, more container shipped inland versus the first quarter of last year, resulted in year-over-year growth. So now moving on to Slide 7. Here is our outlook for the rest of 2023 as we see it today. Starting with our bulk commodities, we expect grain to be challenged near term as export demand softens and supply tightens throughout this crop year. However, as we look ahead towards the next crop season in late fall, we're encouraged by the initial forecast. For coal, low natural gas prices and a milder winter allow utilities to build more inventory. We are experiencing normal softness through the shoulder months. Looking further out in the year, demand will largely be dependent on natural gas prices and summer weather. Lastly, we expect biofuel shipments of renewable diesel and their associated feedstocks to grow due to solid market demand, new production coming online and business development wins. Moving on to industrial. The forecast for industrial production is to shrink in 2023, and the demand is getting weaker in forest products. However, we expect to see continued strength in construction and metal with new business wins. And finally, for Premium, we expect near-term challenges in the intermodal market from high inventory levels, inflationary pressures and weak consumer spending as people shift back to spend more towards services than goods. We will be closely watching for a potential market uptick in the latter part of the year. In addition, we expect automotive growth to continue, driven by strong OEM production and dealer inventory replenishment. So to wrap up, we are facing economic uncertainty and a tough price environment in a few of our markets, but we expect to see strength in some other commodity areas. Our diverse portfolio allows us to maintain our pricing guidance. To capture more demand, we are working closely with Eric and his team to be agile and have resources available in locations where we need them. I am confident that the team's relentless focus on business development will drive volumes to exceed industrial production this year. With that, I'll turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance. Yes. Chris, so let's just start off. You look at our coal, we're expecting it to have a seasonal lull this time, the shoulder months that I mentioned. If you look at it last year, natural gas prices were much higher. So this is more of a normal look for domestic intermodal. We'll keep an eye on it. It's a very loose market right now. There's quite a bit of truck capacity that's out there. So we'll be watching that. And then also, last year, if you look at it, our grain business was still pretty strong at the time of year. Now we're seeing more global grain going to places where we exported last year. Now having said all that, looking forward to the rest of the year, hey, we're still bullish about some of these markets that I mentioned, whether it's finished vehicles, the metal, rock that's in our construction area is one and then biofuels. We are seeing a little bit of that. We've seen production related to the auto OEMs. There was one pretty large highly public analysis that came out. And with that, you got to remember there's a lot of other inputs that move by rail, whether it's soda ash or the glass, the metals that comes in for the car. That's great for us. Also, in our bulk commodities, on the ag side, we're expecting some new production and receivers out there. So yes, it is looking encouraging, and this is the first time that we're seeing tangible things that we can point toward. So that's a positive for us. I won't go on and on. We enjoy a fabulous network there. I'll leave it at that. This is a big picture longer term. I mean, you've got to get time for these locations to actually build up the physical infrastructure there. Yes. I don't think I'm going to break out domestic international here. But what we saw, and I mentioned that just because you do have a more fluid intermodal network on the international side, we don't have a lot of the stack boxes on either end. More of those ocean carriers are moving in one, and we're seeing that. We put in products up against that. That's helping that with our grain facility down there on the Dallas side, with The Katy and they've hit their largest volume record in the first quarter. They just announced they're going to expand. And so we feel good about that, that we can move more of that inland. Yes. So before I talk about domestic intermodal, which I think is your question, I just want to reiterate that we've got a broad diverse set of customers and markets that we get the price. And we've said that publicly, call it, approximately roughly half of that business, we get to touch every year outside of just one particular market. Now there is a lag impact to that. But the sales leaders, the commercial teams have done a really fabulous job going out articulating, hey, we're spending quite a bit on CapEx. We're putting quite a few resources out there. They understand what's taken place in the industry with our business on the labor side and the labor negotiations. And candidly, they are experiencing the same inflationary pressure. So you've got that piece. Now talking about domestic intermodal, yes, domestic intermodal has been a pretty loose market, quite a bit of truck capacity that's there. We're seeing it in our bids and RFPs. We've got mechanisms that are in place for our suite of intermodal customers to go out there and compete and win business based on their own strengths and capabilities, which give us confidence. And the other part of that is the fact that as the market tightens up, we can quickly capture that upside. Yes. We've been in close contact with the West Coast port, and they believe that there should be an agreement here near term. I'll tell you it's hard to quantify what's been diverted away because of some of these labor challenges. I'll tell you when we look at the order book going out to, I'll call it, the West Coast ports, it looks like the negative delta that we saw year-over-year is becoming less and less. I think that's just -- I can't be that precise, Jason. We could be positive about it, but to be precise, probably just wouldn't be a good idea. Yes. Certainly, the way we calculate price volume increasing and improving helps us. So I'll say that also because it is April and not December. We have time to get more of that volume in the play as we move throughout the year. I would not say that there are some markets that are harder to capture price in other than those areas where we have mechanisms in place align with domestic intermodal. We've been very disciplined in our approach to take price. And in some cases, we've all taken some risk there to make sure that we're pricing towards the market. Absolutely. We'll be watching natural gas pretty closely. Yes. It's pretty broad because, obviously, it's in all three of our business teams, meaning if you look at it, biofuels, renewable diesel for us is an emerging market. Been very encouraged by our ability to land new customers, new production sites to move out of the Midwest going into the West, and those are attractive margins to us. On the industrial side, the same thing is true as we look at our metals business and some of the minerals business tied to that. Same as with rock. Those are areas that are positive, and they have structural increases related to population growth down in Texas, Louisiana and the Gulf. And so those are great. And then you are aware -- you are aware, Allison, of some of the new recent wins in our intermodal sector. And again, we feel really blast that we've got a fleet of highly capable customers that can go out and grow business over the road, and it complements very nicely our UMP our UMAX and E&P products that we have in the marketplace. We see the pipeline is still there. The thing that we're keeping an eye on is are they actually moving the forecasted amount that they initially told us. So no concerns with the pipeline, just a little bit of concern with making sure the volume that they committed to is still there. Yes. And I said this, Amit, we feel really good about the mechanisms we have in place for our customers to go out there and compete and win and retain business based on their capabilities and their strengths. And I also feel good about, again, as the markets move that we'll be able to move more real time with it. And so that's a positive for us. I'll say that we have not seen that risk right now. We have very close relationship with the EV leaders we've enjoyed growth there. Our ramps are prepared to handle those EVs, and then we're looking at the forecast and the size and what we need to do anything from an investment perspective and make sure that we can efficiently move those off and on the ramp and do it faithfully."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jim Vena, Chief Executive Officer for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Vena. You may now begin.\nJim Vena: Good morning, Rob, beautiful morning in Omaha, nice fall day. So good morning, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Union Pacific's third quarter results. I'm joined in Omaha, by our Chief Financial Officer, Jennifer Hamann, our Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Kenny Rocker, and our Executive Vice President of Operations, Eric Gehringer. As you'll hear from the team, our third quarter results do an excellent job of capturing the progress we've made under our strategy to lead the industry in safety, service and operational excellence. And you're seeing how that leads to financial success. I'm very pleased with where we sit today compared to where we started a little over a year ago. Now let's discuss third quarter results, starting on Slide number 3. This morning, Union Pacific reported 2024 third quarter net income of $1.7 billion, a 9% improvement and earnings per share of $2.75, a 10% improvement. Third quarter operating revenue gained 3% of strong volumes and core pricing gains were impacted by our business mix and less fuel surcharge revenue. Excluding fuel, freight revenue increased 5% versus 2023. Reported expenses year-over-year improved 2%, while fuel prices were a driver. The team did an excellent job generating productivity to control costs as we successfully handled a 6% increase in volume. Our third quarter operating ratio of 60.3% improved 310 basis points versus last year, further demonstrating our ability to be operationally excellent while maintaining a resource buffer to handle unforeseen events. Look, it was another really good quarter. I'm pleased with how we flex to handle the 33% increase in international intermodal volume during the quarter, while improving service metrics across our network. And yes, that mix of business pressured margins a bit. But at the end of the day, it's about operating as efficiently as possible to drive increases in net income and free cash flow. And as Jennifer will walk you through, we did an excellent job of delivering in those areas. It's another proof point that our strategy is working. I'll let the team walk you through the quarter in more detail and then come back for a wrap up before we go to question and answers. So we'll start with the third quarter financials. Jennifer, over to you.\nJennifer Hamann: Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Let's begin on Slide 5 with a walk down of our third quarter income statement, where operating revenue of $6.1 billion increased 3% versus 2023 on a 6% volume increase and third quarter freight revenue totaled $5.8 billion, up 4% compared to last year. Breaking down the freight revenue components, increased volume in the quarter added 550 basis points. Strong core pricing gains were more than offset by business mix, reducing freight revenue 75 basis points. As I mentioned at Investor Day, International Intermodal's average revenue per car is significantly lower than our system average. And lastly, fuel surcharge revenue of $635 million was flat versus last year as lower fuel prices impacted freight revenue 75 basis points. Wrapping up the top-line, other revenue declined $73 million or 18%, driven by several factors: lower access oils resulting from the second quarter intermodal equipment sales reduced demand for auto part shipments at our subsidiary, the ongoing transfer of metro operations and a onetime contract settlement of $12 million during the quarter all contributed to the decrease. As a reminder, there are cost savings across our expense lines associated with the ongoing revenue impact from the equipment sales and metro transfer. Switching then to expenses, third quarter operating expense of $3.7 billion improved 2%, driven by strong productivity and lower fuel prices that more than offset volume-related expenses. There are more details in the appendix, but let me highlight some of the performance drivers. Compensation and benefits expense increased 2% versus last year as wage inflation, including the July 1st, 4.5% increase and volume costs were partially offset by 5% lower workforce levels and record workforce productivity. Trained service employees were flat year-over-year, as we used our buffer resources to handle increased quarterly volume. All other workforce areas decreased 8%, reflecting our continued focus on operational excellence. Cost per employee in the third quarter increased 8% as a result of higher incentive compensation as well as additional wage inflation related to the work rest labor agreements. Purchased services and material expense improved 4% as cost to maintain a lower active locomotive fleet, and decreased subsidiary drayage expenses were partially offset by inflation and volume related expenses. Fuel expense in the quarter declined 13% on a 17% decrease in fuel prices from $3.12 to $2.60 per gallon. Our fuel consumption rate increased 1%, related to the significant growth in less fuel-efficient intermodal traffic, which offset our year-over-year productivity gains. Finally, other expense was better by 6%, reflecting the impact of write-offs in 2023 that more than offset inflation and volume costs. The result of solid revenue growth and strong cost control was third quarter operating income of $2.4 billion, up 11% versus 2023. Below the line, other income decreased $19 million from lower real estate income, while interest expense declined 6% or $20 million on lower average debt levels. Income tax expense increased 23%, driven by higher pre-tax income and state income tax reductions in 2023. Third quarter net income of $1.7 billion, increased 9% versus 2023, which when combined with a lower average share count resulted in double-digits earnings per share growth to $2.75. Our quarterly operating ratio of 60.3% improved 310 basis points year-over-year with nearly half of that coming from core operational improvement. As we discussed in Dallas at our Investor Day, operating ratio is an outcome of our strategy and not the goal. Our goal is to grow earnings and generate more cash for our shareholders, which we achieved even as our revenue growth and margins were impacted by mix. Looking now at cash, shareholder returns in the balance sheet on Slide 6. Year-to-date cash from operations totaled $6.7 billion, up $700 million versus last year. Our cash flow conversion rate improved to 83% and free cash flow has almost doubled versus 2023, up over $900 million. These improvements are driven by 2023 labor agreement payments and growth in operating income, partially offset by higher cash taxes. Year-to-date, our shareholders have received $3.2 billion through dividends and share repurchases, including third quarter repurchases of $738 million. Finally, our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio finished the quarter at 2.7x, as we maintain a strong balance sheet and remain A rated by our three credit rating agencies. So wrapping up on Slide 7, with just over two months left in the year, the majority of 2024 story has been written and it's been a good one. We are executing on the fundamentals of railroading, which is critical to achieving the full financial potential of this franchise. We are affirming our prior 2024 guidance, most importantly that we will continue to improve profitability through our strategy of safety, service and operational excellence. Pricing dollars will exceed our inflation dollars. We will purchase $1.5 billion of shares and invest roughly $3.4 billion of capital and our capital allocation strategy is unchanged. We also are going to put a slightly finer point on how we expect to close the year. At this time, we'd expect fourth quarter results to closely mirror the third quarter, while improving on a year-over-year basis. This level of performance will mark our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year gains, again demonstrating the positive results of our strategy. Throughout the year, we've shown our ability to pivot and flex to handle the various challenges of railroading, from weather of all types to the significant West Coast traffic spike, and we navigated them successfully, improving service, while maintaining cost discipline. We continue to generate strong pricing and productivity, positioning us well to finish 2024 with momentum and on a path to achieve the long-term targets we laid out last month. I'll now turn it over to Kenny to provide an update on the business environment. Kenny?\nKenny Rocker: Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning. As Jennifer mentioned, we had a solid third quarter. Freight revenues totaled $5.8 billion for the quarter, which was up 5%, excluding fuel surcharges, due to increased volume and strong core pricing gains. Let's jump right in and talk about the key drivers for each of our business groups. Starting with our Bulk segment, revenue for the quarter was up 2%, compared to last year on a 3% decrease in volume and a 5% increase in average revenue per car based on a positive mix in traffic and solid core pricing gains. Coal continued to face difficult market conditions in the quarter, resulting from reduced coal demand due to high inventory levels and competition from low natural gas prices. Grain products volumes increased for the quarter due to business development wins and new facilities supporting renewable diesel and associated byproducts, as we highlighted last month at our Investor Day. Lastly, export grain business was up for the quarter, primarily driven by corn and wheat. We continue to win business moving to Mexico, as their domestic consumption outpaces production. Moving to Industrial. Revenue for the quarter was up 3% for the quarter, on a 2% decrease in volume. Average revenue per car increased by 5% due to strong core pricing gains and a positive mix in traffic. Petroleum shipments increased for the quarter due to strong business development efforts in various markets like asphalt and lube oil. Petrochemicals volumes continued to grow due to domestic demand in plastics and new business wins in our industrial chemicals market. However, those gains were more than offset by the softer demand for rock against last year's record shipment. Premium revenue for the quarter was up 7% on a 14% increase in volume and a 6% decrease in average revenue per car, reflecting increased international intermodal shipments, lower fuel surcharges and truck market pressures. Automotive volumes were down due to unplanned production adjustments, partially offset by business wins with Volkswagen and General Motors. Intermodal volumes continue to remain strong. Our international intermodal volume was up 33%, significantly outpacing growth seen in West Coast imports. Import strength also drove increased domestic volume, which we were able to capitalize on due to our diverse IMC network. Now turning to Slide 10. Here is our outlook for the balance of 2024 for the key markets we serve. Starting with Bulk. Coal is expected to remain challenged, as inventories remain high, and we see competition from low natural gas prices. Moving to Grain. We are optimistic due to a strong supply in UP's franchise areas, and we have secured additional new facilities that will ensure domestic growth, generating long-term ratable grain demand. We expect ongoing strength in the Mexico export market as the UP continues to increase its share south of the border. Additionally, we expect continued growth in the grain products tied to renewable fuels and their associated feedstocks. The team is focused on capturing business as production continues to ramp up at new facilities brought online, such as Bartlett's crush facility in Cherryvale, Kansas. Turning to Industrial. As we mentioned earlier, we expect the rock market will not match last year's record volume. For petroleum, we have tougher comps but are building on our success with business development. Petrochemicals is expected to outperform the market, based on the strength of our Gulf Coast franchise, and we are excited to see incremental volume from Shintech's expansion at Plaquemines, Louisiana. And wrapping up with Premium. On the intermodal side, the surge of West Coast import volumes will continue to drive for both our international and domestic markets for the remainder of the year. In Automotive, we are seeing softness in the market, which will be partially offset by business development wins. In summary, I'm proud of the commercial team. We're going to see the strongest volume year since 2029. Our diverse portfolio allows us to see positive momentum, and our resource buffer puts us in a great position to manage increased volumes on the West Coast. The team is focused on our key growth markets, collaborating with our customers and the operating team to find innovative solutions to grow and win together. With that, I'll turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance.\nEric Gehringer: Thank you, Kenny, and good morning. Moving to Slide 12. As I mentioned at our Investor Day in September, we always believe there's a better way to do things, even the things we're doing well today. And that culture has manifested itself in our results, as we continue to make great progress in our safety, service performance and efficiency metrics. Starting with safety. We remain intensely focused on our four pillar strategy to prevent injuries and drive down derailments. As a result, year-to-date both derailment and personal injury rates improved year-over-year. While we are not there yet, we are clearly on the path to become the safest railroad. Freight car velocity improved 5% to 210 miles per day compared to third quarter 2023. Additionally, throughout the last several weeks, we have maintained a freight car velocity near 220 miles per day. A favorable business mix coupled with continued improvements in terminal dwell has driven the performance. Notably, we achieved a third quarter record in terminal dwell, a 5% improvement versus last year. Intermodal and Manifest Service Performance Index saw a 1 and 5 point improvement year-over-year respectively. As demonstrated by our results, the team took quick action throughout the quarter to deploy buffer resources and adjust trip plans minimizing the impact of a 33% surge in international intermodal shipments. These swift actions not only allowed us to effectively absorb the increased volumes, but also mitigated the impact on our broader network. Now let\u2019s review our key efficiency metrics on Slide 13. In addition to our service product, the team remains hyper-focused on driving productivity throughout the network. The more productive we are, the better we put ourselves in a position to compete and you can see we did that in the third quarter. Locomotive productivity improved 5%, compared to third quarter 2023. While increased fluidity of the network has enabled our performance, the team also continued its focus on reducing locomotive dwell. In fact, this quarter our locomotive dwell results tied for the best ever quarterly performance, a 5% year-over-year improvement. Workforce productivity, which includes all employees, improved 12% versus 2023. Impressively, both the month of September and the third quarter marked all-time records for their respective periods. Our continued work to leverage technology and automate operations across our transportation, mechanical and engineering team is paying dividends. Not only is it driving efficiencies, but it's also improving the safety of how we work. Train length was flat for the third quarter. After experiencing the impacts of Hurricane Beryl in July, we've made steady sequential improvement throughout the quarter and ended September with a monthly record over 9,600 feet. These improvements are a direct result of targeted transportation plan changes and capital investments, such as siding extensions and technology. While we have made great strides this year to improve train length, there are still opportunities to safely improve, as we strive to generate mainline capacity for current and future growth. To wrap up, great work by the team, as they efficiently leverage our buffer resources to handle the influx in volumes. However, as I opened with, there is always opportunity to get better and I'm confident the team will continue pushing in our pursuit of industry leading safety, service and operational excellence. Jim?\nJim Vena: Thank you, Eric. Turning to Slide 15. Before we get to your questions, I'd like to quickly summarize, what you've heard from our team. First, as you heard from Jennifer, we did a great job of adding volume to our network in an efficient manner. And given the margin profile of that volume, it was imperative that we did so. We also continue to generate strong pricing that reflects the value we're creating for our customers. Again imperative to mitigate the mix dynamic in the quarter. Kenny gave an overview of third quarter volumes and laid out thoughts for the remainder of the year. The team is making no excuses and going after every available carload. While international intermodal gets a lot of attention these days, there are plenty of additional markets, where the team is winning to bring new customers to the railroad over the short-term and long-term. Lastly, Eric updated our progress to improve safety service and operational excellence. Year-to-date our safety metrics continue to show great improvement, but they're just the initial steps toward being industry-leading. On the service front, the operating team did a great job of improving service, while we handled more business. That was possible due to the efficiency of our network and our ability to maximize asset utilization. While the business of railroading can be unpredictable, it's the fundamentals of how you operate the company anticipating and reacting to change that ultimately matters. I said it earlier and I'll say it again, I'm very pleased with where we sit today. When I joined the company, I said, we had pressures that were going to take us a couple of years to get by some of the inflationary pressures. But, as you heard at our Investor Day last month, we have the right team and the right strategy to make take this company to new heights. This is just the beginning of the journey. So with that, we're excited, we're ready and we're ready to take your questions. Rob?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question today will be coming from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.\nKen Hoexter: Good morning, Jim and team. Thank you for the question. I guess, two things. One, can you just clarify, when you talk consistent with last quarter, are you talking on an operating ratio level? Are you talking on a revenue or op income level? Just want to clarify that. And then, I guess, Kenny, it seems coal has taken a big step down lately. Can you talk about what puts and takes about what's built into the full year target that you're targeting there?\nJennifer Hamann: I'll start with that then, Ken. Thanks for the question. Yes, I mean, when we say consistent, and we say results, we're being pretty broad there. But, yes, I mean, I think we see are the as we look at what's going to happen in the fourth quarter. We see the outcomes being very similar across all of those categories in terms of our fourth quarter results. So consistent is consistent.\nKenny Rocker: Yes. On the coal side, no surprises with coal. We'd expect what you're seeing in the public numbers, those volumes to continue through the rest of the year. That's why I made a point to focus on if you look at that bulk line, doing everything we can to counter some of those challenges on the coal side with renewable fuels and with the grain network.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Wells Fargo.\nChris Wetherbee: Good morning, guys. I guess I just maybe wanted to understand a little bit about how you think about the intermodal outlook and maybe how that influences that comment around the fourth quarter. So we came off of what has been a remarkable sort of preloaded peak season potentially in the third quarter, particularly for international. Do you see the mix start to change a little bit, but maybe sort of work that into a little bit of the drivers of that consistency in the fourth quarter? It would be helpful.\nJennifer Hamann: Yes. I'll start with that, Chris, and then Kenny can weigh in relative to the volume. I mean, we believe the mix pressures are going to continue into the fourth quarter. You also see just kind of that normal seasonality. You have a little bit lower volume, you've got the holidays, tend to have a little bit of weather. There's those things. The other thing that I think folks need to pay attention to is fuel on a year-over-year basis and even sequentially, because you have a much different dynamic from fuel. We think our fuel surcharge is probably going to be $200 million or so less in the fourth quarter. And when you're looking at how it contributed positively in the third quarter and as a drag on fourth quarter, there's a lot of puts and takes there that I think you need to pay attention to that, I think help maybe fill in some of those blanks as well as just the mix impact. Kenny?\nKenny Rocker: Yes. On a year-over-year basis, I think we could expect international intermodal to be elevated. Although, as we go throughout the quarter and you can see that in some of the numbers now, you're seeing it start to step down a little bit. One of the things that I just want to highlight again is the preparedness for the team to be able to accept and anticipate that 33% increase. And so, we're very encouraged by that.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets.\nWalter Spracklin: Yes, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Jim, in your prepared remarks, you kind of alluded to margins that perhaps weren't what you were hoping. Is that to say that kind of the prior margin improvement that you achieved in your first few years ago is not possible in the current environment or is it just taking longer? And I think, I'm just curious whether your mention of an industry-leading OR. Do you think that that is in effect for next year? In other words, can you have an industry-leading OR as early as next year?\nJim Vena: I think we have an industry leading OR for the last number of quarters including this one. I think we're the last ones to report and I'm pretty safe to say that. Walter, let's back up a little bit. People are in different positions of where and what we started. I remember back in 2019 where I joined, we parked 1,000 plus locomotives closer to 1,500. We adjusted the number of people that took to operate the railroad and those were big changes and we did those already. I think I was here and then I went on sabbatical and now I'm back. And am I done? Absolutely not. But, it's a lot different place to start where I came back 13, 14 months ago, than it was if I would have come, if we were in the same situation as 2019. We will be the best margin operating ratio company this year and I don't see any reason for us not to continue that and we will look at ways. Now inflationary pressure and I said it from the very first call I was on is, it's not going to be an easy one to get over. We are pushing price, but also being cognizant that we only get, the customers have to see value in that. They have to understand that we're giving them a product that allows them to win in the marketplace. And we've done that with the revenue coming in and pricing higher than what inflation is. So what I see is exactly what we laid out in our Investor Day. We see EPS growth high single-digits to low double-digits. We have the opportunity with the cash that we're providing that if we don't come up with another use for that we can buy back $4 billion to $5 billion versus shares. And we are absolutely online to set operating ratio improvement at the Union Pacific. So that's the way I see it Walter. Hopefully I answered your question.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs.\nUnidentified Analyst : Good morning. This is Andre on for Jordan. Thanks for taking my question. With headcount down 5% year-over-year and carload growth up nicely at 6%, you achieved strong incremental margins in the quarter both year-over-year and sequentially. Could you just talk a little bit more about the productivity opportunity set that you guys are taking and the actions there and how that sets up for 2025, incremental if industrial production can actually accelerate from here?\nEric Gehringer : Absolutely, Andre. Let's start by level-setting on what we did. So you start thinking about locomotive dwell. In my prepared comments, I talked about we've tied the best quarterly results that we've ever had before. Workforce productivity 12% monthly and quarterly record. TrainLink September best month ever in the history of Union Pacific and certainly a quarterly record in 2Q. But as we look at that, productivity is not new for us. Since 2019, we've driven approximately $1.4 billion in productivity and you're going to see us continue to find opportunities. We work on it every single day. Let's talk about what some of those are. When I start talking about workforce, I always break it down for my team, it's fundamentals, it's agreements, it's technology. On the fundamentals, I still see opportunities for us to be able to improve our recur rate. We've done improvement. There's still more opportunity there. When you look at the number of people that we use in our yard and local, you heard Jim talk about the inflationary pressures of a 4% wage increase to start the year and a 4.5% at July 1st. Yet, if you look at our wages that we're paying, we've actually been able to offset some of that inflation through productivity. That's technology, that's process. You're going to continue to see us do that. Fuel is going to still be a big opportunity for us. Whether you're talking about process or whether you're talking about technology, it's a huge expense for us and it's one we got to continue to work through. Our work with EMS, which is Energy Management, our work on how we think about filling our locomotives, where do we fill the most locomotives at the lowest cost, we've driven that compliance now north of 90%, where we started the year significantly lower. That's still an opportunity for us. I'll tell you the list goes on, and on, and on. When I say we work on it every day, I really mean that. It's safety, it's service, it's productivity.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein.\nDavid Vernon: Hi. Thanks for the time. Eric, I had a question for you on the intermodal train speeds. The data we're looking at from the outside looking in, those numbers are trending kind of as low as they've been. We've seen some issues on dwell at the West Coast ports as well. How do I reconcile some of those external data points with the performance that you guys are driving in the results today in terms of talking about the best ever TrainLink, best ever improvements in intermodal customer service? I'm just trying to square that circle, because it's come up in a couple of client conversations.\nEric Gehringer: Yes. Thank you for the question, David. Here's how I reconcile it. It tells you that 220 is not as good as we can be, because to your point, we've seen dramatic improvements in both the manifest and bulk side and we've seen improvements on some lanes in intermodal, we've continued to work to be able to improve that. Now let's be really frank, 33% increase in international intermodal without much advance notice, if any advance notice, I'm very proud of what the team has accomplished to be able to handle that. Now what do we have to continue to do to build back that intermodal speed that you're talking about? Well, it's the things we're doing right now. So when we talk about deploying our buffer resources, that's taken the form of locomotives and cars into the LA Basin. We've staged our trains across the system, so that we take every train, excuse me, every car that we can into the ports and we take every car that they can give us back. We work closely with the CSX and the NS to ensure that our interchange points remain fluid. These are the things we need to continue to execute, as we continue to capture that volume and I expect in short order that, that intermodal speed will turn the other way and that will continue to add on top of the excellent performance we have already.\nJim Vena: David, I need to sort of add on a little bit from what Eric said. I followed up with both LA and Long Beach Board here earlier this week and we both came to the same conclusion. No one told us first or second quarter that we were going to see a 33% increase and it was an event that happened because of East Coast ports issues, the Canadian issues. The big question is, how did we handle it, and you know that when something happens that is thrown on you, you start moving intermodal equipment and you don't get the same speed and you don't get the same velocity and we knew we were not going to be able to maintain that. But let's see where the success is or failure by the supply chain. Ships are not being held out at LA and Long Beach. They are arriving and going on the way they normally do with that kind of increase in business. As far as the fluidity of our terminals, we're in great shape. We've been able to turn the containers and the customers have done a fantastic job of pulling those containers off and delivering. The only place that we'd love it, if we have been able to plan it is, we'd have faster velocity if we could have been told that, it was coming and seen it a little sooner so we could place cars in the right place, work on the terminals we have at the West Coast a little differently and be able to speed it up. I'm very proud. I think the customers have seen what LA and Long Beach can do and I think that they it will be part of their decision making as they move ahead to say can LA and Long Beach handle an increase of business and I think it can and we've proven that point. It's a heck of a success story for us. I love the story. I love that you look at our metrics real good, and I'm sure that you've seen that, we're running over 220 miles per day for our cars and that's what's really important to us as we keep the place fluid. Thank you very much. Great question, David.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS.\nMike Triano : Hi, Jim. This is Mike Triano on for Tom. If we look at workforce productivity and locomotive productivity, they're both up mid-single-digits through September and they've been a driver of OR improvement this year despite the volume and the mix headwinds. If we look out to next year, the volume backdrop is still kind of murky, but volumes are kind of flat to up. Do you think you can get another mid-single-digits improvement in those productivity metrics?\nJim Vena: We're sticking to our guidance for next year, which I think that's it. We've set it out, we thought about it. It's very, very definitive about what we want to deliver next year. So unless the economy implodes in the United States, we're very comfortable that it's that we're going to be able to deliver that. So I'm very proud of when you get that kind of productivity number that we delivered this last quarter and we don't see any reason for us not to be able to take a look at what we're doing on the railroad to continue to improve productivity. We know that, we're carrying extra people, because of some of the collective agreements that we still have to implement from the last round. We're being very prudent on that side, but you could see on the non-operating side, what we've been able to do to still operate the railroad in a very efficient manner. We do that every day, take a look at it and I'm very comfortable that we're headed the right way. Jennifer, anything to add?\nJennifer Hamann: No. I just would reiterate and it's really kind of what Eric talked about too. When we look at all the areas of expense and on the capital side, we have areas to improve our productivity and we have action plans against that for the rest of this year and going into 2025 and beyond. That's what really gives us the confidence to say, there's certainly great runway ahead of us and we're very confident in our ability to perform.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Daniel Imbro with Stephens.\nDaniel Imbro: Yes. Hi, good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe wanted to ask a broader one, just from a competitive standpoint, I know it's hard to know, but your Western peers have been more vocal, but wanted to improve it. I'm curious if you're noticing anything different when you're out there bidding on business or going head-to-head with them in the market. And then, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned merchandise pricing was positive. Just curious how you're seeing core merchandise pricing out there in the market, if it's changing at all? Thanks.\nKenny Rocker: If you look at the size of the pie, we're really competing against truck. We're putting together a service product to go out there and compete against truck, against sourcing, to a lesser degree against barge. So we're doing what we can do to go out there and grow and win share and focus on Union Pacific and what we can control. That's that. The second part of your question, look, I'm proud of the team to be able to go out and lead with the capital investments that we put into the network for our customers, to lead with the inflationary pressures that we can have, the buffer resource that Jim and Eric talked about, and now we talked a little bit about the velocity. We tie it all to the service and we're aligning those pricing with the service product that's there. So, yes, the team has been able to go out there and secure some strong pricing on that merchandise business of the freight.\nJim Vena: Kenny, the only thing I would add is this and I think it's a valid point to make. I want the entire industry to operate very efficiently. I want the entire industry to be able to operate in a manner that allows us all to grow. We interchange a lot of traffic not quite 50%, but around 40% touches another railroad, whether it's a short line or one of the other railroads in the United States. The more we can all be efficient, when we interchange traffic, when we move it across the Mississippi, when we move it with our Western competitor. We love to compete, but there's a lot of traffic, if we're both efficient on, we get to be able to move that from other modes of transportation. Now I've worked with people, if I was smiling last night when I was thinking about this, how many people that I've worked with that are at other railroads, whether it's CPKC now even Burlington Northern Santa Fe, whether it's CSX or whether it's Norfolk Southern. So we come from a culture all of us that have worked together that we operate railroads in an efficient manner and we move ahead so that we want all of us want growth. I'm not speaking for the rest of them, I'm speaking for us at Union Pacific. Now given all that, listen, I can control what we do, not what everybody else does. I'm very comfortable with where we are and what we can do in the kind of business mix that we have. And you could see at this last quarter and what we've been able to deliver and what we see moving forward. I'm excited. I think the industry is in a better place now than it was 10 years ago and 5 years ago, and I'm sure better than we were in 2022. It's a wonderful place to be and we'll even continue to get better. That little competition with all the people you know is the best thing you can have. Nothing better than beating all the people that you know and that's what we want to do.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI.\nJon Chappell: Good morning, Jim. Kenny, I was going to ask this anyway, maybe a pretty well-timed follow-up to the last one. So the arc up 5% in both bulk and industrial obviously points to your pricing. Jim says that, customers have to see value in the service and you're seeing that. But with inflation conceptually coming down a little bit, the volume headwinds remaining, to keep that type of pricing momentum despite the good service, do you need a little bit of help from the volume side, from the macro, from demand to continue to push price or at a certain point is that kind of cap out without getting some volume tailwind?\nKenny Rocker: Yes. The macro is the macro, and those are things that are out of our control, Jon. We focus on the network. We focus on the service that Eric is providing us, the investments we're making, and we link that to the value of the pricing. We're very crystal clear in how we articulate to our customers. The way we look at it, we see it as something that will definitely continue to happen.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Jim, maybe just to come back to the one of the initial comments you had earlier here, and then also something you said when you first came on board. Just to take a little while to get over the labor challenges that you sort of inherited on the network. Obviously, we've seen mix in coal not help and then just the broader inflationary trend. Maybe just to help level set things a little bit, you said it's going to take a while. Can you offer any sort of context in terms of what the timing should be, if it's going to be gradual or if there's some step change that we could be thinking of, as we look more broadly to getting over some of these hurdles and probably to a better place than what you started off with?\nJim Vena: Brian, thanks for the question. If we -- I don't like to look backwards too much, but I think we've done a great job at Union Pacific, all 30,000 of us, to be able to deliver where we are comparatively to everybody else. Now growth is real important to us and we've done a great job of providing service at a high level. Remember service is what we sold the customer not other measures that are out there to talk about what service is, is we measure individually to every one of our customers about what level of service that we sold them. We put that in the mix and we had inflationary pressure. That's why we are very clear on what our three year expectation is, Brian, of what our results should be and what we think we can deliver. I'm very comfortable where we are and I think we'll see improvements in our operating ratio. We'll see improvements over time over our net income and improvements in our EPS that drives value for our shareholders. Very comfortable. This was always at the very start, I said it was going to be a couple of years. It's still a couple of years. It was not going to be easy and it's not easy to get to overcome some of the things. But I think we've done a good job with pricing growth and coal. Coal is coal, like coal is down 20%. At the end of the day, if it wasn't down 20%, but that's not the way I look at the world. There's always challenges. If there was no challenges, then I would have stayed retired and enjoyed myself in Scottsdale, Arizona this morning going for a hike to Camelback. I'm here because I think there's something to do and we can get this company moving forward. I'm very excited, Brian. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Ben Nolan with Stifel.\nBen Nolan: Thanks a lot. The service performance index for both intermodal and manifest has been trending up higher. I'm just curious, if you think there's a point where if you arrive at a certain level or if at a certain range where you can really lean more heavily into pricing than maybe you already have or and maybe also just share gains versus competitors, or versus trucking, is that -- is there like a magic number or at least a magic range where you feel like really you have a strong or much stronger competitive advantage?\nKenny Rocker: Yes. Jim hit it a little bit earlier and what do we sell to our customers, and how do we translate that into pricing and those discussions. No. There's not a magical number. But clearly, as the service improves, that gives us a better environment to maximize price. Same is true on growth, more consistent, reliable product and better service product. We go in and we ask for more business when we're talking to customers. We ask to look at their truck files. We ask to look at talk to more of their receivers. Clearly, as we improve and we've done a great job here in the third quarter on the service product. It creates our own capacity. It creates our own opportunities regardless of what happens in the macro environment.\nBen Nolan: Do you think you're there now? Just, as a follow-up.\nKenny Rocker: I hope not. I mean, we always want to improve as a management team. So no, we're going to always strive to improve. There's no time where we're going to yell out we arrived.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.\nEric Morgan : Hi, good morning. This is Eric Morgan on for Brandon. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to come back to the mix discussion in the fourth quarter. I think you mentioned mix headwinds continuing in the quarter, maybe with some international intermodal volume growth moderating somewhat. But, can you just talk about some of the mix effects from other commodity groups outside of intermodal? In particular, maybe how you view margin contribution from coal would be helpful, I think.\nJennifer Hamann: I'm going to pass on that last part of your question. But, if you just look at our business teams, industrial is the group that has our highest average revenue per car, has very strong contributions to our bottom line, and that business has been down all year. Now, there's always mix within mix, but with the continued pressures in the industrial economy and the continued outlook that those volumes are down year-over-year, that's an impact and that certainly contributes to the mix, in addition to obviously seeing the growth come in some of the lower average revenue per car, kinds of businesses like the international intermodal. On the Bulk side, yes, there's coal, set that aside. Grain, strong grain into Mexico, which is great for us. We really enjoy that business. That's a little bit shorter length of haul than if we're taking it to export out through the West Coast. Again, you have some of that what I'll call mix within mix. Kenny, I don't know if you want to add anything else?\nKenny Rocker: Yes. I just want to say we're not going to apologize for accepting the increase. Yes. We'd love the 33% increase. What I'd tell you is that, the management team here did a good job of preparing for it. That's what we did with Phoenix to take trucks off the road, what we did to expand Inland Empire. All these things set us up for success for this unexpected amount of volume that's come on.\nJennifer Hamann: That's really why it's so important goes back to Jim's point on the fundamentals. That's why we need to be just diligent about how we're using our resources, our workforce productivity and how we run this railroad, so that we can absorb shocks from mix and still produce a very good quarterly result.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Stephanie Moore with Jefferies.\nStephanie Moore: You talked a lot about the strength in export grain to Mexico, but can you also talk a little bit more broadly about your Mexico business? How do you see that going forward? And any thoughts on geopolitical and administration changes as well would be helpful.\nKenny Rocker: Yes. First of all, I just want to step back as we're talking about our grain business and our grain network and differentiate renewable fuels and the actual facilities that we've landed there that we've discussed. The same thing with our grain network, the facilities, meaning the 20-plus facilities that have come on and the fact that Cherryvale Kansas facility will help supply grain into Mexico. So let me just kind of break that apart to let you know how we look at it. But then, yes, broadly, as we look at Mexico, Clearly, there's a lot of opportunity with over-the-road trucks. There are some markets like finished vehicles and also auto parts. We have a strong service product coming out there. What differentiates us, Stephanie is, again, the fact that we have multiple partners that can get in that market. We have our own rail box that we can get into that market. And we have daily service into and out of Mexico, which we know we're the only one that has that. So clearly, again, a strong growth area for us. We laid it out in Investor Day. And as far as the administration, we see that it's an environment that they're going to be certainly pro-business and support the freight environment, so we're excited about that.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\nScott Group: Jennifer, any color on that comp for employees up 8% and how to think about that going forward? And then I know someone else asked already about like what that sort of flat Q4 comment made. But I just -- I guess I'm not sure if that was -- still not sure if that was an earnings or margin or revenue comment. So I don't know any color?\nJennifer Hamann: Okay, Scott. So we'll start with the comp for employees. So if you look at the 8% increase, call it, rough numbers, half of that was from the July 1 wage increase. The other half is a combination of higher incentive comp year-over-year as well as higher guarantee payments. That's really associated with the work rest agreements as we've cut over more hubs through the year and also graduated more TE&Y employees from training. So those are all the drivers that we see in there. And for 4Q, it's probably going to look pretty similar, maybe even up a little bit more as we continue to carry some of the extra resources support the implementation of the work rest. And so that's really why you've heard us stress the productivity piece today because we do have inflationary pressures, and that's why that workforce productivity is just absolutely critical for us as well as how we're approaching labor going forward and making sure that we are getting good agreements in place that can help us serve our customers in a very efficient manner while compensating our employees fairly. Going back to your other question about the consistent -- we said results. That's a fairly all-encompassing words. So you could call that any number of measures. But you know what the key ones are that you all look at EPS, operating ratio, operating income, we think it's going to look very similar in 4Q versus 3Q.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Elliot Alper with TD Cowen.\nElliot Alper: This is Elliott on for Jason Seidl. I believe this is the first quarter this year where your domestic intermodal volume outlook is positive. Can you talk about what you're seeing in the domestic intermodal market in Q4? And I know you already talked about kind of the mix headwinds in international growth and fuel, but we see domestic intermodal growing into the quarter. Could that maybe partially offset intermodal rev per car in Q4? Just trying to gauge the magnitude.\nKenny Rocker: So we've been encouraged on the domestic intermodal front, even as late as the second quarter, we saw that line be positive. It's been positive in the third quarter. Now some of that has benefited from the international in a most side. And that's why I keep harping on these products that we have, having a product like Inland Empire helps us capture some of that domestic intermodal, and we've seen some strong demand there. I'll tell you as it looks at -- we look at it for the fourth quarter. Again, we think we'll see a little bit more of a benefit for what's taking place on the international intermodal side, and we'll see what happens as we continue throughout the quarter.\nOperator: Our final question is from the line of Ariel Rosa with Citigroup.\nAriel Rosa: I just wanted to -- I know some other people have spoken about this already, but I wanted to ask about is the target to price above rail inflation. Could you give us color, just to be clear, is that something that's being achieved currently and that we can expect for 2024? And then kind of given the looser capacity environment, would you say that you've kind of gotten more pushback from customers as you have those pricing discussions? Or do you think service is sufficient currently to kind of compensate for whatever the loose truck environment might be doing or the kind of the softer demand environment might be?\nJim Vena: Ari, good question. Kenny?\nKenny Rocker: Yes. So I think you're talking specifically and only about domestic intermodal, you'll have to clear it up, if you can. We've got -- and we've talked about this, we've got price mechanisms for our customers that are in place to keep them competitive. Again, I talked to you about the fact that second quarter, third quarter, we were up in domestic intermodal. So we look at that as a positive outcome for us. We've gone from a trucking environment really since 2022, that's really been stagnant to downward and it's flattish now. We'll see what happens in the next few months, but we feel good about where we're positioned and the ability as it capacity tightens, we're going to see more value on the pricing side. .\nJim Vena: Jennifer, do you want to talk about the inflation.\nJennifer Hamann: Absolutely. So to that point, in terms of your question, absolutely, our pricing dollars today are exceeding our inflation dollars, and they have throughout this inflationary period, whether you're talking about 2024, you've been going back 2023, 2022. We have been committed to that and we have achieved that. I think the important point really is going forward, and we talked about this at Investor Day, is that not only will we continue to have our price dollars exceed our inflation dollars that it will become accretive to our margins next year. So I feel very bullish on that front.\nJim Vena: Ari, good question. Why don't I just wrap it up real quick and then looking-forward to the call in 3 months and looking-forward to finishing off this year just the way we set it up and also delivering on what we said last year? If we look at what we've been able to deliver as a team, 10% increase in earnings per share, 11% up in operating income, 9% up in net income, productivity, up 12%. Those are all numbers that make us very comfortable of how we are operating the railroad and how we're driving business. We think that if we get the service level, and it's very close to where we are right now to the right level, then the discussion is how do we work together with our customers to win in the marketplace and not worried about what the -- whether the service is holding them back from winning in the marketplace. So with that, let me just close off by thanking everybody for joining us this morning. I know there was competing calls, and nice to have you guys all with us this morning and looking-forward to more discussions as we move ahead. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Thank you, Kenny, and good morning. Moving to Slide 12. As I mentioned at our Investor Day in September, we always believe there's a better way to do things, even the things we're doing well today. And that culture has manifested itself in our results, as we continue to make great progress in our safety, service performance and efficiency metrics. Starting with safety. We remain intensely focused on our four pillar strategy to prevent injuries and drive down derailments. As a result, year-to-date both derailment and personal injury rates improved year-over-year. While we are not there yet, we are clearly on the path to become the safest railroad. Freight car velocity improved 5% to 210 miles per day compared to third quarter 2023. Additionally, throughout the last several weeks, we have maintained a freight car velocity near 220 miles per day. A favorable business mix coupled with continued improvements in terminal dwell has driven the performance. Notably, we achieved a third quarter record in terminal dwell, a 5% improvement versus last year. Intermodal and Manifest Service Performance Index saw a 1 and 5 point improvement year-over-year respectively. As demonstrated by our results, the team took quick action throughout the quarter to deploy buffer resources and adjust trip plans minimizing the impact of a 33% surge in international intermodal shipments. These swift actions not only allowed us to effectively absorb the increased volumes, but also mitigated the impact on our broader network. Now let's review our key efficiency metrics on Slide 13. In addition to our service product, the team remains hyper-focused on driving productivity throughout the network. The more productive we are, the better we put ourselves in a position to compete and you can see we did that in the third quarter. Locomotive productivity improved 5%, compared to third quarter 2023. While increased fluidity of the network has enabled our performance, the team also continued its focus on reducing locomotive dwell. In fact, this quarter our locomotive dwell results tied for the best ever quarterly performance, a 5% year-over-year improvement. Workforce productivity, which includes all employees, improved 12% versus 2023. Impressively, both the month of September and the third quarter marked all-time records for their respective periods. Our continued work to leverage technology and automate operations across our transportation, mechanical and engineering team is paying dividends. Not only is it driving efficiencies, but it's also improving the safety of how we work. Train length was flat for the third quarter. After experiencing the impacts of Hurricane Beryl in July, we've made steady sequential improvement throughout the quarter and ended September with a monthly record over 9,600 feet. These improvements are a direct result of targeted transportation plan changes and capital investments, such as siding extensions and technology. While we have made great strides this year to improve train length, there are still opportunities to safely improve, as we strive to generate mainline capacity for current and future growth. To wrap up, great work by the team, as they efficiently leverage our buffer resources to handle the influx in volumes. However, as I opened with, there is always opportunity to get better and I'm confident the team will continue pushing in our pursuit of industry leading safety, service and operational excellence. Jim? Absolutely, Andre. Let's start by level-setting on what we did. So you start thinking about locomotive dwell. In my prepared comments, I talked about we've tied the best quarterly results that we've ever had before. Workforce productivity 12% monthly and quarterly record. TrainLink September best month ever in the history of Union Pacific and certainly a quarterly record in 2Q. But as we look at that, productivity is not new for us. Since 2019, we've driven approximately $1.4 billion in productivity and you're going to see us continue to find opportunities. We work on it every single day. Let's talk about what some of those are. When I start talking about workforce, I always break it down for my team, it's fundamentals, it's agreements, it's technology. On the fundamentals, I still see opportunities for us to be able to improve our recur rate. We've done improvement. There's still more opportunity there. When you look at the number of people that we use in our yard and local, you heard Jim talk about the inflationary pressures of a 4% wage increase to start the year and a 4.5% at July 1st. Yet, if you look at our wages that we're paying, we've actually been able to offset some of that inflation through productivity. That's technology, that's process. You're going to continue to see us do that. Fuel is going to still be a big opportunity for us. Whether you're talking about process or whether you're talking about technology, it's a huge expense for us and it's one we got to continue to work through. Our work with EMS, which is Energy Management, our work on how we think about filling our locomotives, where do we fill the most locomotives at the lowest cost, we've driven that compliance now north of 90%, where we started the year significantly lower. That's still an opportunity for us. I'll tell you the list goes on, and on, and on. When I say we work on it every day, I really mean that. It's safety, it's service, it's productivity. Yes. Thank you for the question, David. Here's how I reconcile it. It tells you that 220 is not as good as we can be, because to your point, we've seen dramatic improvements in both the manifest and bulk side and we've seen improvements on some lanes in intermodal, we've continued to work to be able to improve that. Now let's be really frank, 33% increase in international intermodal without much advance notice, if any advance notice, I'm very proud of what the team has accomplished to be able to handle that. Now what do we have to continue to do to build back that intermodal speed that you're talking about? Well, it's the things we're doing right now. So when we talk about deploying our buffer resources, that's taken the form of locomotives and cars into the LA Basin. We've staged our trains across the system, so that we take every train, excuse me, every car that we can into the ports and we take every car that they can give us back. We work closely with the CSX and the NS to ensure that our interchange points remain fluid. These are the things we need to continue to execute, as we continue to capture that volume and I expect in short order that, that intermodal speed will turn the other way and that will continue to add on top of the excellent performance we have already."

            "name": "Jim Vena",
            "content": "Good morning, Rob, beautiful morning in Omaha, nice fall day. So good morning, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Union Pacific's third quarter results. I'm joined in Omaha, by our Chief Financial Officer, Jennifer Hamann, our Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Kenny Rocker, and our Executive Vice President of Operations, Eric Gehringer. As you'll hear from the team, our third quarter results do an excellent job of capturing the progress we've made under our strategy to lead the industry in safety, service and operational excellence. And you're seeing how that leads to financial success. I'm very pleased with where we sit today compared to where we started a little over a year ago. Now let's discuss third quarter results, starting on Slide number 3. This morning, Union Pacific reported 2024 third quarter net income of $1.7 billion, a 9% improvement and earnings per share of $2.75, a 10% improvement. Third quarter operating revenue gained 3% of strong volumes and core pricing gains were impacted by our business mix and less fuel surcharge revenue. Excluding fuel, freight revenue increased 5% versus 2023. Reported expenses year-over-year improved 2%, while fuel prices were a driver. The team did an excellent job generating productivity to control costs as we successfully handled a 6% increase in volume. Our third quarter operating ratio of 60.3% improved 310 basis points versus last year, further demonstrating our ability to be operationally excellent while maintaining a resource buffer to handle unforeseen events. Look, it was another really good quarter. I'm pleased with how we flex to handle the 33% increase in international intermodal volume during the quarter, while improving service metrics across our network. And yes, that mix of business pressured margins a bit. But at the end of the day, it's about operating as efficiently as possible to drive increases in net income and free cash flow. And as Jennifer will walk you through, we did an excellent job of delivering in those areas. It's another proof point that our strategy is working. I'll let the team walk you through the quarter in more detail and then come back for a wrap up before we go to question and answers. So we'll start with the third quarter financials. Jennifer, over to you. Thank you, Eric. Turning to Slide 15. Before we get to your questions, I'd like to quickly summarize, what you've heard from our team. First, as you heard from Jennifer, we did a great job of adding volume to our network in an efficient manner. And given the margin profile of that volume, it was imperative that we did so. We also continue to generate strong pricing that reflects the value we're creating for our customers. Again imperative to mitigate the mix dynamic in the quarter. Kenny gave an overview of third quarter volumes and laid out thoughts for the remainder of the year. The team is making no excuses and going after every available carload. While international intermodal gets a lot of attention these days, there are plenty of additional markets, where the team is winning to bring new customers to the railroad over the short-term and long-term. Lastly, Eric updated our progress to improve safety service and operational excellence. Year-to-date our safety metrics continue to show great improvement, but they're just the initial steps toward being industry-leading. On the service front, the operating team did a great job of improving service, while we handled more business. That was possible due to the efficiency of our network and our ability to maximize asset utilization. While the business of railroading can be unpredictable, it's the fundamentals of how you operate the company anticipating and reacting to change that ultimately matters. I said it earlier and I'll say it again, I'm very pleased with where we sit today. When I joined the company, I said, we had pressures that were going to take us a couple of years to get by some of the inflationary pressures. But, as you heard at our Investor Day last month, we have the right team and the right strategy to make take this company to new heights. This is just the beginning of the journey. So with that, we're excited, we're ready and we're ready to take your questions. Rob? I think we have an industry leading OR for the last number of quarters including this one. I think we're the last ones to report and I'm pretty safe to say that. Walter, let's back up a little bit. People are in different positions of where and what we started. I remember back in 2019 where I joined, we parked 1,000 plus locomotives closer to 1,500. We adjusted the number of people that took to operate the railroad and those were big changes and we did those already. I think I was here and then I went on sabbatical and now I'm back. And am I done? Absolutely not. But, it's a lot different place to start where I came back 13, 14 months ago, than it was if I would have come, if we were in the same situation as 2019. We will be the best margin operating ratio company this year and I don't see any reason for us not to continue that and we will look at ways. Now inflationary pressure and I said it from the very first call I was on is, it's not going to be an easy one to get over. We are pushing price, but also being cognizant that we only get, the customers have to see value in that. They have to understand that we're giving them a product that allows them to win in the marketplace. And we've done that with the revenue coming in and pricing higher than what inflation is. So what I see is exactly what we laid out in our Investor Day. We see EPS growth high single-digits to low double-digits. We have the opportunity with the cash that we're providing that if we don't come up with another use for that we can buy back $4 billion to $5 billion versus shares. And we are absolutely online to set operating ratio improvement at the Union Pacific. So that's the way I see it Walter. Hopefully I answered your question. David, I need to sort of add on a little bit from what Eric said. I followed up with both LA and Long Beach Board here earlier this week and we both came to the same conclusion. No one told us first or second quarter that we were going to see a 33% increase and it was an event that happened because of East Coast ports issues, the Canadian issues. The big question is, how did we handle it, and you know that when something happens that is thrown on you, you start moving intermodal equipment and you don't get the same speed and you don't get the same velocity and we knew we were not going to be able to maintain that. But let's see where the success is or failure by the supply chain. Ships are not being held out at LA and Long Beach. They are arriving and going on the way they normally do with that kind of increase in business. As far as the fluidity of our terminals, we're in great shape. We've been able to turn the containers and the customers have done a fantastic job of pulling those containers off and delivering. The only place that we'd love it, if we have been able to plan it is, we'd have faster velocity if we could have been told that, it was coming and seen it a little sooner so we could place cars in the right place, work on the terminals we have at the West Coast a little differently and be able to speed it up. I'm very proud. I think the customers have seen what LA and Long Beach can do and I think that they it will be part of their decision making as they move ahead to say can LA and Long Beach handle an increase of business and I think it can and we've proven that point. It's a heck of a success story for us. I love the story. I love that you look at our metrics real good, and I'm sure that you've seen that, we're running over 220 miles per day for our cars and that's what's really important to us as we keep the place fluid. Thank you very much. Great question, David. We're sticking to our guidance for next year, which I think that's it. We've set it out, we thought about it. It's very, very definitive about what we want to deliver next year. So unless the economy implodes in the United States, we're very comfortable that it's that we're going to be able to deliver that. So I'm very proud of when you get that kind of productivity number that we delivered this last quarter and we don't see any reason for us not to be able to take a look at what we're doing on the railroad to continue to improve productivity. We know that, we're carrying extra people, because of some of the collective agreements that we still have to implement from the last round. We're being very prudent on that side, but you could see on the non-operating side, what we've been able to do to still operate the railroad in a very efficient manner. We do that every day, take a look at it and I'm very comfortable that we're headed the right way. Jennifer, anything to add? Kenny, the only thing I would add is this and I think it's a valid point to make. I want the entire industry to operate very efficiently. I want the entire industry to be able to operate in a manner that allows us all to grow. We interchange a lot of traffic not quite 50%, but around 40% touches another railroad, whether it's a short line or one of the other railroads in the United States. The more we can all be efficient, when we interchange traffic, when we move it across the Mississippi, when we move it with our Western competitor. We love to compete, but there's a lot of traffic, if we're both efficient on, we get to be able to move that from other modes of transportation. Now I've worked with people, if I was smiling last night when I was thinking about this, how many people that I've worked with that are at other railroads, whether it's CPKC now even Burlington Northern Santa Fe, whether it's CSX or whether it's Norfolk Southern. So we come from a culture all of us that have worked together that we operate railroads in an efficient manner and we move ahead so that we want all of us want growth. I'm not speaking for the rest of them, I'm speaking for us at Union Pacific. Now given all that, listen, I can control what we do, not what everybody else does. I'm very comfortable with where we are and what we can do in the kind of business mix that we have. And you could see at this last quarter and what we've been able to deliver and what we see moving forward. I'm excited. I think the industry is in a better place now than it was 10 years ago and 5 years ago, and I'm sure better than we were in 2022. It's a wonderful place to be and we'll even continue to get better. That little competition with all the people you know is the best thing you can have. Nothing better than beating all the people that you know and that's what we want to do. Brian, thanks for the question. If we -- I don't like to look backwards too much, but I think we've done a great job at Union Pacific, all 30,000 of us, to be able to deliver where we are comparatively to everybody else. Now growth is real important to us and we've done a great job of providing service at a high level. Remember service is what we sold the customer not other measures that are out there to talk about what service is, is we measure individually to every one of our customers about what level of service that we sold them. We put that in the mix and we had inflationary pressure. That's why we are very clear on what our three year expectation is, Brian, of what our results should be and what we think we can deliver. I'm very comfortable where we are and I think we'll see improvements in our operating ratio. We'll see improvements over time over our net income and improvements in our EPS that drives value for our shareholders. Very comfortable. This was always at the very start, I said it was going to be a couple of years. It's still a couple of years. It was not going to be easy and it's not easy to get to overcome some of the things. But I think we've done a good job with pricing growth and coal. Coal is coal, like coal is down 20%. At the end of the day, if it wasn't down 20%, but that's not the way I look at the world. There's always challenges. If there was no challenges, then I would have stayed retired and enjoyed myself in Scottsdale, Arizona this morning going for a hike to Camelback. I'm here because I think there's something to do and we can get this company moving forward. I'm very excited, Brian. Thanks for the question. Ari, good question. Kenny? Jennifer, do you want to talk about the inflation. Ari, good question. Why don't I just wrap it up real quick and then looking-forward to the call in 3 months and looking-forward to finishing off this year just the way we set it up and also delivering on what we said last year? If we look at what we've been able to deliver as a team, 10% increase in earnings per share, 11% up in operating income, 9% up in net income, productivity, up 12%. Those are all numbers that make us very comfortable of how we are operating the railroad and how we're driving business. We think that if we get the service level, and it's very close to where we are right now to the right level, then the discussion is how do we work together with our customers to win in the marketplace and not worried about what the -- whether the service is holding them back from winning in the marketplace. So with that, let me just close off by thanking everybody for joining us this morning. I know there was competing calls, and nice to have you guys all with us this morning and looking-forward to more discussions as we move ahead. Thank you very much."

            "name": "Jennifer Hamann",
            "content": "Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Let's begin on Slide 5 with a walk down of our third quarter income statement, where operating revenue of $6.1 billion increased 3% versus 2023 on a 6% volume increase and third quarter freight revenue totaled $5.8 billion, up 4% compared to last year. Breaking down the freight revenue components, increased volume in the quarter added 550 basis points. Strong core pricing gains were more than offset by business mix, reducing freight revenue 75 basis points. As I mentioned at Investor Day, International Intermodal's average revenue per car is significantly lower than our system average. And lastly, fuel surcharge revenue of $635 million was flat versus last year as lower fuel prices impacted freight revenue 75 basis points. Wrapping up the top-line, other revenue declined $73 million or 18%, driven by several factors: lower access oils resulting from the second quarter intermodal equipment sales reduced demand for auto part shipments at our subsidiary, the ongoing transfer of metro operations and a onetime contract settlement of $12 million during the quarter all contributed to the decrease. As a reminder, there are cost savings across our expense lines associated with the ongoing revenue impact from the equipment sales and metro transfer. Switching then to expenses, third quarter operating expense of $3.7 billion improved 2%, driven by strong productivity and lower fuel prices that more than offset volume-related expenses. There are more details in the appendix, but let me highlight some of the performance drivers. Compensation and benefits expense increased 2% versus last year as wage inflation, including the July 1st, 4.5% increase and volume costs were partially offset by 5% lower workforce levels and record workforce productivity. Trained service employees were flat year-over-year, as we used our buffer resources to handle increased quarterly volume. All other workforce areas decreased 8%, reflecting our continued focus on operational excellence. Cost per employee in the third quarter increased 8% as a result of higher incentive compensation as well as additional wage inflation related to the work rest labor agreements. Purchased services and material expense improved 4% as cost to maintain a lower active locomotive fleet, and decreased subsidiary drayage expenses were partially offset by inflation and volume related expenses. Fuel expense in the quarter declined 13% on a 17% decrease in fuel prices from $3.12 to $2.60 per gallon. Our fuel consumption rate increased 1%, related to the significant growth in less fuel-efficient intermodal traffic, which offset our year-over-year productivity gains. Finally, other expense was better by 6%, reflecting the impact of write-offs in 2023 that more than offset inflation and volume costs. The result of solid revenue growth and strong cost control was third quarter operating income of $2.4 billion, up 11% versus 2023. Below the line, other income decreased $19 million from lower real estate income, while interest expense declined 6% or $20 million on lower average debt levels. Income tax expense increased 23%, driven by higher pre-tax income and state income tax reductions in 2023. Third quarter net income of $1.7 billion, increased 9% versus 2023, which when combined with a lower average share count resulted in double-digits earnings per share growth to $2.75. Our quarterly operating ratio of 60.3% improved 310 basis points year-over-year with nearly half of that coming from core operational improvement. As we discussed in Dallas at our Investor Day, operating ratio is an outcome of our strategy and not the goal. Our goal is to grow earnings and generate more cash for our shareholders, which we achieved even as our revenue growth and margins were impacted by mix. Looking now at cash, shareholder returns in the balance sheet on Slide 6. Year-to-date cash from operations totaled $6.7 billion, up $700 million versus last year. Our cash flow conversion rate improved to 83% and free cash flow has almost doubled versus 2023, up over $900 million. These improvements are driven by 2023 labor agreement payments and growth in operating income, partially offset by higher cash taxes. Year-to-date, our shareholders have received $3.2 billion through dividends and share repurchases, including third quarter repurchases of $738 million. Finally, our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio finished the quarter at 2.7x, as we maintain a strong balance sheet and remain A rated by our three credit rating agencies. So wrapping up on Slide 7, with just over two months left in the year, the majority of 2024 story has been written and it's been a good one. We are executing on the fundamentals of railroading, which is critical to achieving the full financial potential of this franchise. We are affirming our prior 2024 guidance, most importantly that we will continue to improve profitability through our strategy of safety, service and operational excellence. Pricing dollars will exceed our inflation dollars. We will purchase $1.5 billion of shares and invest roughly $3.4 billion of capital and our capital allocation strategy is unchanged. We also are going to put a slightly finer point on how we expect to close the year. At this time, we'd expect fourth quarter results to closely mirror the third quarter, while improving on a year-over-year basis. This level of performance will mark our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year gains, again demonstrating the positive results of our strategy. Throughout the year, we've shown our ability to pivot and flex to handle the various challenges of railroading, from weather of all types to the significant West Coast traffic spike, and we navigated them successfully, improving service, while maintaining cost discipline. We continue to generate strong pricing and productivity, positioning us well to finish 2024 with momentum and on a path to achieve the long-term targets we laid out last month. I'll now turn it over to Kenny to provide an update on the business environment. Kenny? I'll start with that then, Ken. Thanks for the question. Yes, I mean, when we say consistent, and we say results, we're being pretty broad there. But, yes, I mean, I think we see are the as we look at what's going to happen in the fourth quarter. We see the outcomes being very similar across all of those categories in terms of our fourth quarter results. So consistent is consistent. Yes. I'll start with that, Chris, and then Kenny can weigh in relative to the volume. I mean, we believe the mix pressures are going to continue into the fourth quarter. You also see just kind of that normal seasonality. You have a little bit lower volume, you've got the holidays, tend to have a little bit of weather. There's those things. The other thing that I think folks need to pay attention to is fuel on a year-over-year basis and even sequentially, because you have a much different dynamic from fuel. We think our fuel surcharge is probably going to be $200 million or so less in the fourth quarter. And when you're looking at how it contributed positively in the third quarter and as a drag on fourth quarter, there's a lot of puts and takes there that I think you need to pay attention to that, I think help maybe fill in some of those blanks as well as just the mix impact. Kenny? No. I just would reiterate and it's really kind of what Eric talked about too. When we look at all the areas of expense and on the capital side, we have areas to improve our productivity and we have action plans against that for the rest of this year and going into 2025 and beyond. That's what really gives us the confidence to say, there's certainly great runway ahead of us and we're very confident in our ability to perform. I'm going to pass on that last part of your question. But, if you just look at our business teams, industrial is the group that has our highest average revenue per car, has very strong contributions to our bottom line, and that business has been down all year. Now, there's always mix within mix, but with the continued pressures in the industrial economy and the continued outlook that those volumes are down year-over-year, that's an impact and that certainly contributes to the mix, in addition to obviously seeing the growth come in some of the lower average revenue per car, kinds of businesses like the international intermodal. On the Bulk side, yes, there's coal, set that aside. Grain, strong grain into Mexico, which is great for us. We really enjoy that business. That's a little bit shorter length of haul than if we're taking it to export out through the West Coast. Again, you have some of that what I'll call mix within mix. Kenny, I don't know if you want to add anything else? That's really why it's so important goes back to Jim's point on the fundamentals. That's why we need to be just diligent about how we're using our resources, our workforce productivity and how we run this railroad, so that we can absorb shocks from mix and still produce a very good quarterly result. Okay, Scott. So we'll start with the comp for employees. So if you look at the 8% increase, call it, rough numbers, half of that was from the July 1 wage increase. The other half is a combination of higher incentive comp year-over-year as well as higher guarantee payments. That's really associated with the work rest agreements as we've cut over more hubs through the year and also graduated more TE&Y employees from training. So those are all the drivers that we see in there. And for 4Q, it's probably going to look pretty similar, maybe even up a little bit more as we continue to carry some of the extra resources support the implementation of the work rest. And so that's really why you've heard us stress the productivity piece today because we do have inflationary pressures, and that's why that workforce productivity is just absolutely critical for us as well as how we're approaching labor going forward and making sure that we are getting good agreements in place that can help us serve our customers in a very efficient manner while compensating our employees fairly. Going back to your other question about the consistent -- we said results. That's a fairly all-encompassing words. So you could call that any number of measures. But you know what the key ones are that you all look at EPS, operating ratio, operating income, we think it's going to look very similar in 4Q versus 3Q. Absolutely. So to that point, in terms of your question, absolutely, our pricing dollars today are exceeding our inflation dollars, and they have throughout this inflationary period, whether you're talking about 2024, you've been going back 2023, 2022. We have been committed to that and we have achieved that. I think the important point really is going forward, and we talked about this at Investor Day, is that not only will we continue to have our price dollars exceed our inflation dollars that it will become accretive to our margins next year. So I feel very bullish on that front."

            "content": "Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning. As Jennifer mentioned, we had a solid third quarter. Freight revenues totaled $5.8 billion for the quarter, which was up 5%, excluding fuel surcharges, due to increased volume and strong core pricing gains. Let's jump right in and talk about the key drivers for each of our business groups. Starting with our Bulk segment, revenue for the quarter was up 2%, compared to last year on a 3% decrease in volume and a 5% increase in average revenue per car based on a positive mix in traffic and solid core pricing gains. Coal continued to face difficult market conditions in the quarter, resulting from reduced coal demand due to high inventory levels and competition from low natural gas prices. Grain products volumes increased for the quarter due to business development wins and new facilities supporting renewable diesel and associated byproducts, as we highlighted last month at our Investor Day. Lastly, export grain business was up for the quarter, primarily driven by corn and wheat. We continue to win business moving to Mexico, as their domestic consumption outpaces production. Moving to Industrial. Revenue for the quarter was up 3% for the quarter, on a 2% decrease in volume. Average revenue per car increased by 5% due to strong core pricing gains and a positive mix in traffic. Petroleum shipments increased for the quarter due to strong business development efforts in various markets like asphalt and lube oil. Petrochemicals volumes continued to grow due to domestic demand in plastics and new business wins in our industrial chemicals market. However, those gains were more than offset by the softer demand for rock against last year's record shipment. Premium revenue for the quarter was up 7% on a 14% increase in volume and a 6% decrease in average revenue per car, reflecting increased international intermodal shipments, lower fuel surcharges and truck market pressures. Automotive volumes were down due to unplanned production adjustments, partially offset by business wins with Volkswagen and General Motors. Intermodal volumes continue to remain strong. Our international intermodal volume was up 33%, significantly outpacing growth seen in West Coast imports. Import strength also drove increased domestic volume, which we were able to capitalize on due to our diverse IMC network. Now turning to Slide 10. Here is our outlook for the balance of 2024 for the key markets we serve. Starting with Bulk. Coal is expected to remain challenged, as inventories remain high, and we see competition from low natural gas prices. Moving to Grain. We are optimistic due to a strong supply in UP's franchise areas, and we have secured additional new facilities that will ensure domestic growth, generating long-term ratable grain demand. We expect ongoing strength in the Mexico export market as the UP continues to increase its share south of the border. Additionally, we expect continued growth in the grain products tied to renewable fuels and their associated feedstocks. The team is focused on capturing business as production continues to ramp up at new facilities brought online, such as Bartlett's crush facility in Cherryvale, Kansas. Turning to Industrial. As we mentioned earlier, we expect the rock market will not match last year's record volume. For petroleum, we have tougher comps but are building on our success with business development. Petrochemicals is expected to outperform the market, based on the strength of our Gulf Coast franchise, and we are excited to see incremental volume from Shintech's expansion at Plaquemines, Louisiana. And wrapping up with Premium. On the intermodal side, the surge of West Coast import volumes will continue to drive for both our international and domestic markets for the remainder of the year. In Automotive, we are seeing softness in the market, which will be partially offset by business development wins. In summary, I'm proud of the commercial team. We're going to see the strongest volume year since 2029. Our diverse portfolio allows us to see positive momentum, and our resource buffer puts us in a great position to manage increased volumes on the West Coast. The team is focused on our key growth markets, collaborating with our customers and the operating team to find innovative solutions to grow and win together. With that, I'll turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance. Yes. On the coal side, no surprises with coal. We'd expect what you're seeing in the public numbers, those volumes to continue through the rest of the year. That's why I made a point to focus on if you look at that bulk line, doing everything we can to counter some of those challenges on the coal side with renewable fuels and with the grain network. Yes. On a year-over-year basis, I think we could expect international intermodal to be elevated. Although, as we go throughout the quarter and you can see that in some of the numbers now, you're seeing it start to step down a little bit. One of the things that I just want to highlight again is the preparedness for the team to be able to accept and anticipate that 33% increase. And so, we're very encouraged by that. If you look at the size of the pie, we're really competing against truck. We're putting together a service product to go out there and compete against truck, against sourcing, to a lesser degree against barge. So we're doing what we can do to go out there and grow and win share and focus on Union Pacific and what we can control. That's that. The second part of your question, look, I'm proud of the team to be able to go out and lead with the capital investments that we put into the network for our customers, to lead with the inflationary pressures that we can have, the buffer resource that Jim and Eric talked about, and now we talked a little bit about the velocity. We tie it all to the service and we're aligning those pricing with the service product that's there. So, yes, the team has been able to go out there and secure some strong pricing on that merchandise business of the freight. Yes. The macro is the macro, and those are things that are out of our control, Jon. We focus on the network. We focus on the service that Eric is providing us, the investments we're making, and we link that to the value of the pricing. We're very crystal clear in how we articulate to our customers. The way we look at it, we see it as something that will definitely continue to happen. Yes. Jim hit it a little bit earlier and what do we sell to our customers, and how do we translate that into pricing and those discussions. No. There's not a magical number. But clearly, as the service improves, that gives us a better environment to maximize price. Same is true on growth, more consistent, reliable product and better service product. We go in and we ask for more business when we're talking to customers. We ask to look at their truck files. We ask to look at talk to more of their receivers. Clearly, as we improve and we've done a great job here in the third quarter on the service product. It creates our own capacity. It creates our own opportunities regardless of what happens in the macro environment. I hope not. I mean, we always want to improve as a management team. So no, we're going to always strive to improve. There's no time where we're going to yell out we arrived. Yes. I just want to say we're not going to apologize for accepting the increase. Yes. We'd love the 33% increase. What I'd tell you is that, the management team here did a good job of preparing for it. That's what we did with Phoenix to take trucks off the road, what we did to expand Inland Empire. All these things set us up for success for this unexpected amount of volume that's come on. Yes. First of all, I just want to step back as we're talking about our grain business and our grain network and differentiate renewable fuels and the actual facilities that we've landed there that we've discussed. The same thing with our grain network, the facilities, meaning the 20-plus facilities that have come on and the fact that Cherryvale Kansas facility will help supply grain into Mexico. So let me just kind of break that apart to let you know how we look at it. But then, yes, broadly, as we look at Mexico, Clearly, there's a lot of opportunity with over-the-road trucks. There are some markets like finished vehicles and also auto parts. We have a strong service product coming out there. What differentiates us, Stephanie is, again, the fact that we have multiple partners that can get in that market. We have our own rail box that we can get into that market. And we have daily service into and out of Mexico, which we know we're the only one that has that. So clearly, again, a strong growth area for us. We laid it out in Investor Day. And as far as the administration, we see that it's an environment that they're going to be certainly pro-business and support the freight environment, so we're excited about that. So we've been encouraged on the domestic intermodal front, even as late as the second quarter, we saw that line be positive. It's been positive in the third quarter. Now some of that has benefited from the international in a most side. And that's why I keep harping on these products that we have, having a product like Inland Empire helps us capture some of that domestic intermodal, and we've seen some strong demand there. I'll tell you as it looks at -- we look at it for the fourth quarter. Again, we think we'll see a little bit more of a benefit for what's taking place on the international intermodal side, and we'll see what happens as we continue throughout the quarter. Yes. So I think you're talking specifically and only about domestic intermodal, you'll have to clear it up, if you can. We've got -- and we've talked about this, we've got price mechanisms for our customers that are in place to keep them competitive. Again, I talked to you about the fact that second quarter, third quarter, we were up in domestic intermodal. So we look at that as a positive outcome for us. We've gone from a trucking environment really since 2022, that's really been stagnant to downward and it's flattish now. We'll see what happens in the next few months, but we feel good about where we're positioned and the ability as it capacity tightens, we're going to see more value on the pricing side. ."

        "content": "Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Union Pacific Second Quarter Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today\u2019s presentation are available on Union Pacific\u2019s website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jim Vena, Chief Executive Officer for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Vena. You may now begin.\nJim Vena: Thanks, Rob. And, good morning, and nice to come to you all from a beautiful morning here is Omaha. And, thanks for joining us today to discuss Union Pacific\u2019s second quarter results. I\u2019m joined by our Chief Financial Officer, Jennifer Hamann; our Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales, Kenny Rocker; and our Executive Vice President of Operations, Eric Gehringer. As we dive into the discussion of the second quarter, you\u2019ll hear that operating outdoors these past few months has not been easy, but I\u2019m pleased with how we manage those challenges to drive strong financial results. It provides another proof point that our strategy is the right one to drive success. Now, let\u2019s discuss second quarter results starting on Slide 3. This morning, Union Pacific reported 2024 second quarter net income of $1.7 billion or $2.74 per share. This compares to 2023 second quarter net income of $1.6 billion or $2.57 per share. Second quarter operating revenue was up 1% as solid core pricing gains and slightly increased volume were reduced by a negative business mix and lower fuel surcharge revenue. And, if you\u2019re normalizing for the yearly change in fuel, freight revenue was up 2% versus 2023. Reported expenses year-over-year were down 4%. This is very impressive work by the team to offset the high inflationary pressure we\u2019ve experienced in a flattish volume environment, even when you adjust for one-time items and fuel. Our second quarter operating ratio of 60.0% improved 300 basis points versus last year and despite some challenges, we still showed sequential improvement. Overall, this quarter was another solid step toward our goal of leading the industry in safety, service and operational excellence. I\u2019ll let the team walk you through the quarter in more detail and then come back for a wrap up before we go to Q&A. So, we\u2019ll start with Jennifer and the Q2 financials. Jennifer?\nJennifer Hamann: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s start on Slide 5 with a walk-down of our second quarter income statement, where operating revenue of $6 billion increased 1% versus last year on slightly positive volume. As Kenny will highlight, this strong topline performance was supported by solid pricing gains and business wins against the backdrop of weak coal demand. Second quarter freight revenue totaled $5.6 billion, a 1% gain. Digging into the revenue components, strong core pricing gains partially offset by an unfavorable business mix added 150 basis points to freight revenue. Double-digit growth in international intermodal volume was the primary contributor to the negative mix dynamic and further compounded by an overall decline in our higher average revenue per car industrial business. Slightly positive volumes in the quarter added 50 basis points to freight revenue. And lastly, fuel surcharge revenue of $669 million declined 5% as lower fuel prices impacted freight revenue 75 basis points. Excluding fuel surcharge, freight revenue grew 2% as the team continues to pace revenue growth faster than volume. Wrapping up the topline, other revenue declined 6% as a result of lower intermodal accessorials and less demand for auto parts shipments at our Loup subsidiary. Switching to expenses, second quarter operating expense of $3.6 billion decreased $152 million versus 2023 as we drove productivity across most cost categories. We have more details in the appendix, but let me highlight some of the performance drivers. Compensation and benefits expense declined 6% versus last year as we reduced headcount 5% and generated positive productivity. Although our training pipeline is significantly reduced compared to 2023, train service employees increased 1% as we continue to carry more train service employees as a buffer for our operations and to offset the impact of new labor agreements. The remainder of the workforce decreased 9% as we continue to focus on delayering and pushing work down in the organization. And, as you\u2019ll recall, last year\u2019s expenses included a $67 million one-time ratification payment. Following up on an item we highlighted at our first quarter report, last month we completed the transfer of around 350 mechanical employees to Metro in Chicago. Going forward, this transfer will lower both other revenue and our expenses by roughly $15 million a quarter. Excluding last year\u2019s one-time labor payment, cost per employee in the second quarter increased 4% as we continue to drive for better overall efficiency. Fuel expense in the quarter declined 6% on a 5% decrease in fuel prices from $2.86 per gallon to $2.73 per gallon. We overcame a challenging operating environment and less fuel efficient freight mix to improve our fuel consumption rate 1% largely by locomotive productivity. Equipment and other rents declined 12%, reflecting improved cycle times and lower lease expense, partially offset by business mix. Finally, other expense decreased 4% as we recorded a couple of one-time items in the quarter. On the positive side, we added a $46 million gain from an intermodal equipment sale. Conversely, we recognized $23 million of additional environmental expense at a legacy California remediation site. Second quarter operating income of $2.4 billion increased 9% versus last year. Below the line, other income increased 11% as a result of interest received on tax refund claims, while interest expense declined 6% on lower average debt levels. Second quarter net income of $1.7 billion and earnings per share of $2.74 both improved 7% versus 2023. Our quarterly operating ratio of 60% improved 300 basis points year-over-year. As I just discussed, there were several puts and takes in the quarter. Key here is that our core operations drove 160 basis points of OR improvement and $0.21 of EPS growth year-over-year. This is a great continuation of the momentum we\u2019ve created these past three quarters. Turning to shareholder returns in the balance sheet on Slide 6, second quarter cash from operations totaled $4 billion up $175 million versus last year. Growth in operating income and 2023 labor agreement payments partially offset by higher income tax payments resulted in the increase in cash from operations and our free cash flow improvement, up 43% to $853 million. As stated back in April, we restarted share repurchases late in the second quarter. Although we plan to ramp up repurchases through the year, we started slowly with just over $100 million repurchased in June. Combined with our dividend payments, we\u2019ve returned $1.7 billion to shareholders year-to-date. Finally, our adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio finished the quarter at 2.8 times and we continue to be A rated by our three credit rating agencies. Wrapping up on Slide 7, as we\u2019ve reached the midway point of 2024, there remains some uncertainty about the second half recovery that many were forecasting. As Kenny will detail, there are definitely markets where we\u2019re seeing growth and much of that growth is being driven by our business development efforts. There also are some challenge markets, particularly coal. Operationally, the team is making great progress towards our long-term goals to be the best in safety, service and operational excellence. This is reflected in the progress in our safety and performance metrics, including our margins. Importantly, we believe the trend is indicative of where we can get to long-term and each successive quarter is a step on our way to winning. We are highly confident in our ability to generate price dollars in excess of inflation dollars and still expect freight revenue to pace ahead of volume in 2024. We also remain committed to our long-term capital allocation strategy. This includes last week\u2019s announcement of a 3% increase in our dividend as we drive higher returns to our owners. This increase represents the 18th year in a row of annual dividend increases. With share repurchases, we expect to repurchase around $1.5 billion in 2024 as we maintain our current leverage. Before I turn it over to Kenny, I\u2019d summarize our second quarter financial performance as strong and our confidence in the future stronger as we continue to unlock the potential of our great franchise. We\u2019re excited to execute on our strategy in the second half and lay out more of our long-term thoughts at our Investor Day in September. Kenny?\nKenny Rocker: Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning. As Jennifer mentioned, we had a solid second quarter, especially if you put aside the lower volume from coal. Freight revenues totaled $5.6 billion for the quarter, which was up 2% excluding fuel surcharges due to strong core pricing and a slight increase in volume. Let\u2019s jump right in and talk about the key drivers in each of our business groups. Starting with our Bulk segment. Revenue for the quarter was down 2% compared to last year on a 5% decrease in volume and a 3% increase in average revenue per car driven by solid core pricing gains and a positive mix in traffic. However, if you exclude coal, Bulk revenue for the quarter was up 4% year-over-year and volume grew by 6%. Coal volume was down 23% in the quarter due to ongoing secular decline of the market along with continued challenges from lower natural gas prices and higher inventory levels. Fertilizer volumes increased for the quarter due to strong export demand for Canpotex potash and easier comps from a 2023 customer outage. In addition, grain products business was favorable due to increased demand for renewable diesel, strong demand for ethanol and new business wins. Moving to Industrial, revenue was up 2% for the quarter on a 3% decrease in volume and a 5% increase in average revenue per car. Strong core pricing gains and a positive mix in traffic were partially offset by lower fuel surcharges. Our strong business development efforts in petroleum allowed us to capitalize on opportunities. Petrochemicals volume continued to grow due to improved domestic demand in plastics and strong business development wins in our industrial chemicals markets from customers located along the Gulf Coast. However, challenges with high inventories and rainy weather in the South negatively impacted our rock volumes. Premium revenue for the quarter was up 4% on a 6% increase in volume and a 2% decrease in average revenue per car reflecting negative mix, lower fuel surcharges and truck market pressure. Automotive volumes were positive due to business development wins with Volkswagen and General Motors, but offset by unplanned decreases in production impacting auto parts shipments. Intermodal volumes continue to remain strong due to West Coast import demand and positive domestic growth despite market conditions especially within our Parcels segment. Now, turning to Slide 10. Here\u2019s our outlook for the balance of 2024 for the key markets we serve. Starting with Bulk, coal is expected to remain challenged as inventories remain high and natural gas futures stay at levels that make coal less competitive. For grain, as we sit here today, the markets look stable and healthy although global export sales are off to a slow start. Crop conditions look good and we\u2019ll have a better read over the next several weeks. In addition, we expect grain products to remain positive as we see incremental renewable diesel production coming online in California and continue to capture new business. Turning to Industrial. Our outlook remains the same as we laid out during our last earnings call. We expect our rock market will not match last year\u2019s record volume. However, both petroleum and petrochemical markets will remain favorable due to our focus on business development supported by our investments in the Gulf Coast. And, wrapping up with Premium, on the intermodal side, we expect to see continued strength for imports in the near-term. And, while we have seen imports drive pockets of increased demand, on the domestic side, the overall market remains soft. But, our improved service product, along with our diversified set of private asset owners and IMCs provide Union Pacific more at bet when opportunities present themselves. And for automotive, we\u2019re still expecting year-over-year growth due to business development wins despite some softening in the market. In summary, I\u2019m proud of the commercial team and their focus to fill the volume gap we\u2019re seeing from coal. On the price side, we\u2019re achieving solid price results to overcome inflation and delivering the consistent and efficient service that we sold to our customers. As we head into the second half of the year, I am confident that our great franchise, along with the diverse product offerings we provide, gives our customers the ability to compete and win in the marketplace. Our commercial leaders are actively working with customers and the operating team to convert more over the road business to rail that allows us both to win and grow. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Eric, to review our operational performance.\nEric Gehringer: Thank you, Kenny, and good morning. Moving to Slide 12. As you heard from Jim, Mother Nature delivered many powerful weather events throughout the quarter as we experienced impactful flooding across both our northern and southern regions. But, we\u2019re not here to make excuses. Leveraging our intense focus on operational excellence and detailed contingency plans the team quickly acted to mitigate the impact by adjusting trip plans and deploying temporary buffer resources to safely restore operations. I\u2019m very proud of our frontline employees who worked tirelessly to repair our infrastructure to minimize the customer impact. There are countless examples highlighting their efforts as they repaired miles of damaged track, restored bridges and cleared countless trees and debris. That being said, versus 2023, service levels and network performance for the second quarter remained strong, demonstrating our recoverability in the wake of major weather disruptions. Starting with our foundation of safety, we continue to drive improvements building on the momentum of the first quarter. For the second quarter, both derailment and personal injury rates improved year-over-year. While I am proud of the team for making this progress, we will not rest until every employee goes home safe to their loved ones every day. Freight car velocity was flat in the second quarter compared to 2023 as improvements in terminal dwell were offset by weather impacted train speeds. The opportunity here is to drive even stronger terminal dwell performance by removing unnecessary car touches across the network. On the service front, intermodal SPI improved four points as manifest and auto SPI remained flat. Although we worked hard to minimize impact on weather on our service product, we know customers felt the impact, particularly those located in the affected areas. Now, let\u2019s review our key efficiency metrics on Slide 13. The team remains highly focused on cost control, leveraging technology and other investments to drive productivity throughout our operation. As I mentioned last quarter, it is imperative to our strategy as it enables Kenny and the team to compete in the marketplace. Similar to the first quarter, we saw year-over-year improvements across all of our metrics. Locomotive productivity improved 6% compared to second quarter 2023 driven by improved network fluidity and asset utilization. Throughout the year, we have been able to efficiently flex our locomotive fleet with units readily available to adjust to varying volume levels. Workforce productivity, which does include all employees, improved 5% versus 2023. While overall employee levels decreased, our active train, engine and yard employees increased as we implement new labor agreements. Train length improved 2% compared to second quarter 2023 and 3% sequentially due to increased intermodal volume combined with the usage of safety technologies like Precision Train Builder. In fact, our second quarter result was a quarterly record and June marked the first month ever with train length over 9,600 feet. This is a remarkable achievement by the team as they continue to generate mainline capacity for future growth. Wrapping up, it\u2019s important to note, as we continue to implement new technology throughout our operation, we are also building new processes. These processes powered by automation and real-time analytics open new capabilities for Union Pacific and our customers. I\u2019m looking forward to sharing such examples at our Investor Day in September. So with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to, Jim.\nJim Vena: Thank you, Eric. Turning to Slide 15. Before we get to your questions, I\u2019d like to quickly summarize what you\u2019ve heard from our team. First, as you heard from Jennifer, despite a challenging environment, we achieved strong financial results in the quarter. We continue to drive efficiency into the network and the commercial team has done a good job generating price for the value we provide our customers. Kenny provided you with an overview of the second quarter volumes and laid out some updated thoughts for the remainder of the year. I think it\u2019s worth stating that when you remove coal, our total volume was up 3% in the second quarter. This demonstrates that even in a tough freight environment, we are winning with our customers to bring new business to the railroad. Lastly, Eric walked you through the progress we\u2019re making across safety, service and operational excellence. In the first half of the year, our safety metrics improved, but we still have a way to go. Our service was challenged in the quarter, but I\u2019m pleased with our ability to recover and we\u2019re continuing to do things more efficiently making good improvements in operational excellence. Look the quarter presented its challenges, but I\u2019m very pleased with the results we achieved. From the beginning, I said improvement wasn\u2019t going to be a straight line. There are just too many variables when you operate an outdoor factory, but I expect the trend line will be in the right direction and we demonstrated that again this quarter. Over the past 12 months, we\u2019ve put this company on the right path to redefining what\u2019s possible for Union Pacific, a theme we\u2019ll build on at our Investor Day in mid-September. With that, now we\u2019re ready to take your questions, Rob.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And, the first question today is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nJim Vena: Good morning, Brandon.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good morning. Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. So, Jim, if I recall, it was almost a year ago that you got appointed CEO and I think you said publicly like give me a year then let\u2019s look back and judge how things went. I think you just clearly articulated the coal headwinds in the quarter. But I guess, how would you look at the past year in terms of operational improvement, network performance? And then maybe most importantly customer growth, which I think you were alluding to?\nJim Vena: Yes, Brandon, I appreciate the question and you\u2019re right on. I think they announced me last year on 26th, we agreed that I was going to join this company and the announcement came up. So, guess what it\u2019s a year. Now, I actually didn\u2019t start work till the 14th of August, but that\u2019s okay, couple of weeks doesn\u2019t make a difference. Bottom line is, if I look at the quarter Brandon, I\u2019m very, very, very happy with how we\u2019ve progressed on this railroad. If you start above the line and Kenny and the entire team have done a great job of, we knew we had an inflationary pressures with the contracts that were signed and we knew that we had to do something above the line and I think we\u2019ve done a great job and you can see that where the revenue comes in against our volume growth and we continue and we will continue to see that as we go through the year. So, I\u2019m very comfortable with that. Business development, we have been, I have personally spent a lot of time, Kenny and his entire team spends a lot of time and the entire leadership group with customers looking for opportunity and we\u2019ve spent capital and developed new facilities and expanded facilities across our network to be able to handle more business. But, the best part about it is our service level is to the point where the first discussion isn\u2019t, are you providing the service that we agreed to, it\u2019s more of how do we work together to move ahead. Operationally below the line very comfortable to be able to present today the numbers that we are on car velocity, dwell, locomotive and things that you all don\u2019t see, how fast our crew changes are, how well we\u2019re able to and the number of people it takes to operate the terminals, we see those numbers every day and I\u2019m very comfortable of where we are. And, I\u2019m also very happy that we continue to improve our operating ratio and I don\u2019t see that stopping. We\u2019ll have, I never give a number for operating ratio, because it\u2019s a result of everything you do, but to have a 160 basis points improvement this last quarter, year-over-year operating ratio and sequentially a small is a greater testament with what we can do with everything that we were impacted with this customer. We are not a team that makes excuses. You won\u2019t hear us complain about coal. We just say that coal is a problem, but to be able to when we had 20% plus drop in our coal volume to actually increase goes to show you the strength of our network. We\u2019re going to leverage what we\u2019re doing in Mexico with our 26% ownership of the FXE and we think that\u2019s going to lead to more growth as we move ahead and we\u2019re going to leverage this network we have. So, Brandon, I\u2019m in a real good place. So, hopefully you guys aren\u2019t the toughest marketers in the world, because sometimes some of you are. But overall, I\u2019m very happy with where we are today and I look forward to how this next few years while I\u2019m leading this company and show everybody what we can do.\nBrandon Oglenski: Appreciate the answer, Jim. Thanks.\nJim Vena: You\u2019re welcome, Brandon.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nJim Vena: Good morning, Scott.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good morning. So, I know, Jennifer, mix can swing on you positive negative. Any thoughts on mix based on your volume outlook in the back half of the year? And then, I just want to bigger picture, right? Even if I adjust for mix, the yield growth is still relatively muted in the context of higher inflation. And so, I know I\u2019ve asked this before, I keep asking because I just think it\u2019s so critical like when do you guys think we truly get back to inflation plus pricing? And, I don\u2019t mean like dollars versus dollars, I mean like margin accretive inflation plus pricing because I think that\u2019s sort of like the, in my opinion, the key to like having confidence in like sustained margin improvement. So, I don\u2019t know, any thoughts? Thank you.\nJennifer Hamann: Well, so a couple of things there, Scott. On the mix side of things, as we look ahead, a lot of the drivers that were present in our volumes here in the second quarter are going to be present at least into the third quarter. International intermodal is staying strong, coal is weaker, the industrial portion of our portfolio, while we\u2019ve got great business development opportunities, there\u2019s just a little softness there. And so, if you assume that, that dynamic continues, that\u2019s going to continue to have an impact on our mix, probably to the negative side. So, I mean, you guys get our volumes every week, you\u2019ll be able to see that, engage that, but that\u2019s kind of our going in expectation as we look at what\u2019s ahead of us, particularly into the third quarter and we\u2019ll see how some of those intermodal trends move into 4Q. In terms of the question relative to price and price accretion, the team is doing, I think, a very good job of driving price in the areas where they can touch it and actively work with the customers. Jim mentioned the service aspect of it, that\u2019s critical when you\u2019re sitting in front of customers and driving the price. And so, the thing that I\u2019m very encouraged by is we know we\u2019ll get to that point. I\u2019m not going to give you a date by which we\u2019ll get to that point. But, what\u2019s encouraging is without that, we\u2019re still driving very solid margin improvement and looking for more going ahead. So, that\u2019s what I would focus on. And, as we continue to get more access to contracts, that\u2019s just going to give us more upside and more ability going forward.\nScott Group: Thank you.\nJim Vena: Thanks for the question, Scott.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Seidl: Thank you, operator. Jim and team, good morning. Nice to see you guys recover from some of the weather in the quarter. I want to focus in a little bit on something, Kenny, that you say, you mentioned there was some weakness on your rock business. We\u2019ve been hearing some of the infrastructure projects that were planned are sort of really not getting off the ground. Is that part of the weakness that\u2019s behind that or what are you looking at in the marketplace?\nKenny Rocker: Yes, Jason, you\u2019re right, on. We\u2019ve seen some NLG products down in the Gulf that have been delayed or slow roll. And, a lot of it also is just overall demand and we haven\u2019t had the best weather, haven\u2019t seen that in that second quarter. So yes, it is. I will tell you this though, Jason, Eric\u2019s team is doing everything they can to capture the volume that is out there. We\u2019re looking at adding every car to every train that we can to maximize efficiency. So, as the opportunities are there we\u2019re taking advantage of it.\nJason Seidl: Well, that makes sense. And, Kenny, on the delayed projects, is there any expectation for these things to sort of be lifted as we look into \u201825 or it\u2019s just sort of a wait and see?\nKenny Rocker: I think, it\u2019s wait and see. It\u2019s hard for us to go out and forecast what a lot of the customers will do and how the contractors will play out. Our best bet is just to be prepared, which we are.\nJason Seidl: Sounds good. Appreciate the time.\nJim Vena: Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nJon Chappell: Thank you. Good morning. Jim, do we get to a point in your new tenure here where some of these productivity improvements that you\u2019ve made start to hit a ceiling without volume? And, clearly what you\u2019ve been able to do on locomotives and workforce, in a flat volume environment and of course we understand what\u2019s happening with coal, is pretty impressive, but do you hit the ceiling without a volume tailwind at some point?\nJim Vena: No, I don\u2019t see that. I think we\u2019ve shown that we can improve and I see more improvement even with a flat. I don\u2019t expect us to have our volume be flat though. That\u2019s not the way we\u2019re working at this. Everything that we\u2019ve done is to increase our volume against some pretty big negatives that are structural that we can\u2019t control. So, is it easier when you have increase in volume? Yes, you have another five cars on an intermodal train or a manifest train makes it a lot easier. But, the technology that we\u2019re implementing, the speed that we\u2019re going to be able to change our plan and what we\u2019re doing moving forward will help us to be able to even on a flat volume be able to improve our efficiency. So, I\u2019m very comfortable with, as we move ahead there\u2019ll be more even on a flat.\nJon Chappell: Great. Thanks, Jim.\nJim Vena: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nStephanie Moore: Hi, good morning. Thank you.\nJim Vena: Good morning.\nStephanie Moore: I think continuing on the prior question, really nice margin performance for the first half of the year. Can you talk a little bit, just based on maybe some of the mix headwinds and the cost of initiatives and a lot of the kind of puts and takes here, what that should mean in terms of kind of normal seasonality for margins as the OR as the year progresses? Thank you.\nJim Vena: Stephanie, listen, I just sort of answered overall on the high level what I see, but I\u2019m going to pass this off to, Kenny. Kenny, you talked about margin, how we\u2019re looking at pricing, how we move ahead.\nKenny Rocker: Yes, yes. Thanks for that, Jim. So, first of all, you all have heard me say that before, when you look at our approach to revenue growth, it\u2019s volume growth through business development, but it\u2019s also our pricing approach. And, our commercial team has been very clear to articulate some of the inflationary pressures that are out there. But more importantly, the team has taken risks. And so, we are doing as these contracts are coming up everything we can do to maximize price or margin expansion. And so at every turn, at every contract, those are some with our service improving, Eric, those are some really good opportunities for us to maximize our price. So, we\u2019re doing everything we can do there.\nStephanie Moore: So, I guess just a follow-up, really nothing from a seasonality standpoint to really call out as we think about performance as the year progresses?\nJennifer Hamann: I mean, when you think about seasonality, I\u2019ll jump in here. It really has a lot to do with volumes. And, if you look at our volume performance, generally speaking, the quarters where we have the strongest volume growth, that\u2019s where you tend to get your greatest margin improvement. It goes back to Jim\u2019s comments on productivity and that volume leverage piece. That said, we\u2019ve shown really good sequential improvement in our margins and have kind of broke that trend as we\u2019ve really come in and put a big focus on how we can drive greater productivity across the network over the last three quarters. And quite frankly, I think that\u2019s something that maybe is a little bit underappreciated in terms of how hard it has been for the team to achieve that. Looking forward, it really is going to be about the volumes and the continued emphasis on the productivity and the price. Those are our three levers. And so, as you\u2019re thinking sequentially, I\u2019d be comparing volumes sequentially and see how that progresses. That\u2019s going to really be the determinant.\nJim Vena: Thanks, Stephanie.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nJim Vena: Good morning, Brian.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hey, good morning, team. Thanks for taking the question. Yes, maybe a couple for, Kenny. Can you just talk about the international intermodal has always been quite strong. There\u2019s been some expectation for that to spill over into domestic. Do you have any thoughts on when that might happen and whether that\u2019s good, bad or indifferent for UP? And then secondly, I don\u2019t know who would want to take this, but just as we get to the Investor Day in a couple of months, you talked about redefining what\u2019s possible. Can you help level set expectations what we\u2019re going to hear from you all and the team? Will we see multi-year growth strategy, again underpinned by some of the end markets, we talk about truckload conversion and quantify that, maybe just help give us some expectations on what to think about in a couple of months when we see you on Dallas?\nKenny Rocker: Yes, let me take this, the first one on international intermodal. So first of all, yes, we\u2019ve seen some very strong growth on the international intermodal side and yes, we have seen some of that spillover on the domestic intermodal side. And, I want to touch on the fact that our product development, meaning the investment that we\u2019ve made efficient investments in places like Inland Empire helping us to grow. Here recently, even though it\u2019s a short-term phenomenon because of the labor issues up in Canada. We\u2019re not going to just take that volume in the short-term. We\u2019re doing everything we can to get it permanently. We won a piece of business into our Twin Cities Inland Intermodal Terminal and that\u2019s the way we can take advantage again of the product development that\u2019s out there. So, that\u2019s the international intermodal. I talked a little bit about the fact that yes, we are seeing quite a bit that\u2019s being transloaded that\u2019s showing up on the domestic side and our products are helping grow. In fact, when we look at our domestic business, year-over-year in the quarter it was up and we feel pretty good about where it started off here in this quarter. So, that\u2019s some real specific feedback for you.\nJennifer Hamann: Okay. And, then in terms of your question about the Investor Day and what\u2019s possible, that really is going to be how we\u2019re going to frame things and that\u2019s certainly been Jim\u2019s challenge to the team since he came here a little over a year ago, is don\u2019t look back at what you\u2019ve done historically, don\u2019t look back and see what you think has been best ever, look forward and see what you really do think we can achieve together with this great franchise that we have. So, I don\u2019t want to front run things too much with you, Brian. We want to make sure folks tune in September. But, we\u2019re excited about the message and the opportunity to speak to everybody and share some of our plans.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Okay, understood. Thank you.\nJim Vena: Thanks, Brian.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJim Vena: Good morning, Ken.\nKen Hoexter: Good morning. So, service was challenged by the weather in the quarter. You\u2019re showing an ability to recover. Jim, you just noted we should continue to see operating ratio improvement going forward. Should we see that improved car velocity going forward now you don\u2019t have storms and being the cost benefit then I guess I\u2019ll ask kind of Stephanie\u2019s question a little differently. Given the hazy economic outlook, can operating ratio improve sequentially?\nJim Vena: Well, Ken, people always want me to start talking about where we I think the endpoint is on this and I think we continue to improve. We\u2019re going to have quarters that are better than other quarters, but operationally you should always look at, we give a lot of metrics out there and if you take a look at the metrics, car velocity is real important, dwell time is real important and then of course there\u2019s about 100 others that I look at internally that tell me how we\u2019re operating and where we need to focus and how we need to do this. So, that\u2019s one piece and we are aligned. We\u2019ve got a great team. They know what the end goal is. So, I see us optimizing the railroad and continue to get better at how we operate. But, what really helps operating ratio and margins is revenue growth, and we are pushing hard on that piece by both bringing in volume at the right price and also pricing because of inflation and everything we\u2019ve had. So, when you put those two things together, we might have some quarters where sequentially it doesn\u2019t improve as much as people would like because it\u2019s never a straight line. But, I\u2019m very comfortable. I didn\u2019t come back to work. I look at it as I had a sabbatical for a couple of years away from Union Pacific, came on, did what we had to do operationally. I\u2019m back here to drive this place to where is what I see is possible, and I\u2019m very comfortable. And, after the first year, I\u2019m even more comfortable than I was on August 14 when I walked back in the front door. So Ken, it\u2019s take a look at those metrics, but take a look at what\u2019s happening in our volume and translate that on what we did in the second quarter on revenue against where we were with our carload growth. So, hopefully that gives you a better framing of the way I look at it, Ken.\nKen Hoexter: Thanks, Jim.\nJim Vena: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nTom Wadewitz: Yes, good morning.\nJim Vena: Good morning.\nTom Wadewitz: So, I wanted to ask just on kind of I think you talked about some weakness in industrial. How do you think about your markets overall if you say industrial and consumer? Are things getting kind of a little bit stronger or a little bit weaker in those two segments? And then, maybe one more for probably for Kenny as well, you mentioned a lot of times business development and new customer wins, which is great. Wondered if you could kind of give us a couple of buckets to think about where the opportunity for new business wins is the most significant, right? Are there some industrial segments or which customer segments give you the most opportunity in the future for those customer wins to matter? Thank you.\nKenny Rocker: Yes. Thank you, Tom. So, you\u2019ve got a few macroeconomic indicators like, industrial production, not strong, housing starts aren\u2019t helping us either and then you know where natural gas prices are. So, we don\u2019t get the rollover and play dead, because coal is not where it needs to be. The commercial team is out there hustling and getting more business. Let me talk about some of the areas that I feel good about from a business development perspective. Renewable diesel, I\u2019ll start with that. That\u2019s an emerging market. I\u2019ve been really excited that the team has been out there growing origin points and destination points. It allows us to pitch and catch. On the petrochemical side in the Gulf, we talked about the investments there and the wins that we\u2019ve been able to get in that petrochemical market. And then, on the Premium side, I\u2019ll talk about it from a couple of angles. One is Mexico will continue to be a market over the near-term and long-term. And, you\u2019ve seen that Eric side has put up some really good products up against it as we talk about that north south quarter getting into the Midwest and products in terms of getting into the Southeast and then bought quite a few new products coming out of Houston, going into Phoenix, setting up our ramp and expanding in different areas. So, in some cases, we have to create our own markets to make the pie larger and that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re seeing.\nTom Wadewitz: When you say the premium side, you mean premium like domestic and removal products? Or how do you mean that?\nKenny Rocker: Both domestic and our international intermodal.\nTom Wadewitz: Okay. And just back on the kind of economy question, do you think it\u2019s getting like stronger or weaker or is that hard to say?\nKenny Rocker: It\u2019s still very unclear for us. I\u2019m not in a position to forecast where it is. All I\u2019m telling you is that we\u2019re going to go out and make our own markets where we can and we\u2019re doing that through the product development that I mentioned and working with customers.\nTom Wadewitz: Okay, great. Thanks for the time.\nJim Vena: Thanks, Tom.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nJim Vena: Good morning, Chris.\nChris Wetherbee : Hey, morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe Kenny coming back on the pricing side, I guess I\u2019m just kind of curious as you\u2019re seeing the market from a volume perspective ex-coal look a little bit more supportive here in \u201824, operationally things are moving well. As you\u2019re having these incremental contract renewals, is it reasonable to say that the rate of increase is beginning to maybe pick up a little bit? I guess I just was curious kind of perspective when you\u2019re thinking in the old days when we used to get sort of same store sales type of numbers, how you think about that? So, I was just kind of curious if we are actually starting to see any uptick there?\nKenny Rocker: The short answer is yes. The long answer is that every contract is unique, every customer is unique, every discussion is unique. We\u2019re mixing that with what\u2019s happening on the service side. A stronger service product is helping us. We\u2019ve always been very price disciplined as a company. What you\u2019re seeing is that now we\u2019re able to take a little bit more risk as we\u2019re talking to our customers because of the inflationary pressures that are out there.\nChris Wetherbee : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nJim Vena: Thanks, Chris.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC. Please proceed with your question.\nWalter Spracklin : Thanks very much, operator. So, Jim, you mentioned before your sabbatical there, you were able to achieve an operating ratio as low I think in one quarter it\u2019s 55.1%. And there\u2019s been a lot of talk in about how this time is different and that might not be an achievable number. So, not asking you a target, just rather asking you, are things different -- are there factors that are really limiting you that weren\u2019t there before either cyclical like volume or structural like the work rules? Just trying to get an apples-to-apples compare of what kind of what is the new 55%, not asking you that, but more asking you are there those factors are they meaningful enough to kind of put it in permanent impairment on that on an objective or any comparing it to any prior level of operating ratio achievement?\nJim Vena: Walter, I like the question because that\u2019s exactly the way we need to look at it is, we know what we\u2019ve done before and I could go back to when I was at Canadian National and numbers that were delivered back in 2013 to 2016. So, I know the game of how and the play and how you have to get there to be able to deliver. Is there some things that are structurally different? Yes, the collective agreements are impact to our cost and will follow for a while with us. Now we\u2019ve done a great job of mitigating some of it, but it\u2019s pretty tough to mitigate it all. So, that\u2019s a negative that\u2019s going to be with us for a while. So, we\u2019ll probably carry a few more people than we normally would have if the railroad had not signed some of the last collective agreements. But I look at it this way, I see a clear picture as we move ahead that we can mitigate a lot of that and have a railroad that\u2019s very efficient. We\u2019re going to use the network we have to optimize our cost structure. We are implementing work patterns and how we operate that will help us. So, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be able to mitigate all of that, but you can also mitigate it by bringing more business on and also leveraging our access to Mexico, leveraging our access to customers. Kenny is a little reserved sometimes in Jennifer, but I\u2019ll tell you, we have a railroad that the opportunity is there. And we have discussions, we don\u2019t talk about, oh geez, we have some problems with this. We look at what are we going to do, Phoenix, we opened it up because we think there\u2019s a market there. Minneapolis, we opened it up. Fritz Intermodal Terminal, we expanded. We spent money in the Gulf and working with customers that want to be with us. So, we do both of those. I say, hang on, watch us go. This is not a short-term. I said it the very first time I was on the call, this is not a short-term fix when you have that kind of inflationary pressure. But I\u2019m very happy that this quarter we were able to deliver another 160 basis points of improvement in our OR with everything that we\u2019ve done and we\u2019re going to have some good quarters, some bad quarters, but I\u2019m telling you in the long run stay tuned Walter. And listen Walter, I\u2019ve seen as you\u2019re you\u2019re probably in Canada, I know there\u2019s a lot of people that I know from CN and others impacted with fire in my hometown and I wish everybody the best.\nWalter Spracklin: Appreciate it. Okay, thanks for the color, Jim.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Ben Nolan with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nBen Nolan : Yes, thanks. I was interested to see that the average train length, I think you\u2019d said, was the highest that it\u2019s ever been. It was curious if, as you think about that going forward, maybe there were some puts and takes, like more international intermodal, I assume is helpful to that, but maybe coal is detrimental. Do you think there\u2019s more room to go there? Can we continue to see, the train lengths improve? And then, obviously, that is beneficial to everything across the board, but OR in particular.\nJim Vena: Well, let me pass it over to Eric and I can\u2019t give you the answer, because Eric knows it\u2019s a different number than that, but I\u2019ve got a goal out there, but Eric, it\u2019s all yours.\nEric Gehringer: Ben, to be very clear, the answer to your question is yes, we can continue to grow it. Now let\u2019s make sure we\u2019re all on the same page, 2% improvement in the quarter, 3% sequential improvement. To your comment, best quarter we\u2019ve ever had and June was the highest month in the history of Union Pacific at 9,600 feet. And we want to give a lot of credit to our team. That\u2019s hard work to do that. Now when we have conversations about TrainLink, we also got to remind ourselves that since 2019, our mainline derailments are down 42%, while our TrainLink has been up 20%. That\u2019s because we continue to invest in technology and science. And that\u2019s really going to be the continued foundation of how we keep building this out. Yes, to your point, mix makes a difference, but what makes more of a difference is getting more volume on the railroad like we\u2019re seeing with intermodal, that\u2019s been a tailwind for us, but also using our Precision Train Builder software as well as other things that continue to identify opportunities for us to do it. And then on a day to day just fundamentally how we run the railroad and we\u2019ve talked about this before, we still see opportunities to combo trains largely on the bulk side. So yes, there is more opportunity, the team is up against that. I\u2019m looking forward to their continued gains.\nBen Nolan: All right. Appreciate. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJordan Alliger : Hi. Just a couple of demand related questions, follow ups. I think in the first quarter you had mentioned the commodity outlook was muted. Now it\u2019s uncertain. So, I guess first part of the question is and some commodities moved to the positive bucket like international, intermodal and grains. I\u2019m just sort of wondering, are you feeling better or even though it\u2019s uncertain, are you feeling better than you did a quarter ago? And then specifically on coal, obviously, there\u2019s been a lot of carload pressure, but can you give some sense as to the trajectory as we move through the back half of the year in terms of year-over-year pressures? Thanks.\nKenny Rocker: Yes. I\u2019ll start with coal first and then work my way back. And again, coal is a natural gas prices are all over the place. If you look at April, they were the lowest on record for a few years and as we move throughout the quarter by June they had bounced back up. It\u2019s very difficult to go out and forecast based on that. We talked about preparedness. We\u2019re talking with Eric\u2019s team daily to make sure we can capture the demand that\u2019s out there. I\u2019ve been very encouraged that our commercial team is talking to each coal customer, each coal receiver one by one to see when they can add in set. So, we\u2019re doing everything we can to influence the demand there. So, overall demand, let\u2019s just talk about a few things. One, on the international, intermodal side, that\u2019s been a strength for us. I think that will stay with us at least for the quarter. I can\u2019t see out further than that. I talked about a little bit earlier the positives we\u2019re seeing from that on the domestic side and the products that we have up against it to go out there and grow. Grain, you had a question about grain. Hey, look, the crop looks great right now as it stands today. The demand looks what I call stable. We\u2019ll see what happens on the export market. But while we are waiting for the export market, our commercial team is engaging those domestic receivers. And Mexico is also an area from a business development perspective that we want. So, we can\u2019t just wait around for some of these markets to help us out. We\u2019re doing something about it and making something happen. Automotive, same thing. We talked about the wins. What I hadn\u2019t talked about is that we\u2019ve had some products where Eric has helped us out where we\u2019ve had land bridge opportunities. So, again very specific actions up against the service and the product to really help overcome some of these other macroeconomic challenges on the housing and industrial side.\nJordan Alliger: Okay. Thank you.\nJim Vena: Thank you. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.\nA \u2013 Jim Vena: Good morning, Bascome.\nBascome Majors : Good morning, Jim. Jim and Jennifer, you both talked about having to get past some of the inflationary pressures. And I know you mentioned contracts referring to the labor agreement. I know in the past, this time last year, you were talking about some of the purchased services pressure as well. Can you help us understand kind of where you\u2019re tracking when you blend your sense of inflation and overall labor with both the contractual rates and then some of the work rule adjustments and purchased service. Like where is that today? How does that compare to last year? And what\u2019s the steady state as you look at two, three years to understand what we\u2019re really pricing against the marketplace today? Thank you.\nJennifer Hamann: Yes, thanks for the question, Bascome. So, coming into the year, we said that we thought our full-year inflation would be around 5% or so. I think we\u2019re probably tracking pretty close to that. We\u2019re seeing some wins in some of the purchased service categories, seeing a little bit greater acceptance in the marketplace, few more people coming into bid. So, that\u2019s encouraging and certainly that\u2019s an opportunity for us to get a little bit better pricing on that purchase services side of the world. Same with materials to a certain extent, obviously that plays more into our CapEx spend than it does the OE, but both are very important to us, right. We\u2019re looking to control costs at every turn. Comp and benefits certainly is a big piece of our expenses. That inflation, I would say, is still probably running around that 5% level that we talked to coming into the year. I think as you all know, we\u2019ve got a 4.5% wage increase that became effective. The last one in this round of negotiations became effective July 1 for our craft professionals. So, I don\u2019t see a lot changing there. It\u2019s just some moving pieces and parts and we\u2019re trying to find areas where we can try to mitigate that either through our productivity, through our purchasing and how we\u2019re just running the railroad in general. And obviously, that\u2019s the task that we have up against Kenny and his team is, these are the inflationary pressures that we\u2019re facing, this is what\u2019s going into the cost structure and we need to go out there, have those tough conversations and the team is doing that and I feel very confident about that.\nBascome Majors: To that point, if we get into next year, it sounds like it\u2019s probably a safer expectation to think still closer to that 5% range than maybe the 2.5% to 3% we saw for a long time?\nJennifer Hamann: Yes. I mean, it\u2019s too soon to say, Bascome, at this point. But boy, my hope is that we\u2019re talking about a number that\u2019s less than 5% next year as we move in. It seems like all of those indicators are moving in the right direction, but we\u2019ll look at that. I think to your point though, when I look back historically, we used to talk about an inflation rate that was around 2%. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to get back to those levels, but certainly, we\u2019re going to work to push it down below 5%.\nJim Vena: The only thing I would add Bascome is, there\u2019s a lot of indicators that tell us that there\u2019s a change, what\u2019s happening to inflation, overall inflation, CPI, what\u2019s happening to the job market and what\u2019s happening to the input costs for us. So, those things are trending the right way, but how much of a drop we\u2019re going to see next year, we\u2019ll see, but I\u2019d rather have that view than where we were a year ago.\nBascome Majors: Thank you both.\nJim Vena: Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nJim Vena: Good morning, Ravi.\nChristyne McGarvey: Hey, good morning. This is Christyne McGarvey on for Ravi. Thanks for the question. I wanted to circle back to the business development conversation and maybe ask the question in a slightly different way. Just curious if you guys have seen any notable changes in terms of the makeup of the pipeline or maybe even more particularly customer behavior. Just as think about pipeline conversion, is there anything out there with macro or political development that kind of leaving shippers with some decision paralysis that wears off in the coming months and that could start to see conversion accelerate, but just be curious on that angle how you guys are thinking about things?\nKenny Rocker: Yes. So, the pipeline is strong. It\u2019s a robust pipeline. We feel good about the pipeline both near-term and over the next couple of years. The conversion rates haven\u2019t changed. We keep an eye on that. I know where it is there. What we saw here recently is the realization rates, meaning if a customer said, hey, it\u2019s going to be 100 cars, it wasn\u2019t as high as 100 cars. And, so you would expect as the markets improve that realization rate to also go up. Again, we\u2019re looking at the same macroeconomic indicators. Hey, if housing starts to move, you know what, that moves a lot of things. That\u2019s cement, that\u2019s PVC, that\u2019s roofing, that\u2019s the carpet that goes in there, that\u2019s glass, that\u2019s the soda ash we move. We play a role in all those products. And so, we\u2019ll see where that happens. But, the theme here is that the markets are going to do what the markets are going to do. We are going out and creating our own markets again through product development and business development and doing it as efficiently as possible as we can.\nJim Vena: Thanks for the question.\nChristyne McGarvey: Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Daniel Imbro with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.\nJim Vena: Good morning, Daniel.\nDaniel Imbro: Yes. Hey, good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking our questions. Maybe one from a capital efficiency standpoint. So, Jim, how do you feel about the assets you guys have today? I think you all mentioned in the prepared remarks you could flex the fleet up and down. Utilization probably always go up, but obviously there\u2019s longer term savings. So, how do you balance the need to refresh some of the fleet? How do you think about capital spending in this environment just potentially ahead of more volume growth as we look forward from here?\nJim Vena: Yes, I think we built our capital plan. We always build it from bottom up to see what we need to do and we\u2019re very comfortable with the $3.4 billion that we have this year and we don\u2019t see any substantial difference in our capital plan moving forward. Now, do we do have the capability, you heard us talk about buying back $1.5 billion of shares, you\u2019ve heard us on the cash that we\u2019re producing. So, if we need to, if there\u2019s something out there that really we need to spend money on, we\u2019ll do that. But, as far as the railroad, the assets, the plant that\u2019s fixed, we don\u2019t fool around with that. What we need to spend, we spend and then we have also built into that $3.4 billion was development and what we can do to drive more business to our railroad. So, I\u2019m very comfortable, that\u2019s the way you should think about it. I don\u2019t see a big change as we move ahead. Jennifer, anything else you wanted to add?\nJennifer Hamann: No, you hit it just right.\nJim Vena: Okay, thank you.\nDaniel Imbro: And so, share repurchases would be expected use of excess free cash flow, if cash flow came in stronger, Jim, is that the right way to interpret that comment?\nJennifer Hamann: Yes, I mean, so I\u2019ll jump in here. I mean, the priorities for our cash spending, we\u2019ve been, I think, very clear on. First dollar goes back into the business, then we prioritize our dividend, which again, just you saw that we gave the 3% increase here last week and then the excess cash is going to share. So yes, if we have, if you look historically at what we\u2019ve put into our share repurchase program, it\u2019s been greater than the $1.5 billion. Some of that\u2019s been using balance sheet capacity. We don\u2019t intend to add any leverage this year. We feel good about our leverage levels, but we\u2019re going to try to drive more cash and if that\u2019s available, we would put it to shares.\nDaniel Imbro: Great. Thanks so much. Best of luck.\nJim Vena: Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with you question.\nDavid Vernon : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So, Kenny, a quick one for you on intermodal pricing for domestic. Obviously, the truck markets remain weak. I\u2019m just wondering if sequentially you\u2019re seeing anything month-to-month of those rates sort of firming or how that direction looks into the back half of the year? And then, bigger picture question for you Jim on the STP wanting to sort of convene a council to discuss railroad growth. I\u2019d love to get your thoughts on kind of why you think the regulators pulling this thing together and maybe some early views of what you guys think you might have to say at that?\nKenny Rocker: David, Jim, I\u2019ll take the first one. So look, we\u2019ve been 18 months now, a little bit over 18 months where domestic intermodal pricing has either been going down or just staying at the bottom. And, I\u2019m not going to sit here today and try to forecast when it\u2019s going to move up, which I\u2019m highlighting the 18 months because it\u2019s been quite a time here and so we\u2019ll see what happens. Here is the key thing I want you to focus on is that I mentioned here recently we\u2019ve been able to see some year-over-year growth on domestic intermodal. We\u2019ve got a group of private asset providers that give us a lot of add backs, a lot of options and we\u2019ve been really as a company doubling down on our product development. So, that when things change, and they will change, but I\u2019m not going to forecast it, we\u2019ll be prepared.\nJim Vena: Listen, I appreciate the question on the STB. I think we have the exact same goal as the STB on growth. We want to grow our business and I think we\u2019ve done a, if you actually listen carefully to what we said, we\u2019ve been able to grow our business even with some markets that are giving us some huge headwinds and that\u2019s a pretty good quarter. And, if you watch the carloads that we\u2019ve so far this month, I\u2019m pretty happy with where we\u2019re headed. We\u2019re going to have up and down, but we are working hard on that. So, I think it\u2019s a great hearing. I\u2019m looking forward to it. I can\u2019t make it personally, because we are headed to Dallas and I\u2019m looking forward to those couple of days and that sort of is right in between when we need to be in Dallas, just before it. But, guess who is going and Kenny is going there, he is going to represent us well and I\u2019m looking forward to presenting to everybody to see who Union Pacific is, what we\u2019re doing and how we\u2019re going to leverage this great franchise to be able to grow our business even with all the challenges that we have. So, I\u2019m excited to hear what all the other railroads have to say and I\u2019m sure we\u2019re all in the same place. We all want to be price smart and also be able to move the products that are available to us. So, I\u2019m looking forward to the hearing and Kenny, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re going to represent this real well.\nKenny Rocker: I\u2019m ready. You bet you, Jim.\nJim Vena: Thank you very much for the question.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Jim Vena for closing comments.\nJim Vena: Well, listen, thanks everybody for listening in this morning. We are very excited with what we\u2019ve been able to deliver as a team for our shareholders and what we\u2019ve been able to do safety through the communities that we operate for our employees and we\u2019re very excited that we\u2019ve been able to take the head on challenges that were presented and be able to deliver a quarter that showed improvements both underneath on how we operate and how we operate even safer and the metrics that we\u2019re moving ahead. So, I\u2019m very comfortable where we are. I like our future. I think we got a great railroad and I truly am looking forward to Dallas. I think it\u2019s a great spot to go and have our Investor Day. And, at the Investor Day, we\u2019ll take you through with a little more substance about what we foresee in the future over the next two or three years and what we see in the next year that Union Pacific can deliver. And, I\u2019m looking forward to seeing all of you that can make it in Dallas, wonderful location, great spot for us, an important place for us. So, thank you very much everybody for listening in.\nOperator: This will conclude today\u2019s conference. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Eric Gehringer",
            "content": "Thank you, Kenny, and good morning. Moving to Slide 12. As you heard from Jim, Mother Nature delivered many powerful weather events throughout the quarter as we experienced impactful flooding across both our northern and southern regions. But, we're not here to make excuses. Leveraging our intense focus on operational excellence and detailed contingency plans the team quickly acted to mitigate the impact by adjusting trip plans and deploying temporary buffer resources to safely restore operations. I'm very proud of our frontline employees who worked tirelessly to repair our infrastructure to minimize the customer impact. There are countless examples highlighting their efforts as they repaired miles of damaged track, restored bridges and cleared countless trees and debris. That being said, versus 2023, service levels and network performance for the second quarter remained strong, demonstrating our recoverability in the wake of major weather disruptions. Starting with our foundation of safety, we continue to drive improvements building on the momentum of the first quarter. For the second quarter, both derailment and personal injury rates improved year-over-year. While I am proud of the team for making this progress, we will not rest until every employee goes home safe to their loved ones every day. Freight car velocity was flat in the second quarter compared to 2023 as improvements in terminal dwell were offset by weather impacted train speeds. The opportunity here is to drive even stronger terminal dwell performance by removing unnecessary car touches across the network. On the service front, intermodal SPI improved four points as manifest and auto SPI remained flat. Although we worked hard to minimize impact on weather on our service product, we know customers felt the impact, particularly those located in the affected areas. Now, let's review our key efficiency metrics on Slide 13. The team remains highly focused on cost control, leveraging technology and other investments to drive productivity throughout our operation. As I mentioned last quarter, it is imperative to our strategy as it enables Kenny and the team to compete in the marketplace. Similar to the first quarter, we saw year-over-year improvements across all of our metrics. Locomotive productivity improved 6% compared to second quarter 2023 driven by improved network fluidity and asset utilization. Throughout the year, we have been able to efficiently flex our locomotive fleet with units readily available to adjust to varying volume levels. Workforce productivity, which does include all employees, improved 5% versus 2023. While overall employee levels decreased, our active train, engine and yard employees increased as we implement new labor agreements. Train length improved 2% compared to second quarter 2023 and 3% sequentially due to increased intermodal volume combined with the usage of safety technologies like Precision Train Builder. In fact, our second quarter result was a quarterly record and June marked the first month ever with train length over 9,600 feet. This is a remarkable achievement by the team as they continue to generate mainline capacity for future growth. Wrapping up, it's important to note, as we continue to implement new technology throughout our operation, we are also building new processes. These processes powered by automation and real-time analytics open new capabilities for Union Pacific and our customers. I'm looking forward to sharing such examples at our Investor Day in September. So with that, I'll turn it back to, Jim. Ben, to be very clear, the answer to your question is yes, we can continue to grow it. Now let's make sure we're all on the same page, 2% improvement in the quarter, 3% sequential improvement. To your comment, best quarter we've ever had and June was the highest month in the history of Union Pacific at 9,600 feet. And we want to give a lot of credit to our team. That's hard work to do that. Now when we have conversations about TrainLink, we also got to remind ourselves that since 2019, our mainline derailments are down 42%, while our TrainLink has been up 20%. That's because we continue to invest in technology and science. And that's really going to be the continued foundation of how we keep building this out. Yes, to your point, mix makes a difference, but what makes more of a difference is getting more volume on the railroad like we're seeing with intermodal, that's been a tailwind for us, but also using our Precision Train Builder software as well as other things that continue to identify opportunities for us to do it. And then on a day to day just fundamentally how we run the railroad and we've talked about this before, we still see opportunities to combo trains largely on the bulk side. So yes, there is more opportunity, the team is up against that. I'm looking forward to their continued gains."

            "name": "Jim Vena",
            "content": "Thanks, Rob. And, good morning, and nice to come to you all from a beautiful morning here is Omaha. And, thanks for joining us today to discuss Union Pacific's second quarter results. I'm joined by our Chief Financial Officer, Jennifer Hamann; our Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales, Kenny Rocker; and our Executive Vice President of Operations, Eric Gehringer. As we dive into the discussion of the second quarter, you'll hear that operating outdoors these past few months has not been easy, but I'm pleased with how we manage those challenges to drive strong financial results. It provides another proof point that our strategy is the right one to drive success. Now, let's discuss second quarter results starting on Slide 3. This morning, Union Pacific reported 2024 second quarter net income of $1.7 billion or $2.74 per share. This compares to 2023 second quarter net income of $1.6 billion or $2.57 per share. Second quarter operating revenue was up 1% as solid core pricing gains and slightly increased volume were reduced by a negative business mix and lower fuel surcharge revenue. And, if you're normalizing for the yearly change in fuel, freight revenue was up 2% versus 2023. Reported expenses year-over-year were down 4%. This is very impressive work by the team to offset the high inflationary pressure we've experienced in a flattish volume environment, even when you adjust for one-time items and fuel. Our second quarter operating ratio of 60.0% improved 300 basis points versus last year and despite some challenges, we still showed sequential improvement. Overall, this quarter was another solid step toward our goal of leading the industry in safety, service and operational excellence. I'll let the team walk you through the quarter in more detail and then come back for a wrap up before we go to Q&A. So, we'll start with Jennifer and the Q2 financials. Jennifer? Thank you, Eric. Turning to Slide 15. Before we get to your questions, I'd like to quickly summarize what you've heard from our team. First, as you heard from Jennifer, despite a challenging environment, we achieved strong financial results in the quarter. We continue to drive efficiency into the network and the commercial team has done a good job generating price for the value we provide our customers. Kenny provided you with an overview of the second quarter volumes and laid out some updated thoughts for the remainder of the year. I think it's worth stating that when you remove coal, our total volume was up 3% in the second quarter. This demonstrates that even in a tough freight environment, we are winning with our customers to bring new business to the railroad. Lastly, Eric walked you through the progress we're making across safety, service and operational excellence. In the first half of the year, our safety metrics improved, but we still have a way to go. Our service was challenged in the quarter, but I'm pleased with our ability to recover and we're continuing to do things more efficiently making good improvements in operational excellence. Look the quarter presented its challenges, but I'm very pleased with the results we achieved. From the beginning, I said improvement wasn't going to be a straight line. There are just too many variables when you operate an outdoor factory, but I expect the trend line will be in the right direction and we demonstrated that again this quarter. Over the past 12 months, we've put this company on the right path to redefining what's possible for Union Pacific, a theme we'll build on at our Investor Day in mid-September. With that, now we're ready to take your questions, Rob. Good morning, Brandon. Yes, Brandon, I appreciate the question and you're right on. I think they announced me last year on 26th, we agreed that I was going to join this company and the announcement came up. So, guess what it's a year. Now, I actually didn't start work till the 14th of August, but that's okay, couple of weeks doesn't make a difference. Bottom line is, if I look at the quarter Brandon, I'm very, very, very happy with how we've progressed on this railroad. If you start above the line and Kenny and the entire team have done a great job of, we knew we had an inflationary pressures with the contracts that were signed and we knew that we had to do something above the line and I think we've done a great job and you can see that where the revenue comes in against our volume growth and we continue and we will continue to see that as we go through the year. So, I'm very comfortable with that. Business development, we have been, I have personally spent a lot of time, Kenny and his entire team spends a lot of time and the entire leadership group with customers looking for opportunity and we've spent capital and developed new facilities and expanded facilities across our network to be able to handle more business. But, the best part about it is our service level is to the point where the first discussion isn't, are you providing the service that we agreed to, it's more of how do we work together to move ahead. Operationally below the line very comfortable to be able to present today the numbers that we are on car velocity, dwell, locomotive and things that you all don't see, how fast our crew changes are, how well we're able to and the number of people it takes to operate the terminals, we see those numbers every day and I'm very comfortable of where we are. And, I'm also very happy that we continue to improve our operating ratio and I don't see that stopping. We'll have, I never give a number for operating ratio, because it's a result of everything you do, but to have a 160 basis points improvement this last quarter, year-over-year operating ratio and sequentially a small is a greater testament with what we can do with everything that we were impacted with this customer. We are not a team that makes excuses. You won't hear us complain about coal. We just say that coal is a problem, but to be able to when we had 20% plus drop in our coal volume to actually increase goes to show you the strength of our network. We're going to leverage what we're doing in Mexico with our 26% ownership of the FXE and we think that's going to lead to more growth as we move ahead and we're going to leverage this network we have. So, Brandon, I'm in a real good place. So, hopefully you guys aren't the toughest marketers in the world, because sometimes some of you are. But overall, I'm very happy with where we are today and I look forward to how this next few years while I'm leading this company and show everybody what we can do. You're welcome, Brandon. Good morning, Scott. Thanks for the question, Scott. Thanks for the question. No, I don't see that. I think we've shown that we can improve and I see more improvement even with a flat. I don't expect us to have our volume be flat though. That's not the way we're working at this. Everything that we've done is to increase our volume against some pretty big negatives that are structural that we can't control. So, is it easier when you have increase in volume? Yes, you have another five cars on an intermodal train or a manifest train makes it a lot easier. But, the technology that we're implementing, the speed that we're going to be able to change our plan and what we're doing moving forward will help us to be able to even on a flat volume be able to improve our efficiency. So, I'm very comfortable with, as we move ahead there'll be more even on a flat. Thank you. Good morning. Stephanie, listen, I just sort of answered overall on the high level what I see, but I'm going to pass this off to, Kenny. Kenny, you talked about margin, how we're looking at pricing, how we move ahead. Thanks, Stephanie. Good morning, Brian. Thanks, Brian. Good morning, Ken. Well, Ken, people always want me to start talking about where we I think the endpoint is on this and I think we continue to improve. We're going to have quarters that are better than other quarters, but operationally you should always look at, we give a lot of metrics out there and if you take a look at the metrics, car velocity is real important, dwell time is real important and then of course there's about 100 others that I look at internally that tell me how we're operating and where we need to focus and how we need to do this. So, that's one piece and we are aligned. We've got a great team. They know what the end goal is. So, I see us optimizing the railroad and continue to get better at how we operate. But, what really helps operating ratio and margins is revenue growth, and we are pushing hard on that piece by both bringing in volume at the right price and also pricing because of inflation and everything we've had. So, when you put those two things together, we might have some quarters where sequentially it doesn't improve as much as people would like because it's never a straight line. But, I'm very comfortable. I didn't come back to work. I look at it as I had a sabbatical for a couple of years away from Union Pacific, came on, did what we had to do operationally. I'm back here to drive this place to where is what I see is possible, and I'm very comfortable. And, after the first year, I'm even more comfortable than I was on August 14 when I walked back in the front door. So Ken, it's take a look at those metrics, but take a look at what's happening in our volume and translate that on what we did in the second quarter on revenue against where we were with our carload growth. So, hopefully that gives you a better framing of the way I look at it, Ken. You're welcome. Good morning. Thanks, Tom. Good morning, Chris. Thanks, Chris. Walter, I like the question because that's exactly the way we need to look at it is, we know what we've done before and I could go back to when I was at Canadian National and numbers that were delivered back in 2013 to 2016. So, I know the game of how and the play and how you have to get there to be able to deliver. Is there some things that are structurally different? Yes, the collective agreements are impact to our cost and will follow for a while with us. Now we've done a great job of mitigating some of it, but it's pretty tough to mitigate it all. So, that's a negative that's going to be with us for a while. So, we'll probably carry a few more people than we normally would have if the railroad had not signed some of the last collective agreements. But I look at it this way, I see a clear picture as we move ahead that we can mitigate a lot of that and have a railroad that's very efficient. We're going to use the network we have to optimize our cost structure. We are implementing work patterns and how we operate that will help us. So, I don't think we'll be able to mitigate all of that, but you can also mitigate it by bringing more business on and also leveraging our access to Mexico, leveraging our access to customers. Kenny is a little reserved sometimes in Jennifer, but I'll tell you, we have a railroad that the opportunity is there. And we have discussions, we don't talk about, oh geez, we have some problems with this. We look at what are we going to do, Phoenix, we opened it up because we think there's a market there. Minneapolis, we opened it up. Fritz Intermodal Terminal, we expanded. We spent money in the Gulf and working with customers that want to be with us. So, we do both of those. I say, hang on, watch us go. This is not a short-term. I said it the very first time I was on the call, this is not a short-term fix when you have that kind of inflationary pressure. But I'm very happy that this quarter we were able to deliver another 160 basis points of improvement in our OR with everything that we've done and we're going to have some good quarters, some bad quarters, but I'm telling you in the long run stay tuned Walter. And listen Walter, I've seen as you're you're probably in Canada, I know there's a lot of people that I know from CN and others impacted with fire in my hometown and I wish everybody the best. Well, let me pass it over to Eric and I can't give you the answer, because Eric knows it's a different number than that, but I've got a goal out there, but Eric, it's all yours. Thank you. Thanks for the question. The only thing I would add Bascome is, there's a lot of indicators that tell us that there's a change, what's happening to inflation, overall inflation, CPI, what's happening to the job market and what's happening to the input costs for us. So, those things are trending the right way, but how much of a drop we're going to see next year, we'll see, but I'd rather have that view than where we were a year ago. Thanks for the question. Good morning, Ravi. Thanks for the question. Good morning, Daniel. Yes, I think we built our capital plan. We always build it from bottom up to see what we need to do and we're very comfortable with the $3.4 billion that we have this year and we don't see any substantial difference in our capital plan moving forward. Now, do we do have the capability, you heard us talk about buying back $1.5 billion of shares, you've heard us on the cash that we're producing. So, if we need to, if there's something out there that really we need to spend money on, we'll do that. But, as far as the railroad, the assets, the plant that's fixed, we don't fool around with that. What we need to spend, we spend and then we have also built into that $3.4 billion was development and what we can do to drive more business to our railroad. So, I'm very comfortable, that's the way you should think about it. I don't see a big change as we move ahead. Jennifer, anything else you wanted to add? Okay, thank you. Thanks for the question. Listen, I appreciate the question on the STB. I think we have the exact same goal as the STB on growth. We want to grow our business and I think we've done a, if you actually listen carefully to what we said, we've been able to grow our business even with some markets that are giving us some huge headwinds and that's a pretty good quarter. And, if you watch the carloads that we've so far this month, I'm pretty happy with where we're headed. We're going to have up and down, but we are working hard on that. So, I think it's a great hearing. I'm looking forward to it. I can't make it personally, because we are headed to Dallas and I'm looking forward to those couple of days and that sort of is right in between when we need to be in Dallas, just before it. But, guess who is going and Kenny is going there, he is going to represent us well and I'm looking forward to presenting to everybody to see who Union Pacific is, what we're doing and how we're going to leverage this great franchise to be able to grow our business even with all the challenges that we have. So, I'm excited to hear what all the other railroads have to say and I'm sure we're all in the same place. We all want to be price smart and also be able to move the products that are available to us. So, I'm looking forward to the hearing and Kenny, I'm sure you're going to represent this real well. Thank you very much for the question. Well, listen, thanks everybody for listening in this morning. We are very excited with what we've been able to deliver as a team for our shareholders and what we've been able to do safety through the communities that we operate for our employees and we're very excited that we've been able to take the head on challenges that were presented and be able to deliver a quarter that showed improvements both underneath on how we operate and how we operate even safer and the metrics that we're moving ahead. So, I'm very comfortable where we are. I like our future. I think we got a great railroad and I truly am looking forward to Dallas. I think it's a great spot to go and have our Investor Day. And, at the Investor Day, we'll take you through with a little more substance about what we foresee in the future over the next two or three years and what we see in the next year that Union Pacific can deliver. And, I'm looking forward to seeing all of you that can make it in Dallas, wonderful location, great spot for us, an important place for us. So, thank you very much everybody for listening in."

            "name": "Jennifer Hamann",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 5 with a walk-down of our second quarter income statement, where operating revenue of $6 billion increased 1% versus last year on slightly positive volume. As Kenny will highlight, this strong topline performance was supported by solid pricing gains and business wins against the backdrop of weak coal demand. Second quarter freight revenue totaled $5.6 billion, a 1% gain. Digging into the revenue components, strong core pricing gains partially offset by an unfavorable business mix added 150 basis points to freight revenue. Double-digit growth in international intermodal volume was the primary contributor to the negative mix dynamic and further compounded by an overall decline in our higher average revenue per car industrial business. Slightly positive volumes in the quarter added 50 basis points to freight revenue. And lastly, fuel surcharge revenue of $669 million declined 5% as lower fuel prices impacted freight revenue 75 basis points. Excluding fuel surcharge, freight revenue grew 2% as the team continues to pace revenue growth faster than volume. Wrapping up the topline, other revenue declined 6% as a result of lower intermodal accessorials and less demand for auto parts shipments at our Loup subsidiary. Switching to expenses, second quarter operating expense of $3.6 billion decreased $152 million versus 2023 as we drove productivity across most cost categories. We have more details in the appendix, but let me highlight some of the performance drivers. Compensation and benefits expense declined 6% versus last year as we reduced headcount 5% and generated positive productivity. Although our training pipeline is significantly reduced compared to 2023, train service employees increased 1% as we continue to carry more train service employees as a buffer for our operations and to offset the impact of new labor agreements. The remainder of the workforce decreased 9% as we continue to focus on delayering and pushing work down in the organization. And, as you'll recall, last year's expenses included a $67 million one-time ratification payment. Following up on an item we highlighted at our first quarter report, last month we completed the transfer of around 350 mechanical employees to Metro in Chicago. Going forward, this transfer will lower both other revenue and our expenses by roughly $15 million a quarter. Excluding last year's one-time labor payment, cost per employee in the second quarter increased 4% as we continue to drive for better overall efficiency. Fuel expense in the quarter declined 6% on a 5% decrease in fuel prices from $2.86 per gallon to $2.73 per gallon. We overcame a challenging operating environment and less fuel efficient freight mix to improve our fuel consumption rate 1% largely by locomotive productivity. Equipment and other rents declined 12%, reflecting improved cycle times and lower lease expense, partially offset by business mix. Finally, other expense decreased 4% as we recorded a couple of one-time items in the quarter. On the positive side, we added a $46 million gain from an intermodal equipment sale. Conversely, we recognized $23 million of additional environmental expense at a legacy California remediation site. Second quarter operating income of $2.4 billion increased 9% versus last year. Below the line, other income increased 11% as a result of interest received on tax refund claims, while interest expense declined 6% on lower average debt levels. Second quarter net income of $1.7 billion and earnings per share of $2.74 both improved 7% versus 2023. Our quarterly operating ratio of 60% improved 300 basis points year-over-year. As I just discussed, there were several puts and takes in the quarter. Key here is that our core operations drove 160 basis points of OR improvement and $0.21 of EPS growth year-over-year. This is a great continuation of the momentum we've created these past three quarters. Turning to shareholder returns in the balance sheet on Slide 6, second quarter cash from operations totaled $4 billion up $175 million versus last year. Growth in operating income and 2023 labor agreement payments partially offset by higher income tax payments resulted in the increase in cash from operations and our free cash flow improvement, up 43% to $853 million. As stated back in April, we restarted share repurchases late in the second quarter. Although we plan to ramp up repurchases through the year, we started slowly with just over $100 million repurchased in June. Combined with our dividend payments, we've returned $1.7 billion to shareholders year-to-date. Finally, our adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio finished the quarter at 2.8 times and we continue to be A rated by our three credit rating agencies. Wrapping up on Slide 7, as we've reached the midway point of 2024, there remains some uncertainty about the second half recovery that many were forecasting. As Kenny will detail, there are definitely markets where we're seeing growth and much of that growth is being driven by our business development efforts. There also are some challenge markets, particularly coal. Operationally, the team is making great progress towards our long-term goals to be the best in safety, service and operational excellence. This is reflected in the progress in our safety and performance metrics, including our margins. Importantly, we believe the trend is indicative of where we can get to long-term and each successive quarter is a step on our way to winning. We are highly confident in our ability to generate price dollars in excess of inflation dollars and still expect freight revenue to pace ahead of volume in 2024. We also remain committed to our long-term capital allocation strategy. This includes last week's announcement of a 3% increase in our dividend as we drive higher returns to our owners. This increase represents the 18th year in a row of annual dividend increases. With share repurchases, we expect to repurchase around $1.5 billion in 2024 as we maintain our current leverage. Before I turn it over to Kenny, I'd summarize our second quarter financial performance as strong and our confidence in the future stronger as we continue to unlock the potential of our great franchise. We're excited to execute on our strategy in the second half and lay out more of our long-term thoughts at our Investor Day in September. Kenny? Well, so a couple of things there, Scott. On the mix side of things, as we look ahead, a lot of the drivers that were present in our volumes here in the second quarter are going to be present at least into the third quarter. International intermodal is staying strong, coal is weaker, the industrial portion of our portfolio, while we've got great business development opportunities, there's just a little softness there. And so, if you assume that, that dynamic continues, that's going to continue to have an impact on our mix, probably to the negative side. So, I mean, you guys get our volumes every week, you'll be able to see that, engage that, but that's kind of our going in expectation as we look at what's ahead of us, particularly into the third quarter and we'll see how some of those intermodal trends move into 4Q. In terms of the question relative to price and price accretion, the team is doing, I think, a very good job of driving price in the areas where they can touch it and actively work with the customers. Jim mentioned the service aspect of it, that's critical when you're sitting in front of customers and driving the price. And so, the thing that I'm very encouraged by is we know we'll get to that point. I'm not going to give you a date by which we'll get to that point. But, what's encouraging is without that, we're still driving very solid margin improvement and looking for more going ahead. So, that's what I would focus on. And, as we continue to get more access to contracts, that's just going to give us more upside and more ability going forward. I mean, when you think about seasonality, I'll jump in here. It really has a lot to do with volumes. And, if you look at our volume performance, generally speaking, the quarters where we have the strongest volume growth, that's where you tend to get your greatest margin improvement. It goes back to Jim's comments on productivity and that volume leverage piece. That said, we've shown really good sequential improvement in our margins and have kind of broke that trend as we've really come in and put a big focus on how we can drive greater productivity across the network over the last three quarters. And quite frankly, I think that's something that maybe is a little bit underappreciated in terms of how hard it has been for the team to achieve that. Looking forward, it really is going to be about the volumes and the continued emphasis on the productivity and the price. Those are our three levers. And so, as you're thinking sequentially, I'd be comparing volumes sequentially and see how that progresses. That's going to really be the determinant. Okay. And, then in terms of your question about the Investor Day and what's possible, that really is going to be how we're going to frame things and that's certainly been Jim's challenge to the team since he came here a little over a year ago, is don't look back at what you've done historically, don't look back and see what you think has been best ever, look forward and see what you really do think we can achieve together with this great franchise that we have. So, I don't want to front run things too much with you, Brian. We want to make sure folks tune in September. But, we're excited about the message and the opportunity to speak to everybody and share some of our plans. Yes, thanks for the question, Bascome. So, coming into the year, we said that we thought our full-year inflation would be around 5% or so. I think we're probably tracking pretty close to that. We're seeing some wins in some of the purchased service categories, seeing a little bit greater acceptance in the marketplace, few more people coming into bid. So, that's encouraging and certainly that's an opportunity for us to get a little bit better pricing on that purchase services side of the world. Same with materials to a certain extent, obviously that plays more into our CapEx spend than it does the OE, but both are very important to us, right. We're looking to control costs at every turn. Comp and benefits certainly is a big piece of our expenses. That inflation, I would say, is still probably running around that 5% level that we talked to coming into the year. I think as you all know, we've got a 4.5% wage increase that became effective. The last one in this round of negotiations became effective July 1 for our craft professionals. So, I don't see a lot changing there. It's just some moving pieces and parts and we're trying to find areas where we can try to mitigate that either through our productivity, through our purchasing and how we're just running the railroad in general. And obviously, that's the task that we have up against Kenny and his team is, these are the inflationary pressures that we're facing, this is what's going into the cost structure and we need to go out there, have those tough conversations and the team is doing that and I feel very confident about that. Yes. I mean, it's too soon to say, Bascome, at this point. But boy, my hope is that we're talking about a number that's less than 5% next year as we move in. It seems like all of those indicators are moving in the right direction, but we'll look at that. I think to your point though, when I look back historically, we used to talk about an inflation rate that was around 2%. I don't think we're going to get back to those levels, but certainly, we're going to work to push it down below 5%. No, you hit it just right. Yes, I mean, so I'll jump in here. I mean, the priorities for our cash spending, we've been, I think, very clear on. First dollar goes back into the business, then we prioritize our dividend, which again, just you saw that we gave the 3% increase here last week and then the excess cash is going to share. So yes, if we have, if you look historically at what we've put into our share repurchase program, it's been greater than the $1.5 billion. Some of that's been using balance sheet capacity. We don't intend to add any leverage this year. We feel good about our leverage levels, but we're going to try to drive more cash and if that's available, we would put it to shares."

            "name": "Kenny Rocker",
            "content": "Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning. As Jennifer mentioned, we had a solid second quarter, especially if you put aside the lower volume from coal. Freight revenues totaled $5.6 billion for the quarter, which was up 2% excluding fuel surcharges due to strong core pricing and a slight increase in volume. Let's jump right in and talk about the key drivers in each of our business groups. Starting with our Bulk segment. Revenue for the quarter was down 2% compared to last year on a 5% decrease in volume and a 3% increase in average revenue per car driven by solid core pricing gains and a positive mix in traffic. However, if you exclude coal, Bulk revenue for the quarter was up 4% year-over-year and volume grew by 6%. Coal volume was down 23% in the quarter due to ongoing secular decline of the market along with continued challenges from lower natural gas prices and higher inventory levels. Fertilizer volumes increased for the quarter due to strong export demand for Canpotex potash and easier comps from a 2023 customer outage. In addition, grain products business was favorable due to increased demand for renewable diesel, strong demand for ethanol and new business wins. Moving to Industrial, revenue was up 2% for the quarter on a 3% decrease in volume and a 5% increase in average revenue per car. Strong core pricing gains and a positive mix in traffic were partially offset by lower fuel surcharges. Our strong business development efforts in petroleum allowed us to capitalize on opportunities. Petrochemicals volume continued to grow due to improved domestic demand in plastics and strong business development wins in our industrial chemicals markets from customers located along the Gulf Coast. However, challenges with high inventories and rainy weather in the South negatively impacted our rock volumes. Premium revenue for the quarter was up 4% on a 6% increase in volume and a 2% decrease in average revenue per car reflecting negative mix, lower fuel surcharges and truck market pressure. Automotive volumes were positive due to business development wins with Volkswagen and General Motors, but offset by unplanned decreases in production impacting auto parts shipments. Intermodal volumes continue to remain strong due to West Coast import demand and positive domestic growth despite market conditions especially within our Parcels segment. Now, turning to Slide 10. Here's our outlook for the balance of 2024 for the key markets we serve. Starting with Bulk, coal is expected to remain challenged as inventories remain high and natural gas futures stay at levels that make coal less competitive. For grain, as we sit here today, the markets look stable and healthy although global export sales are off to a slow start. Crop conditions look good and we'll have a better read over the next several weeks. In addition, we expect grain products to remain positive as we see incremental renewable diesel production coming online in California and continue to capture new business. Turning to Industrial. Our outlook remains the same as we laid out during our last earnings call. We expect our rock market will not match last year's record volume. However, both petroleum and petrochemical markets will remain favorable due to our focus on business development supported by our investments in the Gulf Coast. And, wrapping up with Premium, on the intermodal side, we expect to see continued strength for imports in the near-term. And, while we have seen imports drive pockets of increased demand, on the domestic side, the overall market remains soft. But, our improved service product, along with our diversified set of private asset owners and IMCs provide Union Pacific more at bet when opportunities present themselves. And for automotive, we're still expecting year-over-year growth due to business development wins despite some softening in the market. In summary, I'm proud of the commercial team and their focus to fill the volume gap we're seeing from coal. On the price side, we're achieving solid price results to overcome inflation and delivering the consistent and efficient service that we sold to our customers. As we head into the second half of the year, I am confident that our great franchise, along with the diverse product offerings we provide, gives our customers the ability to compete and win in the marketplace. Our commercial leaders are actively working with customers and the operating team to convert more over the road business to rail that allows us both to win and grow. And with that, I'll turn it over to Eric, to review our operational performance. Yes, Jason, you're right, on. We've seen some NLG products down in the Gulf that have been delayed or slow roll. And, a lot of it also is just overall demand and we haven't had the best weather, haven't seen that in that second quarter. So yes, it is. I will tell you this though, Jason, Eric's team is doing everything they can to capture the volume that is out there. We're looking at adding every car to every train that we can to maximize efficiency. So, as the opportunities are there we're taking advantage of it. I think, it's wait and see. It's hard for us to go out and forecast what a lot of the customers will do and how the contractors will play out. Our best bet is just to be prepared, which we are. Yes, yes. Thanks for that, Jim. So, first of all, you all have heard me say that before, when you look at our approach to revenue growth, it's volume growth through business development, but it's also our pricing approach. And, our commercial team has been very clear to articulate some of the inflationary pressures that are out there. But more importantly, the team has taken risks. And so, we are doing as these contracts are coming up everything we can do to maximize price or margin expansion. And so at every turn, at every contract, those are some with our service improving, Eric, those are some really good opportunities for us to maximize our price. So, we're doing everything we can do there. Yes, let me take this, the first one on international intermodal. So first of all, yes, we've seen some very strong growth on the international intermodal side and yes, we have seen some of that spillover on the domestic intermodal side. And, I want to touch on the fact that our product development, meaning the investment that we've made efficient investments in places like Inland Empire helping us to grow. Here recently, even though it's a short-term phenomenon because of the labor issues up in Canada. We're not going to just take that volume in the short-term. We're doing everything we can to get it permanently. We won a piece of business into our Twin Cities Inland Intermodal Terminal and that's the way we can take advantage again of the product development that's out there. So, that's the international intermodal. I talked a little bit about the fact that yes, we are seeing quite a bit that's being transloaded that's showing up on the domestic side and our products are helping grow. In fact, when we look at our domestic business, year-over-year in the quarter it was up and we feel pretty good about where it started off here in this quarter. So, that's some real specific feedback for you. Yes. Thank you, Tom. So, you've got a few macroeconomic indicators like, industrial production, not strong, housing starts aren't helping us either and then you know where natural gas prices are. So, we don't get the rollover and play dead, because coal is not where it needs to be. The commercial team is out there hustling and getting more business. Let me talk about some of the areas that I feel good about from a business development perspective. Renewable diesel, I'll start with that. That's an emerging market. I've been really excited that the team has been out there growing origin points and destination points. It allows us to pitch and catch. On the petrochemical side in the Gulf, we talked about the investments there and the wins that we've been able to get in that petrochemical market. And then, on the Premium side, I'll talk about it from a couple of angles. One is Mexico will continue to be a market over the near-term and long-term. And, you've seen that Eric side has put up some really good products up against it as we talk about that north south quarter getting into the Midwest and products in terms of getting into the Southeast and then bought quite a few new products coming out of Houston, going into Phoenix, setting up our ramp and expanding in different areas. So, in some cases, we have to create our own markets to make the pie larger and that's exactly what you're seeing. Both domestic and our international intermodal. It's still very unclear for us. I'm not in a position to forecast where it is. All I'm telling you is that we're going to go out and make our own markets where we can and we're doing that through the product development that I mentioned and working with customers. The short answer is yes. The long answer is that every contract is unique, every customer is unique, every discussion is unique. We're mixing that with what's happening on the service side. A stronger service product is helping us. We've always been very price disciplined as a company. What you're seeing is that now we're able to take a little bit more risk as we're talking to our customers because of the inflationary pressures that are out there. Yes. I'll start with coal first and then work my way back. And again, coal is a natural gas prices are all over the place. If you look at April, they were the lowest on record for a few years and as we move throughout the quarter by June they had bounced back up. It's very difficult to go out and forecast based on that. We talked about preparedness. We're talking with Eric's team daily to make sure we can capture the demand that's out there. I've been very encouraged that our commercial team is talking to each coal customer, each coal receiver one by one to see when they can add in set. So, we're doing everything we can to influence the demand there. So, overall demand, let's just talk about a few things. One, on the international, intermodal side, that's been a strength for us. I think that will stay with us at least for the quarter. I can't see out further than that. I talked about a little bit earlier the positives we're seeing from that on the domestic side and the products that we have up against it to go out there and grow. Grain, you had a question about grain. Hey, look, the crop looks great right now as it stands today. The demand looks what I call stable. We'll see what happens on the export market. But while we are waiting for the export market, our commercial team is engaging those domestic receivers. And Mexico is also an area from a business development perspective that we want. So, we can't just wait around for some of these markets to help us out. We're doing something about it and making something happen. Automotive, same thing. We talked about the wins. What I hadn't talked about is that we've had some products where Eric has helped us out where we've had land bridge opportunities. So, again very specific actions up against the service and the product to really help overcome some of these other macroeconomic challenges on the housing and industrial side. Yes. So, the pipeline is strong. It's a robust pipeline. We feel good about the pipeline both near-term and over the next couple of years. The conversion rates haven't changed. We keep an eye on that. I know where it is there. What we saw here recently is the realization rates, meaning if a customer said, hey, it's going to be 100 cars, it wasn't as high as 100 cars. And, so you would expect as the markets improve that realization rate to also go up. Again, we're looking at the same macroeconomic indicators. Hey, if housing starts to move, you know what, that moves a lot of things. That's cement, that's PVC, that's roofing, that's the carpet that goes in there, that's glass, that's the soda ash we move. We play a role in all those products. And so, we'll see where that happens. But, the theme here is that the markets are going to do what the markets are going to do. We are going out and creating our own markets again through product development and business development and doing it as efficiently as possible as we can. David, Jim, I'll take the first one. So look, we've been 18 months now, a little bit over 18 months where domestic intermodal pricing has either been going down or just staying at the bottom. And, I'm not going to sit here today and try to forecast when it's going to move up, which I'm highlighting the 18 months because it's been quite a time here and so we'll see what happens. Here is the key thing I want you to focus on is that I mentioned here recently we've been able to see some year-over-year growth on domestic intermodal. We've got a group of private asset providers that give us a lot of add backs, a lot of options and we've been really as a company doubling down on our product development. So, that when things change, and they will change, but I'm not going to forecast it, we'll be prepared. I'm ready. You bet you, Jim."

[Operator Instructions] A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website.\n It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jim Vena, Chief Executive Officer for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Vena. You may now begin. \nVincenzo Vena: Thanks, Rob, and good morning to everyone. Beautiful day in Omaha, 60 degrees, a little bit of rain. It is absolutely perfect for railroading. So why don't we get started? And thank you for joining us today to discuss Union Pacific's first quarter results.\n I'm joined in Omaha by our Chief Financial Officer, Jennifer Hamann; our Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales, Kenny Rocker; and our Executive Vice President of Operations, Eric Gehringer.  \n As you'll hear from the team, we continue to execute our multiyear strategy to establish Union Pacific as the industry leader in safety, service and operational excellence. We, again, took positive steps towards that goal in the first quarter. While challenges outside our control persists, we are establishing a foundation for long-term success.\n Now let's discuss first quarter results starting on Slide 3. This morning, Union Pacific reported 2024 1st quarter net income of $1.6 billion or $2.69 per share. This compares to 2023 1st quarter net income of $1.6 billion or $2.67 per share. We're pleased to be able to report earnings growth in a tough environment, especially since last year's results included a $0.14 per share real estate gain.\n First quarter operating revenue was flat as solid core pricing gains and a positive business mix were offset by lower fuel surcharge revenue and reduced volumes. Normalizing for the impact from fuel surcharge, freight revenue was up 4% versus last year. Expenses year-over-year were down 3%, driven by lower fuel prices and productivity gains. This was partially offset by inflation, increased transportation workforce levels to compensate for new labor agreements and higher depreciation. \n Our first quarter operating ratio of 60.7% improved 140 basis points versus last year. This also represents a 20 basis point improvement sequentially from the fourth quarter, which further demonstrates the strong work by the team. Look, it's a great start to the year. I'm pleased with how the Union Pacific team is coming together to unlock what's possible for our company. But there's a lot of work to do. I'll let the team walk you through the quarter in more detail, and I'll come back and wrap it up before we go to question and answer.\n So with that, Jennifer, why don't you go through the first quarter financials? \nJennifer Hamann: All right. Thanks, Jim, and good morning. I'll begin with a walkdown of our first quarter income statement on Slide 5, where operating revenue of $6 billion was flat versus last year on a 1% volume decline that was significantly driven by a 20% reduction in coal shipments. In fact, excluding coal, volumes would have been up close to 2% year-over-year even in this tough freight environment.\n Looking in at the revenue components further, total freight revenue of $5.6 billion declined 1%. The single largest driver of the year-over-year decrease was a 25% reduction in fuel surcharge revenue to $665 million as lower fuel prices negatively impacted freight revenue 375 basis points. Solid core pricing gains and a favorable business mix combined to add 350 basis points to freight revenue. Reduced coal and rock shipments as well as increased soda ash and petroleum carloads drove the positive mix dynamic. Excluding fuel surcharge, freight revenue grew 4%, a solid start to the year and a demonstration of the great diversity of the UP franchise. \n Wrapping up the top line, other revenue increased 4%, driven by increased accessorial revenue that included a one-time contract settlement of $25 million. Switching to expenses, operating expense of $3.7 billion decreased 3%, as we generated solid productivity against lower demand. Digging deeper into a few of the expense lines, compensation and benefits expense was up 4% versus last year. First quarter workforce levels decreased 2% as reductions in non-transportation employees more than offset a 4% increase in our active TE&Y workforce. Although our training pipeline is significantly reduced, we continue to carry additional train services employees as a buffer for our operations and to offset the impact of newly available sick pay benefits and work rest agreements.\n While talking about workforce levels, I do want to mention one quick housekeeping item. As some of you might be aware, we are in the process of transferring operating responsibility for certain passenger lines in Chicago to Metro. As part of that, in June, we will be transferring around 350 mechanical employees to Metro. On a quarterly basis, this will lower both revenue and expense by roughly $15 million. Cost per employee in the first quarter increased 5%, reflecting wage inflation and additional costs associated with new labor agreements. Fuel expense in the quarter declined 14% on a 13% decrease in fuel prices from $3.22 per gallon to $2.81 per gallon. \n We also improved our fuel consumption rate by 1% as locomotive productivity more than offset a less fuel-efficient business mix given the decline in coal shipments. Purchased Services & Materials expense decreased 6% versus last year, as we maintained a smaller active locomotive fleet, and our logistics subsidiary incurred less drayage expense. In addition, a little less than half of the year-over-year variance related to resolution of a contract dispute. \n Finally, Equipment & Other Rents declined 8%, reflecting a more fluid network seen through improved cycle times and lower lease expenses. By controlling the controllables in our cost structure, first quarter operating income of $2.4 billion increased 3% versus last year. Below the line, Jim noted last year's real estate transaction and other income, and our interest expense declined 4% on lower average debt levels. First quarter net income of $1.6 billion and earnings per share of $2.69 both improved 1% versus 2023. And our quarterly operating ratio of 60.7% improved 140 basis points year-over-year, which includes a 60 basis point headwind from lower fuel prices.\n Turning to shareholder returns and the balance sheet on Slide 6. First quarter cash from operations totaled $2.1 billion, up roughly $280 million versus last year. Growth in operating income as well as the impact from 2023 labor agreement payments are reflected in that increase. In addition, free cash flow and our cash flow conversion rate both showed nice improvements. As planned, we paid down $1.3 billion of debt maturities in March. That resulted in our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio declining to 2.9x at the end of the quarter, and we continue to be A-rated by our 3 credit rating agencies. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends totaling $795 million.\n Wrapping things up on Slide 7. As you'll hear from Kenny, our overall outlook on the freight environment hasn't changed a lot since January. Yes, there have been some pluses and minuses from our original outlook, but in totality, we still see the same economic uncertainty. What I am certain of, however, is that our service product is meeting and will continue to meet the demand in the marketplace. And when volumes strengthen, we will be ready to provide our customers with the service they need to grow with us. In addition, as evidenced by our first quarter results, we will continue to generate productivity that improves our network efficiency.\n Also demonstrated by those first quarter results is our commitment to generating pricing dollars in excess of inflation dollars. If you set fuel aside, our price commitment as well as expectations for positive mix in 2024 should allow us to pace freight revenue ahead of volume.\n And finally, with capital allocation, we plan to start -- restart share repurchases in the second quarter, a further demonstration of the confidence we have in our strategy and the momentum that is building. The actions we're taking to improve safety, service and operational excellence are reflected in our financials, and continuing on with this strategy will drive shareholder value in 2024 and well into the future.\n Let me turn it over to Kenny now to provide an update on the business environment. \nKenny Rocker: Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning. As Jennifer mentioned, freight revenues totaled $5.6 billion for the quarter, which was down 1% as core pricing was offset by lower fuel surcharges and a 1% drop in volume. \n Let's jump right in and talk about the key drivers in each of our business groups. Starting with Bulk, revenue for the quarter was down 4% compared to last year on a 5% decrease in volume and a 1% increase in average revenue per car. Solid core pricing gains across most Bulk segments were largely offset by low natural gas prices that unfavorably impacted our coal index contracts and lower on fuel surcharges. \n As stated, coal continued to face difficult market conditions in the first quarter as warmer temperatures overall led to record low natural gas prices and caused significant declines in demand. Grain and grain products volume was up for the quarter with increased shipments of corn to Mexico as well as more shipments from Canadian origins. Lastly, despite strong truck competition, food and refrigerated shipments increased as a result of new business for dry goods solid demand and network service improvement.\n Moving to Industrial. Revenue was up 4% for the quarter, driven by a 1% increase in volume. Strong core pricing gains and a positive mix in traffic were partially offset by lower fuel surcharges. Our strong business development efforts in petroleum allowed us to capitalize on windows of opportunity along with new domestic contract wins. Demand improved for our Petrochemicals business in both export and domestic markets. However, challenges with high inventories and weather negatively impacted our rock volumes. \n Premium revenue for the quarter was down 3% on a 1% increase in volume and a 4% decrease in average revenue per car, reflecting lower fuel surcharges and truck market pressures. Automotive volumes were positive due to business development wins with Volkswagen and General Motors, along with continued strength from dealer inventory replenishment. Intermodal volumes were positive in the quarter, driven by strong international West Coast demand, which was partially offset by the international contract loss I mentioned in January and soft market conditions in domestic intermodal.\n Turning to Slide 10. Here is our 2024 outlook as we see it today for the key markets we serve. Starting with Bulk, we anticipate continued challenges in coal as inventories are projected to be at record levels and natural gas futures remain depressed. We are hopefully watching grain, particularly as it relates to new crop conditions and fourth quarter export demand. We expect domestic grain demand to be stable. \n Lastly, we are optimistic about grain products, as we continue to see growth in biofuel feedstocks. Additionally, we recently won incremental grain products business out of Iowa that started moving earlier this year by demonstrating our consistent service products and developing competitive solutions to support our customer's business. \n Turning to Industrial. The rock market will be challenged to exceed last year's record volume. However, we expect petroleum and petrochem markets to remain favorable due to our focus on business development, supported by our investments in the Gulf Coast and operational excellence.\n And finally, for Premium, on the intermodal side, we expect to see consistent, strong West Coast imports in the near term, but it's still too early to predict what will happen in the back half of the year. On the domestic intermodal side, we continue to see market softness, but expect our strong service products and diversified set of IMC and private asset partners will set us up well when demand returns. For Automotive, we will see continued strength due to our business development wins and improved OEM production. \n In summary, coal and domestic intermodal will put pressure on our volumes this year, but the team has taken action. As you saw in the first quarter, excluding fuel, we were able to grow revenue even as we face lower volumes overall. I am confident that with our improved service products, we will continue to win new business and take trucks off the road. On the price side, we are having deliberate conversations with customers on price increases to overcome inflationary pressures. And those conversations are backed up by an efficient service product that Eric's team has given to our customers so that they can compete and win.\n We have a great franchise, along with being the premier cross-border rail provider to and from Mexico that positions us well to serve markets in both the U.S. and Mexico. Our legacy service and the new service offerings we've added allows us to win in the marketplace, and we see strong opportunities in front of us to grow with our customers. \n And with that, I'll turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance. \nEric Gehringer: Thank you, Kenny, and good morning. Moving to Slide 12. We exited 2023 with strong operational momentum across the board. And while weather quickly presented its challenges, the team rose to the task. The speed with which our service product recovered is a testament to our strategy and the resiliency of our network. We continue to see meaningful year-over-year improvements in our metrics. This is a direct result of our steadfast focus on providing industry-leading safety, service and operational excellence.  \n Starting with Freight Car Velocity. Improvements in terminal dwell and overall network fluidity led to a 4% improvement compared to first quarter 2023. Sequentially, Freight Car Velocity declined 6%, primarily due to shifts in product mix between our Bulk, Manifest and Intermodal services. Particularly, we are seeing an impact from declines in Intermodal and Bulk shipments, which generally contribute higher average daily car miles. Key is that our service product remains consistent, and we are delivering what we sold to our customers. We want our customers to win. And if they win, we win. \n To further deliver on the service we sold to our customers, we recently introduced a new measure Service Performance Index, or SPI. As the name implies, it's a combined metric that reflects the actual service provided, and we believe it's a better measure than trip plan compliance alone. For those customers with specific transit commitments, we measure against that. And for the many customers who rely on our historical performance to inform their rail transportation planning decision, SPI provides a measure that aligns with this practice. \n For the first quarter, both Intermodal and Manifest and Auto SPI saw a sizable 14 and 7-point year-over-year improvement, respectively. The team also delivered safety performance in the quarter, both on derailment and personal injury fronts. As we continue to emphasize the culture of safety, we're also investing in technology and process, ensuring our employees have the tools they need to operate safely and efficiently. Our goal is clear, we want to lead the industry and drive tangible change so everyone goes home safely each day.\n Now let's review our key efficiency metrics on Slide 13. While maintaining focus on enhancing safety and service, it is equally crucial that we do so in a cost-effective manner, enabling Kenny and the team to compete in a broader range of markets. In alignment with this objective, we saw year-over-year improvement across all of our first quarter metrics, indicating that the efficiency of our railroad is on the right track. \n Locomotive productivity improved 10% compared to first quarter 2023, as the team continues to run an efficient operation and a transportation plan that requires fewer locomotives to satisfy the demands of the business. In fact, we have reduced our active fleet by about 500 locomotives compared to last year.\n Workforce productivity, which includes all employees, improved 1% as average daily car miles declined slightly and employees decreased 2% compared to 2023. While overall workforce counts declined, our train, engine and yard employees increased 4%, as we continue to support our training pipeline, scheduled work agreements and provide the capacity buffer necessary to navigate an ever-changing environment. \n Train length improved 1% compared to first quarter 2023. After a particularly challenging January due to winter weather, we quickly adjusted to set train length records in both February and March. Notably, manifest train length increased by around 300 feet. While train length increased for nearly all train categories year-over-year, declines in intermodal shipments, which generally move on longer trains, moderated sequential performance. \n Although we are encouraged by these results, there are ample opportunities ahead for us to further improve asset utilization and the efficiency of our network. For instance, we are leveraging technology to automate terminal functions and engineering renewal activities, increasing energy management utilization to improve fuel consumption and developing car plan optimizers to reduce car touches. While these are just a few of key initiatives, running a safe, reliable and efficient railroad for all our stakeholders is vital. And as we move forward, we will continue pushing the envelope in our pursuit of industry-leading safety, service and operational excellence.\n So with that, I'll turn it back to Jim. \nVincenzo Vena: Thank you, Eric. Turning now to Slide 15. Before we get to your questions, I'd like to quickly summarize what you've heard from our team. First, as you heard from Jennifer and Kenny, our volume outlook in some markets continues to be challenged. We are mitigating those challenges by driving efficiency in the network, which is driving stronger financial returns, and this provides confidence to start repurchasing shares in the second quarter.\n Kenny provided you with an overview of the first quarter volumes and laid out some updated thoughts for the year. Coal is going to be a headwind. It is what it is. We need to outperform what our markets give us naturally to offset that impact. And if we provide the service we sold to our customers, I'm confident they'll grow with us. It's also imperative that we generate pricing for the value we're providing our customers.\n Lastly, Eric walked you through the progress we're making across safety, service and operational excellence. When I look at how we're performing, I see improvement across the board. The network is operating fluidly and efficiently, allowing us to meet the demand in the market. And that drove the financial success, as you saw here in the first quarter. There's certainly more to do, but we're on the right path.\n At the end of the day, we're demonstrating continuous improvement, getting a little better each day. In the long run, our focus on being the best across the spectrum will generate sustainable long-term value for the years ahead. \n One final item for you all, a Save the Date. We are planning an Investor Day on September 18 and 19 in Dallas, Texas. More details to follow, but we're excited to lay out more of our vision to demonstrate what's possible for this great company of ours.\n And with that, Rob, we're ready to take on some of the questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. \nDavid Vernon: So it seems like the operations are working pretty well, Jim. I'd like you to maybe talk about kind of what you're doing with Kenny and his team to start focusing on growth that's maybe different or hasn't been done at UNP in the past. We know there's been a couple of the joint services with the CN and the Falcon and stuff like that. But internally in terms of focusing the team on more business development efforts, can you just kind of talk to us a little bit about what kind of changes you're making or what kind of initiatives you're emphasizing to start driving a little bit more growth on the networks? \nVincenzo Vena: You bet. David, thanks for the question. And I'll just summarize real quick what we're doing. And then, Kenny, maybe you want to get into a little bit more of the specifics, okay? So if we look at what we're doing on the railroad side, and that's very important in how we're going to be able to grow and grow with our customers is our customers -- some customers we have expect speed and resiliency in the model. And others, it is -- speed is less of a concern. It is consistency in the model. So if you take a look at what we're doing, we are building the fundamental blocks that we are able to provide a service like no one else. We can go from and we're out there selling it. So in the high-speed market to market, we have a service that operates very high speed, 2,000 miles in less than 2 days, that makes us competitive against other modes of transportation.\n If we look at the consistency, we want our customers to win. And the best way for us to grow is with the customers that we have, whether it's the automobile business that we handle, whether it's the export business that we handle, whether it's in the Gulf, whether it's our access into Mexico and our interchanges with the other railroads and how we can originate, and we all win together. So we're doing all of that. I'm spending -- Eric might say, I'm not -- he wishes I would spend more time on some other things, so I still look at the operation. It's still there. I think there's a lot more that needs to be delivered.\n And when you do an analysis, and the way I like to do a regression analysis on what the operation is like, I'm comfortable, but there's more to do. And the pressure is on to be more consistent and faster and be able to deliver a better service product. We do that, we win. But I've also spent a lot of time with Kenny and his team and myself personally, meeting with customers, understanding what they need to win, our present customers and future customers. And I think we continue down this path with consistent service. And the value that we can provide to customers for them to grow is such that they want to partner with UP, and we want to partner with them because we want our customers to win, and I really like where we are. And if we can keep this consistency, David, going, which I'm very confident we can, then I think, Kenny, I hate to tell you, it should be pretty easy for you to grow the business in a way you go. \nKenny Rocker: All right. So look, David, you hit it on the head. What are we doing differently? And I just want to talk to you about some of the product development that Eric and I and our teams are doing together. You look at the Phoenix ramp. We're excited about it. We're seeing that volume come in there and grow sequentially. It just gives our customers and BCOs more optionality.\n Port of Houston is one. We put that service back on. We've been excited about the growth that we've seen come out of there, and we'll continue to add on to the destinations that are there. We started off with 5, now we're at 11. You look at Inland Empire, we just added on a new product there. Now we're going to 20 cities, east of Chicago with the CSX and the NS on the unit train side. Because we are seeing the cycle times improve, we're naturally getting more volume, so we like that piece.\n On the finished vehicle side, you talk about product development. business that's coming off of the water that's getting land bridge that we're moving back east. Look, this lower cost that we have really opens up new markets for us at great margins. So we're on offense. I mean we're pushing every lever we can to get business onto our network. We got a beautiful franchise, as Jim mentioned, and we're taking advantage of it. \nDavid Vernon: All right. If I could maybe squeak one quick follow-up. How is the FXE performing with the extra volume? I know south of the border, there's been a lot that shipped over onto that. And then, are you thinking about sort of expanding capacity over the Eagle Pass Gateway to maybe accommodate future growth out of Mexico? \nVincenzo Vena: David, real quick, I've spent a lot of time, I think I've made like 8 or 9 trips down to Mexico already in the 8 months I've been here, working very closely with FXE with our ownership position in them. We know where the points of concern are. FXE has done a good job of identifying what they have to do, and I think they run a good service product. They're going to continue with the same goal as we have to strive, and we're working together on it. In fact, in a couple of weeks, I'm going to ride a train, head end of a freight train, down on the FXE to take a look at their railroad even more.\n The border, we have processes in place to make it easier for our crews to not stop right at the border and get trains across, which just makes sense, just like between Canada and the U.S. at International Falls. So we are in the process of cleaning up those items that limit the speed and the efficiency for our customers to get across the border. So I'm very happy to see where we are. And we're trying to work as one railroad. I don't like to give other railroads my excess locomotives, and you can understand why, I don't have to explain it. But we have provided FXE some locomotives to make sure that they can move the traffic that's out there. And they've seen a large growth. Their number is -- I'll let them give you the exact number, but the -- we see growth in Mexico, both northbound and southbound, and that's a market we want to use those 6 touchpoints we have to get into Mexico and optimize it for Union Pacific. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Justin Long from Stephens. \nJustin Long: So it was good to see the OR improve a little bit sequentially despite the typical seasonality that you see. And in the outlook, you talked about profitability gaining momentum. But can you help us translate that into how you're expecting the OR to trend over the balance of the year? It seems like we're tracking towards the sub-60 the rest of 2024, but is there anything on the horizon that could prevent that from happening? \nJennifer Hamann: Thanks, Justin. We are not providing OR guidance, but -- so I'm not going to comment on your number. But I think the way that you're describing it in terms of what we expect from ourselves is to continue to make improvement. You heard Jim talk about the fact that we made good gains, but there's more to do. And that's really our focus, is to continue to do that quarter-over-quarter to make gains. Obviously, we're doing that in an environment that we can't totally control.\n We control a lot of things, especially about our service product and our cost structure and how we go into the market and how Kenny and his team are pricing, but we are doing that against an economic backdrop that's a little uncertain. We don't know what's going to happen with interest rates yet. So those are the things that do have an impact on us, including fuel prices. So just stay tuned. We feel really good about the setup and are very confident about our ability to perform. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. \nAmit Mehrotra: Congrats on the strong results. Eric, obviously, you and the team have done a phenomenal job with the operations and the metrics. We've kind of been stuck in this 155,000-ish 7-day carload number. I will be curious to get your confidence and perspective on how much more you can handle when Kenny gives you that to handle. How you feel comfortable about moving 5,000, 10,000 more carloads per week, if you can talk about that?\n And then just, Jennifer, related to that this question that was just asked, the weather gets better from 1Q to 2Q, you move more industrial carloads. It's a pretty meaningful advantage as you move from 1Q to 2Q, if you can just talk about any. And fuel, I think fuel noise moderates a little bit. If you can just talk about anything that I'm missing there as we think about from 1Q to 2Q that might be on the negative side of the ledger. \nEric Gehringer: Good. I'll start with it, Amit. Thank you very much for that question. Now I want to be really clear right off the bat. We have the capacity to be able to handle more than 155,000 carloads. What brings us tremendous confidence is when you think about the 5 critical resources that we have. We clearly have enough terminal capacity. We clearly have enough mainline capacity. More specifically, we've talked about in the past and continue to maintain a buffer in our crew base. We have a couple of hundred extra crews based across the system that are available. As to your point, when that volume comes on, we have the crews.\n Locomotives, in my prepared comments, I said that over the last 12 months, we've been able to store 500 locomotives due largely because of the increased fluidity in the system. Those are available to us. As Kenny brings more volume to the railroad, we don't have to wait a week, we don't have to wait 30 days, they're parked across the system available to us.\n And then, of course, on the car side, we have cars not only spaced across the system that we call out the ready cars, but we actually have been working with customers in which we're storing cars right at their facility, so the moment they're ready to give us that load, we're ready to pick it up. \n Now when you think about capacity, the final thing you have to think about is the work that we do on train lengths. We talk often about driving volume variable approach to how we operate the railroad. Train length is one of the ways we do it. At a 300-foot improvement in our manifest quarter versus same quarter last year, that's a huge lift. That's a massive accomplishment by the team. Building train length in the manifest network is one of the hardest things we do. What that tells you is if we're really good at the hardest things we do, as the intermodal volume starts to come back, we don't have to add train pairs on. We can take some of the latent capacity we have in our existing train peers and utilize it. So we're ready. \nVincenzo Vena: So, Amit, the only thing I would add is, and you know, I've never given guidance on operating ratio because it's a result of how you operate the railroad, and that's really important. But ex-fuel, a 60.1% last quarter with where the volumes were, what we did with price and what we did with efficiency on the railroad, that's a pretty good number. It's okay in the way I look at the world. Some people would say it's excellent. I go, it's pretty good. \n So I see moving us forward, and unless we get surprised, Kenny does his job properly, and we are able to return the proper price because of the great service and the product that we're delivering, and we continue to operate the railroad efficiently, and numbers underneath and the numbers that people don't see every day that I look at, make me very comfortable that we have a clear view of how we become more productive down at the ground level in this railroad driving decision-making closer to the people that need to make the decision and not trying to do it here in Omaha in like the headquarters.\n So, Amit, I'm not going to give a number, but I'm comfortable with where we're headed in the long term for Union Pacific. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. \nJonathan Chappell: Jim, I was going to ask just kind of where you left off. In January, you kind of admitted somewhat modestly that it would be difficult to improve the margin without a volume tailwind. And here you are with 200 basis points of core improvement with volumes down year-over-year. So what was the, I guess, change in the last couple of months? Eric touched on a lot of things, but how are you able to make such a huge improvement in such a short period of time? And what's your comfort in the sustainability of that when you actually do get a volume tailwind in the network? \nVincenzo Vena: Well, let's start with the end of the question. I love volume, and I love revenue. So at the end of the day, that's really important to us to be able to drive it forward. And what we've done is we worked hard. It looks easy sometimes to operate a railroad and especially as complicated as the Union Pacific network is because it is complicated. It's not a linear railroad. It's very, very spread out in the way it operates. But I think we're focusing the people at the right level. We're doing the right things when it comes on the expense side and headcount and everything that's involved in it, making sure that we don't impact service. And I think we did a great job of it, and I can see us improve in every one of those.\n So Kenny is going to deliver, Eric is going to deliver and the rest of us are going to make sure that we do everything we can possible to make sure that this company moves ahead because if we can have better margins, it opens up markets to us, even more markets than what we have today. So that is the end game, and you basically have asked me what our strategy is, and I'm looking forward to delivering it in the next couple of years. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. \nKen Hoexter: Congrats for the team on some great results in a tough volume environment. But I wanted to dig into, maybe flipping Amit's question a little bit on the other side. You've been focused on these operations for 8 months now. I want to understand the more room to run, right? So you're getting service to where you want, but -- maybe is there a continued ability to pull out locomotives and cars as you continue to get more efficient? Maybe just give kind of some examples of -- Eric talked about increasing train life. Isn't there ability to go further before the volumes come online? But just -- PSR typically is, you focus on improving the service and then you get the ability to pull out the equipment and employees as you move forward, so maybe just talk about the opportunity to keep doing that. \nVincenzo Vena: Yes. Listen, great question. And I'm going to give Eric to talk about how he sees and what's moving forward and Kenny, but let me just summarize the way I like to look at things is you always try to optimize the network operationally and look for ways to be able to drive efficiencies in the network. But the base plan always is what did we sell to customers, what did we tell the customers we're going to deliver and make sure that that's the base plan. And from that, you build it up.\n So we see improvements not only in train length -- we had a few more cars on every train, that's very efficient in the network. It allows us to have better capacity. But we also look at how we handle the terminals, touch points in the cars, how can we forward the cars without touching them for a longer distance.\n And the next piece for us is how fast we can react to our train plan so that it takes us way too long right now and to be able to adjust our train plan so that we still provide the service that we sold. So we have tools in place, and we're developing them even further that allow us to change our plan in a much shorter period of time, in a few days or a week versus weeks so that we can optimize the railroad even more. So very excited about that, and I see that as being a positive step.\n Eric, Kenny, anything to add? \nEric Gehringer: I'll start building up with that. So, Ken, to Jim's point, when you look at our quarterly performance from a dwell perspective, and we had a 5% improvement in our car dwell during the quarter, that's a full half of 1 hour off of every car on the Union Pacific. That's how we are able to move the cars faster. Now when you think about that going beyond that, to Jim's point about being agile, we took out 4,000 touchpoints just in the first quarter as we looked for more and more ways to be able to modify the transportation plan to move the cars faster.\n Now you build off of that and you start to get to the fundamentals of the railroad, the improvements we've made in recrew rate. There's still opportunity there. Certainly, our investments in technology, both with [ RCO ] as well as [ Mobilinx ], that's about getting more productive in the yards. Even when we think about the brake-person deal that we signed last year that we spoke about working to ensure that we have capitalized on all those opportunities. \n We've talked about locomotives, 500 already out. We see more opportunities. You hit on train length to start your question, but also sometimes things we don't talk about, our purchase services, we made great progress, as Jennifer reported in the quarter on purchased services. We did that from everything from maximizing the material movement using trains instead of trucks to how many vehicles we have on the railroad. \n You've seen what our headcount has done over the last year. We've aligned our fleet from a vehicle perspective to that, to about 600 vehicles coming out. So everything is in play right now, Ken. We look at it every single day. We work through it every single day. And the biggest thing that we're looking for is how do we ensure that we make meaningful changes to not only improve our service product, but also make us safe while we drive financial success. \nVincenzo Vena: Ken, anything to add? \nKenny Rocker: I mean we talked about the efficiency. It shows up in the product development that we talked about. It shows up in all these small discrete things like adding more cars right at the customer's plant and asking for more business by customer, by plant. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. \nRavi Shanker: So the 3.5% price/mix number in 1Q, kind of how do you think about that over the course of the year? And obviously, puts and takes on the macro, truck pricing, et cetera, and some movements in the mix side as well. So how do we think the number evolves? \nJennifer Hamann: So -- we're probably not going to give you a number, Ravi, which isn't going to surprise you, but I'll let Kenny talk to the markets. But just from a mix perspective, with intermodal probably staying weak through most of the year, that probably is going to give us the ability to have some positive mix within our business as we think about that for the rest of the year. Kenny? \nKenny Rocker: Yes. I've been very encouraged and proud of the commercial team and the conversations that they're having with customers on price, articulating the inflationary pressures that are there and working with those customers to price to the market, taking a little bit more risk to price that business. And at the end of the day, our service product has improved, as you can see in the results, and we're talking to our customers about that and aligning that with the capital investments we're making. So it is not a coincidence or by luck, we are having very deliberate conversations with our customers. \nRavi Shanker: Understood. And if I can squeeze a super quick follow-up kind of, I think you had said in other revenue, there was a contract settlement and there's a claim settlement and other expenses as well. Is that the same one? Or Are they 2 different ones? \nJennifer Hamann: Those are 2 different ones, Ravi. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. \nBrian Ossenbeck: Just wanted to kind of follow up on that last question from Ravi. In terms of just the mix, it sounds like it's getting better from here. Maybe, Kenny, you can give us some color in terms of the pace of renewals as it was always going to take a bit of time to touch through the rest of the business and services helping with that momentum. So it would be helpful to hear that. \n And then just secondarily, similarly on the labor agreements in coal, like are both of those with coal network rightsized to the big drop you've seen right now? Or is there a little bit more to do? And on the labor side, you obviously had some new agreements to adjust for as well. So just trying to figure out where those 3 things stand in terms of where they are now and sort of looking at the rest of the year. \nKenny Rocker: Yes, I'll start off. Thanks for the question. I said that back in January, it's not like we woke up January 1 and started deciding that we needed to have these deliberate conversations with customers. These started well early last year. And we've shared this. We can touch close to half of our price annually. The other half is in multiyear deals. I touched on it a little bit, about the deliberate conversations that we're having, the risk that's out there. And then I'll talk about a couple of markets. \n You look at domestic intermodal, those spot markets, if you look at it, here where we stand today, they are the same that they were from a spot market perspective last year, so this has been a long time, same thing on the contracted rates. Those contract rates have been where they are for a long time, over 8 months. And so the good thing, if you're an optimist like I am, there -- you know you're at the trough, but the thing you don't know is when things will improve or get better. And we're not in a position where we're going to forecast that they -- when that will happen.\n What I will tell you, and I talked about the product development already, we're prepared. We're ready. We're working with Eric's team, and we're bringing on more volume that comes on. And so we'll see what happens there, but I can tell you that we're prepared and excited. \nEric Gehringer: And Brian, to your question about crews and the coal lines, so every single week, we review every board across the system. And we're looking, just as you pointed out, for changes in the market that shows up an increased or reduced demand. We've made adjustments. We'll continue to make adjustments.\n And it reminds me to make sure that we remind ourselves a year ago, we were talking to all of you about 200, 250 borrow-outs across the system. For the third month in a row, we have 0 borrow-outs across the entire system. Now that doesn't mean that with some seasonal adjustments to some business like grain harvest, we might put some out there, but it's a massive accomplishment, and I give the team credit for it because they've been able to manage the crews in a way that we don't have any borrow-out. So agility, all day long. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. \nJordan Alliger: You've alluded to this a few times this morning, but productive and cost takeout, certainly seem better than we would have had in our model, particularly in areas such as PT, which you have alluded to as well as the rents. Can you maybe talk to some of the sustainability of the current trend line? Because it was quite a bit of a delta versus what we've seen lately as we move forward from here. \nJennifer Hamann: Yes. Jordan, thanks for that question. So I think you're right. You're hearing a lot of positivity by the team because we know that there are more opportunities. And first, it's building the momentum, it's sustaining the momentum and then keeping the cost out. And so if you think about equipment rents, that really is all about continuing to drive the car velocity, continue to drive the cycle time and the dwell that Eric referenced. So those are directly impacting that line.\n And then purchased services, certainly, the locomotive fleet is a big part of that, as we continue to use our locomotive fleet more protectively and reduce those numbers, that's an opportunity to sustain and potentially improve there as well as across the rest of the contract services that we use, is we're being smarter and looking deeper at every dollar that we're spending. And that's been one of Jim's messages to the team is, when you're looking at the resources, spend the dollars like your own and make sure that it's a wise dollar that's being spent and that you're getting the appropriate return for it. So feel good about continuing to make progress. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. \nEric Morgan: This is actually Eric Morgan on for Brandon. I just wanted to ask another one about mix. I appreciate the detail on the impact to yields, but I was just curious if you could speak to any effects on margins just because with coal being down, big drag on volumes right now in international intermodal as well. Should we be thinking these sort of mix swings helped to drive the strong OR in the quarter? Or is it really just an RPU impact? \nJennifer Hamann: Yes. Thanks for that question. So mix does help on the RPU. And when we think about mix, there is some different mix in terms of the cost profile that's behind that. Our opportunity and our job is to improve the profitability of every line of business that we have. And so we are very proud of our manifest franchise. That's really our sweet spot for sure. But as Eric talked, intermodal, grain, coal, those are very profitable businesses for us as well to the extent that we can drive greater train length, So -- I'm not going to say we're totally agnostic, but we want to grow, and we want to grow across all lines of business. And so I think if you see us do that, you're going to like the margins that come from them. \nVincenzo Vena: You bet. And just to sort of -- why don't I summarize the way I look at the quarter and what we see moving forward? First of all, if you look -- if you take a look at our results, our industrial, and that's what I love about Union Pacific is our industrial originations, the Mexico product that is non-intermodal, which gives us a different level of return and price capability, is strong. And that's what we want to see. And that was -- that's what helped us in the first quarter, and I can't see that changing, except I just don't know where the macro items are going to be in the short term in the U.S.\n I was hoping with all the products that we ship and handle for people and consumers that I would have seen an interest rate cut in the next few months and maybe it will happen later on this year. So an interest rate cut would help us in what people are spending on their homes from lumber and number of products. But if you take a look at where we are, and that's what I like, we leverage that franchise we have in the Gulf in originations in the middle of the heartland of the United States.\n And we always look for ways to improve our efficiency. We drive better return with whatever price we get out of the international and domestic business. And every time I see a train full of box cars and tank cars, it's music to my ears when those wheels roll by. So thank you very much. \nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners. \nJeffrey Kauffman: Congratulations, this quarter, a tremendous result. I wanted to take a step back, a question for Kenny. What are you seeing in terms of customer commitments to near-shoring or rebasing manufacturing? And then in terms of coming back to the rail, your service metrics are up. And clearly, there's a flywheel effect there, but what are your customers telling you they need to see, those that maybe took business away before they would bring that business back? \nKenny Rocker: Yes. Thanks for the question. On the near-shoring piece, it's real. You've seen the amount of investments that's there. We've got a strong commercial presence that's there, and you look at the overall rail, I'm talking the rail industry market share into and out of Mexico, is still relatively low if you put it in the mid-teens or so.\n Our new service product that we have in place at this time has been picking up steam and we've seen it grow. We've seen it grow in that North-South corridor. We've seen it grow in the traffic that we put on, the new product that we put on going in the Southeast, so tremendous growth there.\n There is also a more carload business that will come online and more plants that will come online, some of them for some of the autos that are going to come on and some just other what I'll call just industrial pieces. We're set up for that. We're engaging those customers. Our network strength and franchise gives us an opportunity to move a lot of that, both the feedstocks in Mexico and the finished product out of Mexico, so a very strong place for us, the 6 gateways. We had a great quarter coming into and out of Mexico, and we want to build on that.\n As far as those customers coming back to us, with every month that we are able to sustain and ensure reliable product, we're able to capture a little bit more business, but we're also able to sit down with them and talk to them about adding the 1 or 2 carloads or talk to them about a truck lane piece or talk to them about their rail versus truck by lane percentage. So the stronger service product is certainly a positive for us, and our commercial team has been very aggressive out there hustling to get every carload. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. \nThomas Wadewitz: Nice performance on the OR and the network and everything, so congratulations on that. I wanted to just get a little more color, I think, Jennifer or whoever else wants to jump in on the expense side, I know you've got a couple of questions, but comp and benefits, how do we think about that going forward? Is headcount stable? Did that go down a little bit?\n And then on the purchase services line, I know, kind of storing locomotives, cars, that's helpful, but is that -- should we model that kind of flat looking forward? Or I guess you said there's a onetime where you didn't identify whether that's kind of small or meaningful, so I think just from a modeling perspective. And -- is there kind of further improvement? Or how do we think about it sequentially on comp and benefits and purchase services? \nJennifer Hamann: You bet, Tom. So let me start with the purchased services. So I think I did say that the one-time item there accounted for about half of the year-over-year decrease. So you should set that aside when you're thinking about rolling that forward. But again, as you heard me talk on another question, we still obviously think we have opportunities there.\n If you switch to comp and benefits then, back in January, we said we thought that we would probably see about a 5% increase in that line for the year. We were at 4% here in the first quarter, so really kind of right online there. And I think you know the drivers, they're wage inflation, they're the sick pay benefits, some higher guarantee pay, offset by what we're doing to improve our overall productivity and how we're managing the headcount.\n When you think about those new contract benefits in terms of the sick pay, it's also -- when we're rolling out the work rest agreements, that is resulting in a little bit of an elevation in terms of our TE&Y headcounts in anticipation of those benefits. And so really, the way to think about that is that we're paying a little bit more due to those agreements for the same unit of work. But I think what's encouraging there is we're offsetting that with some of our productivity, and that's our plan going forward. \nThomas Wadewitz: Okay. So that kind of comp and benefit plan probably is stable is the right way to look at it? \nJennifer Hamann: Yes. I mean, obviously, if there's a significant change up or down from a volume perspective, that can have an impact, but I think we feel like we're in a pretty good place right now. \nVincenzo Vena: It's a great way to look at it, Tom, in the short term, you'll see in the next few quarters. But the challenge, and one that we know that we have to tackle, is we have wage inflation. You deal with that absolutely, and you have a great service product and you price properly. I think we're doing the right things there so that we don't impact our customers to the point where they can't win in the marketplace.\n But efficiency-wise, if you look at how the number of cars we're switching for employee and everything that we're doing with technology, I'm very comfortable that we'll figure out a way to change that slope on that line on what it costs us and the number of people per car to be able to hand the business level that we're at. So a little bit -- it's a lot of hard work, but I see over the next couple of years for us to get back in line to where we were. \nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. \nBascome Majors: The owners of your Western competitor made some very public comments about really wanting more margin and profitability out of that business just a few months ago. Can you speak to if you've seen anything different in either how they approach the market or operate their business? And is or can that create opportunities for you to grow in the midterm? \nVincenzo Vena: Bascome, it's a great question. And did I like to hear that? Absolutely. But because I think we're in an industry where we provide for the price that we charge very competitive and we beat most modes of transportation. So I think you need to be smart on how you price, and I think you need to make sure that we provide the service for that price that we sold. \n So we compete every day against our competitor, and we're here to win. And hopefully, they're prudent in the way they look at their markets, and I don't tell them what to do. They need to do theirs. And we're very comfortable that we're doing the right things. And I think head-to-head, we'll put our complex of what we have, including the Mexico piece, and I think it gives us a great opportunity to compete. And you have to love it, great competition against the great. The railroad is a wonderful thing. I love it. It makes us better. It makes the whole industry better. So I love the comments, but we'll see what their actions are as we see them go down the road. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. \nScott Group: So Jennifer, Kenny sounded a bit better on price. I know last quarter, you talked about price/cost is a margin headwind for the year. I'm just wondering, are we getting any closer to that becoming a tailwind, right, if we can combine some of the productivity stuff with price/cost that the margins could get pretty good. I just don't know if we're getting closer to that inflection yet. And then can you just clarify that if we've seen the full impact of the coal RPU headwind from lower nat gas, or if there's another step-down coming there? \nJennifer Hamann: Yes. I'll let Kenny talk -- take that coal question. But you're hearing it right. We're putting a lot of pressure on Kenny and the team to go out there and deliver the price, and they're very much stepping up to that and are taking on that challenge and being aggressive in the marketplace. Obviously, we improved our margins in the quarter. So the combination of our volume, which was down a little bit, but price and productivity is what's driving the margin improvement. I can't say that we're accretive yet from just a pure price inflation standpoint, but that absolutely is the goal. We are though exceeding, just the dollars are exceeding the inflation dollars. We're still very confident of that. Kenny? \nKenny Rocker: Yes. I just want to reiterate what Jennifer said, we'll exceed our inflationary dollars. On this coal question that you have, we're looking at the same things. You're looking at in terms of the natural gas futures, and we're talking to our customers, similar to my comments around domestic intermodal. Yes, I think we're at the trough levels, when they will come up is yet to be seen. They're still depressed. We'll see if we get some seasonal lift here going into the spring and the summer. I want a hot, muggy summer so we can move more business. But if that doesn't happen, we'll see what Eric and the team to do for us to efficiently move the coal business. Thank you for the question. \nVincenzo Vena: I'm telling you, and I have to jump in on this one here, Kenny and team and everybody, coal is what it is, and I said it in my prepared comments on purpose. We have other markets that are going to take care of that coal business. It's tough to replace the number of the trains that we originate, but we used to originate a heck of a lot more than we do today, and we need to be able to grow it. So we can hope, and I'm not into hope. I'm into, let's go out there, deliver, have the right processes, have the right things possible, and we go deliver and we win.\n And I've spoken about our franchise a few times on this call. That's what allows us to win. We provide good service and will more than offset anything that happens over the long term with coal. It is what it is, okay? I don't see it coming back to a large level that it will change us. It might do it for a short term, but that's the way I look at it, and that's the way the team here at Union Pacific is. We're going to win regardless of what happens to one commodity that we ship. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. \nStephanie Benjamin Moore: So, Jim, really nice progress here across safety and service. So in terms of customer engagement post these improvements, what are you hearing from customers? Are you seeing engagement accelerate at all? Kind of what's the opportunity from here? And then maybe on the flip side, I'd love to hear, have you noticed any challenges to the network, maybe revenue holds looking to fill that, that were maybe less apparent? I'd love to get your thoughts. \nVincenzo Vena: It's a great question. I think it's -- when I came back to work, a lot of people thought that the only thing I'd concentrate is on operations, and I have been spending some time there. But I have spent a lot of time speaking to customers. I did it the first week I was on the job. I've followed up with them. I've gone to meetings when we bring them in, our Industrial, our Bulk, our Premium business. \n So the feedback is they want us to win, and they see themselves winning in the marketplace if Union Pacific can be successful in what our strategy is. So the feedback has been positive. There's always some markets and some customers that we have to truly understand what their impacts are and where they are because we want them to survive and win. So we're doing everything we can. And maybe, Kenny, you can speak a little bit more about our engagement and what we're doing with customers. \nKenny Rocker: Yes. If you look at it, so far this year, our face-to-face meetings, the strong customer engagement strategies. We have a lot more, significantly more contacts with customers, and we're touching them in different ways. One of the unique strategies that we have as I'm looking at Eric, 1/3 of our meetings have an operating leader or a local operating person is there. And we're doing that to see how we can grow more business specifically. So strong customer engagement strategy at all levels, and we're going to keep at it. Thanks for the question. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Elliot Alper with TD Cowen. \nElliot Alper: This is Elliot on for Jason Seidl. My question is on international intermodal. So the outlook calls for pretty muted international intermodal for the year, I guess. We would appreciate some more context around that. I mean, I understand there was a customer loss that you called out last quarter. We've seen some strong volumes coming out of the West Coast ports, I guess. Should we continue to think about that continued acceleration on the West Coast mostly offset? Or could there be some upside if the strength on the West Coast continues? \nKenny Rocker: Elliot, thanks for the question. So a few things here. Let's set aside the contract loss you referenced. It's been strong. International intermodal has been strong for us, a little bit of a pleasant surprise for us that we've been able to capitalize on it. We're seeing more IPI business or business that's going into our network increase by a few points. We are aware that there has been a small impact on the positive side because of some of the challenges with the Panama Canal. We'll see what happens if some of the BCOs are a little bit more concerned with any labor issues on the East Coast.\n But as we go through the second quarter, I feel pretty good about those volumes staying where they are, as we talk to our customers in their pipeline. I'd like to see as we move a few weeks out what happens in the second half of the year. So I'm not ready today here in April to bet on what's going to happen in the second half of the year. \n The last thing I'll end with, and I've said this quite a bit, I do like the fact that regardless of what happens at the West Coast, we're preparing for if it does get transloaded, more products were to get to the East Coast that I talked about, those 20 cities that will move with the NS and the CSX, our Phoenix product and us being holistically and leveraging the entire franchise to go after more business out of the Port of Houston. Thanks for your question. \nOperator: The next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. \nWalter Spracklin: So I want to take a little bit of a bigger picture on the competitive environment and how you interact with your competitors, both East and West. When we were at -- we were attending a recent session with the -- with Southern campaign, they called out the CP, KCS, CSX as a natural alliance. Just curious whether you see yourself as naturally being able to cooperate, coordinate operations to bring a more effective, higher service product to your customers. \n Is there one company in particular or -- that you could align a little bit closer with given the network interplay between the companies? Just curious what you're thinking about longer term in the absence of acquisitions or mergers. Could there be increased cooperation that allows you to bring a higher service to the customer? \nVincenzo Vena: Walter, I appreciate the question. You have to think about it that 40% of the traffic that we either originate or receive starts somewhere else. So when you put that number in perspective, we can't be choosy and say that we'd rather partner with one Eastern railroad or one Canadian. I guess, I can't call CP or CN Canadian railroads anymore. I apologize to both of them, but international railroads. And what we need to do -- and all the short lines that we touch. The way I look at it is what is the best and the fastest and the quickest. So if we're all efficient, we all have good service, we all are smart in running a very fluid railroad that has buffer to be able to handle the ups and downs that naturally occur, Walter, we all win. So I don't have a preference.\n Now I love it that we get to compete with some of them, and we say, we originate lots of many cars, and we say to them, which one wants the business, is it CSX or NS or is it CN or CP. And I think we compete on some. But when we work together, which we are, we have very detailed meetings with CPKC, with CN, with NS and with CSX to talk about on that interline business, how do we make those interchanges fluid, so we don't spend 24 hours to interchange cars at some interchange when we go one way or the other. So we can win and beat trucks, especially in that speed network that requires that kind of work. \n So, Walter, no preference, best one wins, and we want to be able to tell people, you want to interchange with us because -- versus the other carrier in the West, the BNSF because we have the best model, we are the fastest, we can get the markets and we move quick. And once we get there, because the customer looks at it end-to-end, how good are you at origination, are you on time, how fast you get it over the road. And that's why I look at the -- I don't look at train speed, it's an illogical measure on productivity on the railroad. I look at car velocity, and that's what's important. So hopefully, I answered your question, Walter. \nWalter Spracklin: It does. Congrats on a great quarter. \nOperator: Our final question is from the line of Ben Nolan from Stifel. \nBenjamin Nolan: And as much as we, you guys don't want to talk about specific markets. One of the things that I've been hearing about lately a lot is more crude by rail. Kenny, I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on that. Is that something that you guys are seeing? And as you think about sort of the outlook going forward, how needle moving is that to the business? \nKenny Rocker: Yes. Thanks for the question. You heard my comments around our petroleum markets and business development wins there. And it's a type of oil that we're moving that we're excited about, and it's moving right now domestically. We've seen some strength. Eric's team has been able to help us grow a little bit of that business and get as much of it as we can. So we don't see that kind of traditional crude by rail that we saw 10 years ago, but we're seeing another emerging commodity in the market that we're excited to be moving, and it's going great for us. \nVincenzo Vena: Rob, just let me -- if that was the last question, let me just summarize real quick because I think there's a few key points that I want to make sure that we highlight. One is, I think, the last 2 quarters have shown what's possible for this railroad. And that's really important to us is what's possible. We will have headwinds. We have a wage increase coming July 1. That's a headwind.\n We have certain segments of our business that are down and can be up and others that are up that are going to impact us. But the way we look at it, and I'm so proud of this entire team and the entire railroad, if you look at what we're doing is we're making ourselves more efficient, we're driving decision-making to the right level, we're providing service that we sold our customers at a high level. And the franchise that we have and the network that we have gives us every possibility to win in the long term. That's the goal.\n I'm looking forward to in September deep diving what we look like in the next 2 or 3 years, have a longer-term plan for everybody. And I'm sure I'm going to run into some of you before. But, otherwise, looking forward to the next quarter that closes. April is a great start with where our carloads are, and this is a great railroad, great franchise, and I'm looking forward to moving it forward.\n Thank you very much for joining us today. \nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Eric Gehringer",
            "content": "Thank you, Kenny, and good morning. Moving to Slide 12. We exited 2023 with strong operational momentum across the board. And while weather quickly presented its challenges, the team rose to the task. The speed with which our service product recovered is a testament to our strategy and the resiliency of our network. We continue to see meaningful year-over-year improvements in our metrics. This is a direct result of our steadfast focus on providing industry-leading safety, service and operational excellence.  \n Starting with Freight Car Velocity. Improvements in terminal dwell and overall network fluidity led to a 4% improvement compared to first quarter 2023. Sequentially, Freight Car Velocity declined 6%, primarily due to shifts in product mix between our Bulk, Manifest and Intermodal services. Particularly, we are seeing an impact from declines in Intermodal and Bulk shipments, which generally contribute higher average daily car miles. Key is that our service product remains consistent, and we are delivering what we sold to our customers. We want our customers to win. And if they win, we win. \n To further deliver on the service we sold to our customers, we recently introduced a new measure Service Performance Index, or SPI. As the name implies, it's a combined metric that reflects the actual service provided, and we believe it's a better measure than trip plan compliance alone. For those customers with specific transit commitments, we measure against that. And for the many customers who rely on our historical performance to inform their rail transportation planning decision, SPI provides a measure that aligns with this practice. \n For the first quarter, both Intermodal and Manifest and Auto SPI saw a sizable 14 and 7-point year-over-year improvement, respectively. The team also delivered safety performance in the quarter, both on derailment and personal injury fronts. As we continue to emphasize the culture of safety, we're also investing in technology and process, ensuring our employees have the tools they need to operate safely and efficiently. Our goal is clear, we want to lead the industry and drive tangible change so everyone goes home safely each day.\n Now let's review our key efficiency metrics on Slide 13. While maintaining focus on enhancing safety and service, it is equally crucial that we do so in a cost-effective manner, enabling Kenny and the team to compete in a broader range of markets. In alignment with this objective, we saw year-over-year improvement across all of our first quarter metrics, indicating that the efficiency of our railroad is on the right track. \n Locomotive productivity improved 10% compared to first quarter 2023, as the team continues to run an efficient operation and a transportation plan that requires fewer locomotives to satisfy the demands of the business. In fact, we have reduced our active fleet by about 500 locomotives compared to last year.\n Workforce productivity, which includes all employees, improved 1% as average daily car miles declined slightly and employees decreased 2% compared to 2023. While overall workforce counts declined, our train, engine and yard employees increased 4%, as we continue to support our training pipeline, scheduled work agreements and provide the capacity buffer necessary to navigate an ever-changing environment. \n Train length improved 1% compared to first quarter 2023. After a particularly challenging January due to winter weather, we quickly adjusted to set train length records in both February and March. Notably, manifest train length increased by around 300 feet. While train length increased for nearly all train categories year-over-year, declines in intermodal shipments, which generally move on longer trains, moderated sequential performance. \n Although we are encouraged by these results, there are ample opportunities ahead for us to further improve asset utilization and the efficiency of our network. For instance, we are leveraging technology to automate terminal functions and engineering renewal activities, increasing energy management utilization to improve fuel consumption and developing car plan optimizers to reduce car touches. While these are just a few of key initiatives, running a safe, reliable and efficient railroad for all our stakeholders is vital. And as we move forward, we will continue pushing the envelope in our pursuit of industry-leading safety, service and operational excellence.\n So with that, I'll turn it back to Jim. Good. I'll start with it, Amit. Thank you very much for that question. Now I want to be really clear right off the bat. We have the capacity to be able to handle more than 155,000 carloads. What brings us tremendous confidence is when you think about the 5 critical resources that we have. We clearly have enough terminal capacity. We clearly have enough mainline capacity. More specifically, we've talked about in the past and continue to maintain a buffer in our crew base. We have a couple of hundred extra crews based across the system that are available. As to your point, when that volume comes on, we have the crews.\n Locomotives, in my prepared comments, I said that over the last 12 months, we've been able to store 500 locomotives due largely because of the increased fluidity in the system. Those are available to us. As Kenny brings more volume to the railroad, we don't have to wait a week, we don't have to wait 30 days, they're parked across the system available to us.\n And then, of course, on the car side, we have cars not only spaced across the system that we call out the ready cars, but we actually have been working with customers in which we're storing cars right at their facility, so the moment they're ready to give us that load, we're ready to pick it up. \n Now when you think about capacity, the final thing you have to think about is the work that we do on train lengths. We talk often about driving volume variable approach to how we operate the railroad. Train length is one of the ways we do it. At a 300-foot improvement in our manifest quarter versus same quarter last year, that's a huge lift. That's a massive accomplishment by the team. Building train length in the manifest network is one of the hardest things we do. What that tells you is if we're really good at the hardest things we do, as the intermodal volume starts to come back, we don't have to add train pairs on. We can take some of the latent capacity we have in our existing train peers and utilize it. So we're ready. I'll start building up with that. So, Ken, to Jim's point, when you look at our quarterly performance from a dwell perspective, and we had a 5% improvement in our car dwell during the quarter, that's a full half of 1 hour off of every car on the Union Pacific. That's how we are able to move the cars faster. Now when you think about that going beyond that, to Jim's point about being agile, we took out 4,000 touchpoints just in the first quarter as we looked for more and more ways to be able to modify the transportation plan to move the cars faster.\n Now you build off of that and you start to get to the fundamentals of the railroad, the improvements we've made in recrew rate. There's still opportunity there. Certainly, our investments in technology, both with [ RCO ] as well as [ Mobilinx ], that's about getting more productive in the yards. Even when we think about the brake-person deal that we signed last year that we spoke about working to ensure that we have capitalized on all those opportunities. \n We've talked about locomotives, 500 already out. We see more opportunities. You hit on train length to start your question, but also sometimes things we don't talk about, our purchase services, we made great progress, as Jennifer reported in the quarter on purchased services. We did that from everything from maximizing the material movement using trains instead of trucks to how many vehicles we have on the railroad. \n You've seen what our headcount has done over the last year. We've aligned our fleet from a vehicle perspective to that, to about 600 vehicles coming out. So everything is in play right now, Ken. We look at it every single day. We work through it every single day. And the biggest thing that we're looking for is how do we ensure that we make meaningful changes to not only improve our service product, but also make us safe while we drive financial success. And Brian, to your question about crews and the coal lines, so every single week, we review every board across the system. And we're looking, just as you pointed out, for changes in the market that shows up an increased or reduced demand. We've made adjustments. We'll continue to make adjustments.\n And it reminds me to make sure that we remind ourselves a year ago, we were talking to all of you about 200, 250 borrow-outs across the system. For the third month in a row, we have 0 borrow-outs across the entire system. Now that doesn't mean that with some seasonal adjustments to some business like grain harvest, we might put some out there, but it's a massive accomplishment, and I give the team credit for it because they've been able to manage the crews in a way that we don't have any borrow-out. So agility, all day long."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Jennifer Hamann",
            "content": "All right. Thanks, Jim, and good morning. I'll begin with a walkdown of our first quarter income statement on Slide 5, where operating revenue of $6 billion was flat versus last year on a 1% volume decline that was significantly driven by a 20% reduction in coal shipments. In fact, excluding coal, volumes would have been up close to 2% year-over-year even in this tough freight environment.\n Looking in at the revenue components further, total freight revenue of $5.6 billion declined 1%. The single largest driver of the year-over-year decrease was a 25% reduction in fuel surcharge revenue to $665 million as lower fuel prices negatively impacted freight revenue 375 basis points. Solid core pricing gains and a favorable business mix combined to add 350 basis points to freight revenue. Reduced coal and rock shipments as well as increased soda ash and petroleum carloads drove the positive mix dynamic. Excluding fuel surcharge, freight revenue grew 4%, a solid start to the year and a demonstration of the great diversity of the UP franchise. \n Wrapping up the top line, other revenue increased 4%, driven by increased accessorial revenue that included a one-time contract settlement of $25 million. Switching to expenses, operating expense of $3.7 billion decreased 3%, as we generated solid productivity against lower demand. Digging deeper into a few of the expense lines, compensation and benefits expense was up 4% versus last year. First quarter workforce levels decreased 2% as reductions in non-transportation employees more than offset a 4% increase in our active TE&Y workforce. Although our training pipeline is significantly reduced, we continue to carry additional train services employees as a buffer for our operations and to offset the impact of newly available sick pay benefits and work rest agreements.\n While talking about workforce levels, I do want to mention one quick housekeeping item. As some of you might be aware, we are in the process of transferring operating responsibility for certain passenger lines in Chicago to Metro. As part of that, in June, we will be transferring around 350 mechanical employees to Metro. On a quarterly basis, this will lower both revenue and expense by roughly $15 million. Cost per employee in the first quarter increased 5%, reflecting wage inflation and additional costs associated with new labor agreements. Fuel expense in the quarter declined 14% on a 13% decrease in fuel prices from $3.22 per gallon to $2.81 per gallon. \n We also improved our fuel consumption rate by 1% as locomotive productivity more than offset a less fuel-efficient business mix given the decline in coal shipments. Purchased Services & Materials expense decreased 6% versus last year, as we maintained a smaller active locomotive fleet, and our logistics subsidiary incurred less drayage expense. In addition, a little less than half of the year-over-year variance related to resolution of a contract dispute. \n Finally, Equipment & Other Rents declined 8%, reflecting a more fluid network seen through improved cycle times and lower lease expenses. By controlling the controllables in our cost structure, first quarter operating income of $2.4 billion increased 3% versus last year. Below the line, Jim noted last year's real estate transaction and other income, and our interest expense declined 4% on lower average debt levels. First quarter net income of $1.6 billion and earnings per share of $2.69 both improved 1% versus 2023. And our quarterly operating ratio of 60.7% improved 140 basis points year-over-year, which includes a 60 basis point headwind from lower fuel prices.\n Turning to shareholder returns and the balance sheet on Slide 6. First quarter cash from operations totaled $2.1 billion, up roughly $280 million versus last year. Growth in operating income as well as the impact from 2023 labor agreement payments are reflected in that increase. In addition, free cash flow and our cash flow conversion rate both showed nice improvements. As planned, we paid down $1.3 billion of debt maturities in March. That resulted in our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio declining to 2.9x at the end of the quarter, and we continue to be A-rated by our 3 credit rating agencies. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends totaling $795 million.\n Wrapping things up on Slide 7. As you'll hear from Kenny, our overall outlook on the freight environment hasn't changed a lot since January. Yes, there have been some pluses and minuses from our original outlook, but in totality, we still see the same economic uncertainty. What I am certain of, however, is that our service product is meeting and will continue to meet the demand in the marketplace. And when volumes strengthen, we will be ready to provide our customers with the service they need to grow with us. In addition, as evidenced by our first quarter results, we will continue to generate productivity that improves our network efficiency.\n Also demonstrated by those first quarter results is our commitment to generating pricing dollars in excess of inflation dollars. If you set fuel aside, our price commitment as well as expectations for positive mix in 2024 should allow us to pace freight revenue ahead of volume.\n And finally, with capital allocation, we plan to start -- restart share repurchases in the second quarter, a further demonstration of the confidence we have in our strategy and the momentum that is building. The actions we're taking to improve safety, service and operational excellence are reflected in our financials, and continuing on with this strategy will drive shareholder value in 2024 and well into the future.\n Let me turn it over to Kenny now to provide an update on the business environment. Thanks, Justin. We are not providing OR guidance, but -- so I'm not going to comment on your number. But I think the way that you're describing it in terms of what we expect from ourselves is to continue to make improvement. You heard Jim talk about the fact that we made good gains, but there's more to do. And that's really our focus, is to continue to do that quarter-over-quarter to make gains. Obviously, we're doing that in an environment that we can't totally control.\n We control a lot of things, especially about our service product and our cost structure and how we go into the market and how Kenny and his team are pricing, but we are doing that against an economic backdrop that's a little uncertain. We don't know what's going to happen with interest rates yet. So those are the things that do have an impact on us, including fuel prices. So just stay tuned. We feel really good about the setup and are very confident about our ability to perform. So -- we're probably not going to give you a number, Ravi, which isn't going to surprise you, but I'll let Kenny talk to the markets. But just from a mix perspective, with intermodal probably staying weak through most of the year, that probably is going to give us the ability to have some positive mix within our business as we think about that for the rest of the year. Kenny? Those are 2 different ones, Ravi. Yes. Jordan, thanks for that question. So I think you're right. You're hearing a lot of positivity by the team because we know that there are more opportunities. And first, it's building the momentum, it's sustaining the momentum and then keeping the cost out. And so if you think about equipment rents, that really is all about continuing to drive the car velocity, continue to drive the cycle time and the dwell that Eric referenced. So those are directly impacting that line.\n And then purchased services, certainly, the locomotive fleet is a big part of that, as we continue to use our locomotive fleet more protectively and reduce those numbers, that's an opportunity to sustain and potentially improve there as well as across the rest of the contract services that we use, is we're being smarter and looking deeper at every dollar that we're spending. And that's been one of Jim's messages to the team is, when you're looking at the resources, spend the dollars like your own and make sure that it's a wise dollar that's being spent and that you're getting the appropriate return for it. So feel good about continuing to make progress. Yes. Thanks for that question. So mix does help on the RPU. And when we think about mix, there is some different mix in terms of the cost profile that's behind that. Our opportunity and our job is to improve the profitability of every line of business that we have. And so we are very proud of our manifest franchise. That's really our sweet spot for sure. But as Eric talked, intermodal, grain, coal, those are very profitable businesses for us as well to the extent that we can drive greater train length, So -- I'm not going to say we're totally agnostic, but we want to grow, and we want to grow across all lines of business. And so I think if you see us do that, you're going to like the margins that come from them. You bet, Tom. So let me start with the purchased services. So I think I did say that the one-time item there accounted for about half of the year-over-year decrease. So you should set that aside when you're thinking about rolling that forward. But again, as you heard me talk on another question, we still obviously think we have opportunities there.\n If you switch to comp and benefits then, back in January, we said we thought that we would probably see about a 5% increase in that line for the year. We were at 4% here in the first quarter, so really kind of right online there. And I think you know the drivers, they're wage inflation, they're the sick pay benefits, some higher guarantee pay, offset by what we're doing to improve our overall productivity and how we're managing the headcount.\n When you think about those new contract benefits in terms of the sick pay, it's also -- when we're rolling out the work rest agreements, that is resulting in a little bit of an elevation in terms of our TE&Y headcounts in anticipation of those benefits. And so really, the way to think about that is that we're paying a little bit more due to those agreements for the same unit of work. But I think what's encouraging there is we're offsetting that with some of our productivity, and that's our plan going forward. Yes. I mean, obviously, if there's a significant change up or down from a volume perspective, that can have an impact, but I think we feel like we're in a pretty good place right now. Yes. I'll let Kenny talk -- take that coal question. But you're hearing it right. We're putting a lot of pressure on Kenny and the team to go out there and deliver the price, and they're very much stepping up to that and are taking on that challenge and being aggressive in the marketplace. Obviously, we improved our margins in the quarter. So the combination of our volume, which was down a little bit, but price and productivity is what's driving the margin improvement. I can't say that we're accretive yet from just a pure price inflation standpoint, but that absolutely is the goal. We are though exceeding, just the dollars are exceeding the inflation dollars. We're still very confident of that. Kenny?"

            "name": "Kenny Rocker",
            "content": "Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning. As Jennifer mentioned, freight revenues totaled $5.6 billion for the quarter, which was down 1% as core pricing was offset by lower fuel surcharges and a 1% drop in volume. \n Let's jump right in and talk about the key drivers in each of our business groups. Starting with Bulk, revenue for the quarter was down 4% compared to last year on a 5% decrease in volume and a 1% increase in average revenue per car. Solid core pricing gains across most Bulk segments were largely offset by low natural gas prices that unfavorably impacted our coal index contracts and lower on fuel surcharges. \n As stated, coal continued to face difficult market conditions in the first quarter as warmer temperatures overall led to record low natural gas prices and caused significant declines in demand. Grain and grain products volume was up for the quarter with increased shipments of corn to Mexico as well as more shipments from Canadian origins. Lastly, despite strong truck competition, food and refrigerated shipments increased as a result of new business for dry goods solid demand and network service improvement.\n Moving to Industrial. Revenue was up 4% for the quarter, driven by a 1% increase in volume. Strong core pricing gains and a positive mix in traffic were partially offset by lower fuel surcharges. Our strong business development efforts in petroleum allowed us to capitalize on windows of opportunity along with new domestic contract wins. Demand improved for our Petrochemicals business in both export and domestic markets. However, challenges with high inventories and weather negatively impacted our rock volumes. \n Premium revenue for the quarter was down 3% on a 1% increase in volume and a 4% decrease in average revenue per car, reflecting lower fuel surcharges and truck market pressures. Automotive volumes were positive due to business development wins with Volkswagen and General Motors, along with continued strength from dealer inventory replenishment. Intermodal volumes were positive in the quarter, driven by strong international West Coast demand, which was partially offset by the international contract loss I mentioned in January and soft market conditions in domestic intermodal.\n Turning to Slide 10. Here is our 2024 outlook as we see it today for the key markets we serve. Starting with Bulk, we anticipate continued challenges in coal as inventories are projected to be at record levels and natural gas futures remain depressed. We are hopefully watching grain, particularly as it relates to new crop conditions and fourth quarter export demand. We expect domestic grain demand to be stable. \n Lastly, we are optimistic about grain products, as we continue to see growth in biofuel feedstocks. Additionally, we recently won incremental grain products business out of Iowa that started moving earlier this year by demonstrating our consistent service products and developing competitive solutions to support our customer's business. \n Turning to Industrial. The rock market will be challenged to exceed last year's record volume. However, we expect petroleum and petrochem markets to remain favorable due to our focus on business development, supported by our investments in the Gulf Coast and operational excellence.\n And finally, for Premium, on the intermodal side, we expect to see consistent, strong West Coast imports in the near term, but it's still too early to predict what will happen in the back half of the year. On the domestic intermodal side, we continue to see market softness, but expect our strong service products and diversified set of IMC and private asset partners will set us up well when demand returns. For Automotive, we will see continued strength due to our business development wins and improved OEM production. \n In summary, coal and domestic intermodal will put pressure on our volumes this year, but the team has taken action. As you saw in the first quarter, excluding fuel, we were able to grow revenue even as we face lower volumes overall. I am confident that with our improved service products, we will continue to win new business and take trucks off the road. On the price side, we are having deliberate conversations with customers on price increases to overcome inflationary pressures. And those conversations are backed up by an efficient service product that Eric's team has given to our customers so that they can compete and win.\n We have a great franchise, along with being the premier cross-border rail provider to and from Mexico that positions us well to serve markets in both the U.S. and Mexico. Our legacy service and the new service offerings we've added allows us to win in the marketplace, and we see strong opportunities in front of us to grow with our customers. \n And with that, I'll turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance. All right. So look, David, you hit it on the head. What are we doing differently? And I just want to talk to you about some of the product development that Eric and I and our teams are doing together. You look at the Phoenix ramp. We're excited about it. We're seeing that volume come in there and grow sequentially. It just gives our customers and BCOs more optionality.\n Port of Houston is one. We put that service back on. We've been excited about the growth that we've seen come out of there, and we'll continue to add on to the destinations that are there. We started off with 5, now we're at 11. You look at Inland Empire, we just added on a new product there. Now we're going to 20 cities, east of Chicago with the CSX and the NS on the unit train side. Because we are seeing the cycle times improve, we're naturally getting more volume, so we like that piece.\n On the finished vehicle side, you talk about product development. business that's coming off of the water that's getting land bridge that we're moving back east. Look, this lower cost that we have really opens up new markets for us at great margins. So we're on offense. I mean we're pushing every lever we can to get business onto our network. We got a beautiful franchise, as Jim mentioned, and we're taking advantage of it. I mean we talked about the efficiency. It shows up in the product development that we talked about. It shows up in all these small discrete things like adding more cars right at the customer's plant and asking for more business by customer, by plant. Yes. I've been very encouraged and proud of the commercial team and the conversations that they're having with customers on price, articulating the inflationary pressures that are there and working with those customers to price to the market, taking a little bit more risk to price that business. And at the end of the day, our service product has improved, as you can see in the results, and we're talking to our customers about that and aligning that with the capital investments we're making. So it is not a coincidence or by luck, we are having very deliberate conversations with our customers. Yes, I'll start off. Thanks for the question. I said that back in January, it's not like we woke up January 1 and started deciding that we needed to have these deliberate conversations with customers. These started well early last year. And we've shared this. We can touch close to half of our price annually. The other half is in multiyear deals. I touched on it a little bit, about the deliberate conversations that we're having, the risk that's out there. And then I'll talk about a couple of markets. \n You look at domestic intermodal, those spot markets, if you look at it, here where we stand today, they are the same that they were from a spot market perspective last year, so this has been a long time, same thing on the contracted rates. Those contract rates have been where they are for a long time, over 8 months. And so the good thing, if you're an optimist like I am, there -- you know you're at the trough, but the thing you don't know is when things will improve or get better. And we're not in a position where we're going to forecast that they -- when that will happen.\n What I will tell you, and I talked about the product development already, we're prepared. We're ready. We're working with Eric's team, and we're bringing on more volume that comes on. And so we'll see what happens there, but I can tell you that we're prepared and excited. Yes. Thanks for the question. On the near-shoring piece, it's real. You've seen the amount of investments that's there. We've got a strong commercial presence that's there, and you look at the overall rail, I'm talking the rail industry market share into and out of Mexico, is still relatively low if you put it in the mid-teens or so.\n Our new service product that we have in place at this time has been picking up steam and we've seen it grow. We've seen it grow in that North-South corridor. We've seen it grow in the traffic that we put on, the new product that we put on going in the Southeast, so tremendous growth there.\n There is also a more carload business that will come online and more plants that will come online, some of them for some of the autos that are going to come on and some just other what I'll call just industrial pieces. We're set up for that. We're engaging those customers. Our network strength and franchise gives us an opportunity to move a lot of that, both the feedstocks in Mexico and the finished product out of Mexico, so a very strong place for us, the 6 gateways. We had a great quarter coming into and out of Mexico, and we want to build on that.\n As far as those customers coming back to us, with every month that we are able to sustain and ensure reliable product, we're able to capture a little bit more business, but we're also able to sit down with them and talk to them about adding the 1 or 2 carloads or talk to them about a truck lane piece or talk to them about their rail versus truck by lane percentage. So the stronger service product is certainly a positive for us, and our commercial team has been very aggressive out there hustling to get every carload. Yes. I just want to reiterate what Jennifer said, we'll exceed our inflationary dollars. On this coal question that you have, we're looking at the same things. You're looking at in terms of the natural gas futures, and we're talking to our customers, similar to my comments around domestic intermodal. Yes, I think we're at the trough levels, when they will come up is yet to be seen. They're still depressed. We'll see if we get some seasonal lift here going into the spring and the summer. I want a hot, muggy summer so we can move more business. But if that doesn't happen, we'll see what Eric and the team to do for us to efficiently move the coal business. Thank you for the question. Yes. If you look at it, so far this year, our face-to-face meetings, the strong customer engagement strategies. We have a lot more, significantly more contacts with customers, and we're touching them in different ways. One of the unique strategies that we have as I'm looking at Eric, 1/3 of our meetings have an operating leader or a local operating person is there. And we're doing that to see how we can grow more business specifically. So strong customer engagement strategy at all levels, and we're going to keep at it. Thanks for the question. Elliot, thanks for the question. So a few things here. Let's set aside the contract loss you referenced. It's been strong. International intermodal has been strong for us, a little bit of a pleasant surprise for us that we've been able to capitalize on it. We're seeing more IPI business or business that's going into our network increase by a few points. We are aware that there has been a small impact on the positive side because of some of the challenges with the Panama Canal. We'll see what happens if some of the BCOs are a little bit more concerned with any labor issues on the East Coast.\n But as we go through the second quarter, I feel pretty good about those volumes staying where they are, as we talk to our customers in their pipeline. I'd like to see as we move a few weeks out what happens in the second half of the year. So I'm not ready today here in April to bet on what's going to happen in the second half of the year. \n The last thing I'll end with, and I've said this quite a bit, I do like the fact that regardless of what happens at the West Coast, we're preparing for if it does get transloaded, more products were to get to the East Coast that I talked about, those 20 cities that will move with the NS and the CSX, our Phoenix product and us being holistically and leveraging the entire franchise to go after more business out of the Port of Houston. Thanks for your question. Yes. Thanks for the question. You heard my comments around our petroleum markets and business development wins there. And it's a type of oil that we're moving that we're excited about, and it's moving right now domestically. We've seen some strength. Eric's team has been able to help us grow a little bit of that business and get as much of it as we can. So we don't see that kind of traditional crude by rail that we saw 10 years ago, but we're seeing another emerging commodity in the market that we're excited to be moving, and it's going great for us."
