Currently all callers have been placed in a listen-only mode and following management's prepared remarks, the call will be opened up for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's call is being recorded. Please go to TPG IR website to obtain earnings materials. 00:48 I would now like to turn the call over to Gary Stein, Head of Investor Relations at TPG.\nGary Stein: 00:55 Great. Thank you, operator. Welcome to our fourth quarter of 2021 earnings call. Joining me this morning are: Jon Winkelried, Chief Executive Officer and Jack Weingart, our Chief Financial Officer. In addition, our Executive Chairman and Co-Founder, Jim Coulter and our President Todd Sisitsky are also here with us and will be available for the Q&A portion of this morning's call. 01:16 Before we begin, I'd like to remind you this call may include forward-looking statements, which do not guarantee future events or performance.

We believe it is helpful for investors and analysts to understand the historic results through the lens of our go-forward structure and please refer to TPG\u2019s earnings release for details on the pro forma financial information. 02:00 We will also be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call that management believes are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to the nearest GAAP figures in TPG\u2019s earnings release, which is available on the company's website. Please note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any TPG fund. 02:21 I'd now like to turn the call over to Jon Winkelried, Chief Executive Officer.\nJon Winkelried: 02:26 Thanks, Gary, and good morning to everyone. I'd like to thank you all for joining us for our first public investor call, since we completed our IPO on NASDAQ in January. Becoming a publicly listed company was a significant milestone for TPG, as we celebrate our 30th anniversary as an innovator in the alternative asset management industry. 02:48 During our prepared remarks, I'm going to touch on our strong performance for the fourth quarter and full-year of 2021, and then I'll discuss a few highlights across the five multi-product platforms that comprise TPG\u2019s business. I'll then turn the call over to Jack to provide some more details on our financial results. After that I'll make some closing remarks and then we'll open up the call to take your questions. 03:11 Before I discuss our performance, I'd like to address the situation in Ukraine, which I'm sure continues to weigh heavily on all of you just as it does on us here at TPG. From a humanitarian perspective what we've all been watching unfold is truly heart wrenching on so many levels and we extend our thoughts to the courageous citizens of Ukraine. We are providing financial assistance through several charities on the ground in Ukraine and we are also encouraging all of our employees to do whatever they can to help. From a business perspective we have conducted a thorough review of all of our activities and we've confirmed the funds we manage have no direct investments in any Russia or Ukraine-based companies in addition, no Russian Institutional Investors or Sanctioned Russian Nationals or Limited Partners in any of TPG funds. 04:05 We finished 2021 with $114 billion of total assets under management, which increased 27% year-over-year. This growth was driven by a combination of strong investment performance and fundraising across our five platforms, partially offset by significant realization activity. From a value creation perspective, TPG\u2019s funds increased by 7% in the fourth quarter and 38% for the year, which compares to 18% in the prior year. 04:33 Turning to fundraising, we had our second strongest year on record with approximately $20 billion raised, nearly tripling the amount of capital we raised in 2020. Looking at invested capital we put nearly $8 billion to work in the fourth quarter and deployed $22 billion during the year. We have also been very intentional with our realization strategy and we've had an outstanding year with $7 billion of realizations in the fourth quarter, and more than $25 billion for the full-year. 05:03 Taking a step back, we recognize we're talking with you this morning about results that occurred several months ago. Since that time, the global geopolitical and economic landscape has changed dramatically. We are now operating a mix of far more uncertain and volatile backdrop, due to a number of significant macro factors, including widespread inflation, rising rate environment, global supply chain disruptions, and a tight labor market that is driving an extraordinary demand for talent, in addition, of course to the war in Ukraine. 05:35 In an environment such as this, we are even more intently focused on adhering to our investment strategy and approach and we were relying on the playbook we have developed through our 30-years of experience investing across cycles as we navigate through this period. Our expertise is informing every aspect of our business, such as how we source and underwrite new investments; engage with our portfolio companies; and attract and retain top talent. 06:02 With that in mind, I'd like to spend a few minutes walking you through some of the highlights across our five multi-product platforms, starting with our largest platform capital, which had a total AUM of $55 billion at the end of 2021. The recent performance of the portfolio companies within our capital funds has been very strong with value creation of more than 7% in the fourth quarter and 43% for the full-year. This performance was driven by strong growth at the portfolio company level and underscores our investment strategy and focus on bending the curve with respect to the growth trajectory of our portfolio companies. We have also been actively investing across the capital platform, deploying nearly $11 billion in 2021 with a focus on large scale control-oriented investments in our core sectors. As an example of the types of investments we made in the fourth quarter, in November we announced a significant transact -- strategic investment in Troon, the world's largest golf and club related leisure and hospitality services company. We made this investment together with professional golfer Rory McIlroy, who invested in the company in partnership with us. 07:09 During the fourth quarter, we also completed the corporate carve out of Boomi from Dell in a $4 billion transaction. 2021 was also a very significant year for us to deploy capital through our Asia franchise. During the year, we made several investments in the region such as Greenfields Dairy, which is a leading consumer dairy business in Southeast Asia; and Fund Lab, which is a leading out-of-home entertainment company with operations in Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore. 07:38 As I mentioned, we have also been highly focused on returning profits to our fund investors. And during 2021, we generated record total realizations in the capital platform of approximately $16 billion, including $4 billion in the fourth quarter. We also have a robust pipeline of realizations in 2022, including the sales of McAfee and Wind River. Jack will provide some additional details regarding these significant transactions during his remarks. 08:07 I'd now like to discuss our growth platform, which are at $22 billion of total AUM at the end of 2021. This platform provides flexible and scaled capital for rapidly growing businesses through our growth, tech adjacencies, and digital media funds. These funds are well positioned to capitalize on the continued trend of high-quality growth companies staying private for longer. Given the scale and stage at which we are investing and the resources we bring to bear in the current volatile and uncertain market, we are seeing excellent opportunities to invest, including investments with structured securities with downside protection. 08:46 Similar to our capital portfolio, our growth funds continued to perform well with aggregate value creation of 5% in the fourth quarter and 32% for the year. We deployed more than $3 billion during 2021 in a wide variety of companies and returned $4 billion to our investors during the same period. Since the beginning of the year, we have already announced several investments, including project44, a leading provider of supply chain visibility solutions and Xpressbees one of the fastest growing third-party logistics firms in India. 09:18 Moving on, I'd like to briefly discuss our Impact platform, which our total AUM of $14 billion as of December 31, including our inaugural rise Climate Fund, which currently has nearly $7 billion of AUM and we believe is one of the largest and most significant new private equity fund raisers. We were a first mover to institutionalize the private market impact investing more than five years ago and we are incredibly proud of the market-leading platform we have built. Our Impact funds, which operate under the Rise brand focus on investing in companies that are driving societal benefits, while also generating non-concessionary financial returns. 09:54 In addition, we have built a rigorous proprietary impact measurement framework through Y Analytics, TPG\u2019s Impact assessment in ESG performance arm to objectively measure and report the true impact of our funds invested capital. Consistent with our long-held view that impact investments do not need to have lower returns, our Rise funds had a net IRR of 25% as of December 31st to the portfolio of attractive, high growth companies across a range of sectors such as education, healthcare, accessibility financial inclusion, and Climate. 10:28 As an example of the types of significant impact investments we make during the fourth quarter, we announced that Rise Climate is investing $1 billion in a newly created Electric Vehicle subsidiary of Tata Motors, one of the India's largest vehicle manufacturers. This sizable transaction aligns with Rise Climates focus on decarbonize transport, leveraging TPG\u2019s long history of investing in India and our expertise and corporate carve outs. It also underscores the substantial number of opportunities we are seeing to deploy capital at scale and proprietary climate investments around the world. 11:03 In terms of operating results the value creation across our Impact funds was 9% for the fourth quarter and 33% for the year. During 2021 our Impact funds deployed $1.7 billion and we returned more than $1 billion to our fund investors, nearly half of those realizations were generated in the fourth quarter led by the sale of DreamBox Learning a pioneer in the emerging field of intelligent adaptive learning. 11:28 Turning now to real estate, this multi-product platform ended 2021 with $13 billion of total AUM across our opportunistic real estate funds, our core plus strategy and a publicly traded REIT. Our real estate investment -- our real estate platform harnesses TPG\u2019s collective sector expertise and knowledge, applying a thematic approach to investing with a focus on building companies and platforms. This differentiated investment strategy has enabled our $3.7 billion opportunistic real estate fund TREP 3 to generate a 30% net IRR, since inception as of the end of 2021. 12:04 TPG\u2019s real estate platform delivered value creation of 6% for the fourth quarter at 31% for the year across our opportunistic and core plus funds. Our team has been very active deploying a returning capital to our investors, a platform invested $4.5 billion in 2021, including $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter and had total realizations of $3 billion for the year. One transaction, I'd like to highlight is the acquisition of Cinespace Studios, which is North America's second largest independent soundstage platform. Cinespace is well positioned for growth, driven by the surge in demand for original TV and film content. This transaction reflects the deep expertise in media and content development across the firm and is a great example of our thematic approach to investing. 12:50 Lastly, I'd like to touch on our Market Solutions platform, which at $10 billion of total AUM at the end of 2021 across several strategies, including our long-short and long-only public investing funds, our Capital Markets Group and Private Market Solutions, which is our secondary\u2019s business. Our Capital Markets Business, which we established more than 15-years ago as continued to drive significant value by delivering bespoke solutions and optimized financing outcomes for our portfolio companies. Our Asian secondary's business NewQuest continues to perform well, driven by a distinct focus on GP Solutions and we are actively building out our secondary\u2019s platform globally. 13:28 Summing it all up, 2021 was an excellent and important year for TPG. For us that starts with continuing to deliver outstanding investment results across each of our five platforms and generating strong operational and financial results firmwide. We are carrying that momentum into 2022, which began with our successful initial public offering in January. Our strong start to the year has continued with a number of significant developments, regarding realization events, new investments by our funds, and ongoing success with our broad-based fundraising campaign. We will also continue to explore ways to diversify and expand our business through both organic and inorganic opportunities. We've been highly successful with our organic growth initiatives and over the last four years, we have raised $17 billion for five new products. 14:16 Regarding inorganic growth there are several asset classes where we do not currently have a presence that would be highly complementary to our existing product set. We are continually exploring a pipeline of strategic growth opportunities that may help accelerate our ongoing expansion and diversification. 14:34 I'd now like to turn the call over to Jack, so he can take you through our financial results.\nJack Weingart: 14:39 Thanks, Jon and good morning everyone, I'm going to briefly walk through our financial results and highlight some of the more significant points regarding our fourth quarter and full-year financial performance. Our total assets under management grew from $90 billion at the end of 2020 to $114 billion at the end of \u201821. The drivers of this 27% increase during the year include $29 billion of value-creation from our underlying fund investments and over $20 billion from capital raises, partially offset by more than $25 billion of realizations as Jon alluded to. Then we returned to our fund investors throughout 2021. 15:19 Looking briefly at fee generating AUM, we had approximately $60 billion at the end of \u201921, compared to $51 billion at the end of 2020. This 19% increase was driven primarily by the successful raising of nearly $9 billion in fee earning capital related to the Impact and growth platforms. As you may have noticed on Page 20 of our earnings presentation, we have provided some additional detail regarding the duration of our total and fee earning assets under management. 15:49 At the end of \u201921 approximately 87% of our AUM and 85% of our fee earning AUM was in either perpetual or long dated funds with a duration at inception of 10-years or longer. In addition 75% of our fee earning AUM had a remaining duration of five or more years as of the end of 2021, with nearly 25% in vehicles with 10 or more years remaining. At year-end we also had $9.4 billion of AUM subject to fee earning growth, including nearly $7 billion of AUM not yet earning fees and $2.5 billion of fee earning AUM subject to fee rate step-ups in the future. 16:33 In total, we estimate the potential fee-related revenue opportunity associated with this AUM is approximately $50 million to $55 million on an annual basis with very high incremental margins. In addition, at the end of 2021 our funds had more than $28 billion of available capital or dry powder for future deployment. As Gary mentioned, we recently completed our reorganization in connection with our IPO. Beginning in '22, we are now operating under our new structure and we believe it's important to communicate our historical results to you on a pro forma basis for comparability purposes. We recorded GAAP net income for the quarter of $326 million and our pro forma basis GAAP net income totaled $41 million. 17:20 Turning to our pro forma non-GAAP results for the fourth quarter and full-year of 2021. We reported fee-related revenues of $238 million for the fourth quarter, which increased 18% year-over-year and $874 million for the full-year, which increased 20% versus the prior year. We also reported pro forma fee-related earnings or FRE of $91 million for the quarter and $326 million for the year, which was an increase of 44% versus pro forma 2020. The strong growth in our quarterly and full-year fee-related earnings was driven by a combination of top line growth in management fees at a meaningful expansion in our FRE margins. As we continue to scale our business and generate operating leverage. 18:09 Our pro forma FRE margins were 38% for the fourth quarter of \u201821 and 37% for the full-year, compared to 31% in 2020 and 26% in 2019. As we've indicated previously, we expect the continued growth in our FRE margins with a target margin of 45% that we expect to achieve in the next two years. Our pro forma after-tax distributable earnings in the fourth quarter of \u201821 were $137 million, which increased 34% versus the year ago quarter and for the full-year, we generated $538 million of pro forma after-tax DE, which more than doubled, compared to 2020. 18:53 In addition to the strong FRE growth that I just discussed, our pro forma after-tax DE for the fourth quarter and full-year of \u201821 also benefited from a substantial amount of realized performance allocations, which were $54 million in the fourth quarter and $205 million for the year. Notwithstanding, the significant amount of realized performance allocations we generated in 2021, we ended the year with a pro forma net accrued performance allocation balance, which reflects the 20% allocation to the TPG Operating Group of $769 million, an increase of 96% relative to a balance of $392 million at year-end 2020. We also have begun 2022 with a significant amount of realized performance allocations already locked in, including the two signed sale transactions in our capital funds that Jon mentioned. The $14 billion take private of McAfee, where we were substantial shareholders and the sale of Wind River to Aptiv in a $4 billion strategic acquisition. 20:01 Based only on sales of portfolio companies that have been contractually committed in our capital growth and Impact platforms, including Wind River and McAfee. We currently expect these transactions will generate more than $200 million of realized performance allocations on a pre-tax basis. The McAfee sale closed earlier this month, so the performance allocations from this sale will be included in our Q1 dividend and we expect the sale of Wind River to close in the next two quarters. 20:34 Turning briefly to our balance sheet on Page 17 of our earnings presentation, we've included a pro forma view assuming our IPO occurred on December 31st of 2021 and as you can see we have a balance sheet light business model and we are well capitalized with approximately $650 million of cash and less than $450 million of long-term debt. 20:57 Looking forward, we have an exciting period of growth ahead of us at TPG. We have a broad series of fundraising campaigns underway and spanning 11 products across all five of our multi-product platforms. In capital, we launched next generation funds in January as planned for all three of our products TPG Capital, TPG Asia and Healthcare Partners. In Impact, we recently launched our Next Rise Fund and in real estate, we are nearing completion of our next opportunistic fund and we just had a final close last week on our first Core Plus product. We also expect to be in market with several new products over the next 18-months, including life sciences and secondary\u2019s. 21:40 While the fundraising market has become more challenging in recent months, we've been very pleased with our clients receptivity to these campaigns, we are experiencing strong momentum and we remain confident in our ability to achieve our broad fundraising objectives. Through this fundraising cycle, we\u2019re also focused on strategically expanding our institutional client base and further building our presence in the high net worth channel and we're seeing very strong demand from our high net worth channel partners in particular. 22:09 Before I turn the call back over to Jon, I'd like to share some financial guidance based on our current expectations for the first quarter of \u201922. While we do not intend to provide quarterly guidance on a regular basis, since we're reporting the fourth quarter results so close to the end of the first quarter, we believe it's appropriate to provide guidance in this instance. For the first quarter of \u201922, we currently expect fee-related revenue in the range of $235 million to $245 million; FRE in the range of $87 million to $92 million and pre-tax DE in the range of $190 million to $200 million. 22:49 I'd also like to quickly remind you of the timing for our first dividend, as well as our dividend policy. As we noted during the IPO process we expect the Executive Committee of our Board to declare our first dividend in the second quarter of this year with respect to the first quarter of \u201922. Based on this timing, we currently plan to publish our first quarter \u201922 results in May and pay a dividend to record holders during the month of June. As a reminder, our current intention is to pay out to shareholders at least 85% of the after-tax distributable earnings attributable to the TPG Operating Group on a quarterly basis, subject to necessary approvals. 23:28 I'd now like to turn the call back over to Jon for a few closing remarks.\nJon Winkelried: 23:33 Thanks, Jack. Before we take your questions, I wanted to touch on what we view as the most critical element of our strategy TPG\u2019s culture. With our family office heritage and our West Coast roots, we maintain a flat organizational structure that fosters an entrepreneurial and inclusive environment and celebrates innovation, authenticity and a hands-on approach towards identifying solutions and building businesses. 23:58 As we talk about culture, I'd like to highlight TPG\u2019s long-standing commitment to fostering strong ESG performance as a firm and in our investment practices. ESG is a core tenant of TPG\u2019s culture and manifests itself in everything we do from Impact investing to building a responsible portfolio to advancing diversity and inclusivity within our organization, ecosystem and industry. Earlier this month TPG sponsored the Annual Women and Private Equity Summit for the six-year with 21 of our senior women representing the firm at this leading industry event. We believe our commitment to building a diverse equitable and inclusive culture improves the quality of our investments and our ability to build great companies. 24:42 Last month, we held the strategy off-site in the San Francisco for our senior business leaders. It was the first time we had been altogether in person since COVID and it reinforced the momentum we are feeling across the firm. We have started bringing our employees back into our offices around the world on a regular basis and the collective level of enthusiasm across the firm has been incredible. It's clear to me and other members of our leadership team that despite our extended period of time working away from the office, the culture TPG has never been stronger, we're extremely proud of our team for their exceptional performance during an unprecedented time in our professional careers, and we look forward to what we will accomplish as we move forward together at TPG. 25:21 With that, we'll open up the line for questions.\nOperator: 25:25 [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nJon Winkelried: 25:46 Craig, you there, Craig?\nOperator: 25:52 Craig, Your line is now open. Please check the mute function on your phone.\nJon Winkelried: 26:01 Why don\u2019t we go to the next question. Let\u2019s see if we can get Craig back in the queue.\nOperator: 26:09 We will take our next question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is now open.\nGlenn Schorr: 26:17 Hi, thanks very much. I heard you are standing firm on your broad fundraising objectives. I wanted to dig a little deeper into the like near-term say, this year we\u2019ve seen a good pull down in rotation out of growth and rising rates that you mentioned and cracked from valuations. I think that might be a good thing for deploying capital. But I don't know if that slows realizations such that LP\u2019s liquidity is gummed up. So can you just talk about the current fundraising environment growth in capital and how you weigh the puts and takes of all that?\nJack Weingart: 26:57 Sure. Hey, Glenn, it\u2019s Jack. Thanks for the question. Look, I think the fundraising, environment, let me start by saying what, over a longer arc we continue to believe that the very positive secular growth drivers for our industry remain intact. We think the growth of investable capital will continue, the allocations to alternatives across most pools of capital around the world will continue and the desire among the largest allocators to invest more capital with fewer managers, we think will certainly benefit firms like TPG. 27:33 In the short-term to answer your question, the industry is definitely experiencing some indigestion due to a few factors. You pointed to the slowdown in liquidity, and we certainly would expect that, I think as you heard from my comments; our liquidity, we have a substantial amount already locked in that will be closing over the coming quarters from sales that have already been signed. So, I think we will continue to be a stand out among the LPs in driving substantial liquidity from our portfolios. But for the industry, if choppy markets continue liquidity will likely slow down. There's also been faster deployment than expected across the industry, and there has been a bit of a numerator, denominator effect kicking in as many of you have written about with last year's strong alternative performance driving outsized gains in LPs alternative portfolios, and then this year's choppy market is driving a bit of a denominator effect with total assets going down on the margin. 28:35 So the result of all of that is a bit of indigestion in the market, but I will tell you we are in the market with many of our campaigns that I alluded to on the call. And as I said, we are seeing strong reception from our clients for our fundraising campaigns and we do expect to be successful across our fundraising efforts, but those dynamics that you alluded to in the market are definitely real.\nGlenn Schorr: 29:02 I hear you and I agree with on the long term, that's cool. Maybe one quick follow-up on the -- there is liquidity drive in all different parts of the market, and there\u2019s some articles written recently on how the demand for private credit capital is in very high demand with the backup in rates? So, curious how you're thinking about, I know it hasn't been that long since our last conversation, but your build versus buy, what you're doing on the organic front to address some credit demands in the market and then how you're thinking about the backdrop? Is this a good thing or bad thing with the market shifts and your ability to maybe find a partner in the credit side?\nJon Winkelried: 29:45 Glenn, it\u2019s Jon. Thanks for the question. Look, I think at a high level, I don't think any of us have ever seen, sort of, the level of, kind of, evolution within our industry going on in terms of M&A activity, strategic activity across the board, and I think that with some of the forces that Jack described and forces that we've described before, I think that we find that the size and scale is continuing to matter more, being able to raise capital and source capital is -- I think is being ever more influenced by brand and strength of brand. And our LPs that we are close to, want to do more with us across a range of different products, and so I think that, that force is sort of affecting the industry more broadly and we were looking at some of the data, the other day I think over the -- from a decade of \u201809 to like 2018, there were something like four M&A deals done in our industry, and I think last year there were eight -- only -- there were eight I think last year only, and I think there's four or five already this year. 31:00 So, there's a lot of talk and a lot of dialog going on in the industry, and I think there were many managers across various strategies, including credit, but not exclusive to credit as you've already seen that are trying to see and trying to think about what the future looks like. That's, creating a lot of dialog and it's creating a lot of opportunity. So, we are -- as we discussed when we went through our IPO process, we think we're well positioned as sort of a strategic partner for a number of different types of businesses. As I mentioned before, I think we feel like credit as an example is -- and by the way, it's not the only area, but we feel like credit is complementary to the firm and our capabilities overall and so we are evaluating opportunities, and we're going to be as you would expect, I think, we're going to be careful about what we do and we're going to try to be tactical about what we do with respect to doing something that we feel like we can is complementary with our overall franchise is something that we feel like we can help continue to scale also something that where the culture and the people are compatible with what's important to us as an organization and where we feel, again that will get sort of the power of the brand and the power of the franchise working together. 32:28 And so I would expect us to make some progress on that over time, but we're not -- we certainly don't feel compelled to rush on anything we want to find the right opportunities. There are a couple of other areas, I would say, you know, that we feel like we can leverage our brand and expertise well into, I would say another area might be the, kind of, broader infrastructure space, particularly as it relates to energy transition leveraging off of what we built on the Rise within our Rise business within the Impact business, leveraging off our Rise brand, our Y Analytics capability and what we've seen and what we're doing in Climate, where we're seeing as a result of having now raised the capital and deploying our team into the market, we're seeing a lot of interesting opportunities. 33:19 And so I think building some capital with perhaps somewhat different cost of capital features to it. And building an expertise in other disciplines might be very additive to us there, you know, we made an acquisition in the Secondary\u2019s GP solutions space, which is NewQuest, I think, we continue to be interested and continuing to grow that. We're organically, kind of, launching our business within GP Solutions in the US and in Europe by having added a team, which we've talked about before and we're about to add -- we're about to launch in a -- another organic step out strategy of ours will be life sciences, which we're about to launch in the market, which is obviously leveraging off our deep expertise there. 34:07 So I think our mix of, kind of, organic step out growth opportunities for us, we'll continue to be an important part of our playbook. And then we have our eyes and ears open with respect to other opportunities strategically in the market.\nGlenn Schorr: 34:25 Thank you for all that, Jon.\nOperator: 34:29 [Operator Instructions] And we will take our next question from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nCraig Siegenthaler: 34:44 Great. Can you guys hear me, okay?\nJon Winkelried: Yes. Loud and clear.\nCraig Siegenthaler: 34:48 Hi, perfect, good. So good morning, everyone. Hope you all doing well?\nJon Winkelried: 34:52 Good morning.\nCraig Siegenthaler: 34:53 My question is on the growth of value rotation that we're seeing. If the US equity markets go through a multi-year growth to value rotation, can you talk about how this will impact our business, but also remind us how private market investing is different than public market investing in some ways, less impacted by public market valuations?\nTodd Sisitsky: 35:13 Great. Yes, thanks, Craig. It's Todd Sisitsky here. Thank you for the questions. You know, I think, first of all, you're right, we've been oriented as growth investors and transformational investors and I think I'll get to in a moment, but I think your point about the private market being somewhat different that the public markets is spot on. And we've been anticipating choppier markets and really a potential downturn now for several years and that expectation has really shaped our approach to investing and managing our portfolio. 35:46 So first, you know, the new investment front. Our expectation for a market reset and downturn is factored into the go-to-market strategy, the way that we source the new investments that we make. And for several years now, we've built multiple compression so an expectation that we will exit at a lower multiple than we acquired company into our financial model. And our expectation of this downturn has led us to be even more committed to our core strategy of investing only in those sectors and in those themes, so we have really strong conviction across the partnership, and we've got that angles and confidence in our strategies over a number of years. 36:25 And for us especially in late cycle, but really throughout our strategy, we focused on investing in secular sources of growth rather than cyclical growth, which we do think navigates very well through different economic environments. So you can see, for us, even with the choppiness of the past 12-month period and the COVID effect our broad portfolio grew, it's revenue at a rate of 35% versus 17% for the S&P 500 Total Return Index. And so the, you know, so really the sectors and themes we're investing behind in healthcare in cyber security and Climate and DevOps and EdTech, you know, these are all themes that we think we'll grow well and we'll grow through different market environments and will overwhelm the multiple contraction that we're modeling. 37:10 So if you\u2019re -- to distill our investment strategy on two principles, the first is to focus on sectors and themes. And the second is really to invest and this is where I think it gets to the point that you're raising about the difference between private and public markets in situations where we can inflect the growth where we can bend the curve as Jon mentioned in his comments of the companies that we invest in. And so we're able to really focus on organic growth and inorganic growth we spent years, developing themes, building relationships with CEOs and once we have a company, it's a platform for us. So we invest in it with the view of a longer-term hold in some cases through different market cycles to the point where we feel like we have seen this growth here more strategic and that's a big part of the reason you see so many interesting strategic exits for us on the other side. 37:58 And our experience over the 30-years of investing across cycles is that the strong secular growers with strong support engagement, investment from us as a sponsor can perform quite well through recessions. So again recognizing that we're living through a complicated and choppy market, this is -- these are exactly the type of companies, the ones we've invested over the last few years that we think we would invest in under any market condition, including late cycle and where we find ourselves now in the market. 38:30 The only other observation I'd make relative to your question of the rotation from growth to value is that a lot of the discussion of a public market reset is really around young and often pre-revenue companies that saw explosive growth run-ups in the meme era and often, as it seem recently been weighed towards companies, who badly missed aggressive revenue projections. And stepping back, of course, it would make some sense that these pre-revenue companies are very early stage companies would be particularly sensitive to capital market volatility, because these companies need access to additional funding to keep operating, but pre-revenue is really not part of the market that we focus on. And we're really seeing very strong performance in our portfolio not the extraordinary performance misses that you've seen some of these high flying public young growth companies. 39:18 So the last point, new investment front the reset in the public market in a lot of ways as you also mentioned creates a really interesting opportunity for us on the new investment front in the intermediate term. Only the 25% to 30% of our exits in the growth arena, have been in the public markets, but the public market is really are a meaningful competitor to us, the stack in the IPO boom over the past couple of years represented with a competitor and took dozens of opportunities that we might have otherwise pursued away. And so right now we find ourselves in a very good position, where capital has become more scarce again, which is of course very positive thing for us. 39:58 The other thing I'd just point out briefly relative to the market environment is that, you know, that has our expectation of a downturn and choppiness in the market has also driven our priority and our focus around liquidity. As both Jon and Jack described, we've been very focused on driving liquidity during the favorable period over the last few years, record liquidity return to our investors in several business units and driven overwhelmingly through a return sale of equity and specifically full company sales rather than floating companies are doing recaps. And so that has the effect, which is a very positive one for us, particularly in the context of our fundraising efforts of returning capital at the same LPs that we're going to be -- that we\u2019re going to for additional some new fundraisers. But also locking in our returns and locking in our performance. And so from our standpoint, that's been a really important part of our macro view, where we are in the cycle. 40:59 So, look we\u2019re a folks in this environment, and we do anticipate choppy times ahead, but we actually feel like our playbook, our strategy of investing in growth companies and then transforming and inflecting those growth companies is actually very well suited to the current environment, we feel really excited about the portfolio that we've built up over the last few years. 41:17 Jim, do you want -- anything you add to that?\nJim Coulter: 41:19 You know, that was well said, Todd. Craig having done this for a long time, it\u2019s always been interesting to me how different the private market growth investing landscape is in the public market, best in landscape and to think indices in the public market investing world, we tend to think companies in our world. And as Todd pointed out where you get heard is if you have unexpected multiple compression, which is not what we're seeing in our underwriting. 41:47 Secondly, you\u2019ve heard if you miss your numbers in our portfolio is performing very, very strong. And third, in some ways the public market is a robust competitor for us. The world we went through last year of very high access to public markets and SPAC activity in some ways was less attractive for us than the environment we're in now. In the intermediate term to long-term investing area that we're in, this is actually a better part of the cycle for us to invest in, and I think our LPs understand that and continue to support us as we delve into this very interesting market.\nCraig Siegenthaler: 42:36 Hey, thanks for the comprehensive response there. Just a quick follow-up on inorganic growth corporate M&A, we just wanted to update in terms of how you're thinking about this, if anything, sort of, changed? And I was especially interested in the credit vertical and also retail distribution?\nJon Winkelried: 42:56 When you say it changed relative to what?\nCraig Siegenthaler: 43:02 Your prior expectations for inorganic growth?\nJon Winkelried: 43:06 No, I don't think so, I mean, I think we're -- I would say if there is anything that may be changed is we're mindful of price, because the values in various parts of the market have been -- I would say frothy to a degree, it's for certain businesses at certain levels of scale or certain levels of development, everybody thinks they have really valuable thing, and so we're mindful of that as we look at opportunities. But I think again the important things for us, our quality of business, quality of partner and what we feel is an intelligent fit both by virtue of the nature of the business, as well as the team that people, we\u2019re not buying something -- we wouldn't be buying something with an eye toward, you know, just having, sort of, some, kind of, independent subsidiaries somewhere, we'd be buying something that would become part of our overall franchise. And so we also are looking for as people who want to join us, but that would continue to be builders and building the business and so that's important to us. 44:31 I think that within the landscape of credit, as an example, obviously credit is not just one thing, there are sort of multiple aspects to what credit strategies do. And I think that we would over time also be looking to build a balanced approach to that in terms of the different, kind of, lines of business if you will. And so we may -- if we are able to do something in terms of an acquisition, as an example, we may do something that's a piece of that strategy to start with and then continue to build from there. So, but I don't think, I have anything more yet other than our intent to continue to build and diversify our franchise that we talked about during our IPO process, when we last talked about, this is still the same.\nCraig Siegenthaler: 45:27 Thank you, Jon.\nJon Winkelried: 45:29 Thanks.\nOperator: 45:31 We will take our next question from Ken Worthington with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.\nKen Worthington: 45:37 Hi, good morning. TPG has used structured products and other mechanisms to provide some downside protection to your fund returns. I guess, I wanted to better understand how that downside protection may be holding up in the current markets? And where I've struggled is with the degree of protection you're actually getting from these structures? So I was hoping you could help us on maybe the magnitude of the downside protection you've built in either from the proportion of your investments that utilize these structures? Or maybe another way would be if the markets down at certain percent, what sort of downside protection you think an overall portfolio might get from your utilization of this downside protection?\nJack Weingart: 46:25 Ken, as you know in the growth equity market in this case differentiated from Venture. There is a wide usage of preferred stock structures. And also those preferred stocks have real teeth, because the businesses are at a point where they have achieved fundamental long-term value. I would say very high percentage of our growth equity investing is in preferred structures and increasingly as markets get choppy, those preferred\u2019s are not only downside protection, but often have ratchets, super premiums or other things that provide not only downside protection, but upside even in a downside scenario, that's one of the innovations, we really have been leaders in, in the growth equity marketplace. How many not from venture, but instead from the structured world of private equity, we have always built that into our portfolio. I can give you today a absolute percentage as to what percent of the capital would be in that structure, but it is a very broad piece of our economic tool kit. And that is something you will also see us use even more aggressively going forward. 47:47 In moments like this, Ken, as companies go to the financing markets with uncertainty often they're wanting to avoid down rounds and that allows us to create very attractive structure transactions for the capital that they will need as they continue to grow.\nKen Worthington: 48:07 Brilliant, thank you. And then just maybe briefly non-comp expense, I believe, was $36 million this quarter. Where there unusual items in 4Q or is that sort of OpEx, a good starting point for 1Q and beyond?\nJon Winkelried: 48:25 Yes, I think it's a good starting point for 1Q and beyond. We are -- as you know, we've had to build substantial resources to support all the activities as a public company, and I think that's a good starting point for OpEx going forward.\nKen Worthington: 48:40 Great. Thank you very much.\nKen Worthington: 48:43 Thanks.\nOperator: 48:46 We will take our next question from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nAlex Blostein: 48:53 Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the question as well. Maybe just building on some of the fundraising discuss from earlier some of your comments around private equity and sort of some of the indigestion in the marketplace are sort of consistent with how we've been looking at it as well? But curious if you are seeing any of the similar signs in terms of fundraising within other parts of private markets and if you could also give us a sense that within private equity by type of LP or geography, are you seeing any notable differences or is your common fairly broad-based?\nJon Winkelried: 49:29 Sorry, Alex, you're saying just, kind of, drilling down on the characterization, I gave more by geography and type of LP?\nAlex Blostein: 49:39 Yes, exactly right. So the private equity broadly comment -- heard that lot unclear for the industry, but you guys generally expect your fundraising to be on track with what you've communicated during the IPO. But as kind of double-click into that geographies and LP types, so there are notable differences between different customer basis?\nJon Winkelried: 49:58 Yes, that's a good question, Alex and I know you wrote somewhat extensively about this and I think we do a lot of your comments, but to your point, these dynamics are very different in different parts of the world and with different types of LPs. The most directly impacted by some of the, kind of, numerator, denominator, allocation target type math that I walk through or maybe a good example of the US State Pension Funds, who operate with a target for alternatives and although some of those targets are moving higher and there's been some publicity about that. Do they have to manage to a target pretty specifically? So -- and some of the -- maybe International pools of capital that are growing more rapidly and don't have quite as strict target to manage to or actually, we're seeing increasing allocations to our funds. 50:53 As we are in the market, we have some, who are more directly impacted by this. Re-upping with us for sure in some cases staying flat when they would have preferred to increase the amount of capital that we invest for them, but in the international pools of capital we're seeing in some cases, substantial increases in commitment sizes.\nAlex Blostein: 51:15 Great, that's really helpful color. Just pivoting to maybe some of the other growth initiatives we talked about in the past. I was hoping maybe we could zone in on Core Plus real estate, and when you guys are doing there with, especially with respect to opportunities to roll this product out to retail broadly, and any sort of timing of that would be would be helpful? Thanks.\nJon Winkelried: 51:36 You know, I would make one more comment on the -- I left out you just sparked my thought process, Alex. But within the broad high net worth in retail landscape that whole universe of investors is still substantially under allocated to alternatives, and is not impacted by the, kind of, current formulaic numerator, denominator effect so we continue to see real opportunity to grow into that space.\nJim Coulter: 52:01 And Alex, it's Jim. One thing I would add also is the learning\u2019s of the last private equity cycle was that investors, who stepped back from their deployment actually led to some poor performance afterwards. So we're seeing our clients really work to continue deployment even with some of the ingestion learning from past cycles.\nJon Winkelried: 52:28 Alex, on -- just moving to your example on real estate, I think, first of all very important business for us in terms of a driver of growth. We -- I think we talked about this around the IPO the momentum that we have with respect to that platform is very strong. I reviewed in my comments, obviously the types of returns we've generated there. And obviously that's led to us going through a meaningful period of scaling within our real estate platform and also the ability to leverage that performance into new product development. In terms of our progress on fundraising that's one area, as an example where I think we had highlighted, we were going to be in the market raising our fourth opportunistic fund, which was -- which is trapped for, and the progress there, I guess, let me just say has been excellent, and I think we'll be announcing relatively soon. I think a final close with respect to TRIP 4 and that's been excellent. 53:40 I think Jack may have mentioned in his comments that we have announced the final close on our first Core Plus strategy, which was I think -- I had mentioned to you before, a strategy where several of our LPs, who had success with us in the real estate business came to us and helped us basically launch into that part of the market, we closed $1.750 billion in our first Core Plus strategy and I think we mentioned that we had designed that we're after it's effectively after most of the capital is invested. We have an opportunity to work with our LPs to flip that into an open-ended fund structure. 54:22 One of the things that we've been doing recently is thinking through whether or not, that's the most effective way to do it. By the way, I think, that our LPs are going to be interested in seeing the investments in that fund perform for little while. So I would say that we have a little bit of work to do still in front of us before we were able to open it up. But the other thing that we've been evaluating is potentially alongside of that whether or not we use some other structures -- other investing structures in the market like, for instance non-traded REITs and things like that to continue the expansion of that strategy. So we feel pretty good about where we stand right now on the real estate front. We also as you know, have a commercial mortgage a publicly traded commercial mortgage REIT we recently EMEA a higher, which we have announced where we're hiring -- we hired a new CEO for the REIT Doug Bouquard, who comes from Goldman Sachs, who will be joining us very shortly, and hopefully will continue to help us build out in the credit space around real estate, as well with some other structures. So we feel pretty good about the momentum there. 55:36 The other area, obviously, with respect to our progress, I had mentioned earlier, is within the Rise and Impact platform there's been a lot of focus obviously on that, we feel like that's a -- we certainly feel like our franchise is differentiated there and I think we did -- during our IPO road show we were right, we were working on in the middle of raising our Climate Fund, which Jim leads and we've effectively reached our fundraising goal there having raised about $7 billion for our Climate Fund. And I would say, I know, Jim, you might want to talk about it, but in terms of one of the questions that we got along the way was what would deployment look like in Climate, since is to an extent a new sector in the market. And I think we're very encouraged a number of investors have asked us, you know, how can this scale over time? And we're very encouraged by what we're seeing there in terms of opportunities.\nJim Coulter: 56:40 I would add in that question of -- would the opportunities that be large enough is at least in my mind, very much answered. To give you a sense, Alex, we're little over six months into the close of that and fund and activity levels across our Climate investing have been in excess of $3.4 billion of total capital committed across our Rise platform and Co-Invest, and that's really accomplished while we were in the fundraising market. So indicative of very substantial opportunities to attractively deploy capital and grow that product base.\nJack Weingart: 57:27 Sorry, again it's Jack. I want to go back to your OpEx question, because I don't want to indicate the 36 per quarter is what you should expect going forward in \u201922. We do continue to invest in resources for the public company. We do expect that with COVID-related travel restrictions moving on, we are seeing an increase in travel expense. So I would guide you toward, kind of, go-forward quarterly OpEx in the low '50s.\nAlex Blostein: 58:03 Thanks everybody.\nOperator: 58:07 We will take our next question from Robert Lee with KBW. Your line is now open.\nRobert Lee: 58:14 Great, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on your first public earnings call. Maybe going back to fundraising and deployment, so certainly appreciate the comments about fundraising environment. At the same time of those reason getting the spend I think of TREP 4, I guess, you know, maybe closing in the not too distant -- or having a close and not too distant future, may be growth deployment is maybe help these maybe growth six happening faster, kind of, feels like maybe some of your fundraising is being pulled potentially actually being pulled forward with this and versus, you know, maybe what you initially thought. If I just spend a word TPG 9, I mean, is that fair characterization, kind of, feels like something that are happening a bit faster?\nJack Weingart: 59:11 Yes, hey Rob it\u2019s Jack. Let me, and we're not going to be giving substantial intra, kind of, quarter guidance as we go here, but obviously we'll be giving information as we close on capital raises that being said, this is our first quarter, I know, this is obviously our fundraising super cycle ahead of us is super important. So let me try to give you all a little bit more framework and little more information, kind of, campaign by campaign. I think you're the -- inference of your question is correct. So we are seeing a bit of a pull forward relative to our expectations. In fundraising in the context of what I mentioned was a strong demand that we're seeing from our clients for our funds. And as I mentioned in my comments, we have about 11 funds, we expect to be in the market with this year, and let me just walk through the most significant of those to give you more color. 60:04 On the real estate platform, we are currently oversubscribed on our next opportunistic fund TREP 4, Jon alluded to that. And we expect to hold our final close there in the second quarter and we'll obviously give an update at the end of the first quarter, about how much we've closed on as of then. And we expect to be at our hard cap there of $6.5 billion. We just had our final close last week as I mentioned on the Tech Plus, Core Plus product, which is an exciting expansion into -- of our real estate platform. 60:38 On the Impact side we expect to hold the final close for the Climate Fund in the second quarter at the hard cap of $7.2 billion and we recently launched our next broad-based impact fund Rise 3 with a target of $3 billion. On the capital platform, which you asked about we did launch TPG 9 Healthcare Partners 2 and the next Asia Fund in January as planned. On the capital -- on the TPG Capital side, TPG 9 and Healthcare Partners as you know are kind of joined at the hip. And those two, we haven't -- we have articulated to our LPs in aggregate target across those capital basis of $18.5 billion, you know, on the Asia side we launched with a target of $6 billion. 61:33 And we had planned across those businesses to hold first closes as you know from our IPO discussions more in the back half of the year. And I would say, given the pace of investing that we've been seeing. And given the demand we're seeing for the products. I would, currently expect that we hold first closes across all three of those products TPG 9 Healthcare Partners and Asia towards the end of the second quarter.\nRobert Lee: 62:03 Super helpful. Thank you. And maybe a two follow-up and then I\u2019ll -- maybe has the two-part the first check, if you could also just want to make sure I have the numbers right, your 2Q guidance on pre-tax DE was that 190 to 200, so I make sure I have the numbers right?\nJack Weingart: 62:22 That\u2019s Q1.\nRobert Lee: 62:25 Yes, sorry Q1, yes, yes, right.\nJack Weingart: 62:27 On pre-tax DE, yes.\nRobert Lee: 62:31 Right. And then maybe more broadly, one of the, I guess, impacts of, you know, the warrant in Ukraine is more countries focusing on energy security, which necessarily in this day and it still means fossil fuels. So does that all impact as you think about your Rise and Impact funds at all impact? How you think about the opportunities that may evolve over the next couple of years is going to have to be more, more focus globally on secured domestic production or gas generation, have any impact of all, kind of, how you think the opportunities set?\nJon Winkelried: 63:22 Generally, I see it accelerating, a lot of our activity in the Climate area. Let me give you a few pieces of data around that. First of all, one of the big issues in Climate product evolution is what's known as a green premium. How much more expensive or in some cases less expensive it is to do Climate-friendly activity. Higher oil prices generally create very attractive shifts in the green premium and can accelerate projects and activities around Climate investing. The first of all, higher oil prices tend to help us. Secondly, as people focus on energy security and building into energy security they're doing so thinking about it with a green future in front of them. So if you were for example in Europe, not only are you worried about liquid natural gas, but you're looking beyond that the questions of how do we build our solar and other sustainable types of fuels and executions. So essentially, while there will be a lot of focus on fossil fuels are also be a focus on what are we doing next, and that will accelerate activities for green investing, we're seeing that very much in our pipeline. 64:51 And overall, we are also seeing very substantial investing in re-shoring of supply chains, so as people are thinking about battery investing or solar panel investing, there is a real movement towards moving that question of energy security closer into regions, you see that particularly in Europe, but also in the US, and that will drive substantial investment opportunities for us. So a lot of difficult things coming out of the Ukraine, there'll be a lot of near-term focus on fossil fuels, as there should be, but I think in many ways this will accelerate the activity that we're seeing in our pipeline to move to a green future.\nRobert Lee: 65:36 Great. That's very helpful. Thank you -- thanks for taking my questions.\nJim Coulter: 65:40 Okay. Thanks, Rob.\nOperator: 65:43 We'll take our next question from Bill Katz with Citigroup. Your line is now open.\nBill Katz: 65:49 Okay. Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking the question at this point. So first one maybe for Jack could unpack the guidance for the first quarter, I appreciate it around the revenues to $235 to 245? How much might be base versus transaction monitoring fees and for either the quarter just over or the upcoming quarter, are there any catch-up fees embedded in that guidance? Thank you.\nJon Winkelried: 66:15 Hey Bill. I would say the -- there is actually a little bit less -- I would say that the mix of management fees and transaction and monitoring fees is expected to be pretty consistent with what, I mean, what we experienced last year and what we expect to experience this year.\nJack Weingart: 66:43 On your second question, I don't think there are any material catch-up fees embedded in that Q1 guidance.\nBill Katz: 66:51 Great, thank you. I apologize for that. And then bigger question may have either you guys just in terms of funding markets, someone if you comment on that. And then as you, sort of, look into your downstream view with the portfolio companies. What are your company seeing in terms of economic slowdown as we look out over the next sort of three to nine months? Thank you.\nJon Winkelried: 67:14 Are you talking about funding markets? Bill, you're talking about financing markets?\nBill Katz: 67:17 Yes, funding markets for sure right as the ability to impact deployment? Thank you.\nTodd Sisitsky: 67:23 Sure. But hey, it's Todd Sisitsky, I think you know, from our standpoint we have generally been very conservative on leverage and so our strategy as growth investors and transformation investors, sort of, necessitated being not, I can't remember the last time, we've actually taken the full amount of leverage offered by banks in some of these situations. We need the flexibility, we need the ability to put more money into our platforms, both equity and debt. And so despite the ample availability of debt over the last five to seven years, our overall net debt to EBITDA portfolio wide is below 4 times, which again is consistent with our strategy and our exposure. 68:10 I'd also say that again with a anxiety about the choppiness of the market for some number of years, you know, once we do acquire companies won't use -- when we use leverage and we have floating rate debt, we are typically hedging 75% to 85% of the rate exposure. So I think your comment, I mean, obviously interest rates are going to be increasing and that will factor and I think to the overall deal environment, I do think that our strategy is probably a bit insulated from the financial engineering type strategies that really require high availability of cheap leverage. And as a result, I think we feel pretty comfortable with where we said.\nBill Katz: 68:59 Thank you.\nTodd Sisitsky: 69:02 Thanks, Bill.\nOperator: 69:04 Our next question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nBrian Bedell: 69:10 Hi, good afternoon [Technical Difficulty] okay?\nJon Winkelried: 69:13 You're breaking up, Ryan, like it\u2019s hard to hear you.\nBrian Bedell: 69:17 Can you hear me better now.\nJon Winkelried: 69:19 Yes. Yes.\nBrian Bedell: 69:20 Okay, great, great, thank you. I apologize, I had just step up the call for a few minutes. If I'm not sure if you answered this, but I did want to understand the infrastructure comments, I think that you made earlier Jon on the -- on looking at step outs to build the business. And I just wanted to understand if that was on the infrastructure side, is that largely part of an impact strategy overall, because you've mentioned obviously energy transition being a major role within that infrastructure? Or is that something that you're thinking about as a separate platform and then obviously, I guess, organic versus inorganic a possibility within that strategy?\nJon Winkelried: 70:07 I think both organic and inorganic is a possibility within infrastructure and as with any acquisition, it would be where would you take it from where we began. There\u2019s two areas that interest us greatly in the infrastructure area, where we also think we have some natural advantages. The first is related to Rise Climate and in the Tech revolution, what we've found is early on private equity was successful in data centers and towers, and then over time as those revolutions continued they moved into the infrastructure area. And so, having the knowledge, but having multiple pools of capital will be helpful in the Climate revolution, just as it was in the Tech revolution. So we have natural amounts of quite substantial deal flow and often that deal flow doesn't know if it's private equity or infrastructure. So having the opportunity to correct that deal flow and take advantage of our knowledge is as a natural for us. 71:09 The second area that I would point out, we have some advantages as digital infrastructure which is, as you know, one of the fastest growing parts of infrastructure and across what we've done in fiber and elsewhere. We have a strong track record there. So those two particular areas are the most interesting for us, and both of them are things we're thinking deeply about it.\nBrian Bedell: 71:32 And that's more in the near term or are we talking about sort of more of a multi-year vision starting fee next year?\nJon Winkelried: 71:42 As with all our acquisition discussions, it\u2019s hard to predict timing, but we're a business builders as you know, and these are clear areas that we would have advantages in building into or acquiring.\nBrian Bedell: 71:54 Yes. Okay, that makes sense. And then just a follow-up on retail strategy, obviously you're trying to certainly advance that how important is the credit platform or you're acquiring a credit platform to that retail strategy, if that ends up getting sort of postpone for a little while? If it's any issues in finding the right partner? Do you feel that you can really advance the retail strategy from a distribution angle given your product mix right now?\nJack Weingart: 72:28 Yes, it's Jack. Let me touch on that. I don't think it's a problem if credit is -- and say our build into credit is somehow delayed, but you start by thinking about like our current product set is particularly relevant to the high-end of the high net worth market, and we are continuing to invest in building our brand among those high net worth investors. We're continuing to build our team to market to this channel directly at all levels, and we do without having a credit platform during this fundraising cycle that I described, we do expect to raise a greater percentage of our capital from this channel than we have in the past. To give you a sense, I think we have 15 separate campaigns planned across many banks and across almost every product that we have in the market. So we are putting real resources into building our brand and building into that channel. I agree with your -- the inference of your question, as we do continue to diversify our products Tech Plus on the real estate side, as we expand that product and expand into further real estate products and eventually into credit as well. I think we will have set up our brand in the channel to readily capitalize on those opportunities and those products will be applicable to a much broader set of retail investors.\nBrian Bedell: 73:53 Great, that's super helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: 74:00 We will take our next question from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.\nTruman Cooper: 74:06 Hi, good morning. This is Truman here from Morgan Stanley standing in for Mike Cyprys, thanks for taking the question. I'm just going back to organic growth very quickly. You talked a little bit about infra as well as -- it's some other expansions. I just curious, what are the adjacencies do you think you could get into, say over the next three, five years? And just more generally, how do you think about where exactly you step out into and how meaningful could those step outs be over time?\nJim Coulter: 74:32 I think there's a lot of examples, if you look at our history, with the healthcare fund that we've attached to TPG Capital, that's been very successful, there\u2019s a lot of demand for that. Not that many place is actually expressed, scale healthcare investing. Jon, I think mentioned this in passing, but another near-term opportunity, sort of, along the same lines even in the same sectors our life sciences fund. As part of building over many decades now this broad-based healthcare focus which is not just in TPG Capital, it\u2019s in growth, it\u2019s in TPG Asia. We have gotten into the flow of a lot of opportunities that are just earlier stage and really exciting opportunities that we feel very well equipped to evaluate and we want to create an opportunity, a liability stream, it's better suited to addressing that part of the market. 75:29 And frankly the pullback in the life sciences world creates an even more compelling opportunity from a new capital standpoint. So we have a great team that we\u2019ve built around that. We have a lot of resources around the firm that are excited to be involved from investment community standpoint in the sourcing standpoint. And again, it's like a perfectly natural step out and one that be the LPs that we partner with as long as we have particularly around healthcare are very excited to be part of as well.\nJack Weingart: 75:58 Secondary, I would point out is Asia, where we have very substantial opportunity for expansion. And lastly, just a general comment, innovation is alive and well at TPG and the type of innovation you've seen over the last few years. And what you think, Jon, but my sense around the firm is it's not slowing down.\nJon Winkelried: 76:20 No there is, look, there is a -- people are constantly looking for ways of growing the franchise and growing your platforms and one of the things that we are trying to be thoughtful about is how to think about where to allocate resources to because in our view, one of the things that's important is that things either have to be very complementary to the ecosystem and therefore, drive that flywheel effect that we have, you know, Todd referenced the life sciences is a great example, because we're so deep in healthcare and we've actually done -- we've been successful in a number of cases in life sciences investing already that it provides the basis of which to build a meaningful credible step out opportunity, where we have a reason to win in the market. 77:13 The other thing that we focus on is, look not only this question of whether or not it completes the ecosystem, but also whether or not, it can scale or not. And so those are other things that we're mindful of as we think about, because ultimately to generate the kinds of economics we want to generate for the business and grow our business and our financial results. We also want to make sure that we can develop the scale, which implies ultimately sufficient margin. And so we focus on that as well, so when we talked about infra, as an example, that's a place where it links back into a couple of our businesses, but also is a very potentially scale of opportunity where we're already seeing opportunities, as an example, I think, as Jim had mentioned in energy transition, we're already seeing opportunities there and the question is how is cost of capital effect that? How is return profile of the pool of capital effect? How you stand up something on its own versus integrated and what you have? 78:12 Jim mentioned Asia as an example, we have a private equity business in Asia and I think over time, there are a number of different there are -- there is the potential for step outs and organic growth in Asia as a result of the same phenomenon that we've seen here developing in Asia as an example, we developed our tech adjacencies platform here, because we saw opportunities through our franchise that we're slightly different than traditional growth equity opportunities either in structure or in terms of deep minority or whatever the opportunity might have been. I think that we're still -- given the development of some of the markets around Asia, particularly outside of China, we see potential opportunities to do that, whether it's in Australia or in some cases, in India and Southeast Asia. So that's how we think -- that's just to give you a sense of our mindset in terms of how we approach these things. There's lots of innovation energy, we have to, kind of, meter it out and manage it in an appropriate way.\nTruman Cooper: 79:19 That's great color. Thank you very much. And if I could just ask a quick follow-up on our capital return, how did you think about the 85% payout ratio versus say a fixed dividend with some of your peers do? And how that would allow you potentially to retain more capital for investment depreciates in the balance sheet like strategy you're trying to pursue?\nJack Weingart: 79:36 Yes, it's Jack. I think you hit on it right there. Right, we -- pro forma for the IPO as I mentioned, we've got $650 million of cash on the balance sheet. With retaining 15% of after-tax DE will continue to add to that balance sheet flexibility and we have relatively little debt. So as we sit here today and think about pursuing the growth opportunities that we've talked about, we believe we have plenty of capital, and as long as we feel that way, we believe the right answer is return capital to shareholders. So that will be \u2013 we continue to be our policy.\nTruman Cooper: 80:10 That's great. Thank you very much.\nJack Weingart: 80:12 Okay, thanks.\nOperator: 80:14 And we will take our final question from Lucas Ruttan with Bank of Montreal. Your line is now open.\nLucas Ruttan: 80:22 Alright, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to get some more detail on deployment trends across your different investment platforms. Where are you seeing the best opportunities in terms of deployment? And also relative to the roughly $8 billion of capital you invested last quarter roughly where are you year-to-date versus that run rate? Thank you.\nJim Coulter: 80:46 Sure, I'll start with the -- just to sort of where we're seeing opportunities and again apologies if it sounds a bit repetitive. We've continued to I think find our best opportunities near is we have our strongest focus our strongest teamwork and hopefully you've gotten a sense from this, culturally we're very much oriented around themes, around sectors, around getting very deep and developing conviction across our investment committees in the opportunities that we have resources and ecosystems built up in and so for us, and I think, actually, it's worked out quite well, particularly in recent years as we've envision getting later in the cycle in terms of the investment strategy. 81:31 So for us, I'd say that we continue to see a lot of activity and a lot of interesting differentiated make a -- right opportunities in the broad worlds of technology, which would include both software, content, media and host of other sort of interesting areas in and around technology and healthcare, those are two, sort of, big sector areas. And of course within each one there is a lot of granularity as to what we're finding. Jon mentioned interesting opportunity that intersected two of our other sectors in Troon, which overlap both business services and consumer, which are important sectors for us as well. But it's thematically again I think we've continued to, sort of, lean-in, in the places where we have the most conviction and we feel like we have the best resources to continue to drive the growth in our companies and that has continued to generate the most attractive deal flow from our standpoint. And we continue to see to have very busy investment committees with a sense of, a lot of opportunity in front of us will be under three or four final pricings after we're done with the call today in fact.\nLucas Ruttan: 82:49 Thank you.\nJim Coulter: 82:52 Thanks.\nOperator: 82:53 This concludes the question-and-answer portion of today's call. I would now like to turn the call back over to Gary Stein for any additional or closing remarks.\nGary Stein: 83:01 Great. Thank you, operator. Thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to following up with you again next quarter.\nJack Weingart: 83:09 Thanks everyone.\nJon Winkelried: 83:10 Thanks everyone. Appreciate it.\nOperator: 83:14 This concludes today's TPG fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Jon Winkelried",
            "content": "02:26 Thanks, Gary, and good morning to everyone. I'd like to thank you all for joining us for our first public investor call, since we completed our IPO on NASDAQ in January. Becoming a publicly listed company was a significant milestone for TPG, as we celebrate our 30th anniversary as an innovator in the alternative asset management industry. 02:48 During our prepared remarks, I'm going to touch on our strong performance for the fourth quarter and full-year of 2021, and then I'll discuss a few highlights across the five multi-product platforms that comprise TPG's business. I'll then turn the call over to Jack to provide some more details on our financial results. After that I'll make some closing remarks and then we'll open up the call to take your questions. 03:11 Before I discuss our performance, I'd like to address the situation in Ukraine, which I'm sure continues to weigh heavily on all of you just as it does on us here at TPG. From a humanitarian perspective what we've all been watching unfold is truly heart wrenching on so many levels and we extend our thoughts to the courageous citizens of Ukraine. We are providing financial assistance through several charities on the ground in Ukraine and we are also encouraging all of our employees to do whatever they can to help. From a business perspective we have conducted a thorough review of all of our activities and we've confirmed the funds we manage have no direct investments in any Russia or Ukraine-based companies in addition, no Russian Institutional Investors or Sanctioned Russian Nationals or Limited Partners in any of TPG funds. 04:05 We finished 2021 with $114 billion of total assets under management, which increased 27% year-over-year. This growth was driven by a combination of strong investment performance and fundraising across our five platforms, partially offset by significant realization activity. From a value creation perspective, TPG's funds increased by 7% in the fourth quarter and 38% for the year, which compares to 18% in the prior year. 04:33 Turning to fundraising, we had our second strongest year on record with approximately $20 billion raised, nearly tripling the amount of capital we raised in 2020. Looking at invested capital we put nearly $8 billion to work in the fourth quarter and deployed $22 billion during the year. We have also been very intentional with our realization strategy and we've had an outstanding year with $7 billion of realizations in the fourth quarter, and more than $25 billion for the full-year. 05:03 Taking a step back, we recognize we're talking with you this morning about results that occurred several months ago. Since that time, the global geopolitical and economic landscape has changed dramatically. We are now operating a mix of far more uncertain and volatile backdrop, due to a number of significant macro factors, including widespread inflation, rising rate environment, global supply chain disruptions, and a tight labor market that is driving an extraordinary demand for talent, in addition, of course to the war in Ukraine. 05:35 In an environment such as this, we are even more intently focused on adhering to our investment strategy and approach and we were relying on the playbook we have developed through our 30-years of experience investing across cycles as we navigate through this period. Our expertise is informing every aspect of our business, such as how we source and underwrite new investments; engage with our portfolio companies; and attract and retain top talent. 06:02 With that in mind, I'd like to spend a few minutes walking you through some of the highlights across our five multi-product platforms, starting with our largest platform capital, which had a total AUM of $55 billion at the end of 2021. The recent performance of the portfolio companies within our capital funds has been very strong with value creation of more than 7% in the fourth quarter and 43% for the full-year. This performance was driven by strong growth at the portfolio company level and underscores our investment strategy and focus on bending the curve with respect to the growth trajectory of our portfolio companies. We have also been actively investing across the capital platform, deploying nearly $11 billion in 2021 with a focus on large scale control-oriented investments in our core sectors. As an example of the types of investments we made in the fourth quarter, in November we announced a significant transact -- strategic investment in Troon, the world's largest golf and club related leisure and hospitality services company. We made this investment together with professional golfer Rory McIlroy, who invested in the company in partnership with us. 07:09 During the fourth quarter, we also completed the corporate carve out of Boomi from Dell in a $4 billion transaction. 2021 was also a very significant year for us to deploy capital through our Asia franchise. During the year, we made several investments in the region such as Greenfields Dairy, which is a leading consumer dairy business in Southeast Asia; and Fund Lab, which is a leading out-of-home entertainment company with operations in Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore. 07:38 As I mentioned, we have also been highly focused on returning profits to our fund investors. And during 2021, we generated record total realizations in the capital platform of approximately $16 billion, including $4 billion in the fourth quarter. We also have a robust pipeline of realizations in 2022, including the sales of McAfee and Wind River. Jack will provide some additional details regarding these significant transactions during his remarks. 08:07 I'd now like to discuss our growth platform, which are at $22 billion of total AUM at the end of 2021. This platform provides flexible and scaled capital for rapidly growing businesses through our growth, tech adjacencies, and digital media funds. These funds are well positioned to capitalize on the continued trend of high-quality growth companies staying private for longer. Given the scale and stage at which we are investing and the resources we bring to bear in the current volatile and uncertain market, we are seeing excellent opportunities to invest, including investments with structured securities with downside protection. 08:46 Similar to our capital portfolio, our growth funds continued to perform well with aggregate value creation of 5% in the fourth quarter and 32% for the year. We deployed more than $3 billion during 2021 in a wide variety of companies and returned $4 billion to our investors during the same period. Since the beginning of the year, we have already announced several investments, including project44, a leading provider of supply chain visibility solutions and Xpressbees one of the fastest growing third-party logistics firms in India. 09:18 Moving on, I'd like to briefly discuss our Impact platform, which our total AUM of $14 billion as of December 31, including our inaugural rise Climate Fund, which currently has nearly $7 billion of AUM and we believe is one of the largest and most significant new private equity fund raisers. We were a first mover to institutionalize the private market impact investing more than five years ago and we are incredibly proud of the market-leading platform we have built. Our Impact funds, which operate under the Rise brand focus on investing in companies that are driving societal benefits, while also generating non-concessionary financial returns. 09:54 In addition, we have built a rigorous proprietary impact measurement framework through Y Analytics, TPG's Impact assessment in ESG performance arm to objectively measure and report the true impact of our funds invested capital. Consistent with our long-held view that impact investments do not need to have lower returns, our Rise funds had a net IRR of 25% as of December 31st to the portfolio of attractive, high growth companies across a range of sectors such as education, healthcare, accessibility financial inclusion, and Climate. 10:28 As an example of the types of significant impact investments we make during the fourth quarter, we announced that Rise Climate is investing $1 billion in a newly created Electric Vehicle subsidiary of Tata Motors, one of the India's largest vehicle manufacturers. This sizable transaction aligns with Rise Climates focus on decarbonize transport, leveraging TPG's long history of investing in India and our expertise and corporate carve outs. It also underscores the substantial number of opportunities we are seeing to deploy capital at scale and proprietary climate investments around the world. 11:03 In terms of operating results the value creation across our Impact funds was 9% for the fourth quarter and 33% for the year. During 2021 our Impact funds deployed $1.7 billion and we returned more than $1 billion to our fund investors, nearly half of those realizations were generated in the fourth quarter led by the sale of DreamBox Learning a pioneer in the emerging field of intelligent adaptive learning. 11:28 Turning now to real estate, this multi-product platform ended 2021 with $13 billion of total AUM across our opportunistic real estate funds, our core plus strategy and a publicly traded REIT. Our real estate investment -- our real estate platform harnesses TPG's collective sector expertise and knowledge, applying a thematic approach to investing with a focus on building companies and platforms. This differentiated investment strategy has enabled our $3.7 billion opportunistic real estate fund TREP 3 to generate a 30% net IRR, since inception as of the end of 2021. 12:04 TPG's real estate platform delivered value creation of 6% for the fourth quarter at 31% for the year across our opportunistic and core plus funds. Our team has been very active deploying a returning capital to our investors, a platform invested $4.5 billion in 2021, including $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter and had total realizations of $3 billion for the year. One transaction, I'd like to highlight is the acquisition of Cinespace Studios, which is North America's second largest independent soundstage platform. Cinespace is well positioned for growth, driven by the surge in demand for original TV and film content. This transaction reflects the deep expertise in media and content development across the firm and is a great example of our thematic approach to investing. 12:50 Lastly, I'd like to touch on our Market Solutions platform, which at $10 billion of total AUM at the end of 2021 across several strategies, including our long-short and long-only public investing funds, our Capital Markets Group and Private Market Solutions, which is our secondary's business. Our Capital Markets Business, which we established more than 15-years ago as continued to drive significant value by delivering bespoke solutions and optimized financing outcomes for our portfolio companies. Our Asian secondary's business NewQuest continues to perform well, driven by a distinct focus on GP Solutions and we are actively building out our secondary's platform globally. 13:28 Summing it all up, 2021 was an excellent and important year for TPG. For us that starts with continuing to deliver outstanding investment results across each of our five platforms and generating strong operational and financial results firmwide. We are carrying that momentum into 2022, which began with our successful initial public offering in January. Our strong start to the year has continued with a number of significant developments, regarding realization events, new investments by our funds, and ongoing success with our broad-based fundraising campaign. We will also continue to explore ways to diversify and expand our business through both organic and inorganic opportunities. We've been highly successful with our organic growth initiatives and over the last four years, we have raised $17 billion for five new products. 14:16 Regarding inorganic growth there are several asset classes where we do not currently have a presence that would be highly complementary to our existing product set. We are continually exploring a pipeline of strategic growth opportunities that may help accelerate our ongoing expansion and diversification. 14:34 I'd now like to turn the call over to Jack, so he can take you through our financial results. 23:33 Thanks, Jack. Before we take your questions, I wanted to touch on what we view as the most critical element of our strategy TPG's culture. With our family office heritage and our West Coast roots, we maintain a flat organizational structure that fosters an entrepreneurial and inclusive environment and celebrates innovation, authenticity and a hands-on approach towards identifying solutions and building businesses. 23:58 As we talk about culture, I'd like to highlight TPG's long-standing commitment to fostering strong ESG performance as a firm and in our investment practices. ESG is a core tenant of TPG's culture and manifests itself in everything we do from Impact investing to building a responsible portfolio to advancing diversity and inclusivity within our organization, ecosystem and industry. Earlier this month TPG sponsored the Annual Women and Private Equity Summit for the six-year with 21 of our senior women representing the firm at this leading industry event. We believe our commitment to building a diverse equitable and inclusive culture improves the quality of our investments and our ability to build great companies. 24:42 Last month, we held the strategy off-site in the San Francisco for our senior business leaders. It was the first time we had been altogether in person since COVID and it reinforced the momentum we are feeling across the firm. We have started bringing our employees back into our offices around the world on a regular basis and the collective level of enthusiasm across the firm has been incredible. It's clear to me and other members of our leadership team that despite our extended period of time working away from the office, the culture TPG has never been stronger, we're extremely proud of our team for their exceptional performance during an unprecedented time in our professional careers, and we look forward to what we will accomplish as we move forward together at TPG. 25:21 With that, we'll open up the line for questions. 25:46 Craig, you there, Craig? 26:01 Why don't we go to the next question. Let's see if we can get Craig back in the queue. 29:45 Glenn, it's Jon. Thanks for the question. Look, I think at a high level, I don't think any of us have ever seen, sort of, the level of, kind of, evolution within our industry going on in terms of M&A activity, strategic activity across the board, and I think that with some of the forces that Jack described and forces that we've described before, I think that we find that the size and scale is continuing to matter more, being able to raise capital and source capital is -- I think is being ever more influenced by brand and strength of brand. And our LPs that we are close to, want to do more with us across a range of different products, and so I think that, that force is sort of affecting the industry more broadly and we were looking at some of the data, the other day I think over the -- from a decade of \u201809 to like 2018, there were something like four M&A deals done in our industry, and I think last year there were eight -- only -- there were eight I think last year only, and I think there's four or five already this year. 31:00 So, there's a lot of talk and a lot of dialog going on in the industry, and I think there were many managers across various strategies, including credit, but not exclusive to credit as you've already seen that are trying to see and trying to think about what the future looks like. That's, creating a lot of dialog and it's creating a lot of opportunity. So, we are -- as we discussed when we went through our IPO process, we think we're well positioned as sort of a strategic partner for a number of different types of businesses. As I mentioned before, I think we feel like credit as an example is -- and by the way, it's not the only area, but we feel like credit is complementary to the firm and our capabilities overall and so we are evaluating opportunities, and we're going to be as you would expect, I think, we're going to be careful about what we do and we're going to try to be tactical about what we do with respect to doing something that we feel like we can is complementary with our overall franchise is something that we feel like we can help continue to scale also something that where the culture and the people are compatible with what's important to us as an organization and where we feel, again that will get sort of the power of the brand and the power of the franchise working together. 32:28 And so I would expect us to make some progress on that over time, but we're not -- we certainly don't feel compelled to rush on anything we want to find the right opportunities. There are a couple of other areas, I would say, you know, that we feel like we can leverage our brand and expertise well into, I would say another area might be the, kind of, broader infrastructure space, particularly as it relates to energy transition leveraging off of what we built on the Rise within our Rise business within the Impact business, leveraging off our Rise brand, our Y Analytics capability and what we've seen and what we're doing in Climate, where we're seeing as a result of having now raised the capital and deploying our team into the market, we're seeing a lot of interesting opportunities. 33:19 And so I think building some capital with perhaps somewhat different cost of capital features to it. And building an expertise in other disciplines might be very additive to us there, you know, we made an acquisition in the Secondary's GP solutions space, which is NewQuest, I think, we continue to be interested and continuing to grow that. We're organically, kind of, launching our business within GP Solutions in the US and in Europe by having added a team, which we've talked about before and we're about to add -- we're about to launch in a -- another organic step out strategy of ours will be life sciences, which we're about to launch in the market, which is obviously leveraging off our deep expertise there. 34:07 So I think our mix of, kind of, organic step out growth opportunities for us, we'll continue to be an important part of our playbook. And then we have our eyes and ears open with respect to other opportunities strategically in the market. Yes. Loud and clear. 34:52 Good morning. 42:56 When you say it changed relative to what? 43:06 No, I don't think so, I mean, I think we're -- I would say if there is anything that may be changed is we're mindful of price, because the values in various parts of the market have been -- I would say frothy to a degree, it's for certain businesses at certain levels of scale or certain levels of development, everybody thinks they have really valuable thing, and so we're mindful of that as we look at opportunities. But I think again the important things for us, our quality of business, quality of partner and what we feel is an intelligent fit both by virtue of the nature of the business, as well as the team that people, we're not buying something -- we wouldn't be buying something with an eye toward, you know, just having, sort of, some, kind of, independent subsidiaries somewhere, we'd be buying something that would become part of our overall franchise. And so we also are looking for as people who want to join us, but that would continue to be builders and building the business and so that's important to us. 44:31 I think that within the landscape of credit, as an example, obviously credit is not just one thing, there are sort of multiple aspects to what credit strategies do. And I think that we would over time also be looking to build a balanced approach to that in terms of the different, kind of, lines of business if you will. And so we may -- if we are able to do something in terms of an acquisition, as an example, we may do something that's a piece of that strategy to start with and then continue to build from there. So, but I don't think, I have anything more yet other than our intent to continue to build and diversify our franchise that we talked about during our IPO process, when we last talked about, this is still the same. 45:29 Thanks. 48:25 Yes, I think it's a good starting point for 1Q and beyond. We are -- as you know, we've had to build substantial resources to support all the activities as a public company, and I think that's a good starting point for OpEx going forward. 49:29 Sorry, Alex, you're saying just, kind of, drilling down on the characterization, I gave more by geography and type of LP? 49:58 Yes, that's a good question, Alex and I know you wrote somewhat extensively about this and I think we do a lot of your comments, but to your point, these dynamics are very different in different parts of the world and with different types of LPs. The most directly impacted by some of the, kind of, numerator, denominator, allocation target type math that I walk through or maybe a good example of the US State Pension Funds, who operate with a target for alternatives and although some of those targets are moving higher and there's been some publicity about that. Do they have to manage to a target pretty specifically? So -- and some of the -- maybe International pools of capital that are growing more rapidly and don't have quite as strict target to manage to or actually, we're seeing increasing allocations to our funds. 50:53 As we are in the market, we have some, who are more directly impacted by this. Re-upping with us for sure in some cases staying flat when they would have preferred to increase the amount of capital that we invest for them, but in the international pools of capital we're seeing in some cases, substantial increases in commitment sizes. 51:36 You know, I would make one more comment on the -- I left out you just sparked my thought process, Alex. But within the broad high net worth in retail landscape that whole universe of investors is still substantially under allocated to alternatives, and is not impacted by the, kind of, current formulaic numerator, denominator effect so we continue to see real opportunity to grow into that space. 52:28 Alex, on -- just moving to your example on real estate, I think, first of all very important business for us in terms of a driver of growth. We -- I think we talked about this around the IPO the momentum that we have with respect to that platform is very strong. I reviewed in my comments, obviously the types of returns we've generated there. And obviously that's led to us going through a meaningful period of scaling within our real estate platform and also the ability to leverage that performance into new product development. In terms of our progress on fundraising that's one area, as an example where I think we had highlighted, we were going to be in the market raising our fourth opportunistic fund, which was -- which is trapped for, and the progress there, I guess, let me just say has been excellent, and I think we'll be announcing relatively soon. I think a final close with respect to TRIP 4 and that's been excellent. 53:40 I think Jack may have mentioned in his comments that we have announced the final close on our first Core Plus strategy, which was I think -- I had mentioned to you before, a strategy where several of our LPs, who had success with us in the real estate business came to us and helped us basically launch into that part of the market, we closed $1.750 billion in our first Core Plus strategy and I think we mentioned that we had designed that we're after it's effectively after most of the capital is invested. We have an opportunity to work with our LPs to flip that into an open-ended fund structure. 54:22 One of the things that we've been doing recently is thinking through whether or not, that's the most effective way to do it. By the way, I think, that our LPs are going to be interested in seeing the investments in that fund perform for little while. So I would say that we have a little bit of work to do still in front of us before we were able to open it up. But the other thing that we've been evaluating is potentially alongside of that whether or not we use some other structures -- other investing structures in the market like, for instance non-traded REITs and things like that to continue the expansion of that strategy. So we feel pretty good about where we stand right now on the real estate front. We also as you know, have a commercial mortgage a publicly traded commercial mortgage REIT we recently EMEA a higher, which we have announced where we're hiring -- we hired a new CEO for the REIT Doug Bouquard, who comes from Goldman Sachs, who will be joining us very shortly, and hopefully will continue to help us build out in the credit space around real estate, as well with some other structures. So we feel pretty good about the momentum there. 55:36 The other area, obviously, with respect to our progress, I had mentioned earlier, is within the Rise and Impact platform there's been a lot of focus obviously on that, we feel like that's a -- we certainly feel like our franchise is differentiated there and I think we did -- during our IPO road show we were right, we were working on in the middle of raising our Climate Fund, which Jim leads and we've effectively reached our fundraising goal there having raised about $7 billion for our Climate Fund. And I would say, I know, Jim, you might want to talk about it, but in terms of one of the questions that we got along the way was what would deployment look like in Climate, since is to an extent a new sector in the market. And I think we're very encouraged a number of investors have asked us, you know, how can this scale over time? And we're very encouraged by what we're seeing there in terms of opportunities. 63:22 Generally, I see it accelerating, a lot of our activity in the Climate area. Let me give you a few pieces of data around that. First of all, one of the big issues in Climate product evolution is what's known as a green premium. How much more expensive or in some cases less expensive it is to do Climate-friendly activity. Higher oil prices generally create very attractive shifts in the green premium and can accelerate projects and activities around Climate investing. The first of all, higher oil prices tend to help us. Secondly, as people focus on energy security and building into energy security they're doing so thinking about it with a green future in front of them. So if you were for example in Europe, not only are you worried about liquid natural gas, but you're looking beyond that the questions of how do we build our solar and other sustainable types of fuels and executions. So essentially, while there will be a lot of focus on fossil fuels are also be a focus on what are we doing next, and that will accelerate activities for green investing, we're seeing that very much in our pipeline. 64:51 And overall, we are also seeing very substantial investing in re-shoring of supply chains, so as people are thinking about battery investing or solar panel investing, there is a real movement towards moving that question of energy security closer into regions, you see that particularly in Europe, but also in the US, and that will drive substantial investment opportunities for us. So a lot of difficult things coming out of the Ukraine, there'll be a lot of near-term focus on fossil fuels, as there should be, but I think in many ways this will accelerate the activity that we're seeing in our pipeline to move to a green future. 66:15 Hey Bill. I would say the -- there is actually a little bit less -- I would say that the mix of management fees and transaction and monitoring fees is expected to be pretty consistent with what, I mean, what we experienced last year and what we expect to experience this year. 67:14 Are you talking about funding markets? Bill, you're talking about financing markets? 69:13 You're breaking up, Ryan, like it's hard to hear you. 69:19 Yes. Yes. 70:07 I think both organic and inorganic is a possibility within infrastructure and as with any acquisition, it would be where would you take it from where we began. There's two areas that interest us greatly in the infrastructure area, where we also think we have some natural advantages. The first is related to Rise Climate and in the Tech revolution, what we've found is early on private equity was successful in data centers and towers, and then over time as those revolutions continued they moved into the infrastructure area. And so, having the knowledge, but having multiple pools of capital will be helpful in the Climate revolution, just as it was in the Tech revolution. So we have natural amounts of quite substantial deal flow and often that deal flow doesn't know if it's private equity or infrastructure. So having the opportunity to correct that deal flow and take advantage of our knowledge is as a natural for us. 71:09 The second area that I would point out, we have some advantages as digital infrastructure which is, as you know, one of the fastest growing parts of infrastructure and across what we've done in fiber and elsewhere. We have a strong track record there. So those two particular areas are the most interesting for us, and both of them are things we're thinking deeply about it. 71:42 As with all our acquisition discussions, it's hard to predict timing, but we're a business builders as you know, and these are clear areas that we would have advantages in building into or acquiring. 76:20 No there is, look, there is a -- people are constantly looking for ways of growing the franchise and growing your platforms and one of the things that we are trying to be thoughtful about is how to think about where to allocate resources to because in our view, one of the things that's important is that things either have to be very complementary to the ecosystem and therefore, drive that flywheel effect that we have, you know, Todd referenced the life sciences is a great example, because we're so deep in healthcare and we've actually done -- we've been successful in a number of cases in life sciences investing already that it provides the basis of which to build a meaningful credible step out opportunity, where we have a reason to win in the market. 77:13 The other thing that we focus on is, look not only this question of whether or not it completes the ecosystem, but also whether or not, it can scale or not. And so those are other things that we're mindful of as we think about, because ultimately to generate the kinds of economics we want to generate for the business and grow our business and our financial results. We also want to make sure that we can develop the scale, which implies ultimately sufficient margin. And so we focus on that as well, so when we talked about infra, as an example, that's a place where it links back into a couple of our businesses, but also is a very potentially scale of opportunity where we're already seeing opportunities, as an example, I think, as Jim had mentioned in energy transition, we're already seeing opportunities there and the question is how is cost of capital effect that? How is return profile of the pool of capital effect? How you stand up something on its own versus integrated and what you have? 78:12 Jim mentioned Asia as an example, we have a private equity business in Asia and I think over time, there are a number of different there are -- there is the potential for step outs and organic growth in Asia as a result of the same phenomenon that we've seen here developing in Asia as an example, we developed our tech adjacencies platform here, because we saw opportunities through our franchise that we're slightly different than traditional growth equity opportunities either in structure or in terms of deep minority or whatever the opportunity might have been. I think that we're still -- given the development of some of the markets around Asia, particularly outside of China, we see potential opportunities to do that, whether it's in Australia or in some cases, in India and Southeast Asia. So that's how we think -- that's just to give you a sense of our mindset in terms of how we approach these things. There's lots of innovation energy, we have to, kind of, meter it out and manage it in an appropriate way. 83:10 Thanks everyone. Appreciate it."

            "name": "Todd Sisitsky",
            "content": "35:13 Great. Yes, thanks, Craig. It's Todd Sisitsky here. Thank you for the questions. You know, I think, first of all, you're right, we've been oriented as growth investors and transformational investors and I think I'll get to in a moment, but I think your point about the private market being somewhat different that the public markets is spot on. And we've been anticipating choppier markets and really a potential downturn now for several years and that expectation has really shaped our approach to investing and managing our portfolio. 35:46 So first, you know, the new investment front. Our expectation for a market reset and downturn is factored into the go-to-market strategy, the way that we source the new investments that we make. And for several years now, we've built multiple compression so an expectation that we will exit at a lower multiple than we acquired company into our financial model. And our expectation of this downturn has led us to be even more committed to our core strategy of investing only in those sectors and in those themes, so we have really strong conviction across the partnership, and we've got that angles and confidence in our strategies over a number of years. 36:25 And for us especially in late cycle, but really throughout our strategy, we focused on investing in secular sources of growth rather than cyclical growth, which we do think navigates very well through different economic environments. So you can see, for us, even with the choppiness of the past 12-month period and the COVID effect our broad portfolio grew, it's revenue at a rate of 35% versus 17% for the S&P 500 Total Return Index. And so the, you know, so really the sectors and themes we're investing behind in healthcare in cyber security and Climate and DevOps and EdTech, you know, these are all themes that we think we'll grow well and we'll grow through different market environments and will overwhelm the multiple contraction that we're modeling. 37:10 So if you're -- to distill our investment strategy on two principles, the first is to focus on sectors and themes. And the second is really to invest and this is where I think it gets to the point that you're raising about the difference between private and public markets in situations where we can inflect the growth where we can bend the curve as Jon mentioned in his comments of the companies that we invest in. And so we're able to really focus on organic growth and inorganic growth we spent years, developing themes, building relationships with CEOs and once we have a company, it's a platform for us. So we invest in it with the view of a longer-term hold in some cases through different market cycles to the point where we feel like we have seen this growth here more strategic and that's a big part of the reason you see so many interesting strategic exits for us on the other side. 37:58 And our experience over the 30-years of investing across cycles is that the strong secular growers with strong support engagement, investment from us as a sponsor can perform quite well through recessions. So again recognizing that we're living through a complicated and choppy market, this is -- these are exactly the type of companies, the ones we've invested over the last few years that we think we would invest in under any market condition, including late cycle and where we find ourselves now in the market. 38:30 The only other observation I'd make relative to your question of the rotation from growth to value is that a lot of the discussion of a public market reset is really around young and often pre-revenue companies that saw explosive growth run-ups in the meme era and often, as it seem recently been weighed towards companies, who badly missed aggressive revenue projections. And stepping back, of course, it would make some sense that these pre-revenue companies are very early stage companies would be particularly sensitive to capital market volatility, because these companies need access to additional funding to keep operating, but pre-revenue is really not part of the market that we focus on. And we're really seeing very strong performance in our portfolio not the extraordinary performance misses that you've seen some of these high flying public young growth companies. 39:18 So the last point, new investment front the reset in the public market in a lot of ways as you also mentioned creates a really interesting opportunity for us on the new investment front in the intermediate term. Only the 25% to 30% of our exits in the growth arena, have been in the public markets, but the public market is really are a meaningful competitor to us, the stack in the IPO boom over the past couple of years represented with a competitor and took dozens of opportunities that we might have otherwise pursued away. And so right now we find ourselves in a very good position, where capital has become more scarce again, which is of course very positive thing for us. 39:58 The other thing I'd just point out briefly relative to the market environment is that, you know, that has our expectation of a downturn and choppiness in the market has also driven our priority and our focus around liquidity. As both Jon and Jack described, we've been very focused on driving liquidity during the favorable period over the last few years, record liquidity return to our investors in several business units and driven overwhelmingly through a return sale of equity and specifically full company sales rather than floating companies are doing recaps. And so that has the effect, which is a very positive one for us, particularly in the context of our fundraising efforts of returning capital at the same LPs that we're going to be -- that we're going to for additional some new fundraisers. But also locking in our returns and locking in our performance. And so from our standpoint, that's been a really important part of our macro view, where we are in the cycle. 40:59 So, look we're a folks in this environment, and we do anticipate choppy times ahead, but we actually feel like our playbook, our strategy of investing in growth companies and then transforming and inflecting those growth companies is actually very well suited to the current environment, we feel really excited about the portfolio that we've built up over the last few years. 41:17 Jim, do you want -- anything you add to that? 67:23 Sure. But hey, it's Todd Sisitsky, I think you know, from our standpoint we have generally been very conservative on leverage and so our strategy as growth investors and transformation investors, sort of, necessitated being not, I can't remember the last time, we've actually taken the full amount of leverage offered by banks in some of these situations. We need the flexibility, we need the ability to put more money into our platforms, both equity and debt. And so despite the ample availability of debt over the last five to seven years, our overall net debt to EBITDA portfolio wide is below 4 times, which again is consistent with our strategy and our exposure. 68:10 I'd also say that again with a anxiety about the choppiness of the market for some number of years, you know, once we do acquire companies won't use -- when we use leverage and we have floating rate debt, we are typically hedging 75% to 85% of the rate exposure. So I think your comment, I mean, obviously interest rates are going to be increasing and that will factor and I think to the overall deal environment, I do think that our strategy is probably a bit insulated from the financial engineering type strategies that really require high availability of cheap leverage. And as a result, I think we feel pretty comfortable with where we said. 69:02 Thanks, Bill."

            "name": "Jim Coulter",
            "content": "41:19 You know, that was well said, Todd. Craig having done this for a long time, it's always been interesting to me how different the private market growth investing landscape is in the public market, best in landscape and to think indices in the public market investing world, we tend to think companies in our world. And as Todd pointed out where you get heard is if you have unexpected multiple compression, which is not what we're seeing in our underwriting. 41:47 Secondly, you've heard if you miss your numbers in our portfolio is performing very, very strong. And third, in some ways the public market is a robust competitor for us. The world we went through last year of very high access to public markets and SPAC activity in some ways was less attractive for us than the environment we're in now. In the intermediate term to long-term investing area that we're in, this is actually a better part of the cycle for us to invest in, and I think our LPs understand that and continue to support us as we delve into this very interesting market. 52:01 And Alex, it's Jim. One thing I would add also is the learning's of the last private equity cycle was that investors, who stepped back from their deployment actually led to some poor performance afterwards. So we're seeing our clients really work to continue deployment even with some of the ingestion learning from past cycles. 56:40 I would add in that question of -- would the opportunities that be large enough is at least in my mind, very much answered. To give you a sense, Alex, we're little over six months into the close of that and fund and activity levels across our Climate investing have been in excess of $3.4 billion of total capital committed across our Rise platform and Co-Invest, and that's really accomplished while we were in the fundraising market. So indicative of very substantial opportunities to attractively deploy capital and grow that product base. 65:40 Okay. Thanks, Rob. 74:32 I think there's a lot of examples, if you look at our history, with the healthcare fund that we've attached to TPG Capital, that's been very successful, there's a lot of demand for that. Not that many place is actually expressed, scale healthcare investing. Jon, I think mentioned this in passing, but another near-term opportunity, sort of, along the same lines even in the same sectors our life sciences fund. As part of building over many decades now this broad-based healthcare focus which is not just in TPG Capital, it's in growth, it's in TPG Asia. We have gotten into the flow of a lot of opportunities that are just earlier stage and really exciting opportunities that we feel very well equipped to evaluate and we want to create an opportunity, a liability stream, it's better suited to addressing that part of the market. 75:29 And frankly the pullback in the life sciences world creates an even more compelling opportunity from a new capital standpoint. So we have a great team that we've built around that. We have a lot of resources around the firm that are excited to be involved from investment community standpoint in the sourcing standpoint. And again, it's like a perfectly natural step out and one that be the LPs that we partner with as long as we have particularly around healthcare are very excited to be part of as well. 80:46 Sure, I'll start with the -- just to sort of where we're seeing opportunities and again apologies if it sounds a bit repetitive. We've continued to I think find our best opportunities near is we have our strongest focus our strongest teamwork and hopefully you've gotten a sense from this, culturally we're very much oriented around themes, around sectors, around getting very deep and developing conviction across our investment committees in the opportunities that we have resources and ecosystems built up in and so for us, and I think, actually, it's worked out quite well, particularly in recent years as we've envision getting later in the cycle in terms of the investment strategy. 81:31 So for us, I'd say that we continue to see a lot of activity and a lot of interesting differentiated make a -- right opportunities in the broad worlds of technology, which would include both software, content, media and host of other sort of interesting areas in and around technology and healthcare, those are two, sort of, big sector areas. And of course within each one there is a lot of granularity as to what we're finding. Jon mentioned interesting opportunity that intersected two of our other sectors in Troon, which overlap both business services and consumer, which are important sectors for us as well. But it's thematically again I think we've continued to, sort of, lean-in, in the places where we have the most conviction and we feel like we have the best resources to continue to drive the growth in our companies and that has continued to generate the most attractive deal flow from our standpoint. And we continue to see to have very busy investment committees with a sense of, a lot of opportunity in front of us will be under three or four final pricings after we're done with the call today in fact. 82:52 Thanks."

            "name": "Jack Weingart",
            "content": "14:39 Thanks, Jon and good morning everyone, I'm going to briefly walk through our financial results and highlight some of the more significant points regarding our fourth quarter and full-year financial performance. Our total assets under management grew from $90 billion at the end of 2020 to $114 billion at the end of \u201821. The drivers of this 27% increase during the year include $29 billion of value-creation from our underlying fund investments and over $20 billion from capital raises, partially offset by more than $25 billion of realizations as Jon alluded to. Then we returned to our fund investors throughout 2021. 15:19 Looking briefly at fee generating AUM, we had approximately $60 billion at the end of '21, compared to $51 billion at the end of 2020. This 19% increase was driven primarily by the successful raising of nearly $9 billion in fee earning capital related to the Impact and growth platforms. As you may have noticed on Page 20 of our earnings presentation, we have provided some additional detail regarding the duration of our total and fee earning assets under management. 15:49 At the end of '21 approximately 87% of our AUM and 85% of our fee earning AUM was in either perpetual or long dated funds with a duration at inception of 10-years or longer. In addition 75% of our fee earning AUM had a remaining duration of five or more years as of the end of 2021, with nearly 25% in vehicles with 10 or more years remaining. At year-end we also had $9.4 billion of AUM subject to fee earning growth, including nearly $7 billion of AUM not yet earning fees and $2.5 billion of fee earning AUM subject to fee rate step-ups in the future. 16:33 In total, we estimate the potential fee-related revenue opportunity associated with this AUM is approximately $50 million to $55 million on an annual basis with very high incremental margins. In addition, at the end of 2021 our funds had more than $28 billion of available capital or dry powder for future deployment. As Gary mentioned, we recently completed our reorganization in connection with our IPO. Beginning in '22, we are now operating under our new structure and we believe it's important to communicate our historical results to you on a pro forma basis for comparability purposes. We recorded GAAP net income for the quarter of $326 million and our pro forma basis GAAP net income totaled $41 million. 17:20 Turning to our pro forma non-GAAP results for the fourth quarter and full-year of 2021. We reported fee-related revenues of $238 million for the fourth quarter, which increased 18% year-over-year and $874 million for the full-year, which increased 20% versus the prior year. We also reported pro forma fee-related earnings or FRE of $91 million for the quarter and $326 million for the year, which was an increase of 44% versus pro forma 2020. The strong growth in our quarterly and full-year fee-related earnings was driven by a combination of top line growth in management fees at a meaningful expansion in our FRE margins. As we continue to scale our business and generate operating leverage. 18:09 Our pro forma FRE margins were 38% for the fourth quarter of \u201821 and 37% for the full-year, compared to 31% in 2020 and 26% in 2019. As we've indicated previously, we expect the continued growth in our FRE margins with a target margin of 45% that we expect to achieve in the next two years. Our pro forma after-tax distributable earnings in the fourth quarter of \u201821 were $137 million, which increased 34% versus the year ago quarter and for the full-year, we generated $538 million of pro forma after-tax DE, which more than doubled, compared to 2020. 18:53 In addition to the strong FRE growth that I just discussed, our pro forma after-tax DE for the fourth quarter and full-year of \u201821 also benefited from a substantial amount of realized performance allocations, which were $54 million in the fourth quarter and $205 million for the year. Notwithstanding, the significant amount of realized performance allocations we generated in 2021, we ended the year with a pro forma net accrued performance allocation balance, which reflects the 20% allocation to the TPG Operating Group of $769 million, an increase of 96% relative to a balance of $392 million at year-end 2020. We also have begun 2022 with a significant amount of realized performance allocations already locked in, including the two signed sale transactions in our capital funds that Jon mentioned. The $14 billion take private of McAfee, where we were substantial shareholders and the sale of Wind River to Aptiv in a $4 billion strategic acquisition. 20:01 Based only on sales of portfolio companies that have been contractually committed in our capital growth and Impact platforms, including Wind River and McAfee. We currently expect these transactions will generate more than $200 million of realized performance allocations on a pre-tax basis. The McAfee sale closed earlier this month, so the performance allocations from this sale will be included in our Q1 dividend and we expect the sale of Wind River to close in the next two quarters. 20:34 Turning briefly to our balance sheet on Page 17 of our earnings presentation, we've included a pro forma view assuming our IPO occurred on December 31st of 2021 and as you can see we have a balance sheet light business model and we are well capitalized with approximately $650 million of cash and less than $450 million of long-term debt. 20:57 Looking forward, we have an exciting period of growth ahead of us at TPG. We have a broad series of fundraising campaigns underway and spanning 11 products across all five of our multi-product platforms. In capital, we launched next generation funds in January as planned for all three of our products TPG Capital, TPG Asia and Healthcare Partners. In Impact, we recently launched our Next Rise Fund and in real estate, we are nearing completion of our next opportunistic fund and we just had a final close last week on our first Core Plus product. We also expect to be in market with several new products over the next 18-months, including life sciences and secondary's. 21:40 While the fundraising market has become more challenging in recent months, we've been very pleased with our clients receptivity to these campaigns, we are experiencing strong momentum and we remain confident in our ability to achieve our broad fundraising objectives. Through this fundraising cycle, we're also focused on strategically expanding our institutional client base and further building our presence in the high net worth channel and we're seeing very strong demand from our high net worth channel partners in particular. 22:09 Before I turn the call back over to Jon, I'd like to share some financial guidance based on our current expectations for the first quarter of '22. While we do not intend to provide quarterly guidance on a regular basis, since we're reporting the fourth quarter results so close to the end of the first quarter, we believe it's appropriate to provide guidance in this instance. For the first quarter of '22, we currently expect fee-related revenue in the range of $235 million to $245 million; FRE in the range of $87 million to $92 million and pre-tax DE in the range of $190 million to $200 million. 22:49 I'd also like to quickly remind you of the timing for our first dividend, as well as our dividend policy. As we noted during the IPO process we expect the Executive Committee of our Board to declare our first dividend in the second quarter of this year with respect to the first quarter of '22. Based on this timing, we currently plan to publish our first quarter '22 results in May and pay a dividend to record holders during the month of June. As a reminder, our current intention is to pay out to shareholders at least 85% of the after-tax distributable earnings attributable to the TPG Operating Group on a quarterly basis, subject to necessary approvals. 23:28 I'd now like to turn the call back over to Jon for a few closing remarks. 26:57 Sure. Hey, Glenn, it's Jack. Thanks for the question. Look, I think the fundraising, environment, let me start by saying what, over a longer arc we continue to believe that the very positive secular growth drivers for our industry remain intact. We think the growth of investable capital will continue, the allocations to alternatives across most pools of capital around the world will continue and the desire among the largest allocators to invest more capital with fewer managers, we think will certainly benefit firms like TPG. 27:33 In the short-term to answer your question, the industry is definitely experiencing some indigestion due to a few factors. You pointed to the slowdown in liquidity, and we certainly would expect that, I think as you heard from my comments; our liquidity, we have a substantial amount already locked in that will be closing over the coming quarters from sales that have already been signed. So, I think we will continue to be a stand out among the LPs in driving substantial liquidity from our portfolios. But for the industry, if choppy markets continue liquidity will likely slow down. There's also been faster deployment than expected across the industry, and there has been a bit of a numerator, denominator effect kicking in as many of you have written about with last year's strong alternative performance driving outsized gains in LPs alternative portfolios, and then this year's choppy market is driving a bit of a denominator effect with total assets going down on the margin. 28:35 So the result of all of that is a bit of indigestion in the market, but I will tell you we are in the market with many of our campaigns that I alluded to on the call. And as I said, we are seeing strong reception from our clients for our fundraising campaigns and we do expect to be successful across our fundraising efforts, but those dynamics that you alluded to in the market are definitely real. 46:25 Ken, as you know in the growth equity market in this case differentiated from Venture. There is a wide usage of preferred stock structures. And also those preferred stocks have real teeth, because the businesses are at a point where they have achieved fundamental long-term value. I would say very high percentage of our growth equity investing is in preferred structures and increasingly as markets get choppy, those preferred's are not only downside protection, but often have ratchets, super premiums or other things that provide not only downside protection, but upside even in a downside scenario, that's one of the innovations, we really have been leaders in, in the growth equity marketplace. How many not from venture, but instead from the structured world of private equity, we have always built that into our portfolio. I can give you today a absolute percentage as to what percent of the capital would be in that structure, but it is a very broad piece of our economic tool kit. And that is something you will also see us use even more aggressively going forward. 47:47 In moments like this, Ken, as companies go to the financing markets with uncertainty often they're wanting to avoid down rounds and that allows us to create very attractive structure transactions for the capital that they will need as they continue to grow. 57:27 Sorry, again it's Jack. I want to go back to your OpEx question, because I don't want to indicate the 36 per quarter is what you should expect going forward in '22. We do continue to invest in resources for the public company. We do expect that with COVID-related travel restrictions moving on, we are seeing an increase in travel expense. So I would guide you toward, kind of, go-forward quarterly OpEx in the low '50s. 59:11 Yes, hey Rob it's Jack. Let me, and we're not going to be giving substantial intra, kind of, quarter guidance as we go here, but obviously we'll be giving information as we close on capital raises that being said, this is our first quarter, I know, this is obviously our fundraising super cycle ahead of us is super important. So let me try to give you all a little bit more framework and little more information, kind of, campaign by campaign. I think you're the -- inference of your question is correct. So we are seeing a bit of a pull forward relative to our expectations. In fundraising in the context of what I mentioned was a strong demand that we're seeing from our clients for our funds. And as I mentioned in my comments, we have about 11 funds, we expect to be in the market with this year, and let me just walk through the most significant of those to give you more color. 60:04 On the real estate platform, we are currently oversubscribed on our next opportunistic fund TREP 4, Jon alluded to that. And we expect to hold our final close there in the second quarter and we'll obviously give an update at the end of the first quarter, about how much we've closed on as of then. And we expect to be at our hard cap there of $6.5 billion. We just had our final close last week as I mentioned on the Tech Plus, Core Plus product, which is an exciting expansion into -- of our real estate platform. 60:38 On the Impact side we expect to hold the final close for the Climate Fund in the second quarter at the hard cap of $7.2 billion and we recently launched our next broad-based impact fund Rise 3 with a target of $3 billion. On the capital platform, which you asked about we did launch TPG 9 Healthcare Partners 2 and the next Asia Fund in January as planned. On the capital -- on the TPG Capital side, TPG 9 and Healthcare Partners as you know are kind of joined at the hip. And those two, we haven't -- we have articulated to our LPs in aggregate target across those capital basis of $18.5 billion, you know, on the Asia side we launched with a target of $6 billion. 61:33 And we had planned across those businesses to hold first closes as you know from our IPO discussions more in the back half of the year. And I would say, given the pace of investing that we've been seeing. And given the demand we're seeing for the products. I would, currently expect that we hold first closes across all three of those products TPG 9 Healthcare Partners and Asia towards the end of the second quarter. 62:22 That's Q1. 62:27 On pre-tax DE, yes. 66:43 On your second question, I don't think there are any material catch-up fees embedded in that Q1 guidance. 72:28 Yes, it's Jack. Let me touch on that. I don't think it's a problem if credit is -- and say our build into credit is somehow delayed, but you start by thinking about like our current product set is particularly relevant to the high-end of the high net worth market, and we are continuing to invest in building our brand among those high net worth investors. We're continuing to build our team to market to this channel directly at all levels, and we do without having a credit platform during this fundraising cycle that I described, we do expect to raise a greater percentage of our capital from this channel than we have in the past. To give you a sense, I think we have 15 separate campaigns planned across many banks and across almost every product that we have in the market. So we are putting real resources into building our brand and building into that channel. I agree with your -- the inference of your question, as we do continue to diversify our products Tech Plus on the real estate side, as we expand that product and expand into further real estate products and eventually into credit as well. I think we will have set up our brand in the channel to readily capitalize on those opportunities and those products will be applicable to a much broader set of retail investors. 75:58 Secondary, I would point out is Asia, where we have very substantial opportunity for expansion. And lastly, just a general comment, innovation is alive and well at TPG and the type of innovation you've seen over the last few years. And what you think, Jon, but my sense around the firm is it's not slowing down. 79:36 Yes, it's Jack. I think you hit on it right there. Right, we -- pro forma for the IPO as I mentioned, we've got $650 million of cash on the balance sheet. With retaining 15% of after-tax DE will continue to add to that balance sheet flexibility and we have relatively little debt. So as we sit here today and think about pursuing the growth opportunities that we've talked about, we believe we have plenty of capital, and as long as we feel that way, we believe the right answer is return capital to shareholders. So that will be \u2013 we continue to be our policy. 80:12 Okay, thanks. 83:09 Thanks everyone."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that, today's call is being recorded. Please go to TPG's IR website to obtain the earnings materials. I will now turn the call over to Gary Stein, Head of Investor Relations at TPG. Thank you. You may begin.\nGary Stein: Great. Thanks, Bailey. Welcome everyone. Joining me this morning are Jon Winkelried, Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Weingart, Chief Financial Officer. In addition, our Executive Chairman and Co-Founder, Jim Coulter; and our President, Todd Sisitsky, are also here with us and will be available for the Q&A portion of this morning's call. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you this call may include forward-looking statements that do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to TPG's earnings release and SEC filings for factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. TPG undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Within our discussion and earnings release, we are presenting GAAP measures, non-GAAP measures and pro forma GAAP and non-GAAP measures, reflecting the reorganization that was completed during 2021 and immediately prior to TPG's IPO. We believe it is helpful for investors and analysts to understand the historic results through our go-forward structure, and please refer to TPG's earnings release for details on the pro forma financial information. We will also be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call that we believe are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to the nearest GAAP figures in TPG's earnings release, which is available on our website. Please note that, nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any TPG fund. Looking briefly at our results for the fourth quarter, we reported GAAP net income attributable to TPG Inc. of $24 million and after tax distributable earnings of $227 million or $0.59 per share of Class A common stock. We also declared a dividend of $0.5 per share of Class A common stock, which will be paid on March 10th to shareholders of record as of February 27th. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John.\nJon Winkelried: Thanks, Gary. This morning, we are looking forward to discussing our results now that we've completed our first full year as a public company. Since our IPO early last year, we have navigated markets with more disruption and volatility than we have seen in over a decade. There has been pressure from persistent inflation, rising rates and geopolitical conflicts. This macro environment has led to challenges in our industry, marked by tougher fundraising, a slower deal environment, tighter financing conditions and declining valuations. Against this backdrop, TPG has demonstrated resilience in growth. We not only delivered, but surpassed what we set out to accomplish in our first year as public company and we finished 2022 with another strong quarter. We deliberately chose to go public, as we were launching several flagship fundraisers so TPG's public shareholders could share in our accelerated growth. Despite difficult industry-wide fundraising dynamics, we raised $30 billion of capital in 2022, a 47% increase over the prior year. Global private equity fundraising declined 19% in 2022. But we believe we gained share as LPs continue to consolidate their GP relationships, among their best performing managers, including TPG. We held early first closes across all our flagship funds in the market including TPG Capital, Healthcare Partners, Capital Asia and Rise. Although this is one of the most challenging fundraising environments we have seen, we are very pleased with the quality of engagement and continued support from both our longstanding and new limited partners. However, as we look ahead, we are not immune to the fundraising challenges our industry is facing, which will continue to drive uncertainty as campaigns are completed among alternative asset managers. As a result of our fundraising momentum in 2022, we finished the year with $43 billion of dry powder, which is up 51% from the prior year and represents 55% of our fee earning AUM. Total AUM was $135 billion at year end, a 19% increase year-over-year, driven by strong fund raising and value creation of 8% across our platforms, partially offset by $16 billion of realizations as we selectively monetize investments at attractive valuations. Looking to our financial results, we delivered strong performance in 2022. Fee-related revenues for the full year were $1.1 billion and grew 24% from the pro forma prior year. Full year FRE of $450 million grew 39% from pro forma 2021 and represents a 42% FRE margin. We believe our strong results through such a volatile year demonstrate the durability of our franchise. During our IPO, we highlighted the importance of organic growth and innovation as a cornerstone of TPG's long-term success. Over the past year, we have expanded into new strategies, where we believe we have differentiated angles and compelling growth opportunities.  Within our Market Solutions platform, we launched and completed first closes for two GP-led secondary funds. TPG GP Solutions and TPG New West. As I alluded to on our last earnings call, in December, we closed a $500 million anchor commitment to the inaugural TPG Next Fund from CalPERS, one of the world's leading institutional investors. As a reminder, TPG Next was created to seed and state the next generation of diverse-led firms in alternative asset management. We believe there is a significant market opportunity and are committed to backing and supporting underrepresented managers in our industry.  As a result of fundraising and new products, we have continued to grow and diversify our LP base. In 2022, we added approximately 60 new institutional relationships and more than 55 existing LPs have broadened their commitments to TPG by investing in new fund strategies with us. In aggregate, these new and expanded relationships committed more than $6 billion of capital to TPG in 2022. In addition, we have made meaningful progress in strategically expanding our presence of a high-net-worth channel placing five different funds across eight different channel partners. Looking ahead to the rest of 2023 and beyond, the markets are at a crossroads. Fed action has pushed yields higher and equity multiples lower, driving investors to exercise caution as they see equilibrium in valuations. Despite some recent recovery in the equity and leverage finance markets, investment pace among alternative asset managers including TPG has remained muted. Buyers and sellers seem to be taking another pause, as they wait to see how a number of macro drivers play out, such as interest rates, inflation and a possible recession. With significant dry powder, long-dated capital, and a deep sector focus, we believe TPG is well-positioned to capitalize on this market dislocation. While we expect near-term deployment to remain relatively light, we are building a pipeline of interesting opportunities through our long-term, theme-driven sourcing approach. Despite the general slowdown in deal activity for the industry over the last few quarters, we still saw pockets of opportunity for deployment and realizations across our diverse set of platforms and fund strategies. We deployed $5.7 billion and $16.6 billion in the fourth quarter and full year 2022 respectively. I'll walk through a few highlights. In the fourth quarter, we completed five healthcare deals across our capital platform, reinforcing the strength of our differentiated franchise. This includes the acquisitions of DOC Generici in Europe and iNova Pharmaceuticals in Asia Pacific, ao take private of Covetrus's to carve out of claims extend and a follow on investment in Monogram Health. In our growth fund, we completed the carve out of MedQuest Associates, a leading owner, operator and manager of diagnostic imaging facilities in partnership with Novant Health, a preeminent not for profit health system. This deal is a great example TPG's long history of building unique partnerships with high-quality companies, non-profits and academic institutions to create proprietary transactions. Given the capital constraints in today's market, we are seeing a growing interest in creative partnership opportunities, and our pipeline is continuing to build. The market dislocation has also been particularly interesting for our tech adjacencies fund, which we established to provide flexible capital solutions for leading companies in the technology industry.  We believe the recent tech slowdowns has created the most attractive investing environment for TTEC since its launched in 2018. TTEC recently closed two structured investments, one of the leading vertical SaaS and integrated payments company and second a leading provider of cybersecurity solutions. The current challenging backdrop of growth stage technology companies has made the strategic value of TTEC's differentiated capital mandate even more relevant. Our Rise platform is at the forefront of the impact space and our inaugural Rise Climate Fund remains ahead on its pace of deployment. The increasing focus on energy security and de-globalization along with the Inflationary Reduction Act in the U.S. and the new Net-Zero Industry Act in Europe. Fundamentally enhance the investment opportunity. We are seeing an increased demand for capital to address energy transition and climate needs around the world. As an example, in December, TPG Rise Climate committed to invest in Enpal, one of the largest in fastest growing residential decarbonization platforms in Europe. To give you a sense of its momentum, Enpal has grown its customer base and revenues on average 3x each year since its founding in 2017 and is profitable. And finally, in our secondaries platform, our inaugural TPG GP Solutions Fund completed its second investment during the quarter. And in Asia, TPG NuQuest closed the creation of unique continuation vehicle for a leading Singapore based alternative asset manager. We believe our secondaries business is well positioned for growth. GP's net capital is an increasingly valuable source of liquidity and validation, given the slowdown of PE exits particularly for high-quality sponsors on high-quality assets and sponsors portfolios. On realizations, we have been intentionally patient and remain focused on driving growth within our portfolios, where we are relatively early in our average hold period, following our significant monetization activity over the last few years. We realized $4.2 billion and $15.5 billion in the fourth quarter and full year 2022 respectively release. This includes completing our previously announced sale of Wind River to Aptiv in December, which Jack will talk more about. Several monetizations of our public equity positions in regions outside of the U.S. Looking at our capital Asia and growth funds, successfully IPO and partially monetized four of our Indian portfolio companies in a 12-month period. Landmark cars, Five Star Business Finance, Campus Activewear and Nykaa. In November, we fully monetized our stake in Nykaa at attractive prices generating favorable returns despite the volatile equity market backdrop. These IPOs and realizations underscore TPG's leading franchise in India and the broader APAC region, as well as our equity capital markets execution capabilities. This last week, Nextracker, which is in our Rise portfolio, completed its $734 million IPO, the largest and one of the first U.S. IPOs this year. Nextracker is a leading provider of solar tracking solutions that highlights the benefit of our team-based investing. The IPO execution offering was highly successful with the order book well oversubscribed and the stock trading up 27% on its first day. In real estate during the quarter, we sold a portfolio of Student Housing Properties. And last month, we made a sizable realization in one of our U.S. life sciences and innovation focused platforms, a sector that continues to experience strong tailwinds. Given our purposeful portfolio within durable sectors and themes, we have been able to selectively monetize investments, despite a material slowdown in many parts of the real estate market. Looking forward to 2023, we remain focused on the same growth and diversification objectives we discussed with you previously. Our priorities continue to be: One, completing our flagship and other fundraising campaigns.  Two, continuing our strong track record of organic growth. We have always been innovators and we intend to expand into adjacent strategies, where we believe we have unique competitive advantages such as building climate infrastructure and real estate credit and continuing to scale our GP-led secondaries ever. Three, inorganic growth remains an important priority for TPG. We already track and scale today, but we see significant wide space in areas that are natural extensions for us to drive growth in diversification. For example, we remain actively focused on expanding into corporate credit and continue to evaluate a range of opportunities in this space. Before I conclude my remarks, I want to mention our Global Partner Meeting, which we hosted earlier this week in San Francisco. We covered a range of important topics including investment strategy, fundraising, culture and growth drivers for the firm. Our partners are laser-focused on continuing to deliver excellent performance for our investors, while also building and growing a market-leading innovative franchise. I'll now turn the call over to Jack to take you through our financial results.\nJack Weingart: Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Our fourth quarter results once again reflect the resiliency of our FRE centric business model. We finished 2022 with total assets under management of $135 billion, up 19% from the prior year. The key drivers of this increase include $30 billion of new capital raise and almost $7 billion of value creation across our portfolios, partially offset by $16 billion of realizations. Fee-earning AUM increased over the year from $60 billion to $78 billion at the end of 2022, up 30%. At the end of the year, we had $13 billion of AUM subject to fee earning growth, of which 78% was not yet earning fees. We continue to reach record levels in our financial performance. Total fee-related revenue was $307 million for the fourth quarter, up 29% year-over-year. Fourth quarter management fees were essentially flat, compared to the third quarter due to a one-time step down in fee-earning AUM following the activation of the newest vintage funds for capital and healthcare partners. Similarly, the recent step down of our Capital Asia Fund will impact our fee-related revenues in the first quarter of this year. Transaction fees were particularly strong in the fourth quarter, due to our capital markets business, which continues to be an important differentiator for our investment business. During the quarter, our in-house debt capital markets team had a -- role in raising a total of $5 billion of total debt financing in connection with several of the recent investments that John discussed. For the full year 2022, we reported fee related revenues of $1.1 billion, a 24% increase from pro forma 2021. FRE grew 39% from pro forma 2021 to $454 million for full year 2022, driven by a combination of strong management fee growth of 29% and disciplined cost control, which resulted in an FRE margin for the year of 42%. Our margin expansion of more than 400 basis points from pro forma 2021, demonstrates the scalability of our platform and the ongoing benefits of operating leverage. For the fourth quarter, we reported FRE of $139 million, up 53% from the pro forma year ago quarter and an FRE margin of 45%. We believe this margin was somewhat elevated in the fourth quarter and our full year 2022 FRE margin of 42% better reflects our progress toward our near-term target of 45%. After tax distributable earnings for the fourth quarter of 2022 were $227 million, a 65% increase year-over-year. This includes a $95 million contribution from net realized performance allocations in the quarter, primarily attributable to the closing of the Wind River transaction. This was an outstanding investment, generating substantial profits for the firm and our fund investors. Through TPG's ownership and operational expertise, we helped accelerate Wind River's revenue and EBITDA growth, which was flat at the time of our acquisition in 2018. To double-digit levels at the time of our exit. We're very pleased with the outcome of this deal, which furthers TPG's successful history of corporate carve outs and highlights our thematic focus on digital transformation enablers. Following the closing of the Wind River sale, our crude performance allocation balance decreased from $725 million at the end of the third quarter to $643 million at year end, as $95 million in realized gains were partially offset by $12 million of value creation. On the topic of value creation against a difficult operating environment, we continue to see the benefits of our thematic portfolio construction. We invest in companies that have strong secular growth characteristics in sectors where we have deep expertise, and our portfolio delivered value equation of 1% in the quarter and 8% in 2022.  In our private equity businesses within each platform, average portfolio company revenue growth range from 25% to 40% in 2022 compared to 2021. And performance continues to be robust with particular strength and health care, climate and high-end consumer sectors. In connection with our fourth quarter results, as Gary mentioned, we announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per share Class A common stock represent 85% of TPG's after tax distributable earnings. This is the highest quarterly dividend we've declared since IPO. In our first full year as a public company, we will have distributed dividends totaling $1.59 per share of Class A common stock. I would note that in connection with our annual compensation process in January, we granted 3.7 million restricted stock units to our employees. These years will invest over three years. And I would refer you to Slide 28 of our earnings presentation for a comprehensive summary of our equity-based compensation. Looking at our non-GAAP balance sheet for TPG operating group as of December 31st, we remain well capitalized, with $692 million of cash and 450 million of long-term debt. Our $700 million revolver was also undrawn at year end, giving us ample flexibility to pursue strategic growth initiatives. Now turning to fundraising, we raised 3.6 billion of capital in the fourth quarter, primarily focused on new strategies such as TPG Next, and certain areas of our growth platform notably TPG digital media, and T Ted. This brought total capital raised to $30 billion in 2022, a 47% increase compared to the prior year. This was a major accomplishment given the fundraising backdrop and reflects TPG increasing market share due to the breadth and depth of our relationships, the strength of our brand and most importantly our strong investment performance across our platforms.  As we look forward to 2023 our fundraising objectives are as follows. Number one, successfully complete the campaigns for our flagship capital, healthcare partners, Asia and rise funds, which we expect to extend through the remainder of this year given ongoing challenges in the fundraising market.  Number 2, make further progress on capitalizing our new businesses including our secondary's platform TPG Next and life sciences.  Number 3, begin fundraising for our next flagship growth fund, which we expect to launch in the middle of this year based on current deployment pace. And 4 continue our organic growth through the launch of new products. Specifically, we're in discussions with potential LPs for inaugural funds for our private real estate credit effort checkout and for Rise Climate infrastructure. To close out, we're proud of the results that TPG has achieved in his first year as a public company. TPG's FRE growth engine proved to be resilient in 2022 despite challenging market conditions. We're confident in our firm's ability to navigate through dislocation, while continuing to grow our fee generating assets. We look forward to continuing to provide differentiated long-term value to our public shareholders, limited partners and portfolio companies. I'll now turn the call back over to Shelby to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.\nGlenn Schorr: Maybe if you could put some numbers around the points that you just brought up, you caught my attention on two things. One was the step down and one first quarter for capital healthcare and this may put some numbers around that. And the other part was the four buckets of fundraising and great to hear it. I know it's hard given the backdrop, but maybe we could put a range around what we could be expecting on the fundraising side?\nJon Winkelried: In terms of stuff down on TPG just to remind people in Q4, because we activated TPG 9 and Healthcare Partners 2 in Q3. The, the fees charged on TPG 8, Healthcare Partners, sorry TPG 8 and Healthcare Partners 1 step down in Q4, that stepped down was about 2 billion in TPG 8. And it was about 500 million in healthcare partners. And then on your other question I think on a general fundraising outlook. Look, obviously as I mentioned, we feel very good about the progress we made in 2022. We feel like we gain market share, raising $30 billion in the complicated backdrop. And also capitalizing new businesses as I mentioned. I also talked about on the last call the fact that we expected fundraising conditions to remain challenging throughout 2023 and we continue to believe that will be the case. That the same liquidity factors are impacting certain segments of the LP base, but not all segments, primarily the more mature parts of the market, while other parts of the market are growing nicely. The fundraising market remains quite crowded with GPs. Against this backdrop, we do expect to continue to gain share this year and it has been helpful that as we entered 2023 LPs can now access the 2023 budgets and across all the flagship funds, we have in the market TPG Capital 9, Healthcare Partners 2, Asia 8 and Rise 3. We have very strong engagement with LPs. Given the time it takes for LPs to complete their diligence, most of that capital is lining up for Q2 and Q3. So I'd expect Q1 to be relatively light, with an acceleration in Q2 and Q3. It's too early to tell, if we will hit all of our targets, but we feel very good about the progress we are making across all those funds.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Ken Worthington with JP Morgan.\nKen Worthington: Good morning. When you look at the information and data that you are getting from your portfolio companies and maybe a little bit on the broader macro environment as well, how is this informing your view on the outlook for harvesting, as we look to 2023? I guess, first, have signals changed at all so far in '23 from what you may have seen a quarter or two ago? And if so, could this end up being a more constructive environment for harvesting gains, than what you might have been thinking about again three, six months ago?\nJon Winkelried: Sure. Ken, thanks for the question. I think in a nutshell, across the board and particularly in the areas that we have been focused on, which are areas that are generally experiencing secular growth, we have seen steady and strong results. I think Jack took you through some of the numbers, and there really hasn't been a particular change or inflection this quarter. But we felt good about the company's performance both in the revenue side and on the EBITDA side. On the realization front, we continue to have a number of areas that we are exploring sales and alike. We did sell Neogene to AstraZeneca in January. So there is still activity. I'd say, it's a general matter, the skew of the neighborhoods that we are investing in the companies that we are backing and the growth orientation in our investment strategy, does lend itself to strategic takeouts probably a little bit more than the industry averages, and that market will remain active even in different environments. Having said that, our realization pace has been quite strong. In recent years, we have seen the overall industry slowdown a bit on realization front. So there is continuing to be opportunities for liquidity. We continue to see them. Probably not the pace of the last two years.\nJack Weingart: Ken, the only thing I would add to that is that, we are seeing some improvements in the kind of macro and underlying kind of financial markets, as it relates to deal activity that may help from the perspective of realization. So for instance, financing, there has been a reasonably -- there has been a reasonable recovery, not full recovery by any means. But there has been a reasonable recovery when you look at what credit spreads are looking like, and the loan markets feel a little bit better to us in terms of sourcing, financing. And then also I think you have heard us go through some of our activity with respect to public markets on the IPO side, leading up to our most recent, which was Nextracker. And it definitely feels like there is some pent-up demand from the public markets as well, because it's been void of IPO supply for quite a long time. So there are -- the portfolio is performing well. I think we -- I think there is a broad range of sort of when things are ready to be monetized and we have reinforced that in the past that we are going to monetize, when we feel like, it's an optimal time to monetize. But there are some -- relative to last year, maybe some few green shoots here or there in terms of the market backdrop.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.\nBrian Bedell: Maybe switching over to deployment and in the context of fundraising as well. So first on deployment, that sounds like the better improved marketing environment, it's following some of the expected or raising some of the expectations of sellers and therefore slowing the process. So maybe just your thoughts on if we could get a soft landing, is that going to hang up deployment generally? And then maybe through the different platforms? I know, Rise Climate of course is still ahead of schedule, in deployment, maybe it's just some commentary on whether you think that can continue to be the case especially with the new net zero industry act in Europe, is that even more potential than you thought even a quarter ago for that fun?\nJon Winkelried: Thanks for the question. I mean, we talked about this last year, as you might imagine. It's an interesting environment right now, because some of the signals in the market, like some moderating and inflation although the CPI print this week, obviously raises questions on that, but some moderating and inflation rates may be inching back down a little bit. What I was saying before in terms of credit spreads, I mean, we saw, if you go back to '22, right, we saw some dislocation in the market, as inflation spiked, and there was, the overall geopolitical kind of backdrop. And this dynamic of buyers and sellers\u2019 kind of not being in the same place, people trying to get their heads around valuations, slow the market considerably. The fourth quarter, the part of the end of the third and fourth quarter, there was definitely kind of a pickup.  And you heard from already from the deal activity, we talked about, that there was a more active environment for deployment as we got toward the end of the year. It feels like because of these other signals, now, it feels like people are maybe there's like a little another, there's another little pause in the market. Because I think people's expectations on price are maybe going back up, I don't know, whether that's well founded or not, but I think they're going back up. So I think it's going to be sort of a dynamic environment in front of us in terms of fuel activity. It is also creating some interesting opportunities for instance, when you look at GP solutions, capital, continuation vehicles, things like that, it's sort of, as sponsors, try to think about how they want to monetize or partially monetize. So we've seen an uptick there. We've seen some interesting things like co-control deals, what we were we'd looked at a couple because people are looking to take some money out. So I think that's sort of the general backdrop. Jim, maybe you can talk about what's going on in climate. \nJack Weingart: Obviously, momentum on climate was good going into last year. And I would have to say that last year was a seismic change to the positive. Obviously, the political activities and IRA bill in the U.S. change the landscape and accelerate the landscape dramatically. But the events in the Ukraine and the resulting questions of energy security around the world, also substantially increased activity. In the comments, you heard about our investment in NPL growing 300% a year if you can imagine a German consumer rooftop solar in this environment would be a much more interesting energy security question for them, given the changes, and we're seeing that type of thing happening across markets. So activity levels have picked up, there will be a time for them to feather in, because, for example, in the IRA, it's out there, people know it's coming, but it hasn't been fully enacted yet. We're expecting that to happen over the next few months. But generally, the backdrop and interest in climate investing has moved substantially to the positive.\nJon Winkelried: The only thing I was going to add is that if you look more broadly across the portfolio, by the franchise. We have others such as TTAD, which I think is really a solution face capital. That's actually, this is a great environment, and then that platform has been very busy. It continues to be quite busy. And then, John mentioned in his comments, the net cost associates carve out from a not for profit and that's, I think indicative of another thing that we're seeing in our pipeline quite a bit, which is the sort of unusual relationships, structured partnerships, our history of being a partner to everyone from Pfizer, Humana, Intel, AT&T, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, I think that serves us very well when it comes to more problem solving capital. And we spend a lot of time developing those relationships to take a little bit longer for the opportunities to play out, but that portion of our pipeline in our core private equity business remains robust.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Gerald O'Hara with Jefferies.\nGerald O'Hara: Maybe just kind of touching on FRE margin for a moment. I think, during the prepared remarks mentioned, Jack mentioned those somewhat elevated in the quarter, but also recognizing that you're kind of tracking ahead of prior, I guess, guidance towards that sort of 45% target. So maybe a couple of puts and takes that we're in the fourth quarter, and then sort of how you might see the trajectory playing out as we look forward into 2023?\nJon Winkelried: What I meant by the elevated FRE margin in Q4 was largely related to the strong performance on the capital markets fees that I also mentioned on the call, which obviously have a high flow through margin associated with them. So if you normalize that for a more typical quarter, you bring it back down to as I mentioned, something closer to our four year FRE margin in the low-40s. Which is what I would call our kind of our launching pad for continued performance toward them. And we stick with the same target. We've been talking about getting to 45% on a sustainable basis by the end of the year, this year.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprys: Maybe just on credit, you guys have expressed interest to jump back in sounds like you're continuing to think about that and do some work. So just hoping maybe you can update us on your latest thoughts there. Sounds like you're continuing to evaluate ways to enter. Maybe you could just update us on what you're seeing how the environment is impacting those conversations and what learnings and insights have you gleaned from the work that you've done so far, and how that may inform your approach and timing?\nJon Winkelried: I don't know if we have an hour on this call. It's a big question, big topic. Look, I think, we're continuing to be focused on it, particularly in this environment where we see valuations moving around a lot. We see, when you look at sort of where the return on opportunities are in a market like this, particularly with dislocation of capital availability, there are some really interesting capital structure types of opportunities, whether they are top of the capital structure, middle of the capital structure. So we continue to believe that, when you think about credit, you think about sort of the total return part of the spectrum there that is very synergistic with our business. You can hear us talk about our business and I'm sure you can glean that, we are very sector and company focused investors. Where we focus, we are deep. We have a lot of industry knowledge, a lot of company knowledge that dovetails very well with that part of the business.  So I think we continue to have a strong interest in that. We have not backed-off what we have said earlier, which is we have an objective of reentering that space and we expect to at some point. Deal making, as you know, as far as inorganic treat deal making is always complicated particularly in these types of business. So we are working on finding exactly the right partners and the right opportunity. There is other parts of the credit landscape that also are really interesting. And I think you have heard us talk about, if you look at what's going on in real estate, there has been a pretty massive dislocation in the financing markets in real estate. And in some respect real estate valuations versus financing costs are upside down relative to where they have historically been. And so we are out in the market right now. I think we had announced on another earnings call, we hired a new head of our real estate credit business, Doug Clark, who came to us from Goldman Sachs, where he was many years. We are out in the market right now, raising an opportunistic real estate pool of capital, and we feel pretty good about it. There is a lot of receptivity around the market from our LPs that we are talking to and particularly given the strength of our real estate franchise, we are sort of -- we're drafting off of that in a lot of respects for this capital raise and we feel pretty good about it. So we are expecting that we will get some money raised there. We think that the opportunity on that side of the coin is probably as good as we have seen it in maybe a couple of decades. So we are focused on it. We are working on it and we will keep you up to date.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Michael Brown with KBW.\nMichael Brown: Hi good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to -- if you give a little bit more color about the management fees and does any additional need on [indiscernible] for the trajectory here. So just on the fourth quarter, once you step down fees and I don't have a modest impact in the first quarter as well. But you did talk about that there is $13 billion of AUM subject to fee-earning growth here. So any additional color you can add about how to think about the of pace of that potential $70 million of management fees could layer in over the coming quarters? And any other thoughts here on the fee rate going forward?\nJon Winkelried: Yes. Let me appreciate the question. We are getting a couple of questions, since posting our results this morning about the average fee rate. Let me try to clarify that. There is a lot of pieces moving around. It's always calculating an average fee rate based on average F AUM for a quarter. Is a very imprecise thing to do, particularly in a period like this, we are activating new funds and seeing step downs in other funds because we don't charge on a daily average basis. I can tell you first of all, we're not seeing any fee pressure in our business. We're not changing our fee schedules, we're not adding discounts that we didn't have before. That's the most important point.  On the average fee rate calculation, there are couple of particular, couple of things flowing through that as you look at Q3 and Q4 in particular. For example, in Q3, as you know, we activated TPG 9 healthcare partners to in July. So we were actually earning fees for virtually the entire quarter in Q3 on that call it $10 billion. If you run your, I think the way most people calculate a weighted average FAUM for the quarter would be zero plus 10 divided by 2. So you'd assume we're earning fees on 5 billion, we're actually running about 10 billion.  In Q4, we saw the opposite, right? Because the step downs that I just talked about, affected our fees for the full quarter, if you calculated average FAUM for the quarter, you would have picked up a higher number in the beginning a lower number in the end, but we actually had to step down affected the fees for the whole quarter. So that's some of the nuances that you see flowing through. On the shadow FAUM that you asked about. We did add nicely to that during the quarter. If you look at where we raised capital during the quarter. The three biggest areas were our digital media fund, which charges fees on invested capital only, that was 800 million, 350 million for T Ted, which is also fees on DRON capital only. And 500 million for TPG Next, which is a normal fees on committed structure, but we have not yet activated that fund. So all of that would have gone into AUM but not FAUM. And it'll flow in over time.  Predicting when that shadow FAUM will pay fees, and over what time period is really impossible depends upon the pace at which we invest that capital. \nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.\nAlex Blostein: I was hoping you could attack some of the fundraising trends you saw over the course of the fourth quarter. And really how you think about 2023. So I guess first point is in terms of the ultimate sizes of some of the flagship campaigns that you guys are on today, any change and kind of how you think they'll shake out in terms of the absolute size, understanding the timing, might take a little bit longer? And then we'll look at the fourth quarter specifically, I guess, not a big surprise that capital segment didn't see a lot. But I was surprised by still pretty robust pace of fundraising and growth. So maybe just spend a minute on kind of LP appetite for the more kind of traditional sort of PE fundraising versus the growth franchise?\nJon Winkelried: Sure, we try to address several of those points out. First of all, the appetite continues to be on your last point continues to be quite strong. You guys can look at our performance and make your own assessment, we think we're performing quite strongly in generating returns, and importantly, delivering liquidity to our LPs. I mean, our DPI is quite high relative to our peers at a time when others are not distributing as much capital as we have over the past year or two. So the result of all that is strong appetite across the flagships we have in the market. I think I mentioned last fall, we did expect Q4 to be quite light. Just given how tapped out LPs were as we entered Q4, and we actually were able to raise, as you saw over 3.5 billion of capital across other businesses, most notably the ones I just mentioned, TTAD Digital Media, there's also some co investment in there on growth and capital as we close those deals and brought in our LPs as co investors, that co investment capital, largely does not pay fees, but it's highly strategic to us. As our LPs expect us to deliver that co investment. So that's how I characterize kind of Q4. As we look out to this year, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, we do continue to see strong demand these fundraising always has kind of a natural arc to it. And oftentimes after a large first close, we've had all these funds, you tend to see a bit of a back loading to the remainder of the campaign. And I think that's always true. It's even more true in today's kind of fundraising environment. So as I mentioned, we have a lot of people doing work and doing their diligence, I'd expect Q1 to be relatively light, but a good acceleration into Q2 and Q3. We haven't changed our targets on any of the funds. But it's too early to tell whether we'll hit all those targets or not.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Brian McKenna with JMP Securities.\nBrian McKenna: So I appreciate the detail on the number of LPs added during the year. Or can you remind us how many LP relationships do you have an aggregate across your business? And then what's the breakdown between the U.S. and the rest of the world and then kind of over time where you see the most opportunity to add new LPs?\nJack Weingart: I think the LPs, I can look up more precise number, for every LPs across all of our businesses are in the academy called call it 500 to 600 category. Although I think that may not be a bigger number, let me come back to you on that. What was second part of your question?\nBrian McKenna: Just in terms of you know, where do you see kind of the most opportunity to add incremental LPs from here?\nJon Winkelried: And we have been, that number has been growing over time, as John mentioned in his prepared remarks. We still have a lot of untapped potential in the LP base as we continue to grow new products that are more appealing to different segments of the LP market. And as we continue to build out our distribution platform, both the institutional side and the high net worth side, I think the biggest source of potential, we're fairly underweight in Europe. We have a lot of room to grow insurance. We have a lot of room to grow in the high net worth channel, as we've talked about many times will accelerate as we build out more broadly applicable products to that channel. And those are probably the biggest areas I'd call out. But we see a lot of potential and continue to expand our LP base.\nJack Weingart: I did several trips to Europe last year for fundraising most recently fourth quarter. And we have a number of really strong dialogues majority, there's 25 meetings we've had with new folks that we're getting to know, but it feels like there's a lot of untapped potential that we're just starting to make some progress on.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Adam Beatty with UBS.\nAdam Beatty: I want to ask about the capital market solutions business or businesses. There's a couple of different elements in there you already mentioned. Some of the secondary is fundraising which is good. Also the strength in debt arranging in Q4. But just wondering about ECM and the public markets business. And then just overall, what kind of growth trajectory you are thinking about maybe near-term, long-term? Are you still adding resources there? And Obviously, any guardrails you could put around transaction fee expectations would be great. Thanks very much.\nJon Winkelried: Hey, Adam. Thanks for the question. Just to kind of go in reverse order. We definitely continue to add resources in that area. We view the capital markets business to be, and I'll take one piece at a time, to be highly strategic for all the reasons we have talked about. We have added probably doubled the size of that group over the past couple of years. We added someone to lead debt capital markets, actually debt and equity capital markets for us in Asia for example, where we didn't have the team over there yet. On the equity capital markets side, that has not been in the fourth quarter, a major generator of fee revenue for us, but was highly helpful in helping lead the IPO of Nextracker, for example, where we brought in one of the key anchor investors in that IPO. So both the debt and equity side are continuing to be very strategic. The other piece of the business you didn't mentioned, I think it maybe within that Solution segment or platform is our CPaaS business, our public equity partners business. And the performance there was quite strong in 2022. So we see good LP, good engagement for investors and expect to expand that capital base this year. And then you mentioned the secondaries business where you saw we made progress in capitalizing those businesses in Q4. We expect to make continued progress this year.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Finian O'shea with Wells Fargo Securities.\nFinian O'shea: Hi, everyone. Good afternoon there. A question on the impact in Climate franchise. This is an area with good tailwinds and demand as you have noted in the past couple of quarters. Can you talk about on the balance the incoming competition from some of your major peers there? And if that is driving a more challenging fundraising environment, than say, we would have thought a year ago?\nJon Winkelried: Patient is always a form of flattery that I think tells you that, there is substantial interest in the marketplace. Our peers wouldn't be coming in if there weren't a lot of LP demand for this type of activity, which really highlights the value of our leadership position. Over the long arc of private equity, people have always underestimated the amount of market growth that any segments might have. And I think what we are seeing today is very substantial market growth, particularly around certain sectors of the impact landscape. As I said before, there is just a seismic change in what's happening in decarbonization and climate, but across other sectors like online ad, healthcare access, post-COVID, financial inclusion. If you thought of a landscape of sectors you might want to be involved in, they overlap the impact to investing marketplace very strongly. So we feel good about our position. We feel good about the flow we are seeing and we expect competition and we also expect to continue to grow against it.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Rufus Hone with BMO Capital Markets.\nRufus Hone: Maybe coming back to the FRE margin and thinking about it from the expense side. Can you help us think about the jumping off point for fee related expenses heading into 2023? Is the fourth quarter level roughly the right level for the first quarter? And I suppose how are you thinking about your pace of hiring in 2023 relative to 2022 are use sling or investment part, any detail that will be helpful? Thank you.\nJon Winkelried: Our [indiscernible] expenses obviously break down into two primary line items, comp and benefits and OpEx. Comp benefits in Q4 was 102 and change million. And I think that's a reasonable estimate for launching off that. As you know, sometimes what you see in Q4 moves around a bit in his industry, because if you haven't been accruing for bonuses, as you end up paying them, it can cause a change in Q4. In our case, we ended up right on our approval for bonuses. So Q4 is a good reflection of the launching off that for comp and benefits this year. I would expect that we are going to continue to invest in the business. So that should trend up a bit during the course of the year. But a lot of growth has occurred. On the OpEx line, OpEx for the quarter was 66 million roughly and that to reflects all the factors we've talked about full kind of return to office, a full return to a lot of travel, both for deals and for fundraising. That's causing that number to come back up a lot of the public company expenses, we had to account for it. That's all in that number now. So likewise, I think that is roughly a good run right number to think about, as you think about this year. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Luke Mason with BNP Paribas.\nLuke Mason: Just to follow-up on the fundamentals of portfolio companies. You mentioned strong revenue growth and some impressive figures, just for portfolio companies, and it just which areas are driving that growth? Is that across technology and healthcare, just pockets of weakness within the portfolio that you see?\nJon Winkelried: Yes, I mean, just to take you through the qualitative start there. In healthcare, we continue to see strong demand tailwind for procedures, which has really been more of a rebound from the losses of procedures and other healthcare activity more routine health care activity during COVID. In the software, enterprise technology business, I think what we've seen actually is an increase in retention rates, and particularly at certain points last year, we saw a longer sales cycle in terms of new customer conversions. Although I think essentially improved, improved a little bit, but a little bit of a slowdown in this sort of the second derivative in terms of the rate of growth. But this companies are hanging in there very well.  In our other technology, which we call internet digital media, the remains a persistent demand for content and streaming. And a particular rebound in live events, and domestic touring that sort of pre pandemic levels. And we were exposed to that in a number of our companies, certainly including CAA, among others. There has been a slowdown in ad sales. On the consumer side it's really a tale two different sort of groups on the high end. We've seen very strong demand in the consumer and increasing elsewhere. On the lower end, where we have, candidly less portfolio exposure. We've seen more of a more of an issue from inflation and a pullback in demand. Again, that's it's been a little less exposed for us. I think we've talked a bit about rise and climate, so that probably gives you a sense of it for those sectors. That's how we think about the world from a sector perspective. From an EBITDA standpoint, strong growth, they're certainly continues to feel, there has been particularly to the fourth through 2022 in the fourth quarter, some pressure from wage inflation. Our companies are important companies that have important relationships with customers. So most of the raw material price increases we've been able to pass through, but there certainly a lot of focus around wage inflation, and that's subsided a bit. But that was sort of the primary cost side of that, that flowed through in 2022. But overall margins are stable.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I would now like to turn the call back over to Gary Stein for any additional or closing remarks.\nGary Stein: Thanks, Shelby. Thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. Do you have any follow-up questions, please circle back to me or Ebony. Otherwise, we'll look forward to speaking to you again next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's TPG's fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings call and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jon Winkelried",
            "content": "Thanks, Gary. This morning, we are looking forward to discussing our results now that we've completed our first full year as a public company. Since our IPO early last year, we have navigated markets with more disruption and volatility than we have seen in over a decade. There has been pressure from persistent inflation, rising rates and geopolitical conflicts. This macro environment has led to challenges in our industry, marked by tougher fundraising, a slower deal environment, tighter financing conditions and declining valuations. Against this backdrop, TPG has demonstrated resilience in growth. We not only delivered, but surpassed what we set out to accomplish in our first year as public company and we finished 2022 with another strong quarter. We deliberately chose to go public, as we were launching several flagship fundraisers so TPG's public shareholders could share in our accelerated growth. Despite difficult industry-wide fundraising dynamics, we raised $30 billion of capital in 2022, a 47% increase over the prior year. Global private equity fundraising declined 19% in 2022. But we believe we gained share as LPs continue to consolidate their GP relationships, among their best performing managers, including TPG. We held early first closes across all our flagship funds in the market including TPG Capital, Healthcare Partners, Capital Asia and Rise. Although this is one of the most challenging fundraising environments we have seen, we are very pleased with the quality of engagement and continued support from both our longstanding and new limited partners. However, as we look ahead, we are not immune to the fundraising challenges our industry is facing, which will continue to drive uncertainty as campaigns are completed among alternative asset managers. As a result of our fundraising momentum in 2022, we finished the year with $43 billion of dry powder, which is up 51% from the prior year and represents 55% of our fee earning AUM. Total AUM was $135 billion at year end, a 19% increase year-over-year, driven by strong fund raising and value creation of 8% across our platforms, partially offset by $16 billion of realizations as we selectively monetize investments at attractive valuations. Looking to our financial results, we delivered strong performance in 2022. Fee-related revenues for the full year were $1.1 billion and grew 24% from the pro forma prior year. Full year FRE of $450 million grew 39% from pro forma 2021 and represents a 42% FRE margin. We believe our strong results through such a volatile year demonstrate the durability of our franchise. During our IPO, we highlighted the importance of organic growth and innovation as a cornerstone of TPG's long-term success. Over the past year, we have expanded into new strategies, where we believe we have differentiated angles and compelling growth opportunities.  Within our Market Solutions platform, we launched and completed first closes for two GP-led secondary funds. TPG GP Solutions and TPG New West. As I alluded to on our last earnings call, in December, we closed a $500 million anchor commitment to the inaugural TPG Next Fund from CalPERS, one of the world's leading institutional investors. As a reminder, TPG Next was created to seed and state the next generation of diverse-led firms in alternative asset management. We believe there is a significant market opportunity and are committed to backing and supporting underrepresented managers in our industry.  As a result of fundraising and new products, we have continued to grow and diversify our LP base. In 2022, we added approximately 60 new institutional relationships and more than 55 existing LPs have broadened their commitments to TPG by investing in new fund strategies with us. In aggregate, these new and expanded relationships committed more than $6 billion of capital to TPG in 2022. In addition, we have made meaningful progress in strategically expanding our presence of a high-net-worth channel placing five different funds across eight different channel partners. Looking ahead to the rest of 2023 and beyond, the markets are at a crossroads. Fed action has pushed yields higher and equity multiples lower, driving investors to exercise caution as they see equilibrium in valuations. Despite some recent recovery in the equity and leverage finance markets, investment pace among alternative asset managers including TPG has remained muted. Buyers and sellers seem to be taking another pause, as they wait to see how a number of macro drivers play out, such as interest rates, inflation and a possible recession. With significant dry powder, long-dated capital, and a deep sector focus, we believe TPG is well-positioned to capitalize on this market dislocation. While we expect near-term deployment to remain relatively light, we are building a pipeline of interesting opportunities through our long-term, theme-driven sourcing approach. Despite the general slowdown in deal activity for the industry over the last few quarters, we still saw pockets of opportunity for deployment and realizations across our diverse set of platforms and fund strategies. We deployed $5.7 billion and $16.6 billion in the fourth quarter and full year 2022 respectively. I'll walk through a few highlights. In the fourth quarter, we completed five healthcare deals across our capital platform, reinforcing the strength of our differentiated franchise. This includes the acquisitions of DOC Generici in Europe and iNova Pharmaceuticals in Asia Pacific, ao take private of Covetrus's to carve out of claims extend and a follow on investment in Monogram Health. In our growth fund, we completed the carve out of MedQuest Associates, a leading owner, operator and manager of diagnostic imaging facilities in partnership with Novant Health, a preeminent not for profit health system. This deal is a great example TPG's long history of building unique partnerships with high-quality companies, non-profits and academic institutions to create proprietary transactions. Given the capital constraints in today's market, we are seeing a growing interest in creative partnership opportunities, and our pipeline is continuing to build. The market dislocation has also been particularly interesting for our tech adjacencies fund, which we established to provide flexible capital solutions for leading companies in the technology industry.  We believe the recent tech slowdowns has created the most attractive investing environment for TTEC since its launched in 2018. TTEC recently closed two structured investments, one of the leading vertical SaaS and integrated payments company and second a leading provider of cybersecurity solutions. The current challenging backdrop of growth stage technology companies has made the strategic value of TTEC's differentiated capital mandate even more relevant. Our Rise platform is at the forefront of the impact space and our inaugural Rise Climate Fund remains ahead on its pace of deployment. The increasing focus on energy security and de-globalization along with the Inflationary Reduction Act in the U.S. and the new Net-Zero Industry Act in Europe. Fundamentally enhance the investment opportunity. We are seeing an increased demand for capital to address energy transition and climate needs around the world. As an example, in December, TPG Rise Climate committed to invest in Enpal, one of the largest in fastest growing residential decarbonization platforms in Europe. To give you a sense of its momentum, Enpal has grown its customer base and revenues on average 3x each year since its founding in 2017 and is profitable. And finally, in our secondaries platform, our inaugural TPG GP Solutions Fund completed its second investment during the quarter. And in Asia, TPG NuQuest closed the creation of unique continuation vehicle for a leading Singapore based alternative asset manager. We believe our secondaries business is well positioned for growth. GP's net capital is an increasingly valuable source of liquidity and validation, given the slowdown of PE exits particularly for high-quality sponsors on high-quality assets and sponsors portfolios. On realizations, we have been intentionally patient and remain focused on driving growth within our portfolios, where we are relatively early in our average hold period, following our significant monetization activity over the last few years. We realized $4.2 billion and $15.5 billion in the fourth quarter and full year 2022 respectively release. This includes completing our previously announced sale of Wind River to Aptiv in December, which Jack will talk more about. Several monetizations of our public equity positions in regions outside of the U.S. Looking at our capital Asia and growth funds, successfully IPO and partially monetized four of our Indian portfolio companies in a 12-month period. Landmark cars, Five Star Business Finance, Campus Activewear and Nykaa. In November, we fully monetized our stake in Nykaa at attractive prices generating favorable returns despite the volatile equity market backdrop. These IPOs and realizations underscore TPG's leading franchise in India and the broader APAC region, as well as our equity capital markets execution capabilities. This last week, Nextracker, which is in our Rise portfolio, completed its $734 million IPO, the largest and one of the first U.S. IPOs this year. Nextracker is a leading provider of solar tracking solutions that highlights the benefit of our team-based investing. The IPO execution offering was highly successful with the order book well oversubscribed and the stock trading up 27% on its first day. In real estate during the quarter, we sold a portfolio of Student Housing Properties. And last month, we made a sizable realization in one of our U.S. life sciences and innovation focused platforms, a sector that continues to experience strong tailwinds. Given our purposeful portfolio within durable sectors and themes, we have been able to selectively monetize investments, despite a material slowdown in many parts of the real estate market. Looking forward to 2023, we remain focused on the same growth and diversification objectives we discussed with you previously. Our priorities continue to be: One, completing our flagship and other fundraising campaigns.  Two, continuing our strong track record of organic growth. We have always been innovators and we intend to expand into adjacent strategies, where we believe we have unique competitive advantages such as building climate infrastructure and real estate credit and continuing to scale our GP-led secondaries ever. Three, inorganic growth remains an important priority for TPG. We already track and scale today, but we see significant wide space in areas that are natural extensions for us to drive growth in diversification. For example, we remain actively focused on expanding into corporate credit and continue to evaluate a range of opportunities in this space. Before I conclude my remarks, I want to mention our Global Partner Meeting, which we hosted earlier this week in San Francisco. We covered a range of important topics including investment strategy, fundraising, culture and growth drivers for the firm. Our partners are laser-focused on continuing to deliver excellent performance for our investors, while also building and growing a market-leading innovative franchise. I'll now turn the call over to Jack to take you through our financial results. In terms of stuff down on TPG just to remind people in Q4, because we activated TPG 9 and Healthcare Partners 2 in Q3. The, the fees charged on TPG 8, Healthcare Partners, sorry TPG 8 and Healthcare Partners 1 step down in Q4, that stepped down was about 2 billion in TPG 8. And it was about 500 million in healthcare partners. And then on your other question I think on a general fundraising outlook. Look, obviously as I mentioned, we feel very good about the progress we made in 2022. We feel like we gain market share, raising $30 billion in the complicated backdrop. And also capitalizing new businesses as I mentioned. I also talked about on the last call the fact that we expected fundraising conditions to remain challenging throughout 2023 and we continue to believe that will be the case. That the same liquidity factors are impacting certain segments of the LP base, but not all segments, primarily the more mature parts of the market, while other parts of the market are growing nicely. The fundraising market remains quite crowded with GPs. Against this backdrop, we do expect to continue to gain share this year and it has been helpful that as we entered 2023 LPs can now access the 2023 budgets and across all the flagship funds, we have in the market TPG Capital 9, Healthcare Partners 2, Asia 8 and Rise 3. We have very strong engagement with LPs. Given the time it takes for LPs to complete their diligence, most of that capital is lining up for Q2 and Q3. So I'd expect Q1 to be relatively light, with an acceleration in Q2 and Q3. It's too early to tell, if we will hit all of our targets, but we feel very good about the progress we are making across all those funds. Sure. Ken, thanks for the question. I think in a nutshell, across the board and particularly in the areas that we have been focused on, which are areas that are generally experiencing secular growth, we have seen steady and strong results. I think Jack took you through some of the numbers, and there really hasn't been a particular change or inflection this quarter. But we felt good about the company's performance both in the revenue side and on the EBITDA side. On the realization front, we continue to have a number of areas that we are exploring sales and alike. We did sell Neogene to AstraZeneca in January. So there is still activity. I'd say, it's a general matter, the skew of the neighborhoods that we are investing in the companies that we are backing and the growth orientation in our investment strategy, does lend itself to strategic takeouts probably a little bit more than the industry averages, and that market will remain active even in different environments. Having said that, our realization pace has been quite strong. In recent years, we have seen the overall industry slowdown a bit on realization front. So there is continuing to be opportunities for liquidity. We continue to see them. Probably not the pace of the last two years. Thanks for the question. I mean, we talked about this last year, as you might imagine. It's an interesting environment right now, because some of the signals in the market, like some moderating and inflation although the CPI print this week, obviously raises questions on that, but some moderating and inflation rates may be inching back down a little bit. What I was saying before in terms of credit spreads, I mean, we saw, if you go back to '22, right, we saw some dislocation in the market, as inflation spiked, and there was, the overall geopolitical kind of backdrop. And this dynamic of buyers and sellers' kind of not being in the same place, people trying to get their heads around valuations, slow the market considerably. The fourth quarter, the part of the end of the third and fourth quarter, there was definitely kind of a pickup.  And you heard from already from the deal activity, we talked about, that there was a more active environment for deployment as we got toward the end of the year. It feels like because of these other signals, now, it feels like people are maybe there's like a little another, there's another little pause in the market. Because I think people's expectations on price are maybe going back up, I don't know, whether that's well founded or not, but I think they're going back up. So I think it's going to be sort of a dynamic environment in front of us in terms of fuel activity. It is also creating some interesting opportunities for instance, when you look at GP solutions, capital, continuation vehicles, things like that, it's sort of, as sponsors, try to think about how they want to monetize or partially monetize. So we've seen an uptick there. We've seen some interesting things like co-control deals, what we were we'd looked at a couple because people are looking to take some money out. So I think that's sort of the general backdrop. Jim, maybe you can talk about what's going on in climate. The only thing I was going to add is that if you look more broadly across the portfolio, by the franchise. We have others such as TTAD, which I think is really a solution face capital. That's actually, this is a great environment, and then that platform has been very busy. It continues to be quite busy. And then, John mentioned in his comments, the net cost associates carve out from a not for profit and that's, I think indicative of another thing that we're seeing in our pipeline quite a bit, which is the sort of unusual relationships, structured partnerships, our history of being a partner to everyone from Pfizer, Humana, Intel, AT&T, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, I think that serves us very well when it comes to more problem solving capital. And we spend a lot of time developing those relationships to take a little bit longer for the opportunities to play out, but that portion of our pipeline in our core private equity business remains robust. What I meant by the elevated FRE margin in Q4 was largely related to the strong performance on the capital markets fees that I also mentioned on the call, which obviously have a high flow through margin associated with them. So if you normalize that for a more typical quarter, you bring it back down to as I mentioned, something closer to our four year FRE margin in the low-40s. Which is what I would call our kind of our launching pad for continued performance toward them. And we stick with the same target. We've been talking about getting to 45% on a sustainable basis by the end of the year, this year. I don't know if we have an hour on this call. It's a big question, big topic. Look, I think, we're continuing to be focused on it, particularly in this environment where we see valuations moving around a lot. We see, when you look at sort of where the return on opportunities are in a market like this, particularly with dislocation of capital availability, there are some really interesting capital structure types of opportunities, whether they are top of the capital structure, middle of the capital structure. So we continue to believe that, when you think about credit, you think about sort of the total return part of the spectrum there that is very synergistic with our business. You can hear us talk about our business and I'm sure you can glean that, we are very sector and company focused investors. Where we focus, we are deep. We have a lot of industry knowledge, a lot of company knowledge that dovetails very well with that part of the business.  So I think we continue to have a strong interest in that. We have not backed-off what we have said earlier, which is we have an objective of reentering that space and we expect to at some point. Deal making, as you know, as far as inorganic treat deal making is always complicated particularly in these types of business. So we are working on finding exactly the right partners and the right opportunity. There is other parts of the credit landscape that also are really interesting. And I think you have heard us talk about, if you look at what's going on in real estate, there has been a pretty massive dislocation in the financing markets in real estate. And in some respect real estate valuations versus financing costs are upside down relative to where they have historically been. And so we are out in the market right now. I think we had announced on another earnings call, we hired a new head of our real estate credit business, Doug Clark, who came to us from Goldman Sachs, where he was many years. We are out in the market right now, raising an opportunistic real estate pool of capital, and we feel pretty good about it. There is a lot of receptivity around the market from our LPs that we are talking to and particularly given the strength of our real estate franchise, we are sort of -- we're drafting off of that in a lot of respects for this capital raise and we feel pretty good about it. So we are expecting that we will get some money raised there. We think that the opportunity on that side of the coin is probably as good as we have seen it in maybe a couple of decades. So we are focused on it. We are working on it and we will keep you up to date. Yes. Let me appreciate the question. We are getting a couple of questions, since posting our results this morning about the average fee rate. Let me try to clarify that. There is a lot of pieces moving around. It's always calculating an average fee rate based on average F AUM for a quarter. Is a very imprecise thing to do, particularly in a period like this, we are activating new funds and seeing step downs in other funds because we don't charge on a daily average basis. I can tell you first of all, we're not seeing any fee pressure in our business. We're not changing our fee schedules, we're not adding discounts that we didn't have before. That's the most important point.  On the average fee rate calculation, there are couple of particular, couple of things flowing through that as you look at Q3 and Q4 in particular. For example, in Q3, as you know, we activated TPG 9 healthcare partners to in July. So we were actually earning fees for virtually the entire quarter in Q3 on that call it $10 billion. If you run your, I think the way most people calculate a weighted average FAUM for the quarter would be zero plus 10 divided by 2. So you'd assume we're earning fees on 5 billion, we're actually running about 10 billion.  In Q4, we saw the opposite, right? Because the step downs that I just talked about, affected our fees for the full quarter, if you calculated average FAUM for the quarter, you would have picked up a higher number in the beginning a lower number in the end, but we actually had to step down affected the fees for the whole quarter. So that's some of the nuances that you see flowing through. On the shadow FAUM that you asked about. We did add nicely to that during the quarter. If you look at where we raised capital during the quarter. The three biggest areas were our digital media fund, which charges fees on invested capital only, that was 800 million, 350 million for T Ted, which is also fees on DRON capital only. And 500 million for TPG Next, which is a normal fees on committed structure, but we have not yet activated that fund. So all of that would have gone into AUM but not FAUM. And it'll flow in over time.  Predicting when that shadow FAUM will pay fees, and over what time period is really impossible depends upon the pace at which we invest that capital. Sure, we try to address several of those points out. First of all, the appetite continues to be on your last point continues to be quite strong. You guys can look at our performance and make your own assessment, we think we're performing quite strongly in generating returns, and importantly, delivering liquidity to our LPs. I mean, our DPI is quite high relative to our peers at a time when others are not distributing as much capital as we have over the past year or two. So the result of all that is strong appetite across the flagships we have in the market. I think I mentioned last fall, we did expect Q4 to be quite light. Just given how tapped out LPs were as we entered Q4, and we actually were able to raise, as you saw over 3.5 billion of capital across other businesses, most notably the ones I just mentioned, TTAD Digital Media, there's also some co investment in there on growth and capital as we close those deals and brought in our LPs as co investors, that co investment capital, largely does not pay fees, but it's highly strategic to us. As our LPs expect us to deliver that co investment. So that's how I characterize kind of Q4. As we look out to this year, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, we do continue to see strong demand these fundraising always has kind of a natural arc to it. And oftentimes after a large first close, we've had all these funds, you tend to see a bit of a back loading to the remainder of the campaign. And I think that's always true. It's even more true in today's kind of fundraising environment. So as I mentioned, we have a lot of people doing work and doing their diligence, I'd expect Q1 to be relatively light, but a good acceleration into Q2 and Q3. We haven't changed our targets on any of the funds. But it's too early to tell whether we'll hit all those targets or not. And we have been, that number has been growing over time, as John mentioned in his prepared remarks. We still have a lot of untapped potential in the LP base as we continue to grow new products that are more appealing to different segments of the LP market. And as we continue to build out our distribution platform, both the institutional side and the high net worth side, I think the biggest source of potential, we're fairly underweight in Europe. We have a lot of room to grow insurance. We have a lot of room to grow in the high net worth channel, as we've talked about many times will accelerate as we build out more broadly applicable products to that channel. And those are probably the biggest areas I'd call out. But we see a lot of potential and continue to expand our LP base. Hey, Adam. Thanks for the question. Just to kind of go in reverse order. We definitely continue to add resources in that area. We view the capital markets business to be, and I'll take one piece at a time, to be highly strategic for all the reasons we have talked about. We have added probably doubled the size of that group over the past couple of years. We added someone to lead debt capital markets, actually debt and equity capital markets for us in Asia for example, where we didn't have the team over there yet. On the equity capital markets side, that has not been in the fourth quarter, a major generator of fee revenue for us, but was highly helpful in helping lead the IPO of Nextracker, for example, where we brought in one of the key anchor investors in that IPO. So both the debt and equity side are continuing to be very strategic. The other piece of the business you didn't mentioned, I think it maybe within that Solution segment or platform is our CPaaS business, our public equity partners business. And the performance there was quite strong in 2022. So we see good LP, good engagement for investors and expect to expand that capital base this year. And then you mentioned the secondaries business where you saw we made progress in capitalizing those businesses in Q4. We expect to make continued progress this year. Patient is always a form of flattery that I think tells you that, there is substantial interest in the marketplace. Our peers wouldn't be coming in if there weren't a lot of LP demand for this type of activity, which really highlights the value of our leadership position. Over the long arc of private equity, people have always underestimated the amount of market growth that any segments might have. And I think what we are seeing today is very substantial market growth, particularly around certain sectors of the impact landscape. As I said before, there is just a seismic change in what's happening in decarbonization and climate, but across other sectors like online ad, healthcare access, post-COVID, financial inclusion. If you thought of a landscape of sectors you might want to be involved in, they overlap the impact to investing marketplace very strongly. So we feel good about our position. We feel good about the flow we are seeing and we expect competition and we also expect to continue to grow against it. Our [indiscernible] expenses obviously break down into two primary line items, comp and benefits and OpEx. Comp benefits in Q4 was 102 and change million. And I think that's a reasonable estimate for launching off that. As you know, sometimes what you see in Q4 moves around a bit in his industry, because if you haven't been accruing for bonuses, as you end up paying them, it can cause a change in Q4. In our case, we ended up right on our approval for bonuses. So Q4 is a good reflection of the launching off that for comp and benefits this year. I would expect that we are going to continue to invest in the business. So that should trend up a bit during the course of the year. But a lot of growth has occurred. On the OpEx line, OpEx for the quarter was 66 million roughly and that to reflects all the factors we've talked about full kind of return to office, a full return to a lot of travel, both for deals and for fundraising. That's causing that number to come back up a lot of the public company expenses, we had to account for it. That's all in that number now. So likewise, I think that is roughly a good run right number to think about, as you think about this year. Yes, I mean, just to take you through the qualitative start there. In healthcare, we continue to see strong demand tailwind for procedures, which has really been more of a rebound from the losses of procedures and other healthcare activity more routine health care activity during COVID. In the software, enterprise technology business, I think what we've seen actually is an increase in retention rates, and particularly at certain points last year, we saw a longer sales cycle in terms of new customer conversions. Although I think essentially improved, improved a little bit, but a little bit of a slowdown in this sort of the second derivative in terms of the rate of growth. But this companies are hanging in there very well.  In our other technology, which we call internet digital media, the remains a persistent demand for content and streaming. And a particular rebound in live events, and domestic touring that sort of pre pandemic levels. And we were exposed to that in a number of our companies, certainly including CAA, among others. There has been a slowdown in ad sales. On the consumer side it's really a tale two different sort of groups on the high end. We've seen very strong demand in the consumer and increasing elsewhere. On the lower end, where we have, candidly less portfolio exposure. We've seen more of a more of an issue from inflation and a pullback in demand. Again, that's it's been a little less exposed for us. I think we've talked a bit about rise and climate, so that probably gives you a sense of it for those sectors. That's how we think about the world from a sector perspective. From an EBITDA standpoint, strong growth, they're certainly continues to feel, there has been particularly to the fourth through 2022 in the fourth quarter, some pressure from wage inflation. Our companies are important companies that have important relationships with customers. So most of the raw material price increases we've been able to pass through, but there certainly a lot of focus around wage inflation, and that's subsided a bit. But that was sort of the primary cost side of that, that flowed through in 2022. But overall margins are stable."

            "name": "Jack Weingart",
            "content": "Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Our fourth quarter results once again reflect the resiliency of our FRE centric business model. We finished 2022 with total assets under management of $135 billion, up 19% from the prior year. The key drivers of this increase include $30 billion of new capital raise and almost $7 billion of value creation across our portfolios, partially offset by $16 billion of realizations. Fee-earning AUM increased over the year from $60 billion to $78 billion at the end of 2022, up 30%. At the end of the year, we had $13 billion of AUM subject to fee earning growth, of which 78% was not yet earning fees. We continue to reach record levels in our financial performance. Total fee-related revenue was $307 million for the fourth quarter, up 29% year-over-year. Fourth quarter management fees were essentially flat, compared to the third quarter due to a one-time step down in fee-earning AUM following the activation of the newest vintage funds for capital and healthcare partners. Similarly, the recent step down of our Capital Asia Fund will impact our fee-related revenues in the first quarter of this year. Transaction fees were particularly strong in the fourth quarter, due to our capital markets business, which continues to be an important differentiator for our investment business. During the quarter, our in-house debt capital markets team had a -- role in raising a total of $5 billion of total debt financing in connection with several of the recent investments that John discussed. For the full year 2022, we reported fee related revenues of $1.1 billion, a 24% increase from pro forma 2021. FRE grew 39% from pro forma 2021 to $454 million for full year 2022, driven by a combination of strong management fee growth of 29% and disciplined cost control, which resulted in an FRE margin for the year of 42%. Our margin expansion of more than 400 basis points from pro forma 2021, demonstrates the scalability of our platform and the ongoing benefits of operating leverage. For the fourth quarter, we reported FRE of $139 million, up 53% from the pro forma year ago quarter and an FRE margin of 45%. We believe this margin was somewhat elevated in the fourth quarter and our full year 2022 FRE margin of 42% better reflects our progress toward our near-term target of 45%. After tax distributable earnings for the fourth quarter of 2022 were $227 million, a 65% increase year-over-year. This includes a $95 million contribution from net realized performance allocations in the quarter, primarily attributable to the closing of the Wind River transaction. This was an outstanding investment, generating substantial profits for the firm and our fund investors. Through TPG's ownership and operational expertise, we helped accelerate Wind River's revenue and EBITDA growth, which was flat at the time of our acquisition in 2018. To double-digit levels at the time of our exit. We're very pleased with the outcome of this deal, which furthers TPG's successful history of corporate carve outs and highlights our thematic focus on digital transformation enablers. Following the closing of the Wind River sale, our crude performance allocation balance decreased from $725 million at the end of the third quarter to $643 million at year end, as $95 million in realized gains were partially offset by $12 million of value creation. On the topic of value creation against a difficult operating environment, we continue to see the benefits of our thematic portfolio construction. We invest in companies that have strong secular growth characteristics in sectors where we have deep expertise, and our portfolio delivered value equation of 1% in the quarter and 8% in 2022.  In our private equity businesses within each platform, average portfolio company revenue growth range from 25% to 40% in 2022 compared to 2021. And performance continues to be robust with particular strength and health care, climate and high-end consumer sectors. In connection with our fourth quarter results, as Gary mentioned, we announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per share Class A common stock represent 85% of TPG's after tax distributable earnings. This is the highest quarterly dividend we've declared since IPO. In our first full year as a public company, we will have distributed dividends totaling $1.59 per share of Class A common stock. I would note that in connection with our annual compensation process in January, we granted 3.7 million restricted stock units to our employees. These years will invest over three years. And I would refer you to Slide 28 of our earnings presentation for a comprehensive summary of our equity-based compensation. Looking at our non-GAAP balance sheet for TPG operating group as of December 31st, we remain well capitalized, with $692 million of cash and 450 million of long-term debt. Our $700 million revolver was also undrawn at year end, giving us ample flexibility to pursue strategic growth initiatives. Now turning to fundraising, we raised 3.6 billion of capital in the fourth quarter, primarily focused on new strategies such as TPG Next, and certain areas of our growth platform notably TPG digital media, and T Ted. This brought total capital raised to $30 billion in 2022, a 47% increase compared to the prior year. This was a major accomplishment given the fundraising backdrop and reflects TPG increasing market share due to the breadth and depth of our relationships, the strength of our brand and most importantly our strong investment performance across our platforms.  As we look forward to 2023 our fundraising objectives are as follows. Number one, successfully complete the campaigns for our flagship capital, healthcare partners, Asia and rise funds, which we expect to extend through the remainder of this year given ongoing challenges in the fundraising market.  Number 2, make further progress on capitalizing our new businesses including our secondary's platform TPG Next and life sciences.  Number 3, begin fundraising for our next flagship growth fund, which we expect to launch in the middle of this year based on current deployment pace. And 4 continue our organic growth through the launch of new products. Specifically, we're in discussions with potential LPs for inaugural funds for our private real estate credit effort checkout and for Rise Climate infrastructure. To close out, we're proud of the results that TPG has achieved in his first year as a public company. TPG's FRE growth engine proved to be resilient in 2022 despite challenging market conditions. We're confident in our firm's ability to navigate through dislocation, while continuing to grow our fee generating assets. We look forward to continuing to provide differentiated long-term value to our public shareholders, limited partners and portfolio companies. I'll now turn the call back over to Shelby to take questions. Ken, the only thing I would add to that is that, we are seeing some improvements in the kind of macro and underlying kind of financial markets, as it relates to deal activity that may help from the perspective of realization. So for instance, financing, there has been a reasonably -- there has been a reasonable recovery, not full recovery by any means. But there has been a reasonable recovery when you look at what credit spreads are looking like, and the loan markets feel a little bit better to us in terms of sourcing, financing. And then also I think you have heard us go through some of our activity with respect to public markets on the IPO side, leading up to our most recent, which was Nextracker. And it definitely feels like there is some pent-up demand from the public markets as well, because it's been void of IPO supply for quite a long time. So there are -- the portfolio is performing well. I think we -- I think there is a broad range of sort of when things are ready to be monetized and we have reinforced that in the past that we are going to monetize, when we feel like, it's an optimal time to monetize. But there are some -- relative to last year, maybe some few green shoots here or there in terms of the market backdrop. Obviously, momentum on climate was good going into last year. And I would have to say that last year was a seismic change to the positive. Obviously, the political activities and IRA bill in the U.S. change the landscape and accelerate the landscape dramatically. But the events in the Ukraine and the resulting questions of energy security around the world, also substantially increased activity. In the comments, you heard about our investment in NPL growing 300% a year if you can imagine a German consumer rooftop solar in this environment would be a much more interesting energy security question for them, given the changes, and we're seeing that type of thing happening across markets. So activity levels have picked up, there will be a time for them to feather in, because, for example, in the IRA, it's out there, people know it's coming, but it hasn't been fully enacted yet. We're expecting that to happen over the next few months. But generally, the backdrop and interest in climate investing has moved substantially to the positive. I think the LPs, I can look up more precise number, for every LPs across all of our businesses are in the academy called call it 500 to 600 category. Although I think that may not be a bigger number, let me come back to you on that. What was second part of your question? I did several trips to Europe last year for fundraising most recently fourth quarter. And we have a number of really strong dialogues majority, there's 25 meetings we've had with new folks that we're getting to know, but it feels like there's a lot of untapped potential that we're just starting to make some progress on."

We also declared a dividend of $0.26 per common share of Class A common stock, which will be paid on December 2 to holders of record as of November 21. I'd now like to turn the call over to Jon Winkelried, Chief Executive Officer.\nJon Winkelried: Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. We're excited to share our strong third quarter results today. For the quarter, we generated strong sequential growth in fee-earning AUM, fee-related earnings and value creation across our portfolio. Jack and I will take you into further detail for the quarter. But before we do that, I'd like to share some thoughts this morning on the market we're operating in and our position as a firm. Investors have heard a lot during this earnings season about the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. It's a complex time in the markets generally. However, periods of market dislocation like this create opportunities, so I'd like to focus on what this means for TPG. We've been preparing our business for this type of environment for some time. Investors can see this in our results, including the substantial realization cycle we began several years ago, our record dry powder and the innovative investment strategies we have developed. Despite a challenging market backdrop, our current portfolio, which has been built around our core thematic areas, continues to perform well. Our prudent use of leverage to support the growth orientation of these companies has made our portfolio less sensitive to the effects of rapid interest rate increases. And while we are not immune to inflationary pressures in labor costs, we manage a portfolio which has been constructed by targeting businesses with high intellectual property and strong secular growth in sectors such as health care, technology and climate. We are disciplined, patient investors and careful stewards of the long-dated capital we manage. We focus on investing in leading businesses at attractive valuations and finding creative solutions for companies in need of capital. We have a long and successful history of stepping forward in complicated moments like this to drive returns, and we believe we are set up to do so in this environment. There is a significant opportunity in our pipeline, and we believe TPG is well positioned to continue to execute. There are a few points I'd like to highlight in our results. Our financial performance in the third quarter reflects the durability and strength of our FRE-centric business model. TPG generated significant quarter-over-quarter growth in management fees, operating margins and FRE. This is a direct result of the stable growth of our fee earning assets under management as we continue to scale our business. Our third quarter fee-related revenues of $282 million grew 10% sequentially. Fee-related revenues for the last 12 months exceeded $1 billion for the first time in TPG's history. And approximately 90% of these revenues were from stable and growing management fees. FRE in the third quarter of $121 million grew 19% compared to the second quarter. Our total AUM was $135 billion at quarter end, which increased 24% year-over-year. This step-up was driven by strong fundraising activity across our business, including our first closing in the quarter for TPG's flagship Capital Asia Fund and the completion of the first closes for several other flagship funds, including TPG Capital Partners, Healthcare Partners and Rise. In aggregate, we raised more than $8 billion during the third quarter and $29 billion over the last 12 months. We're very pleased with the success of our ongoing campaigns, particularly amid the well-discussed headwinds GPs are facing in the fundraising market. Given the success of our ongoing fundraising campaigns, we had a record $46 billion of capital available for investment at the end of the third quarter. This is up 18% sequentially and represents 57% of our fee-generating AUM. We believe our fundraising progress and record dry powder leaves us well positioned to play offense and drive returns. Over the last few years, we capitalized on the attractive valuation environment and aggressively sold assets. We have deliberately moderated our pace of realizations, given the market dislocation. And we've been positioning our portfolio companies for continued growth, generating value creation of 2% for the quarter and 13% for the last 12 months. This strong relative performance reflects the high-quality, resilient portfolio we have constructed around our long-term sector-based themes. We've been anticipating a downturn for some time and have been consistently building multiple compression into our financial models. Our focus has been on investing in industries with durable secular trends that can continue to drive growth through the cycles. Although our investment pace slowed in the third quarter, consistent with the broader market activity, we're seeing increasingly interesting opportunities to invest in high-quality companies. We're currently in an adjustment period where sellers' valuation expectations are resetting lower, and transaction levels may remain softer for a while longer. We will continue to be patient and highly selective. We are starting to see valuation expectations begin to align, and we believe we're in a strong position to deploy capital given our significant pool of dry powder. With that in mind, I'll highlight some recent investments we've made across our business, starting with the health care sector, where we are one of the world's largest and most active private equity investors. Shortly after the third quarter, we completed several health care investments with a combined enterprise value of more than $9 billion, with TPG investing approximately $3.5 billion of equity. Notably, our in-house capital markets team had a lead arranger role in raising all $5 billion of the debt for these transactions at attractive terms in a difficult financing environment. We believe our capital markets capabilities continue to provide us with a significant competitive advantage and enable us to access financing even during periods of extreme volatility when banks are largely sitting on the sidelines. Leveraging our carve-out expertise, our capital funds acquired ClaimsXten, which is a leading claims editing software platform that was divested from the merger of United and Change Healthcare. We also completed the take private of Covetrus, a leading animal health distribution and technology platform and the acquisition of DOC Generici, an Italian specialty pharmaceuticals company. Our Capital Asia Fund just completed the acquisition of iNova Pharmaceuticals, a leading independent consumer health care company in the Asia Pacific region. iNova is the inaugural investment from TPG Capital Asia VIII and highlights the strength of our Pan-Asian platform, with the transaction representing a cross-border underwrite across our Australia and Southeast Asia teams. We're seeing significant momentum and opportunities across other parts of our business, including our impact and growth platforms where we have built and scaled several innovative funds. In climate, the combination of the recent Inflation Reduction Act, energy prices and growing concerns around energy security have substantially increased investment into the sector. Since its inception just over a year ago, our Rise Climate Fund has already deployed $2.2 billion and currently has a robust pipeline. During the quarter, Rise Climate invested in Monolith Materials, which is a global leader in clean hydrogen and carbon black. And just after the quarter end, Rise announced a follow-on investment in Form Energy, which is developing and commercializing next-generation battery technology. Second, I want to highlight our tech adjacencies fund, which we created to provide bespoke solutions for the tech marketplace. With IPO expectations delayed and prices resetting meaningfully, we are seeing significant opportunities to deploy the $2.6 billion of new capital we have already closed on for this fund. We have a couple of significant transactions that we hope to be closing shortly. I'd like to also touch on real estate. Rising financing costs as a result of government interest rate policy are leading to valuation adjustments and market dislocation. And as a result, deployment has moderated considerably. However, our fourth opportunistic fund just closed on $6.8 billion of new capital, over 80% larger than our prior fund. So we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities as markets adjust. Furthermore, our team's focus on select themes, primarily driven by long-term secular demand drivers, has resulted in less than 5% of the total remaining invested equity across all of our vehicles to be invested in the office and retail sectors, both of which are also experiencing considerable headwinds. Despite the challenging backdrop over the last 6 weeks, we've been able to monetize several real estate investments in the U.S. and Europe at attractive prices. Before I hand the call over to Jack, there are two additional items I'd like to highlight regarding the broader TPG ecosystem. First, we were pleased to announce that TPG Rise was recently named to Fortune's 2022 Change the World list. This annual list acknowledges companies that have had a positive social impact through activities that are part of their core business strategy. We're proud to be included alongside a number of inspiring companies such as PayPal, Walmart, NVIDIA, GoFundMe and DeepMind. Importantly, we are the first global private equity firm ever to be recognized for this prestigious honor. Second, we recently hosted our capital -- our annual meeting for our capital funds. This was our first in-person conference with our capital limited partners since 2019, many of whom are invested in multiple strategies across the firm. We shared our most compelling investment teams, reviewed the status of our portfolio and highlighted the deep venture talent across our capital platform. We also had senior team members in attendance from all of our other product areas and had an opportunity to engage with our LPs on those strategies as well. We're proud of the trust they placed in us and look forward to our continued partnership. I'd now like to hand the call over to Jack, so he can take you through our financial results.\nJack Weingart: Thanks, Jon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for the call this morning. The firm's third quarter financial results demonstrate the strength and resilience of our business. We continue to make good progress through our significant fundraising cycle driving a sequential increase in fee-earning AUM, management fees and fee-related earnings. And our investment performance continues to demonstrate strength in the face of these volatile markets, driving an increase in net accrued performance allocations. Now I'll walk through each of these metrics in a bit more detail. Our total AUM increased from $127 billion to $135 billion during the quarter, an increase of 7% for the quarter and 24% compared to $109 billion at the end of the third quarter of '21. The key drivers of this year-over-year increase were $29 billion of capital raised combined with $15 billion of value creation from our underlying fund investments, partially offset by $18 billion of realizations. Fee-earning AUM increased from $67 billion to $81 billion during the quarter, an increase of 21% for the quarter and 37% compared to $59 billion at the end of the third quarter of '21. This 37% increase year-over-year was driven primarily by the raising of nearly $24 billion in fee-earning capital across our platforms, including the activation of new flagship funds for capital, health care partners, Asia, real estate partners and Rise. At September 30, 89% of our AUM and 90% of our fee-earning AUM was in either perpetual or long-dated funds with a duration at inception of 10 years or longer. In addition, 84% of our fee-earning AUM had a remaining duration of 5 or more years at the end of the quarter. And we had nearly $11 billion of AUM subject to fee earning growth, 60% of which was not yet earning fees at the end of the quarter. Our strong organic growth in fee-earning AUM has driven an increase in management fees, which were up 23% year-over-year to $255 million in the third quarter. Total fee-related revenue increased at a slower pace of 7% year-over-year to $282 million due to a reduction in transaction fee revenue from last year's third quarter. However, as Jon mentioned, we closed several new investments last month in which our debt capital markets team played a major role. So we expect transaction fees to increase in the fourth quarter. Our FRE grew 19% compared to the second quarter, led by management fee revenue growth of 14% along with continued expansion of our FRE margin, which increased 300 basis points sequentially to 43% for the third quarter. As we have indicated previously, we expect our FRE margins to continue to expand as we benefit from ongoing scale on operating leverage, with an FRE margin target of 45% by the end of next year. And we're tracking ahead of plan relative to that target. Our after-tax distributable earnings for the third quarter were $113 million, which reflects the slowdown in year-over-year realization activity that we discussed on last quarter's call. As Jon mentioned, we have moderated our pace of monetizations as we focus on driving growth and value creation in our relatively young portfolio. Importantly, the combination of our lower monetization pace and our strong value creation drove a 7% increase in net accrued performance allocations during the quarter. In connection with our third quarter results, we announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per share of Class A common stock, representing 85% of TPG's after-tax distributable earnings, substantially all of which is driven by FRE. We will have distributed $1.09 in cash per share of Class A common stock with respect to the first 3 quarters of the year. Despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, the fundamental performance of our portfolio companies remain strong, generally with above-market revenue and EBITDA growth. We believe this growth is a result of our hands-on approach and thematic sector-based investing in areas with compelling secular growth trends. This strong performance drove a 2% increase in value creation in the quarter and a 13% increase over the last 12 months. Turning to the non-GAAP balance sheet for the TPG Operating Group as of September 30. We are well capitalized with $572 million of cash and $450 million of long-term debt. During the third quarter, we upsized our undrawn credit facility from $300 million to $700 million to provide us with additional financial flexibility. We also had a net accrued performance allocation balance, as I alluded to, which represents 20% -- the 20% allocation to TPG Operating Group of $725 million. The increase from $677 million at the end of the second quarter is primarily driven by $53 million of unrealized value creation. A notable component of our net accrued performance allocation balance at September 30 is related to the sale of Wind River, which we have discussed on previous calls. This transaction remains under regulatory review, and we are still targeting to close by the end of the year. I'd also like to note that as of September 30, $122 billion or 90% of our AUM was eligible for performance allocations. Now moving on to fundraising. We raised more than $8 billion of capital during the third quarter and $29 billion over the last 12 months. And I'd like to provide you with some more detail on our various campaigns. On our capital platform, we were targeting a first close for our flagship Asia fund in the third quarter. And we completed this as planned, raising $3.4 billion, which takes us more than halfway toward our $6 billion target. We also raised an incremental $2.6 billion for our flagship TPG Capital and Healthcare Partners funds. This brings the combined total to $10.6 billion out of an $18.5 billion combined target. On our Impact platform, we closed on an incremental $600 million for our Rise Fund during Q3, bringing the total raise to $1.9 billion against a target of $3 billion. On our real estate platform, we reached the hard cap for our fourth opportunistic fund as expected, completing the fundraising with total capital commitments of $6.8 billion, which is 83% larger than the predecessor fund. Lastly, we raised approximately $1 billion for our Market Solutions platform, including important first closes for our 2 funds focused on GP-led secondaries: NewQuest in Asia and TGS in North America and Europe. Going forward, we're focused on 3 areas of fundraising: number one, completing the active campaigns I just mentioned; number two, launching our next growth fund, which is likely to take place by mid next year; and number three, exploring several additional organic growth opportunities. For the industry, we do expect fourth quarter fundraising to be limited as many LPs have fully allocated their budgets for the year. We have a strong backlog of LP interest in our funds and expect to complete our active campaigns successfully next year as our client access their 2023 budgets. Before we open the call to take your questions, there's one additional item I'd like to cover. As we were planning and executing our successful IPO earlier this year, one of our primary actives was to bring TPG public at a time when we were experiencing significant growth that we could share with public investors. Another fundamental objective was to create a publicly traded security with sufficient liquidity that could be owned by a broad base of shareholders. To that end, I'm pleased to announce that our Board took steps last week to modify our Class A common stock voting power. We believe this will become effective before the end of the year and will enable TPG to qualify for inclusion in the large Russell family of indices when they rebalance next spring. We're proud of our strong third quarter results and the momentum we're generating across our business. We believe our investment portfolios are performing well amid the evolving market backdrop, and we're working closely with our portfolio companies to build long-term value. In addition, we continue to expect strong growth in fee-generating assets under management and fee-related earnings as a result of our ongoing broad-based fundraising campaigns. With that, I'd now like to turn the call back over to the operator, so we can take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America.\nCraig Siegenthaler: So I think the biggest conversation point with investors today is portfolio valuations, especially given your sector positioning with heavy overweights in software and business services. And for example, I think some of us like to look at the public markets and the software. The iShare software ETF is down about 40% year-to-date versus TPG's positive 10% mark in the capital business. So my question is, how are the underlying EBITDA and revenue growth trends through September 30 across both the capital and growth portfolios? And also, has TPG been adjusting valuation multiples, given the higher discount rate backdrop combined with lower valuation exhibited in the public markets?\nJon Winkelried: Yes, Craig, we're going to have -- Todd, I think, is going to drill down for you in that area. So why don't you go ahead?\nJack Weingart: Before Todd goes to the operating performance, Craig, I'll address the second part of your question. We absolutely look at multiples every quarter along with lots of other data, and we have been bringing multiples down. Todd will give you a sense for the operating performance [indiscernible].\nTodd Sisitsky: Craig, thanks for the question. Overall, the portfolio really continues to perform quite well, and we're experiencing strong underlying growth. Just looking at the third quarter, for example, in the TPG Capital U.S. and Europe business and the TPG Capital Agent business, which just tends to be our more mature, larger check businesses, in the U.S. business, third quarter year over prior third quarter year results, revenue was up in the high 30s. Now that was impacted by the fact that COVID had a -- is a rebound effect from the third quarter 2021 COVID effect, but still very strong growth. The Asia business over that same time frame in active funds was up 22%, 24%, depending on which fund, so good, steady result. And I think that this is, as Jon was sharing, this is the result of having invested in teams and sectors that are tied to secular growth, particularly over the last [indiscernible] time that we were anticipating a downturn. And makes a big difference between the right neighborhoods. Looking forward, because we spend a lot of time on these portfolio companies, not just looking at historical results, but some of the forward indicators, what we're seeing is health care for the most part continued to rebound in volumes post COVID. Software enterprise technology, decision cycles are taking a bit longer there, so it's a little harder to get large deals over the finish line. Growth continues, but it takes a little longer. It actually provides an advantage for incumbents, but a little more challenging, a little slower for the attackers. Climate has strong growth trends driven by the IRA energy prices, growing concerns about energy security, Internet digital media, persistent demand for content, a little softness in ad sales beginning into this year. Consumer has been a little bit divided with strong resilience at the higher end, a little more pressure on the lower-end consumer. So we're watching all this real time, but for the most part, we're very well positioned relative to spaces we're in and the neighborhoods we've invested behind.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.\nAlexander Blostein: Can you guys hear me? Hello?\nJon Winkelried: Yes.\nAlexander Blostein: All right. Perfect. Sorry, I was on mute, I guess, before. So I wanted to start with, I guess, just the conversation around the fundraising backdrop. Obviously, we've spoken, I feel like since January of this year about the difficulties that the private equity industry [indiscernible] when it comes to fundraising. You guys seem to be on track with your larger flagships, but curious if you could help us sort of level set on how you think 2023 is likely to evolve. Again, the cumulative dollars sound the same, but maybe just give us a sense of the timing of kind of how you think that's going to sprinkle across the year. And also, you alluded to several new organic growth opportunities as you look out into 2023. I was wondering if you could expand on what those are.\nJack Weingart: Sure. Thanks, Alex. Look, I think we started talking about this in the first quarter. And since then, it's become a pretty topical issue for the industry. And things were playing out about as we would have expected. I mean, LPs remain in certain regions of the world overallocated for all the reasons we talked about. A lot of GPs are extending fundraising campaigns into next year. We've been planning to do that the whole time as we've been talking about. And so I think next year will remain challenging throughout most of the year for all the same reasons. There was an element of GPs kind of pre-launching fundraising campaigns coming into this year who didn't necessarily need the capital yet, and that kind of opportunistic fundraising launch will not happen next year. So you'll see -- I think you'll see a bit of an abatement in the number of GPs in the market as next year unfolds. But I think next year will remain crowded. As you point out, we remain really on track. We're very pleased with the $26 billion we've raised year-to-date. It's tracking ahead of what we would have told you at the IPO was our expectation for the year as about a 50% increase relative to the same 3-month period the prior year in a market where aggregate fundraising by the industry is down about 20%. So what you often see in times of dislocation like this, is, yes, lower overall fundraising volumes and market share shifts to stronger players. Transaction volumes slow down for a period of time as we're seeing, but the new investment opportunities get much more interesting. So we feel good about our positioning with that backdrop. As it relates to our flagship funds, as we've been saying, we are going to keep them open through the middle of next year. I think the fourth quarter of this year, as I mentioned in my comments, will be particularly light for the whole industry because most LPs are done allocating capital for the year. So I think you'll see a slowdown in the fourth quarter and then kind of a consistent raising of capital by the stronger players during the course of the year next year.\nJon Winkelried: Yes. I think just -- Alex, just to add to Jack's comment, I think the -- in terms of the fundraising environment, I think it's just important to highlight again that the larger managers that have been performing well, I think, are getting positively selected in the market. And remember also that we were very disciplined about returning a lot of capital over the course of the last couple of years. And that's -- I think that's putting us in a good place in terms of many LPs being able to recycle capital back to us. So I think we feel good about our relative position in the market from that perspective. On the organic growth side, I think you'll remember from when we were going around and doing the IPO, we talked a lot about how we've grown the firm over time and our success in innovating and developing new strategies. And that we had raised quite a bit of capital over the last few years related to step-out strategies or new or identifying new sectors or themes in the market that allowed us to build strategies around those. And I think we feel like -- and that's something we talked about continuing to be focused on as a firm, and we are. And I would -- I guess I would point out 4 areas where -- and these are not the only things that we're focused on, but there's 4 areas that I think we feel where we're going to be focused on trying to continue to grow. One is -- and Jim can talk about this a little bit later in the call. But on the climate side, as you heard in my comments, we've seen a substantial flow of really interesting opportunities there. There's a lot of investment that continues to get focused on the space. And I think we're going to try to expand our platform on the climate side with some other opportunities that we'll have more to say about later, but that's an area where we feel like there's more room for growth. A little while ago, we had announced that we had hired a new partner, [indiscernible], to lead our TPG Next initiative, which is our effort to seed and grow minority managers. And our expectation is that we're going to announce a meaningful lead capital commitment with an LP partner shortly on that. And so I think we're going to be off and running on that strategy very shortly. In GP solutions, Jack talked about important closes with anchor LPs in both TGS as well as NewQuest. I would say that given the environment that we're in and what's happening in the secondary market, particularly as it relates to GP capital, we're laser-focused on continuing to grow that. We think it's a very large opportunity. And it's the one -- GP solutions capital is the one area in our market where we see it being undercapitalized. And then lastly, in our leveraging off the strength of our real estate franchise, we are in the process of beginning to raise some capital around the real estate credit opportunity that we see in the market. As you know, we have a publicly traded REIT. We recently hired Doug Bouquard as a partner to lead our real estate credit opportunities. He came from Goldman Sachs. And we -- what was probably a year ago an underwhelming opportunity is now, I think, a pretty compelling opportunity as a result of what's happened with the term structure and rates and what's happening in the real estate market broadly. So we're in the market right now talking to some LP partners about forming capital around that.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.\nKen Worthington: We're just ticking off the boxes here. Carry outlook. So clearly, you mentioned that we can see the challenging markets. You mentioned, and we knew this before, the front-end loading of realization in a number of your portfolios. Can you help us better frame the outlook for realization in carry generation for 2023? So obviously, this is very market dependent, but you have insights into your portfolios in terms of what is seasoning and what is not. I was hoping to just get a better view on the magnitude of a slowdown that we should expect for next year, given all the factors that you had sort of discussed during the call.\nJack Weingart: Ken, it's Jack. Thanks for joining. Thanks for the question. Look, I've said on prior calls that we are not going to forecast CRE, and there's a reason for that. We are investors, and we focus on -- just like we focus carefully on when and which companies to acquire, we focus very carefully on maximizing value for the LPs in our funds and generating the best returns we can. So we're going to be selective and careful in deciding which companies to sell online. And as you might imagine, this market is not the best market to sell high-quality companies as we've kind of alluded to in our comments. In the meantime, we're building a bigger backlog of future promote through the accrued balance. That increased 7% to $725 million during the quarter. One way to think about it is, on average, historically, we have tended to monetize during any 12-month period, call it, 30% -- 30%, 35% of our balance, which gives you kind of an order of magnitude of kind of the annual promote we have kind of in backlog. I would tell you that going into next year, unless markets improve, we would tend to be underweight in selling relative to that average. The other thing I'd note, I mentioned in my comments, Wind River continues to account for over $100 million of our remaining accrued but unrealized carry. And we continue to target a closing by year-end there. Hopefully, that helps. We're not going to get too specific in targeting a specific number -- amount of PRE during any forward-looking period because we're going to do the right thing and sell assets at the right time.\nJon Winkelried: I think in this environment, it's particularly hard to predict. The timing of some of the monetizations, I think, this is going to be obviously shifting around a bit. I think that -- I think -- remember that since 2020, we returned about just under $50 billion of capital to our LPs and have generated really strong DPI across our funds. So far this year, we delivered nearly $190 million of PRE to our shareholders. And I think I understand the averaging or how you'd like to think about sort of what the pace of monetizations will be. But in this environment, with what's happening in the markets with spiking inflation for the first time in 40 years, with the macro picture, I think it's going to be harder to predict with some level of averaging or precision. But when we do have opportunities to monetize, what we're focused on is generating the returns that we need to generate to our investors and that's our priority.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprys: Wanted to come back to the topic around interest rates. Maybe you could just talk a little bit about how the higher interest rate environment is impacting your portfolio companies. What portion of their cap structure is floating rate versus more fixed and hedged? And then on the new investment side, can you talk about how you're adapting the higher financing costs on new deals? Is the purchase price flexing enough to fully offset? Or what are some of the other pieces that may sort of offset partially? Do you anticipate refinancing at a lower cost at some point in the future? Just any color there around how the LDL model is flexing in this environment.\nTodd Sisitsky: Sure. Thanks for the question. It's definitely the case that markets today are challenging and uncertain. But for us, I think we prefer environment where capital is scarce. And it does, as you said, flow through transaction prices. As Jon said, sometimes it takes a little bit of time for the expectations of sellers to sort of recalibrate. But we like it when leverage is less of a commodity. It's definitely also harder to access very large quantums of debt, but mega deals have not been our sweet spot historically in any event. If you look across our portfolio, and this affects both our new underwriting and the question you had about our portfolio of companies, we typically almost consistently actually never take the full amount of leverage that's offered to us. So across all of our portfolios, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratios are like about 3x. And in our capital business, which is certainly on the highest end, it's about 5x, which is a few turns inside of where the industry is. And that's because traditionally, we're focused, as we talked about, on these growth -- secular growth situations where we can not only grow the businesses, but we can inflect the growth curve upwards. And the flexibility inherent in less levered capital structure is really important to us to be able to accomplish that. And so for us, financial engineering and maximizing leverage is really no part of what drives returns for us. It's really about driving that growth, which typically entails a more conservative capital structure. I'd also say, it's an interesting time to continue to develop some of the themes that we have, which include partnering with strategics in an interesting area in often less levered environments. In the last couple of years, we've done that in a lot of places. And then the final point I'd make here is we have an in-house capability that is very important in environments like this. We have, as Jon mentioned, we raised -- we were the lead arranger of $5 billion of debt for these recently closed capital transactions, and that's a real competitive advantage to have that capability. On fixed versus floating, the majority of our debt is fixed. It occurs a little bit, of course, by capital structure. And we'll, of course, place fixed debt and then hedge out a portion of the floating once we get into a deal. So we feel pretty confident between the lower levels of leverage and the fixed rate in terms of where we sit from a liquidity standpoint.\nJack Weingart: And Mike, the other question you asked is about whether we build in assumed low refinancing costs in the future, we absolutely do not do that. So the higher cost of financing has to be accounted for in the model. That being said, we love environments where the distribution of outcomes is more skewed to the positive. So when rates were as low as they were, we did think about the refinancing risk inherent there. It's almost always the case that when debt financing costs are higher like this and more difficult to access, that's a better time to finance deals. And you do have a positive skew to what happens when you can opportunistically refinance that debt.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.\nJon Winkelried: Operator, do you want to go to the next question?\nOperator: Yes. We will take our next question from Brian McKenna with JMP Securities.\nBrian McKenna: Great. So it's good to see the $3.4 billion first close for the Asia fund. So can you talk about the level of demand for this product, specifically in the current market backdrop? And then related, what is the broader deployment opportunity like in the region today?\nJon Winkelried: Jim, do you want to comment?\nJames Coulter: Sure. There is, as I think the close shows, there remains to be strong interest in Asia. The only place I would say we would see weakness in Asia interest is in the U.S. So internationally, there is a very strong interest, particularly in Europe and in the Middle East. In the U.S., we're running into some questions as to global politics. Good thing about our Asia business is we have always been underweighted China and overweighted what we call the arc around China. And we're seeing a relative increase of interest in that strategy. Around the world, you're seeing a pretty strong bounce backs in many of the economies outside of China post COVID, but particularly in Asia. So as investors are looking for growth, they're looking for growth in Asia like China, and that's what our product offers.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.\nGlenn Schorr: Do you hear me this time?\nJon Winkelried: Yes, Glenn. We got you.\nGlenn Schorr: Cool. I was curious on your comments about the opportunity in real estate credit side. One is if you could talk us through anything that could help us on sizing opportunity and what you're expecting? And if it's coming from current LP interest, and that's just the transition of the real estate opportunity on the debt side, so you talked about that a little bit. And then two, while we're on the topic of credit, is -- am I reading too much into it of, oh, maybe this is -- we can piece together the platform one strategy at a time, bring a team together for this piece for a direct lending piece. Just curious if it has any implications to the bigger theme of credit.\nJon Winkelried: Yes. Well, Glenn, I think maybe going in reverse on your question, I think that -- don't read anything into this -- our approach to the real estate credit opportunity I think is, in a lot of respects, separate and distinct from the broader corporate opportunity. And so I'll come back to that after. But it doesn't imply that we're either not focused on the corporate credit opportunity or that we're -- or that our ambitions around it have changed any. I think what's -- going to real estate for a second. The real estate credit opportunity, I mean, we've evaluated and kicked it around for actually some time now. And we were relatively early into the REIT market with TRTX and the commercial mortgage REIT there. And for a while, we were -- over the last number of years, we had kind of evaluated whether or not we wanted to build around that in terms of other private pools of capital that would allow us to attack the opportunity. And while we were doing that, we -- our real estate team is also very focused on getting to much more substantial scale and focusing on the opportunities that we thought were most interesting in terms of developing our track record and establishing our presence in the industry, which we did on the equity side. And obviously, you know where we are there today in terms of having scaled on the equity side. In the process of doing that, our performance has been very strong. Our expertise and understanding of the market in different parts -- different sectors within the space is very strong. And we have a pretty strong following among LPs in terms of our understanding of the space. We went out, and we hired Doug because we felt like at some point, this opportunity was going to come around. It's come around actually in a lot of respects faster than we thought it was. And so we're starting where I think many kind of credit businesses start, which is we see a -- in terms of a total return opportunity, an opportunistic investing opportunity, we see that real time in front of us in terms of what's happened to the financing environment in real estate, dislocation and particularly in a number of spaces as a result of what's going on with a series of term structure changes in the market, banks stepping back from the market in terms of their willingness to lend dislocation in certain sectors like office as an example, retail as an example. And so we're pretty bullish that there's a really interesting opportunity here. And Doug has a background in terms of having kind of managed -- worked through a number of different spaces and sectors within the real estate credit space at Goldman, where he was essentially running a large part of that business. So we're very bullish on it. We're in the process right now of beginning to meet with LPs on it. We feel it's a very large, scalable opportunity over time. And -- but this is where we've chosen to start with respect to leveraging off of our position in the real estate market broadly. And so a number of LPs have been very open-minded in terms of listening to how we're approaching the opportunity. So that's where we are in the real estate credit side.  On the corporate credit side, whether it's direct lending or our capital solutions on credit, we continue to be very interested in it. And we continue to be in the market focused on it and working on it. And we -- it's important and a priority of ours to try to continue to add a credit strategy, a broader credit strategy to our platform over time. We feel it has a lot of value to us. We feel like the way we invest generally as a firm, that adding the credit piece will continue to strengthen our platform, continue to diversify our platform. So don't read anything into the fact that doing this over here, and we're not focused on it because we are.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.\nBrian Bedell: Maybe just to focus on Rise Climate, and if you can update us on the deployment potential there given the Inflation Reduction Act, you talked about this on the last call as well. It looks like it's at least 1/3 deployed if we're looking at maybe a sort of a playbook of deployment, like, for example, for the Growth V fund where you're 2/3 deployed and expect to be back in the market in the middle of next year. Can you just characterize the deployment opportunities in Rise Climate in that context and whether you're sort of potentially cycling through that even -- at an even faster pace and can be back in the market sometime in 2023 for the next vintage?\nJames Coulter: I was hoping for a question in this area. Amidst the complicated market backdrop that we [invest] here, and you're all experiencing one of the real bright spots across our dashboard is what's happening in the climate-related space. Whatever opportunities one thought was available going into this year have been substantially increased by 3 things. First of all, the IRA. If you look at that bill, it's announced as a $369 billion set of incentives. If you look more carefully at the research, those incentives are uncapped, and people think it might be as high as $800 billion or $1 trillion. Within our own portfolio, that dramatically changes. It's the positive, the expected cash flows from things we've already invested in. So it's really good news for what we have in the ground. And it also dramatically opens up the amount of projects and companies that will pass our very strict underwriting standards. So the U.S. has really opened up. Europe quietly has something called REPowerEU, which is also a $300 billion set of incentives. And the European energy prices have dramatically shifted the green premium to a green discount, meaning that green is now much cheaper in that marketplace. And the third thing, frankly, is the weather was just lousy during the year. And so this remains on everyone's mind in a deep way. That being said, an activity has picked up. I don't think there have been many times in my career that I've seen as much of an imbalance between the amount of specialized capital needed and the amount of specialized capital that's been formed. You think about the specialized capital and technology or the specialized capital in oil and gas, and then in all the firms that you can name that have funds in that area that doesn't yet exist in the climate area. And given this acceleration, that's a huge opportunity for us. More capital will flow in. It always does. The head start and the deep knowledge that you have to have to address these markets are something that we've been focused on for a period of time. So you're right, investment pace is a bit ahead of where we might have expected. We're pleased with that. And I think you can see us targeting additional capital raise in '23 and '24. '23 may be, as John alluded to, adjacent products to the Rise Climate Fund. But our pacing -- and we want to be careful to always be moderate in our pacing, but our pacing would suggest that 2024 return to market with the climate fund, but there's lots of opportunities between now and then.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Adam Beatty with UBS.\nAdam Beatty: I wanted to ask about LP co-invest. And we've talked a lot about co-mingled fund raising and what have you. Just wondering about the level of activity that you're seeing there. One of the aspects of the business that you mentioned in the roadshow was that occasionally, on larger deals, TPG would either bring in co-invest or otherwise go outside the firm for capital. So just looking for an update there, kind of the level of interest and activity that you're seeing from LPs these days.\nJack Weingart: Adam, it's Jack. Thanks for the question. Look, I would say a couple of things there. Number one, generally speaking, co-investment opportunities and pursuing co-investments alongside funds in which they invest remains a long-term strategy that's very important to our clients. And we have been a very good partner to many of our LPs in generating co-investments for those who want to see those co-investments alongside our funds. You won't be surprised to hear that in a choppy market like this, where many investors are a little bit kind of moving toward more of a risk-off mentality, combined with the budgetary constraints that we've talked about, LPs are facing and committing to funds, budgets for total investment opportunities in the near term are much lower than they were a year ago. But it remains an important topic, and we will continue to generate attractive co-investment opportunities for our LP investors.\nTodd Sisitsky: And I think it's also -- sorry, it's Todd, just adding one comment. I think it's also a really valuable thing for us that we have a sophisticated group of LPs that in the right situation, particularly when we want to make an initial platform investment and have the opportunity to invest more in our platform companies in the spaces we spent so many years studying, it's a real benefit to have those relationships and the flexibility to provide in scaling up our capital when it's appropriate. So it's a really important part of our ecosystem and one that I think is a permanent part of the private equity business model.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Gerry O'Hara with Jefferies.\nGerald O'Hara: Great. I guess my questions are on FRE or I suppose more specifically FRE earning margin. Jack, I appreciate the comments on how you're tracking ahead of target. But curious to get your sense of how we should think about balancing the fee-paying AUM potential that you outlined earlier in the call against a possible investment in the business or probable, I suppose, investment in the business. So put it other way, what would you perhaps see that could slow the trajectory? Or should we really think about it kind of building from here?\nJack Weingart: Yes. Thanks, Gerry. Good question. I would say we had more acceleration in our FRE margin this year than we expected really driven by both factors: faster growth -- a faster success on the fundraising side driving higher fee-related revenue growth than we had anticipated coming into the year; and our expenses, particularly comp and benefits, tracking below what we expected. That's in part because it's taken us a bit longer to hire people for key roles than we had put into our budget. Those hires haven't changed at all. So we do have some continued investment in building our teams built into our expectations for next year. So I do think that you should expect that line item to grow during the course of next year and probably slow the pace of growth. I'm not changing our target FRE margin by the end of next year. I do think we'll likely exceed it, but there are some additional costs that you should expect us to build the business as we continue to build the infrastructure to support long-term growth.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Luke Mason with BNP Paribas.\nLuke Mason: I think most have been asked. I just wanted to follow up on the organic growth opportunities. Just in this market, how do you think about organic growth versus doing something inorganic. Like on the corporate credit side, is there opportunities for kind of team lift-outs just in this market where potentially activity is a bit slower? Could you maybe do team lift-outs from elsewhere? And just how you think about that.\nJon Winkelried: Well, I think organic growth -- from a growth perspective, organic growth and inorganic growth is not mutually exclusive for us. Organic growth has been a hallmark for us in terms of how we've grown our firm over time. And you'll probably remember how we showed the evolution of the firm in terms of growing both size of our funds as well as identifying new strategies, step-out strategies, or adjacent strategies, and also identifying new important sectors in the market and being innovators like in climate as an example or in impact more broadly. So I talked about some of the organic growth that we're focused on. Jim just mentioned it as it relates to climate. We talked about some of the other strategies that we're continuing to focus on. That's not going to slow down for us. We're highly focused on creating really interesting investment opportunities. And also they're related to the overall ecosystem, and that's really important. These pools of capital that allow us to be nimble, allow us to see opportunities, they feed off of one another. And you can see that consistently in our business. And so that's a core part of how we invest and how we've grown our firm and how we engage with our capital partners, with our LP partners. And so that's going to be a core part of what we continue to do at TPG. On the inorganic side, I think one of the things that we've talked about before is that as the markets continue to consolidate a bit in our industry, particularly in a harder fundraising environment, where capital is more scarce and you see the larger firms or the more experienced firms disproportionately doing better in that context, I think that's creating opportunities with respect to whether it's lift out of teams or acquisition of other businesses. But these deals, in our world, in our business, which is a human capital business, getting inorganic growth completed is a function also of making sure that you're bringing the right team and the right people on board, that you share common objectives in terms of building and growing the business, and that your -- you know what you're buying. And so I would just say that -- and if you look at the history of inorganic growth in this industry, it's obviously accelerated more recently in the last few years, but that's a relatively new phenomenon for our industry. So I think we're -- corporate credit, as an example, as I said before, is an area which we are definitely focused on as a firm. But we're not in a hurry. We're trying to find the right partner. And that's -- and we're thinking about our -- the growth of our firm longer term. So that's how I'd characterize it for you.\nOperator: We will take our final question from Rufus Hone with BMO Capital Markets.\nRufus Hone: I appreciate the detail you provided on the fundraising pipeline. But could you update us on how you're thinking about addressing the retail opportunity and the potential for growth of permanent capital vehicles? Any detail there would be great.\nJon Winkelried: I think -- first of all, just to level set, we're engaged with the channel, particularly in the high net worth retail space, on virtually every campaign that we're in the market on. And so that -- as we've said before, we feel like our business, our brand and our product flow is something that the channel is very interested in. We have great partnerships with the channel partners, and we are in market trying to access capital in every one of our current campaigns. So that's a fixture within each -- within our fundraising strategy. I will say that the channel demand has been not surprisingly weaker across the board. And I think it's a function of generally the markets -- participants in that part of the market feeling generally risk off or more conservative or more careful as the markets have been extremely volatile. It's really not surprising at all to see sort of the orientation of investors to be focused on being a little more careful, a little more liquid. And so what we're seeing across the board, and I think other firms have experienced something similar, maybe with the exception of a few select products that demand -- the demand in that channel is off and down. Over time, as our product set continues to grow, we've said this before, we expect that the broader retail source of capital will be something that we'll have an opportunity to access. And there are certain pools of capital and certain types of investors that are more appropriate for certain types of products. And we'll explore those opportunities when we have the product that fits in that part of the channel. But overall, I think we continue to be pretty active in that higher net worth part of the market, and we'll continue to do so.\nOperator: This concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I would now like to turn the call back over to Gary Stein for any additional or closing remarks.\nGary Stein: Thank you, operator. Thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. If you have any follow-up questions, please circle back to me or Ebony. And otherwise, we'll look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Thank you.\nJack Weingart: Thanks, everyone.\nJon Winkelried: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's TPG's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call and Webcast. You may now disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "James Coulter",
            "content": "Sure. There is, as I think the close shows, there remains to be strong interest in Asia. The only place I would say we would see weakness in Asia interest is in the U.S. So internationally, there is a very strong interest, particularly in Europe and in the Middle East. In the U.S., we're running into some questions as to global politics. Good thing about our Asia business is we have always been underweighted China and overweighted what we call the arc around China. And we're seeing a relative increase of interest in that strategy. Around the world, you're seeing a pretty strong bounce backs in many of the economies outside of China post COVID, but particularly in Asia. So as investors are looking for growth, they're looking for growth in Asia like China, and that's what our product offers. I was hoping for a question in this area. Amidst the complicated market backdrop that we [invest] here, and you're all experiencing one of the real bright spots across our dashboard is what's happening in the climate-related space. Whatever opportunities one thought was available going into this year have been substantially increased by 3 things. First of all, the IRA. If you look at that bill, it's announced as a $369 billion set of incentives. If you look more carefully at the research, those incentives are uncapped, and people think it might be as high as $800 billion or $1 trillion. Within our own portfolio, that dramatically changes. It's the positive, the expected cash flows from things we've already invested in. So it's really good news for what we have in the ground. And it also dramatically opens up the amount of projects and companies that will pass our very strict underwriting standards. So the U.S. has really opened up. Europe quietly has something called REPowerEU, which is also a $300 billion set of incentives. And the European energy prices have dramatically shifted the green premium to a green discount, meaning that green is now much cheaper in that marketplace. And the third thing, frankly, is the weather was just lousy during the year. And so this remains on everyone's mind in a deep way. That being said, an activity has picked up. I don't think there have been many times in my career that I've seen as much of an imbalance between the amount of specialized capital needed and the amount of specialized capital that's been formed. You think about the specialized capital and technology or the specialized capital in oil and gas, and then in all the firms that you can name that have funds in that area that doesn't yet exist in the climate area. And given this acceleration, that's a huge opportunity for us. More capital will flow in. It always does. The head start and the deep knowledge that you have to have to address these markets are something that we've been focused on for a period of time. So you're right, investment pace is a bit ahead of where we might have expected. We're pleased with that. And I think you can see us targeting additional capital raise in '23 and '24. '23 may be, as John alluded to, adjacent products to the Rise Climate Fund. But our pacing -- and we want to be careful to always be moderate in our pacing, but our pacing would suggest that 2024 return to market with the climate fund, but there's lots of opportunities between now and then."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Jon Winkelried",
            "content": "Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. We're excited to share our strong third quarter results today. For the quarter, we generated strong sequential growth in fee-earning AUM, fee-related earnings and value creation across our portfolio. Jack and I will take you into further detail for the quarter. But before we do that, I'd like to share some thoughts this morning on the market we're operating in and our position as a firm. Investors have heard a lot during this earnings season about the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. It's a complex time in the markets generally. However, periods of market dislocation like this create opportunities, so I'd like to focus on what this means for TPG. We've been preparing our business for this type of environment for some time. Investors can see this in our results, including the substantial realization cycle we began several years ago, our record dry powder and the innovative investment strategies we have developed. Despite a challenging market backdrop, our current portfolio, which has been built around our core thematic areas, continues to perform well. Our prudent use of leverage to support the growth orientation of these companies has made our portfolio less sensitive to the effects of rapid interest rate increases. And while we are not immune to inflationary pressures in labor costs, we manage a portfolio which has been constructed by targeting businesses with high intellectual property and strong secular growth in sectors such as health care, technology and climate. We are disciplined, patient investors and careful stewards of the long-dated capital we manage. We focus on investing in leading businesses at attractive valuations and finding creative solutions for companies in need of capital. We have a long and successful history of stepping forward in complicated moments like this to drive returns, and we believe we are set up to do so in this environment. There is a significant opportunity in our pipeline, and we believe TPG is well positioned to continue to execute. There are a few points I'd like to highlight in our results. Our financial performance in the third quarter reflects the durability and strength of our FRE-centric business model. TPG generated significant quarter-over-quarter growth in management fees, operating margins and FRE. This is a direct result of the stable growth of our fee earning assets under management as we continue to scale our business. Our third quarter fee-related revenues of $282 million grew 10% sequentially. Fee-related revenues for the last 12 months exceeded $1 billion for the first time in TPG's history. And approximately 90% of these revenues were from stable and growing management fees. FRE in the third quarter of $121 million grew 19% compared to the second quarter. Our total AUM was $135 billion at quarter end, which increased 24% year-over-year. This step-up was driven by strong fundraising activity across our business, including our first closing in the quarter for TPG's flagship Capital Asia Fund and the completion of the first closes for several other flagship funds, including TPG Capital Partners, Healthcare Partners and Rise. In aggregate, we raised more than $8 billion during the third quarter and $29 billion over the last 12 months. We're very pleased with the success of our ongoing campaigns, particularly amid the well-discussed headwinds GPs are facing in the fundraising market. Given the success of our ongoing fundraising campaigns, we had a record $46 billion of capital available for investment at the end of the third quarter. This is up 18% sequentially and represents 57% of our fee-generating AUM. We believe our fundraising progress and record dry powder leaves us well positioned to play offense and drive returns. Over the last few years, we capitalized on the attractive valuation environment and aggressively sold assets. We have deliberately moderated our pace of realizations, given the market dislocation. And we've been positioning our portfolio companies for continued growth, generating value creation of 2% for the quarter and 13% for the last 12 months. This strong relative performance reflects the high-quality, resilient portfolio we have constructed around our long-term sector-based themes. We've been anticipating a downturn for some time and have been consistently building multiple compression into our financial models. Our focus has been on investing in industries with durable secular trends that can continue to drive growth through the cycles. Although our investment pace slowed in the third quarter, consistent with the broader market activity, we're seeing increasingly interesting opportunities to invest in high-quality companies. We're currently in an adjustment period where sellers' valuation expectations are resetting lower, and transaction levels may remain softer for a while longer. We will continue to be patient and highly selective. We are starting to see valuation expectations begin to align, and we believe we're in a strong position to deploy capital given our significant pool of dry powder. With that in mind, I'll highlight some recent investments we've made across our business, starting with the health care sector, where we are one of the world's largest and most active private equity investors. Shortly after the third quarter, we completed several health care investments with a combined enterprise value of more than $9 billion, with TPG investing approximately $3.5 billion of equity. Notably, our in-house capital markets team had a lead arranger role in raising all $5 billion of the debt for these transactions at attractive terms in a difficult financing environment. We believe our capital markets capabilities continue to provide us with a significant competitive advantage and enable us to access financing even during periods of extreme volatility when banks are largely sitting on the sidelines. Leveraging our carve-out expertise, our capital funds acquired ClaimsXten, which is a leading claims editing software platform that was divested from the merger of United and Change Healthcare. We also completed the take private of Covetrus, a leading animal health distribution and technology platform and the acquisition of DOC Generici, an Italian specialty pharmaceuticals company. Our Capital Asia Fund just completed the acquisition of iNova Pharmaceuticals, a leading independent consumer health care company in the Asia Pacific region. iNova is the inaugural investment from TPG Capital Asia VIII and highlights the strength of our Pan-Asian platform, with the transaction representing a cross-border underwrite across our Australia and Southeast Asia teams. We're seeing significant momentum and opportunities across other parts of our business, including our impact and growth platforms where we have built and scaled several innovative funds. In climate, the combination of the recent Inflation Reduction Act, energy prices and growing concerns around energy security have substantially increased investment into the sector. Since its inception just over a year ago, our Rise Climate Fund has already deployed $2.2 billion and currently has a robust pipeline. During the quarter, Rise Climate invested in Monolith Materials, which is a global leader in clean hydrogen and carbon black. And just after the quarter end, Rise announced a follow-on investment in Form Energy, which is developing and commercializing next-generation battery technology. Second, I want to highlight our tech adjacencies fund, which we created to provide bespoke solutions for the tech marketplace. With IPO expectations delayed and prices resetting meaningfully, we are seeing significant opportunities to deploy the $2.6 billion of new capital we have already closed on for this fund. We have a couple of significant transactions that we hope to be closing shortly. I'd like to also touch on real estate. Rising financing costs as a result of government interest rate policy are leading to valuation adjustments and market dislocation. And as a result, deployment has moderated considerably. However, our fourth opportunistic fund just closed on $6.8 billion of new capital, over 80% larger than our prior fund. So we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities as markets adjust. Furthermore, our team's focus on select themes, primarily driven by long-term secular demand drivers, has resulted in less than 5% of the total remaining invested equity across all of our vehicles to be invested in the office and retail sectors, both of which are also experiencing considerable headwinds. Despite the challenging backdrop over the last 6 weeks, we've been able to monetize several real estate investments in the U.S. and Europe at attractive prices. Before I hand the call over to Jack, there are two additional items I'd like to highlight regarding the broader TPG ecosystem. First, we were pleased to announce that TPG Rise was recently named to Fortune's 2022 Change the World list. This annual list acknowledges companies that have had a positive social impact through activities that are part of their core business strategy. We're proud to be included alongside a number of inspiring companies such as PayPal, Walmart, NVIDIA, GoFundMe and DeepMind. Importantly, we are the first global private equity firm ever to be recognized for this prestigious honor. Second, we recently hosted our capital -- our annual meeting for our capital funds. This was our first in-person conference with our capital limited partners since 2019, many of whom are invested in multiple strategies across the firm. We shared our most compelling investment teams, reviewed the status of our portfolio and highlighted the deep venture talent across our capital platform. We also had senior team members in attendance from all of our other product areas and had an opportunity to engage with our LPs on those strategies as well. We're proud of the trust they placed in us and look forward to our continued partnership. I'd now like to hand the call over to Jack, so he can take you through our financial results. Yes, Craig, we're going to have -- Todd, I think, is going to drill down for you in that area. So why don't you go ahead? Yes. Yes. I think just -- Alex, just to add to Jack's comment, I think the -- in terms of the fundraising environment, I think it's just important to highlight again that the larger managers that have been performing well, I think, are getting positively selected in the market. And remember also that we were very disciplined about returning a lot of capital over the course of the last couple of years. And that's -- I think that's putting us in a good place in terms of many LPs being able to recycle capital back to us. So I think we feel good about our relative position in the market from that perspective. On the organic growth side, I think you'll remember from when we were going around and doing the IPO, we talked a lot about how we've grown the firm over time and our success in innovating and developing new strategies. And that we had raised quite a bit of capital over the last few years related to step-out strategies or new or identifying new sectors or themes in the market that allowed us to build strategies around those. And I think we feel like -- and that's something we talked about continuing to be focused on as a firm, and we are. And I would -- I guess I would point out 4 areas where -- and these are not the only things that we're focused on, but there's 4 areas that I think we feel where we're going to be focused on trying to continue to grow. One is -- and Jim can talk about this a little bit later in the call. But on the climate side, as you heard in my comments, we've seen a substantial flow of really interesting opportunities there. There's a lot of investment that continues to get focused on the space. And I think we're going to try to expand our platform on the climate side with some other opportunities that we'll have more to say about later, but that's an area where we feel like there's more room for growth. A little while ago, we had announced that we had hired a new partner, [indiscernible], to lead our TPG Next initiative, which is our effort to seed and grow minority managers. And our expectation is that we're going to announce a meaningful lead capital commitment with an LP partner shortly on that. And so I think we're going to be off and running on that strategy very shortly. In GP solutions, Jack talked about important closes with anchor LPs in both TGS as well as NewQuest. I would say that given the environment that we're in and what's happening in the secondary market, particularly as it relates to GP capital, we're laser-focused on continuing to grow that. We think it's a very large opportunity. And it's the one -- GP solutions capital is the one area in our market where we see it being undercapitalized. And then lastly, in our leveraging off the strength of our real estate franchise, we are in the process of beginning to raise some capital around the real estate credit opportunity that we see in the market. As you know, we have a publicly traded REIT. We recently hired Doug Bouquard as a partner to lead our real estate credit opportunities. He came from Goldman Sachs. And we -- what was probably a year ago an underwhelming opportunity is now, I think, a pretty compelling opportunity as a result of what's happened with the term structure and rates and what's happening in the real estate market broadly. So we're in the market right now talking to some LP partners about forming capital around that. I think in this environment, it's particularly hard to predict. The timing of some of the monetizations, I think, this is going to be obviously shifting around a bit. I think that -- I think -- remember that since 2020, we returned about just under $50 billion of capital to our LPs and have generated really strong DPI across our funds. So far this year, we delivered nearly $190 million of PRE to our shareholders. And I think I understand the averaging or how you'd like to think about sort of what the pace of monetizations will be. But in this environment, with what's happening in the markets with spiking inflation for the first time in 40 years, with the macro picture, I think it's going to be harder to predict with some level of averaging or precision. But when we do have opportunities to monetize, what we're focused on is generating the returns that we need to generate to our investors and that's our priority. Operator, do you want to go to the next question? Jim, do you want to comment? Yes, Glenn. We got you. Yes. Well, Glenn, I think maybe going in reverse on your question, I think that -- don't read anything into this -- our approach to the real estate credit opportunity I think is, in a lot of respects, separate and distinct from the broader corporate opportunity. And so I'll come back to that after. But it doesn't imply that we're either not focused on the corporate credit opportunity or that we're -- or that our ambitions around it have changed any. I think what's -- going to real estate for a second. The real estate credit opportunity, I mean, we've evaluated and kicked it around for actually some time now. And we were relatively early into the REIT market with TRTX and the commercial mortgage REIT there. And for a while, we were -- over the last number of years, we had kind of evaluated whether or not we wanted to build around that in terms of other private pools of capital that would allow us to attack the opportunity. And while we were doing that, we -- our real estate team is also very focused on getting to much more substantial scale and focusing on the opportunities that we thought were most interesting in terms of developing our track record and establishing our presence in the industry, which we did on the equity side. And obviously, you know where we are there today in terms of having scaled on the equity side. In the process of doing that, our performance has been very strong. Our expertise and understanding of the market in different parts -- different sectors within the space is very strong. And we have a pretty strong following among LPs in terms of our understanding of the space. We went out, and we hired Doug because we felt like at some point, this opportunity was going to come around. It's come around actually in a lot of respects faster than we thought it was. And so we're starting where I think many kind of credit businesses start, which is we see a -- in terms of a total return opportunity, an opportunistic investing opportunity, we see that real time in front of us in terms of what's happened to the financing environment in real estate, dislocation and particularly in a number of spaces as a result of what's going on with a series of term structure changes in the market, banks stepping back from the market in terms of their willingness to lend dislocation in certain sectors like office as an example, retail as an example. And so we're pretty bullish that there's a really interesting opportunity here. And Doug has a background in terms of having kind of managed -- worked through a number of different spaces and sectors within the real estate credit space at Goldman, where he was essentially running a large part of that business. So we're very bullish on it. We're in the process right now of beginning to meet with LPs on it. We feel it's a very large, scalable opportunity over time. And -- but this is where we've chosen to start with respect to leveraging off of our position in the real estate market broadly. And so a number of LPs have been very open-minded in terms of listening to how we're approaching the opportunity. So that's where we are in the real estate credit side.  On the corporate credit side, whether it's direct lending or our capital solutions on credit, we continue to be very interested in it. And we continue to be in the market focused on it and working on it. And we -- it's important and a priority of ours to try to continue to add a credit strategy, a broader credit strategy to our platform over time. We feel it has a lot of value to us. We feel like the way we invest generally as a firm, that adding the credit piece will continue to strengthen our platform, continue to diversify our platform. So don't read anything into the fact that doing this over here, and we're not focused on it because we are. Well, I think organic growth -- from a growth perspective, organic growth and inorganic growth is not mutually exclusive for us. Organic growth has been a hallmark for us in terms of how we've grown our firm over time. And you'll probably remember how we showed the evolution of the firm in terms of growing both size of our funds as well as identifying new strategies, step-out strategies, or adjacent strategies, and also identifying new important sectors in the market and being innovators like in climate as an example or in impact more broadly. So I talked about some of the organic growth that we're focused on. Jim just mentioned it as it relates to climate. We talked about some of the other strategies that we're continuing to focus on. That's not going to slow down for us. We're highly focused on creating really interesting investment opportunities. And also they're related to the overall ecosystem, and that's really important. These pools of capital that allow us to be nimble, allow us to see opportunities, they feed off of one another. And you can see that consistently in our business. And so that's a core part of how we invest and how we've grown our firm and how we engage with our capital partners, with our LP partners. And so that's going to be a core part of what we continue to do at TPG. On the inorganic side, I think one of the things that we've talked about before is that as the markets continue to consolidate a bit in our industry, particularly in a harder fundraising environment, where capital is more scarce and you see the larger firms or the more experienced firms disproportionately doing better in that context, I think that's creating opportunities with respect to whether it's lift out of teams or acquisition of other businesses. But these deals, in our world, in our business, which is a human capital business, getting inorganic growth completed is a function also of making sure that you're bringing the right team and the right people on board, that you share common objectives in terms of building and growing the business, and that your -- you know what you're buying. And so I would just say that -- and if you look at the history of inorganic growth in this industry, it's obviously accelerated more recently in the last few years, but that's a relatively new phenomenon for our industry. So I think we're -- corporate credit, as an example, as I said before, is an area which we are definitely focused on as a firm. But we're not in a hurry. We're trying to find the right partner.

            "name": "Todd Sisitsky",
            "content": "Craig, thanks for the question. Overall, the portfolio really continues to perform quite well, and we're experiencing strong underlying growth. Just looking at the third quarter, for example, in the TPG Capital U.S. and Europe business and the TPG Capital Agent business, which just tends to be our more mature, larger check businesses, in the U.S. business, third quarter year over prior third quarter year results, revenue was up in the high 30s. Now that was impacted by the fact that COVID had a -- is a rebound effect from the third quarter 2021 COVID effect, but still very strong growth. The Asia business over that same time frame in active funds was up 22%, 24%, depending on which fund, so good, steady result. And I think that this is, as Jon was sharing, this is the result of having invested in teams and sectors that are tied to secular growth, particularly over the last [indiscernible] time that we were anticipating a downturn. And makes a big difference between the right neighborhoods. Looking forward, because we spend a lot of time on these portfolio companies, not just looking at historical results, but some of the forward indicators, what we're seeing is health care for the most part continued to rebound in volumes post COVID. Software enterprise technology, decision cycles are taking a bit longer there, so it's a little harder to get large deals over the finish line. Growth continues, but it takes a little longer. It actually provides an advantage for incumbents, but a little more challenging, a little slower for the attackers. Climate has strong growth trends driven by the IRA energy prices, growing concerns about energy security, Internet digital media, persistent demand for content, a little softness in ad sales beginning into this year. Consumer has been a little bit divided with strong resilience at the higher end, a little more pressure on the lower-end consumer. So we're watching all this real time, but for the most part, we're very well positioned relative to spaces we're in and the neighborhoods we've invested behind. Sure. Thanks for the question. It's definitely the case that markets today are challenging and uncertain. But for us, I think we prefer environment where capital is scarce. And it does, as you said, flow through transaction prices. As Jon said, sometimes it takes a little bit of time for the expectations of sellers to sort of recalibrate. But we like it when leverage is less of a commodity. It's definitely also harder to access very large quantums of debt, but mega deals have not been our sweet spot historically in any event. If you look across our portfolio, and this affects both our new underwriting and the question you had about our portfolio of companies, we typically almost consistently actually never take the full amount of leverage that's offered to us. So across all of our portfolios, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratios are like about 3x. And in our capital business, which is certainly on the highest end, it's about 5x, which is a few turns inside of where the industry is. And that's because traditionally, we're focused, as we talked about, on these growth -- secular growth situations where we can not only grow the businesses, but we can inflect the growth curve upwards. And the flexibility inherent in less levered capital structure is really important to us to be able to accomplish that. And so for us, financial engineering and maximizing leverage is really no part of what drives returns for us. It's really about driving that growth, which typically entails a more conservative capital structure. I'd also say, it's an interesting time to continue to develop some of the themes that we have, which include partnering with strategics in an interesting area in often less levered environments. In the last couple of years, we've done that in a lot of places. And then the final point I'd make here is we have an in-house capability that is very important in environments like this. We have, as Jon mentioned, we raised -- we were the lead arranger of $5 billion of debt for these recently closed capital transactions, and that's a real competitive advantage to have that capability. On fixed versus floating, the majority of our debt is fixed. It occurs a little bit, of course, by capital structure. And we'll, of course, place fixed debt and then hedge out a portion of the floating once we get into a deal. So we feel pretty confident between the lower levels of leverage and the fixed rate in terms of where we sit from a liquidity standpoint. And I think it's also -- sorry, it's Todd, just adding one comment. I think it's also a really valuable thing for us that we have a sophisticated group of LPs that in the right situation, particularly when we want to make an initial platform investment and have the opportunity to invest more in our platform companies in the spaces we spent so many years studying, it's a real benefit to have those relationships and the flexibility to provide in scaling up our capital when it's appropriate. So it's a really important part of our ecosystem and one that I think is a permanent part of the private equity business model."

            "name": "Jack Weingart",
            "content": "Thanks, Jon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for the call this morning. The firm's third quarter financial results demonstrate the strength and resilience of our business. We continue to make good progress through our significant fundraising cycle driving a sequential increase in fee-earning AUM, management fees and fee-related earnings. And our investment performance continues to demonstrate strength in the face of these volatile markets, driving an increase in net accrued performance allocations. Now I'll walk through each of these metrics in a bit more detail. Our total AUM increased from $127 billion to $135 billion during the quarter, an increase of 7% for the quarter and 24% compared to $109 billion at the end of the third quarter of '21. The key drivers of this year-over-year increase were $29 billion of capital raised combined with $15 billion of value creation from our underlying fund investments, partially offset by $18 billion of realizations. Fee-earning AUM increased from $67 billion to $81 billion during the quarter, an increase of 21% for the quarter and 37% compared to $59 billion at the end of the third quarter of '21. This 37% increase year-over-year was driven primarily by the raising of nearly $24 billion in fee-earning capital across our platforms, including the activation of new flagship funds for capital, health care partners, Asia, real estate partners and Rise. At September 30, 89% of our AUM and 90% of our fee-earning AUM was in either perpetual or long-dated funds with a duration at inception of 10 years or longer. In addition, 84% of our fee-earning AUM had a remaining duration of 5 or more years at the end of the quarter. And we had nearly $11 billion of AUM subject to fee earning growth, 60% of which was not yet earning fees at the end of the quarter. Our strong organic growth in fee-earning AUM has driven an increase in management fees, which were up 23% year-over-year to $255 million in the third quarter. Total fee-related revenue increased at a slower pace of 7% year-over-year to $282 million due to a reduction in transaction fee revenue from last year's third quarter. However, as Jon mentioned, we closed several new investments last month in which our debt capital markets team played a major role. So we expect transaction fees to increase in the fourth quarter. Our FRE grew 19% compared to the second quarter, led by management fee revenue growth of 14% along with continued expansion of our FRE margin, which increased 300 basis points sequentially to 43% for the third quarter. As we have indicated previously, we expect our FRE margins to continue to expand as we benefit from ongoing scale on operating leverage, with an FRE margin target of 45% by the end of next year. And we're tracking ahead of plan relative to that target. Our after-tax distributable earnings for the third quarter were $113 million, which reflects the slowdown in year-over-year realization activity that we discussed on last quarter's call. As Jon mentioned, we have moderated our pace of monetizations as we focus on driving growth and value creation in our relatively young portfolio. Importantly, the combination of our lower monetization pace and our strong value creation drove a 7% increase in net accrued performance allocations during the quarter. In connection with our third quarter results, we announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per share of Class A common stock, representing 85% of TPG's after-tax distributable earnings, substantially all of which is driven by FRE. We will have distributed $1.09 in cash per share of Class A common stock with respect to the first 3 quarters of the year. Despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, the fundamental performance of our portfolio companies remain strong, generally with above-market revenue and EBITDA growth. We believe this growth is a result of our hands-on approach and thematic sector-based investing in areas with compelling secular growth trends. This strong performance drove a 2% increase in value creation in the quarter and a 13% increase over the last 12 months. Turning to the non-GAAP balance sheet for the TPG Operating Group as of September 30. We are well capitalized with $572 million of cash and $450 million of long-term debt. During the third quarter, we upsized our undrawn credit facility from $300 million to $700 million to provide us with additional financial flexibility. We also had a net accrued performance allocation balance, as I alluded to, which represents 20% -- the 20% allocation to TPG Operating Group of $725 million. The increase from $677 million at the end of the second quarter is primarily driven by $53 million of unrealized value creation. A notable component of our net accrued performance allocation balance at September 30 is related to the sale of Wind River, which we have discussed on previous calls. This transaction remains under regulatory review, and we are still targeting to close by the end of the year. I'd also like to note that as of September 30, $122 billion or 90% of our AUM was eligible for performance allocations. Now moving on to fundraising. We raised more than $8 billion of capital during the third quarter and $29 billion over the last 12 months. And I'd like to provide you with some more detail on our various campaigns. On our capital platform, we were targeting a first close for our flagship Asia fund in the third quarter. And we completed this as planned, raising $3.4 billion, which takes us more than halfway toward our $6 billion target. We also raised an incremental $2.6 billion for our flagship TPG Capital and Healthcare Partners funds. This brings the combined total to $10.6 billion out of an $18.5 billion combined target. On our Impact platform, we closed on an incremental $600 million for our Rise Fund during Q3, bringing the total raise to $1.9 billion against a target of $3 billion. On our real estate platform, we reached the hard cap for our fourth opportunistic fund as expected, completing the fundraising with total capital commitments of $6.8 billion, which is 83% larger than the predecessor fund. Lastly, we raised approximately $1 billion for our Market Solutions platform, including important first closes for our 2 funds focused on GP-led secondaries: NewQuest in Asia and TGS in North America and Europe. Going forward, we're focused on 3 areas of fundraising: number one, completing the active campaigns I just mentioned; number two, launching our next growth fund, which is likely to take place by mid next year; and number three, exploring several additional organic growth opportunities. For the industry, we do expect fourth quarter fundraising to be limited as many LPs have fully allocated their budgets for the year. We have a strong backlog of LP interest in our funds and expect to complete our active campaigns successfully next year as our client access their 2023 budgets. Before we open the call to take your questions, there's one additional item I'd like to cover. As we were planning and executing our successful IPO earlier this year, one of our primary actives was to bring TPG public at a time when we were experiencing significant growth that we could share with public investors. Another fundamental objective was to create a publicly traded security with sufficient liquidity that could be owned by a broad base of shareholders. To that end, I'm pleased to announce that our Board took steps last week to modify our Class A common stock voting power. We believe this will become effective before the end of the year and will enable TPG to qualify for inclusion in the large Russell family of indices when they rebalance next spring. We're proud of our strong third quarter results and the momentum we're generating across our business. We believe our investment portfolios are performing well amid the evolving market backdrop, and we're working closely with our portfolio companies to build long-term value. In addition, we continue to expect strong growth in fee-generating assets under management and fee-related earnings as a result of our ongoing broad-based fundraising campaigns. With that, I'd now like to turn the call back over to the operator, so we can take your questions. Before Todd goes to the operating performance, Craig, I'll address the second part of your question. We absolutely look at multiples every quarter along with lots of other data, and we have been bringing multiples down. Todd will give you a sense for the operating performance [indiscernible]. Sure. Thanks, Alex. Look, I think we started talking about this in the first quarter. And since then, it's become a pretty topical issue for the industry. And things were playing out about as we would have expected. I mean, LPs remain in certain regions of the world overallocated for all the reasons we talked about. A lot of GPs are extending fundraising campaigns into next year. We've been planning to do that the whole time as we've been talking about. And so I think next year will remain challenging throughout most of the year for all the same reasons. There was an element of GPs kind of pre-launching fundraising campaigns coming into this year who didn't necessarily need the capital yet, and that kind of opportunistic fundraising launch will not happen next year. So you'll see -- I think you'll see a bit of an abatement in the number of GPs in the market as next year unfolds. But I think next year will remain crowded. As you point out, we remain really on track. We're very pleased with the $26 billion we've raised year-to-date. It's tracking ahead of what we would have told you at the IPO was our expectation for the year as about a 50% increase relative to the same 3-month period the prior year in a market where aggregate fundraising by the industry is down about 20%. So what you often see in times of dislocation like this, is, yes, lower overall fundraising volumes and market share shifts to stronger players. Transaction volumes slow down for a period of time as we're seeing, but the new investment opportunities get much more interesting. So we feel good about our positioning with that backdrop. As it relates to our flagship funds, as we've been saying, we are going to keep them open through the middle of next year. I think the fourth quarter of this year, as I mentioned in my comments, will be particularly light for the whole industry because most LPs are done allocating capital for the year. So I think you'll see a slowdown in the fourth quarter and then kind of a consistent raising of capital by the stronger players during the course of the year next year. Ken, it's Jack. Thanks for joining. Thanks for the question. Look, I've said on prior calls that we are not going to forecast CRE, and there's a reason for that. We are investors, and we focus on -- just like we focus carefully on when and which companies to acquire, we focus very carefully on maximizing value for the LPs in our funds and generating the best returns we can. So we're going to be selective and careful in deciding which companies to sell online. And as you might imagine, this market is not the best market to sell high-quality companies as we've kind of alluded to in our comments. In the meantime, we're building a bigger backlog of future promote through the accrued balance. That increased 7% to $725 million during the quarter. One way to think about it is, on average, historically, we have tended to monetize during any 12-month period, call it, 30% -- 30%, 35% of our balance, which gives you kind of an order of magnitude of kind of the annual promote we have kind of in backlog. I would tell you that going into next year, unless markets improve, we would tend to be underweight in selling relative to that average. The other thing I'd note, I mentioned in my comments, Wind River continues to account for over $100 million of our remaining accrued but unrealized carry. And we continue to target a closing by year-end there. Hopefully, that helps. We're not going to get too specific in targeting a specific number -- amount of PRE during any forward-looking period because we're going to do the right thing and sell assets at the right time. And Mike, the other question you asked is about whether we build in assumed low refinancing costs in the future, we absolutely do not do that. So the higher cost of financing has to be accounted for in the model. That being said, we love environments where the distribution of outcomes is more skewed to the positive. So when rates were as low as they were, we did think about the refinancing risk inherent there. It's almost always the case that when debt financing costs are higher like this and more difficult to access, that's a better time to finance deals. And you do have a positive skew to what happens when you can opportunistically refinance that debt. Adam, it's Jack. Thanks for the question. Look, I would say a couple of things there. Number one, generally speaking, co-investment opportunities and pursuing co-investments alongside funds in which they invest remains a long-term strategy that's very important to our clients. And we have been a very good partner to many of our LPs in generating co-investments for those who want to see those co-investments alongside our funds. You won't be surprised to hear that in a choppy market like this, where many investors are a little bit kind of moving toward more of a risk-off mentality, combined with the budgetary constraints that we've talked about, LPs are facing and committing to funds, budgets for total investment opportunities in the near term are much lower than they were a year ago. But it remains an important topic, and we will continue to generate attractive co-investment opportunities for our LP investors. Yes. Thanks, Gerry. Good question. I would say we had more acceleration in our FRE margin this year than we expected really driven by both factors: faster growth -- a faster success on the fundraising side driving higher fee-related revenue growth than we had anticipated coming into the year; and our expenses, particularly comp and benefits, tracking below what we expected. That's in part because it's taken us a bit longer to hire people for key roles than we had put into our budget. Those hires haven't changed at all. So we do have some continued investment in building our teams built into our expectations for next year. So I do think that you should expect that line item to grow during the course of next year and probably slow the pace of growth. I'm not changing our target FRE margin by the end of next year. I do think we'll likely exceed it, but there are some additional costs that you should expect us to build the business as we continue to build the infrastructure to support long-term growth. Thanks, everyone."

Please go to TPG's IR website to obtain the earnings materials. I will now turn the call over to Gary Stein, Head of Investor Relations at TPG. Thank you, and sir, you may begin.\nGary Stein: Great. Thanks, operator. Welcome to our second quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining me this morning are Jon Winkelried, Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Weingart, Chief Financial Officer. In addition, our Executive Chairman and Co-Founder, Jim Coulter; and our President, Todd Sisitsky, are also here with us and will be available for the Q&A portion of this morning's call. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that this call may include forward-looking statements that do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to TPG's earnings release and SEC filings for factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. TPG undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Within our discussion and earnings release, we are presenting GAAP measures, non-GAAP measures, and pro forma GAAP and non-GAAP measures, reflecting the reorganization that was completed during 2021 and immediately prior to TPG's IPO. We believe it's helpful for investors and analysts to understand the historic results through the lens of our go-forward structure, and please refer to TPG's earnings release for details on the pro forma financial information. We'll also be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call that management believes are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to the nearest GAAP figures in TPG's earnings release, which is available on the company's website. Please note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any TPG fund. Looking briefly at our results for the second quarter. We reported a GAAP net loss of $10 million and after-tax distributable earnings of $162 million or $0.46 per common share. We also declared a dividend of $0.39 per share of Class A common stock, which will be paid on September 2 to holders of record as of August 19. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jon Winkelried, Chief Executive Officer.\nJon Winkelried: Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. During our prepared remarks today, I'll touch on our recent performance and discuss a few highlights across our business. I'll then turn the call over to Jack to provide more details on our financial results followed by Q&A. We delivered strong financial results for the second quarter, despite a volatile global macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. These results highlight the momentum of our franchise, the strength of our portfolio, and the inherent growth in earnings power of our model. Our second quarter fee-related revenues of $256 million grew 43%, compared to the pro forma year ago quarter, while our fee-related earnings, or FRE, more than doubled to $102 million over the same period. This FRE growth, combined with $60 million of performance-related revenues in the quarter led to after-tax distributable earnings of $162 million, which more than tripled, compared to the pro forma year ago quarter. Driven by these strong results, we announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.39 a share, representing 85% of TPG's after-tax distributable earnings. As of June 30, we had $127 billion of total assets under management, an increase of 17% year-over-year. This growth was driven by significant fundraising activity across our business, led by first closings in the quarter for several of TPG's flagship funds, including TPG Capital Partners, healthcare partners and rise. In aggregate, we raised $13 billion during the second quarter, which is 120% increase versus the year ago quarter, and we raised a record $31 billion over the last 12 months. We're pleased with the strong support we have received from both our long-standing and newer limited partners. The success of our recently completed and ongoing fundraising campaigns is a testament to our excellent track record, strong LP relationships, and best-in-class team. In addition to our robust fundraising over the last quarter and 12 months, we invested $4 billion and $21 billion, respectively. And we delivered realizations of more than $4 billion and $28 billion, respectively. In aggregate, our investment portfolio generated value creation of 12% for the last 12 months, despite a 2% value decline in the second quarter. The global macro environment remains highly uncertain due to a confluence of factors, including inflationary pressures, rising interest rates, the ongoing war in Ukraine, and supply chain constraints. As long-term patient investors, we have successfully navigated TPG through a number of cycles and bounce of volatility over the last three decades and despite the existing backdrop, our business is performing well. While we couldn't have predicted the specific timing or drivers of the current downturn, we have been preparing for the onset of a more challenging market for some time. We aggressively monetized our portfolio during an attractive valuation environment with aggregate realizations totaling 1.3x the amount of capital we invested over the last 12 months. Importantly, at June 30, we had $39 billion of dry powder. The largest amount in the firm's history, representing 59% of our fee-generating AUM. With this large pool of dry powder, we believe we are well-positioned to deploy capital in this increasingly favorable investment environment. We expect to see more attractive investment opportunities across our core sectors and themes as sellers adapt to reset valuations and markets stabilize in the coming quarters. On the realization front, we recognized and leaned into the frothy market valuations over the last 18 to 24 months. Now that the environment has changed, we will still expect to selectively monetize investments in the coming quarters. Our pace will likely moderate. We have a strong relatively young portfolio of attractive companies, and we have a bias to remain patient and continue investing in these companies to build long-term value. I'd now like to walk you through some highlights across our business, starting with our largest platform capital which had [$62 billion] [ph] of total AUM as of June 30. During the quarter, our capital funds completed or announced several investments in companies, including Doc Genrici, a leading European specialty pharmaceuticals company based in Milan, and the pending take private of Covetrus, a leading U.S. animal-health technology and distribution services platform. Both of these transactions leverage our capabilities as one of the most active and experienced healthcare private equity investors, while building on thematic areas we have studied in diligence for many years. During the quarter, we also completed the acquisition of an additional stake in Sauce Labs, a leading provider of automated software testing solutions. This is a great example of the proprietary investment opportunities we create through the connectivity among our investment platforms. Our tech adjacencies fund, TTAD, first made a minority investment in Sauce Labs in 2019 and subsequently increased its position. This relationship enabled our capital team to engage Sauce Labs and its shareholders on a proprietary basis, which led to a majority investment. In the second quarter, we also helped on CAA's strategic acquisition of ICM, which enhanced its leadership position within the entertainment and sports industries. We first invested in CAA back in 2010. And last year, we moved it into a single asset continuation vehicle to maintain our majority ownership of this high-quality business. For the quarter, our capital funds generated total realizations of approximately $2 billion, including the partial sale and recapitalization of TPG Asia's investment in Greencross, Australia's largest pet care company. Next, our growth platform at $21 billion of total AUM at the end of the second quarter. As discussed, we have built our growth portfolio with a focus on sectors and teams like healthcare IT, digital transformation, and security and infrastructure were secular rather than cyclical growth drives performance. We are investing in well-established companies with strong financial profiles, and our investments are often through structured securities that provide some form of downside protection. Growth Platform had an active deployment quarter, including the completion of our investment in Mero Sodali, a leading global provider of shareholder engagement and corporate governance services. In addition, consistent with our hands-on approach and focus on bending the curve to drive transformational growth, we funded several strategic portfolio company acquisitions, including Kaseya\u2019s Take Private Datto to further scale as a leading provider of back-office infrastructure software. Denali's acquisition of Imperial Western Products to bolster its leadership position in organic waste management, Asia Healthcare Holdings acquisition of Dr. Agarwal\u2019s Healthcare, India's largest provider of eye care services, and People 2.0's acquisition of Brookson, a leading compliance and services platform for freelancers in the UK. During the quarter, we returned capital to our growth platform investors through several transactions, including partial monetizations for FreedomPay and Asia Healthcare Holdings. We also announced the strategic sale of implantable provider group to Evolent Health and completed the IPO of Campus Activewear in India. Campus is India's No. 1 sports and athleisure footwear brand and its public offering achieved the second highest subscription ever for an Indian consumer IPO at the time of pricing. Moving on, the Impact platform had total AUM of $15 billion as of June 30. During the quarter, our Impact funds deployed capital in a number of transactions such as Intersect Power, a leading integrated renewable energy platform, Summit Carbon Solutions, which is developing one of the largest carbon capture and storage systems in North America. Beta Technologies, which is developing electric aircraft capable of vertical takeoff and landing, and International Medical University, which operates medical colleges in Malaysia. I'd also note the Inflation Reduction Act is expected to stimulate substantial investment in climate-related technologies and solutions, which should provide a tailwind to some of our existing rise and rise climate portfolio companies and also create attractive investment opportunities going forward. Our real estate platform, which ended the second quarter with $20 billion of total AUM and had a substantial realization in the quarter, the sale of the remaining assets in ICON, which was our warehouse and logistics development venture in the U.K. On the deployment side, the real estate platform continues to add new investments at a measured pace, primarily across our student housing, rental housing, and life science themes. Before I turn the call over to Jack, I'd like to touch on our talent strategy, which is an integral component of TPG's culture. We remain focused on recruiting and retaining best-in-class talent. We recently announced mid-year promotions from more junior members of our investment team across six offices and five business units, and nearly 50% of these promotes identify as diverse. We also held our annual partner promotions, and this year's process was as rigorous and engaging as ever. Our successful partner candidates represented four offices globally and five different business units. And since 2019, 40% of our new partners have identified as diverse. During the quarter, our most senior leaders and I hosted our annual diversity, equity and inclusion [town hall] [ph]. This firm wide event is an important time for us to come together as a global firm to provide updates on our DEI strategy and progress and keep ourselves accountable as we continue to build our firm. I'd also like to highlight that today, we published our annual environmental, social, and governance review, which is available on our website. This report underscores TPG's commitment to advancing ESG performance within the firm and across our broader ecosystem and communities. Lastly, I'm also pleased to note that we recently added Gunther Bright as a new independent director to our board. Gunther is a distinguished leader who has delivered exceptional results as an executive at American Express, a former board member of McAfee, a member of various nonprofit boards. We are confident that his [breadth] [ph] of experience and leadership talent will enhance our board. I'd now like to turn the call over to Jack, so he can take you through our financial results.\nJack Weingart: Thanks Jon, and good morning everyone. I'll briefly walk through our financial results and highlight some of the more significant points regarding our second quarter performance. Our total assets under management grew from $108 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2021 to $127 billion as of June 30 of this year. The key drivers of the 17% increase were the $31 billion of capital raised that Jon mentioned, combined with $15 billion of value creation from our underlying fund investments, partially offset by $28 billion of realizations that were returned to our fund investments during the same period.  Fee Earning AUM increased from $52 billion at June 30 2021 to $67 billion at June 30, 2022. This 28% increase was driven primarily by raising nearly $17 billion in fee earning capital across our platforms, most notably in real estate and impact. Additionally, proforma for the recent activation of our next flagship Capital and Healthcare Partners funds, which I'll discuss momentarily, our fee earning AUM is now $73 billion, which is a 39% increase, compared to the second quarter of 2021. At June 30, approximately 84% of our AUM and 77% of our fee earning AUM was in either perpetual or long-dated funds with a duration at inception of 10 years or longer. In addition, 80% of our fee earning AUM at a remaining duration of five or more years at the end of the second year. We had nearly $16 billion of AUM subject to fee earning growth, including more than $13 billion, not yet earning fees at the end of the second quarter. Despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, the fundamental performance of our portfolio companies remain strong, with aggregate revenue and EBITDA growth well above market, which we believe is a result of our hands-on approach and thematic sector-based investing in areas with secular growth trends. This strong performance, partially offset the declining multiple environment in the quarter, leading to a valuation decline of 2%. Looking at our income statement, we recorded a GAAP net loss for the second quarter of $10 million. Regarding our non-GAAP results, we reported fee-related revenues for the second quarter of $256 million, an FRE of $102 million. Our FRE more than doubled versus the pro forma year ago quarter, driven by a combination of top line growth and management fees and the ongoing expansion of our FRE margin. Our FRE margin was 40% for the second quarter, up from 38% in the first quarter of this year. As we have indicated previously, we expect continued FRE margin expansion as we scale our business and drive operating leverage with an FRE margin target of 45% by the end of next year. Our after-tax distributable earnings were $162 million, which was more than 3x the pro forma year ago quarter, driven by the growth in FRE and by realized performance allocations of $60 million in the second quarter. Turning to the non-GAAP balance sheet for TPG Operating Group, as of June 30, which is reflective of our balance sheet like business model, we are well capitalized with $585 million of cash and $450 million of long-term debt. In July, we also upsized our undrawn credit facility from $300 million to $700 million to provide us with additional financial flexibility.  We also had a net accrued performance allocation balance, which represents the 20% allocation to the TPG Operating Group of $677 million. This decreased from $796 million at the end of the first quarter, driven by a $60 million of realizations and a $60 million unrealized non-cash decline in mark-to-market valuations. A notable component of our performance allocation balance as of June 30 is related to the sale of Wind River, which we've discussed on previous calls. This transaction is currently under regulatory review, and we are now targeting a closing by year-end. I'd also like to note that as of June 30, a $114 billion or 90% of our total AUM was eligible for performance allocations.  On fundraising, we delivered an exceptional quarter with $13 billion of capital raised and a record $31 billion raised over the last 12 months despite headwinds across the industry. I'd like to provide you with a bit more detail and an update regarding additional fundraising post quarter end. I mentioned on our last call that we expected to hold first closes for three funds around mid-year, our flagship TPG Capital, Healthcare Partners, and Rise Funds. In all three cases, we held rolling first closes that began at the end of the second quarter and finished after quarter-end. On TPG Capital and Healthcare Partners, where we've articulated a combined target of $18.5 billion, we closed on $8 billion during Q2, as you saw in the earnings release and another $2.7 billion in the past month bringing the combined first close to $10.6 billion. On Rise, where we've articulated a target of $3 billion, we closed on $1.3 billion during Q2 and another $300 million in the past month, bringing the total first close to $1.6 billion. On the TPG Asia front, as I mentioned on our last call, we expect to complete our first close this quarter, Q3 and we'll have more to report on this during our next earnings call. On our real estate platform, we raised $2.3 billion for our fourth opportunistic real estate funds in the second quarter. We have reached the hard cap for this fund, and we expect to complete fundraising this quarter with our internal capital commitments at a total fund size of approximately $6.8 billion. Finally, a comment on the timing of activation of TPG 9 and Healthcare Partners. We had not activated these funds as of June 30, which is why the $8 billion does not show up in our fee earning AUM numbers at quarter-end. Since then, we finished investing TPG 8 and Healthcare Partners 1, so we have now activated the new flagship funds as of mid-July.  While the remainder of our fundraising campaigns may be extended for reasons that have been well discussed across the industry. We are very pleased with our strong start, and we look forward to updating you on our continued progress in future quarters. Taking a step back, we are proud of our strong second quarter results and the momentum we're generating across our business. We believe our investment portfolios are performing well amidst the volatile market backdrop, and we're working closely with our portfolio of companies to build long-term value. In addition, we continue to expect strong growth in fee-generating assets under management, and fee-related earnings as a result of our ongoing broad-based fundraising campaigns. With that, I'd now like to turn the call back over to the operator, so we can take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] And our first question will come from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Hey, good morning everyone.\nJon Winkelried: Good morning, Craig.\nCraig Siegenthaler: So, we wanted to start on fundraising and it was nice to see the $7 billion closure [Fund 9] [ph] and almost $2 billion for Healthcare 2 in the quarter, especially given some of the emerging challenges, but I want to circle back to Jack's prepared commentary on extension, I think was the word he used. Do you think it'll be significantly more difficult to raise the second half of these funds? I think you have about $8 billion of the $18 billion remaining in the second half of this year, just given that some of your limited partners, they may have hit their full-year fundraising targets a little earlier this year given the [nominator effect] [ph]?\nJack Weingart: Yes. Thanks for the question, Craig. Look, we've been talking for a few quarters now about the fundraising market challenges and the fact that I think all fundraising campaigns across the industry will be more extended than usual. And that, I think, remains the case for the reasons you're articulating. Against that backdrop, we couldn't be happier or more proud of the progress we made as of the end of the quarter and the subsequent quarters I just referred to. I do think as we look out toward the completion of those campaigns that I wouldn't expect them to be complete by the end of the year. I think all of them will extend into next year.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you, Jack. And just for my follow-up, it's actually on the real estate business and marks. And I was curious behind the dynamics of your negative 2.3% mark in real estate. Within that portfolio, which segments were marked down the most, which ones are maybe flat to up? And I also wanted to see how cap rates generally trended, which likely will offset strong free cash flow growth.\nJon Winkelried: Yes, Craig. It's Jon. First of all, I would say that our real estate portfolio, and I think we've talked about this before, is actually performing extremely well. And the places that we're exposed are places where, frankly, I think we feel good about being exposed. So, as you know, our focus from a sector perspective has been life sciences, industrial, rental, residential housing, student housing, data centers and studio content real estate. And we have very little, if any, significant exposure to office or retail, which obviously are down much more significantly. I think as a general matter, we've been reasonably conservative in terms of our marketing, even though our operating performance is actually exceptionally good. And one of the things that we do look at is we do look at across our entire business, public market comps and if you look at REITs in the market, as an example, REITs have had a pretty tough ride in this market downdraft. Just a couple of benchmarks for you. ProLogis, down 23%. EQR, down 19%. These are the largest industrial and apartment REITs. So, when you think about, sort of how we think about marking our book, I think we're being reasonably conservative in doing so. And I think that the areas where we're marking in relation to that, obviously, industrial, rental residential housing are places where we're taking into account those benchmarks relative to the rest of the portfolio, which is marked slightly stronger. So, I think it's fairly straightforward in terms of our approach to how we came through this quarter in our marks. Obviously, cap rates are up a bit with rates overall. The real estate securitization markets are much slower than they were with loan to values that are down, spread slightly wider, etcetera.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nAlex Blostein: Hey, good morning everybody as well. So, I was hoping maybe we could expand a little bit on the fundraising backdrop and just, kind of look under the hood a little bit. One of the things, Jon, you mentioned, is the expansion of the LP basin. I'm curious kind of how that evolved another year through the first slug of the fundraising? How does it differ from the predecessor funds either in terms of the composition of LPs, the number of LPs geographically or by customer tab? We just like to get a little bit more color as we kind of try to get confidence in the remaining piece of this fundraising cycle for you guys?\nJack Weingart: Sure. Thanks, Alex, it's Jack. I would say consistent with, I think, my comments on the prior call, we're definitely seeing a bit of a mix shift in the LP base, first of all, given that the current dynamics in the fundraising market are affecting some segments of the market more than others. I would say that the composition of an LP base is much more international, this cycle than it was last cycle. If you compare the TPG 9 and Healthcare Partners 2, for example, all the capital we've closed on to date, about 35% or so is domestic U.S. capital in the same funds last time, TPG Healthcare 1, it was about 47%. So, a mix shift toward more international capital and a mix shift with pensions representing a bit lower percentage and areas like sovereign wealth increasing. And then I would also say we're definitely successfully expanding our LP base during this broad-based fundraising campaign. We've added \u2013 I don't have exactly the amount of capital we've added from new LPs, but it's a substantial portion of our fundraising process.\nOperator: Alright, thank you. [Operator instructions] Our next question will come from Ken Worthington with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.\nKen Worthington: Thanks for taking the questions. So, as we think about organic growth for TPG and filling in some of your product gaps, how do you see, sort of the spreads between the bid and the ask adjusting for potential deals given the more challenging market conditions that we've seen? So, public market valuations for [all else] [ph] have come down a bunch. To what extent, if at all, have private market valuations come down as well and are they holding up? And then I guess, ultimately, what is your desire to kind of fill in one or two of the capability gaps that I think we talked about during the IPO process, as you look out over, I don't know, pick a time period, 12 months to 18 months. So, not immediately, but over the next, call it, year and a half or so. Is that something that's still sort of a priority for you, I guess, is the question?\nJon Winkelried: Ken, just to clarify the first part of your question, I think on the [bid-ask spread] [ph], you're referring to within the [odd space] [ph], not just generally with respect to our portfolio company, right?\nKen Worthington: Yes. Correct. This is you as a buyer or an investor \u2013 you as a buyer for your personal M&A.\nJon Winkelried: Yes. Well, personally, [indiscernible] well, look, I think the first part of the question in terms of sort of the bid-ask spread, I think I would characterize as very, kind of bespoke or situational. It's very hard to kind of generalize because I think that we have, naturally, as we said during the IPO process, we're interested in continuing to expand our business. And as you know, most of our growth historically has been through organic developed growth. We continue to believe that will be an important growth driver for us. On the nonorganic or the acquisition side, I think that you would expect that we would be very targeted and focused on what we're adding, what the characteristics of it are? And I think there, it's very specific to the potential strategy firm people. So, I really have a hard time generalizing when it comes to that in terms of the bid-ask spread. So, people want to get paid a lot for the businesses, they do, particularly where generally the asset-class has had a tailwind over the last number of years. So, I would say that would \u2013 our judgment on it is, it continues to be quite situational and sort of one-off and specific. And I would reiterate that we do have a desire to continue to be forward leaning on filling in gaps in our business. I think that in particular, I think we continue to have some dialogue with various strategies across the credit space. We feel that generally in our rise and impact business that broadening our capabilities there in a number of different categories is something where we might be able to accelerate that by either acquiring something or something like an aqua hire, a team in a particular discipline. And so, we'll continue to be engaged in the market.\nKen Worthington: Okay. That\u2019s great. That\u2019s it from me. Thank you very much.\nJon Winkelried: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBrian Bedell: Thanks very much. Good morning folks. Maybe if you could just talk about the FRE margin that stepped up nicely to the close to the 40% level. Jack, just your view on given that we're activating these funds now in July, whether you think you're at a level where you can maintain that FRE margin at that 40% level in the second half here? Obviously, you mentioned getting to 45% at the end of 2023.\nJack Weingart: Yes. Thanks for the question, Brian. Look, I think \u2013 I mean, you guys all have models to understand how our business works. The fact that we accelerated the timing of our first closes on our large flagship funds is meaningful, and that should continue to drive good FRE margin expansion. You can never time these things exactly in terms of how our continued investment in people to grow our business coincides relative to the growth of our capital base and the activation of new capital. But now that we've activated those funds that will provide a good bolus to additional management fee growth in the back half of the year. I think that will, to answer your question, allow us to maintain or grow the 40% FRE margin in the back half of the year. Again, toward our target as we complete these fundraises.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi, thanks very much. So, I heard your comments loud and clear on the moderate case of monetizations, maybe in the back half, makes complete sense in the market we're looking at. Just curious if you could talk about how much and how long? And I know that's always a weird question, but usually, you have some lag and lead time on when you ink deal. So, pace of moderation in monetization? And I guess it's the same question on deployment, I've never seen so much dry powder as a percentage of AUM before. I don't know if that pace and timing is any different because you're dealing with the same bid-ask in the market, but maybe having a lot of cash on hand might make deployment quicker than monetization. So, two-parter, but it's the same question. Thanks.\nJon Winkelried: Glenn, it's Jon. Maybe what we'll do is start with monetizations. And I think I'll ask Todd who's here to talk a little bit about pace of monetizations and what we're seeing there, then we'll flip it over to deployment.\nTodd Sisitsky: Yes. First of all, thanks, Glenn for the question. We're very cycle aware. And so, during this last period, as you know, we were very active on the monetization front. And I think our \u2013 the relationship between monetizations and new investments for us over the past year or two was one of the highest in the industry. During that time period, a substantial majority of what we did on the monetization front, we're not IPOs, but were sales. And many of those were too strategic. And I think to your point, some of these strategic sales do continue to pay. So, the dialogues that you have during those periods, they may not be quite as active during this period on as many fronts, but there still is, I think, enacted [indiscernible] some of our companies and several of our portfolios.  And so during periods like this, we see a moderation. And I think it's quite possible to end up slipping to more of a net buyer and we'll talk about the deployment pace in a moment, but the opportunities are still there. These companies that we've built over many years, we feel like we\u2019ve made the more strategic, more growth. And that's why we are such a high number of companies that end up in strategic hands and those continue to be opportunities in different types of economic cycles. So, moderation, yes, the dialogues are ongoing. And frankly, we continue to feel like there's going to be opportunities in the quarters and years ahead on the modernization front.\nJon Winkelried: And, Glenn, I think on deployment, look, I think where we're sitting, and I'm going to want to ask Jim, who is on the call as well to make a couple of comments here as well, but on the deployment pace, your observation about the level of dry powder and ours, in particular, is absolutely right. We've got a tremendous amount of dry powder, which we actually feel great about going into this cycle. We've talked about the sort of good ask spread dynamic in past calls. We still see that playing out. We clearly see from \u2013 if you go through my comments in terms of where we actually have deployed capital, we do see the adjustment process continuing. And there's actually, I think, overall, a fair amount of activity, and we really like the sectors and the themes where we've been focused for a while now. We really like what they're looking like and the opportunities that we're starting to see there. There's a lot of focus in the market, as you already know, on take privates, public to privates. And there's a lot of talk about that. I think that some of that is getting done and some of that will get done. They're not easy deals to get done, but I think they will get done because obviously, there's \u2013 given the public market reset, there's a number of clear opportunities there. So, we're engaged in some dialogue on deals like that. I think that we do start \u2013 we are starting to see some, kind of resetting of expectations in kind of sponsor-to-sponsor related activity. And then given, sort of our relative strengths here in terms of, for instance, our impact business. And when I mentioned about the new build, etcetera., Climate Technologies. I'm going to turn that over to Jim to just make a comment on that.\nJim Coulter: The pending bill \u2013 this is Jim, by the way, the pending bill is probably should drive an interesting discussion on investment opportunities in the climate space. Those of you who have followed it know that it's unlike traditional attempts in climate mitigation. Traditional attempts have been adding cash taxes to admitters. This bill is almost 100% incentives. It's a [indiscernible] bill driven to drive investment. And obviously, that serves us well. To give you a sense, there's three things that we're focused on, first of all, in our existing portfolio, probably 60% to 70% of what we've deployed was deployed, assuming these incentives weren't in place and it has a very positive effect on that deployment, but more importantly, repeat, which is someone who scores the bill basically expects this bill to drive $3 trillion of investment in the climate space. Personally, I think of that is \u2013 that that investment is going to happen, you probably have to release double your money. So, that's a very substantial potential profit pool for investments, and that should open the aperture of deals that will make sense for us given our high hurdle.  And lastly, the U.S. tends to drive technological advancement around the world. So, driving changes in the U.S. market, I think, is going to increase our aperture globally. So, I think not well talked about yet, but interesting is looking forward for deployment in the climate space that should have a very interesting effect.\nJon Winkelried: Yes. Just last piece, Jack, why don't you talk a little bit about numbers on real estate.\nJack Weingart: Sure, Glenn, just to give you a little more color on the realization pipeline. I think I mentioned on the last call that we had $125 million or so of realizations that were contractually committed, but had not yet closed. Obviously, you saw in the second quarter that we delivered $60 million of actual realizations. And as we sit here today, we still have over $100 million of allocable performance allocations signed, but not yet closed. I think Jon's comments were beyond that, our bias at this point is to be selective on monetizations. Given how aggressive we were at selling assets in the past 12 months to 18 months, we currently have a very young, very interesting portfolio of companies, and our bias is to work with the management teams to build those \u2013 build long-term value in that portfolio unless we see very attractive exit opportunities.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMichael Cyprys: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just following up on the pending climate bill and the opportunity set that you mentioned. I guess is there anything that you guys need to do in terms of expanding the team or the platform to capitalize on the opportunity set that you see from the pending bill? And maybe you could just elaborate a bit more on that? Thank you.\nJim Coulter: Yes. Michael, it's Jim. We feel good about the progress of building the existing team. As Jon pointed out, deployment in the impact space has been strong this year. So, I'm not in any way concerned about team. Over time, I think there are opportunities for either organic or inorganic growth to allow us to expand the types of pools of capital we're deploying in the space. So, obviously, our focus right now is on Climate PE, but there are clear adjacencies around that, that we could either organically or inorganically grow into. And I think the climate bill will accelerate LP's views of the exposure they want to build in this area.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Robert Lee with KBW. Your line is now open.\nRobert Lee: Great, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Wanted the first question to be on, kind of your business footprint. Obviously, you have a large growing Asian platform, but you don't talk as much about your EMEA platform. I know it's something you've talked about investing in. Can you maybe just first update us on where that stands and your list of priorities to expand your footprint through Europe and the EMEA region? And then maybe secondly, and I apologize if you went through this earlier, can you update us on your, just some expense guidance for the year, I mean it came in, comp in particular, seemed like really well controlled, but should we still expect that to accelerate at a meaningful pace over the back half of the year?\nTodd Sisitsky: Sure. It's Todd. Thanks to question. Let me start just on the European front. This is a geography we've been in \u2013 really since the beginning of the firm. So, it is important to us. And we've made a lot of progress, I think, in recent years. I think, as Jon mentioned, we just announced a large healthcare deal, [indiscernible]. We have one of the co-heads of the TPG Capital Healthcare platform who works out London with a great team. And so, we're really building our pipeline and our presence there. In real estate, which is another of our global strengths, we have a strong presence with a number of partners and senior team members who have had a lot of success both on the investment and the \u2013 on the liquidity front. And so, Europe for us, we're continuing to grow. We have sort of leaned in, particularly in our strengths. And it also has become an increasingly important place for us from a fundraising perspective. So, I can't remember how much trips and weekends and we spent over in Europe personally. We had a dozen team members over for the [indiscernible] conference. We have a number of new relationships and we've been building across the platforms from a fund raising standpoint in Europe. So, it's an important area for us. We are putting a lot of energy against it. We're spending a lot of time as a senior leadership team in Europe trying to continue to grow the business. And fundamentally, we're leading our strengths as a global platform to keep on our European presence.\nJon Winkelried: Jack, do you want to [indiscernible]?\nJack Weingart: Sure. On the expense front, we're definitely continuing to invest in talent to support the growth of our business. So far this year, we've added over 125 new employees to the firm, and that's been pretty broad-based across investment and services platforms. And to answer your question, we do continue to expect an increase in the comp and benefits expense line through next year. The timing of that is always hard to predict based on where we find the right people for the right roles, but through next year, I'd expect continued growth in the comp and benefits line. OpEx is up in the high 50s as our business rebounds as we have people back in the office as we're all traveling more. And that's \u2013 I would expect continued growth in that line, but it is at a more moderate pace than the comp and benefits line.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Arnaud Giblat with BNP. Your line is open.\nArnaud Giblat: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Can I ask the question on the change in valuations? I think you took capital down 2.4% over the quarter. If you could split that up for me in terms of the different moving parts or change in valuation multiples, growth in EBITDA, and any uplifts you had upon exit? Thank you.\nJon Winkelried: Sure. I would \u2013 I addressed this a little bit in my prepared remarks, but generally, the way I would characterize the way valuations came out on the private equity side is we definitely have aggregate revenue and earnings growth across our portfolio that is exceeding the comparable companies as we look at that metric. So, as we look \u2013 we, on average, took our valuation multiples down for the quarter, but that was almost offset by the growth in earnings.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Finian O'Shea with Wells Fargo.\nFinian OShea: Hi, everyone. Good morning. A question on private credit. Do you still have the similar playbook from the onset or do you consider starting internally, maybe bringing in a team, for example, and building it out from there?\nJack Weingart: I alluded to this before in my comments, but we still do have a focus on expanding the platform and unclear. At this point, we are looking \u2013 we are evaluating a couple of different options, including, as I said, acquisitions/Aqua hire, which I think would be sort of consistent with what you're talking about in terms of bringing in a team. So, we remain focused on it and at some point, hopefully, we'll have more to say on it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Rufus Hone on with BMO Capital. Your line is now open.\nRufus Hone: Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping to get a little more detail around your fundraising pipeline for 2023. And you had the accelerated closings of some of the larger funds starting to come through this quarter. And you mentioned that, that spills over a little into next year and you have the Asia fund coming up as well, but if you could give us a sense of what new funds you expect to bring to market in 2023, that would be helpful? Thank you.\nJon Winkelried: Sure. First of all, the current focus continues to be on completing the fundraising campaigns that we've talked about and scaling our existing businesses. In addition to that, and as I mentioned, those campaigns, TPG 9, Healthcare Partners 2, the Rise Funds, the Asia Fund, which we'll talk about our first close this quarter. We'll probably continue to play out over the next 9 months to 12 months as we complete those campaigns. In addition to that, as we've talked about in prior calls, we are continuing to focus on organic growth through new business creation. And the two areas I'd point to that we're most focused on are secondaries and life sciences. And as we play out the back half of this year, we'll update you on probably initial closes across both of those platforms, which will also by the way, which will also extend into 2023.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Brian McKenna with JMP Securities. Your line is open.\nBrian McKenna: Great, thanks. So, I had a question on your Asia business, I know you're in the market for your next flagship fund, but could you talk about some of the longer-term growth opportunities in the region? How you see your lineup of products and strategies evolving here over time? And then how should we think about resource allocation as part of the business moving forward?\nJack Weingart: I mean just important to reemphasize that the flagship fund, obviously, is the base of our business, the core of our business and getting that fund raised and getting that fund raised and completed is our \u2013 frankly, right now is our real focus. I think that going forward, there are a couple of other areas that we have thought about before that could be interesting. I guess I would characterize those as real estate is one of them, which is an area that might be interesting for us going forward, big asset class in the region, obviously, credit is another area that could also be interesting. And I would say, a strategy perhaps that mirrors what we do here in our tech adjacencies fund, but perhaps in a slightly broader context of industries and verticals. And what I mean by that is essentially hybrid return type structures that might be at a slightly different return \u2013 in slightly different return category than our private equity focus in the region might also be a place that we see opportunities. So, once we get through our fund raise for our core Asia fund, we're going to be thinking about other potential opportunities.\nJon Winkelried: And then on your team point, I think we have a very strong and stable team in the region in the capital business and [indiscernible] business elsewhere. And so, we feel like we're building from a really good base. And it's more steady as she goes with some incremental hiring and selective additions, but starting from a really good place.\nJim Coulter: Yes. Jon, I would add in that the people tend to focus on our flagship fund and perhaps miss some of the strength of our Asia franchise, given the impact and growth investing is done through our global funds I would note that we probably had the highest profile climate investment in Asia last year with our investment in \u2013 a billion investment in Tata Motors. Jon mentioned the IPO in India out of our growth platform and the most recent is investment was a Malaysian medical school. So, we have a substantial footprint across several of our platforms to grow our products out there.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question will come from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks so much for taking my follow-up. Just wanted to follow up on a question earlier about the potential inorganic expansion on the Impact platform. Just maybe a little bit more color on that in terms of what types of areas, is it mostly infrastructure that you're thinking or some other types of areas that would accelerate that platform? And then also if you can comment just on retail in terms of their take-up of some of the new funds, but both an impact in the Rise 3 and also just across the franchise capital and [healthcare burners] [ph].\nJon Winkelried: Jim, why don't you start with the [indiscernible] platform?\nJim Coulter: Yes. For impact and particularly, I'll focus on climate for a moment. It's very clear to me that the $150 trillion expected global investing in climate transition is going to spread across traditional asset classes. And just as we saw in technology that assets that started in private equity like data center and tower has eventually move into infrastructure at an accelerated pace. The same is going to happen here. It's already happening in renewables and it will happen in a number of other of the themes that we're playing. So, from our thematic approach, there's clear opportunities in infrastructure. And as the companies we create in private equity mature, there will be clear opportunities in crossover investing between the public and private market. And finally, if you look at the capital that's been set up for this transition. A lot of it will be in the private credit markets. And I think there's an opportunity to address that entering on a thematic basis, as well as entering from a credit perspective. So, this is early days in a very large area, and we're making sure that we're considering all of the adjacencies while also being prudent in capital deployment pace.\nJack Weingart: Hi, Brian, it's Jack. On retail, high net worth, we definitely continue to see longer-term high net worth, it\u2019s a big area of expansion for us. As you know, it's relatively low as a percentage of our investor base today, compared to some of our peers because our product set is really self-focused on long-term lockup funds that are really applicable to the highest end of the high net worth segment. We do have active campaigns planned or already underway for all of our products in market today with different channel partners to access high net worth capital. That would be true in TPG 9, Healthcare Partners 2, Rise 3, the Asia business, the secondaries business, life sciences, all of those, we have planned multiple engagements with high net worth channel partners. Typically, in a campaign like that, you don't lead with retail, you end up \u2013 you have your initial closes with institutions. So, the success we've had in raising capital across all these funds has actually been without much high net worth to date because we're planning those high net worth campaigns to follow the successful institutional closures that we already had. So, that's kind of upside from today forward. It's definitely the case. There's been a lot of written about this, but more weighted toward the lower end of the high net worth market, that some of the capital has been raised in more in more liquid vehicles with redemption rights. I think you're starting to see that the lower you go down the high net worth market, the more risk off mentality, we're starting to see kick in and high net worth market overall has definitely backed off of their growth at this point. We see that as a near- term issue. Longer term for us, we still see a lot of opportunity to expand our capital base in the channel.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude the Q&A portion of today's call. And I would like to turn it back over to Mr. Gary Stein for additional or closing remarks.\nGary Stein: Great. Thanks, operator. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. If you have any additional questions, please follow up with me or Ebony. Otherwise, we'll look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.\nJon Winkelried: Thanks, everyone.\nJack Weingart: Thank you.\nJim Coulter: Thanks.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's TPG's second quarter 2022 earnings call and webcast.

            "content": "Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. During our prepared remarks today, I'll touch on our recent performance and discuss a few highlights across our business. I'll then turn the call over to Jack to provide more details on our financial results followed by Q&A. We delivered strong financial results for the second quarter, despite a volatile global macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. These results highlight the momentum of our franchise, the strength of our portfolio, and the inherent growth in earnings power of our model. Our second quarter fee-related revenues of $256 million grew 43%, compared to the pro forma year ago quarter, while our fee-related earnings, or FRE, more than doubled to $102 million over the same period. This FRE growth, combined with $60 million of performance-related revenues in the quarter led to after-tax distributable earnings of $162 million, which more than tripled, compared to the pro forma year ago quarter. Driven by these strong results, we announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.39 a share, representing 85% of TPG's after-tax distributable earnings. As of June 30, we had $127 billion of total assets under management, an increase of 17% year-over-year. This growth was driven by significant fundraising activity across our business, led by first closings in the quarter for several of TPG's flagship funds, including TPG Capital Partners, healthcare partners and rise. In aggregate, we raised $13 billion during the second quarter, which is 120% increase versus the year ago quarter, and we raised a record $31 billion over the last 12 months. We're pleased with the strong support we have received from both our long-standing and newer limited partners. The success of our recently completed and ongoing fundraising campaigns is a testament to our excellent track record, strong LP relationships, and best-in-class team. In addition to our robust fundraising over the last quarter and 12 months, we invested $4 billion and $21 billion, respectively. And we delivered realizations of more than $4 billion and $28 billion, respectively. In aggregate, our investment portfolio generated value creation of 12% for the last 12 months, despite a 2% value decline in the second quarter. The global macro environment remains highly uncertain due to a confluence of factors, including inflationary pressures, rising interest rates, the ongoing war in Ukraine, and supply chain constraints. As long-term patient investors, we have successfully navigated TPG through a number of cycles and bounce of volatility over the last three decades and despite the existing backdrop, our business is performing well. While we couldn't have predicted the specific timing or drivers of the current downturn, we have been preparing for the onset of a more challenging market for some time. We aggressively monetized our portfolio during an attractive valuation environment with aggregate realizations totaling 1.3x the amount of capital we invested over the last 12 months. Importantly, at June 30, we had $39 billion of dry powder. The largest amount in the firm's history, representing 59% of our fee-generating AUM. With this large pool of dry powder, we believe we are well-positioned to deploy capital in this increasingly favorable investment environment. We expect to see more attractive investment opportunities across our core sectors and themes as sellers adapt to reset valuations and markets stabilize in the coming quarters. On the realization front, we recognized and leaned into the frothy market valuations over the last 18 to 24 months. Now that the environment has changed, we will still expect to selectively monetize investments in the coming quarters. Our pace will likely moderate. We have a strong relatively young portfolio of attractive companies, and we have a bias to remain patient and continue investing in these companies to build long-term value. I'd now like to walk you through some highlights across our business, starting with our largest platform capital which had [$62 billion] [ph] of total AUM as of June 30. During the quarter, our capital funds completed or announced several investments in companies, including Doc Genrici, a leading European specialty pharmaceuticals company based in Milan, and the pending take private of Covetrus, a leading U.S. animal-health technology and distribution services platform. Both of these transactions leverage our capabilities as one of the most active and experienced healthcare private equity investors, while building on thematic areas we have studied in diligence for many years. During the quarter, we also completed the acquisition of an additional stake in Sauce Labs, a leading provider of automated software testing solutions. This is a great example of the proprietary investment opportunities we create through the connectivity among our investment platforms. Our tech adjacencies fund, TTAD, first made a minority investment in Sauce Labs in 2019 and subsequently increased its position. This relationship enabled our capital team to engage Sauce Labs and its shareholders on a proprietary basis, which led to a majority investment. In the second quarter, we also helped on CAA's strategic acquisition of ICM, which enhanced its leadership position within the entertainment and sports industries. We first invested in CAA back in 2010. And last year, we moved it into a single asset continuation vehicle to maintain our majority ownership of this high-quality business. For the quarter, our capital funds generated total realizations of approximately $2 billion, including the partial sale and recapitalization of TPG Asia's investment in Greencross, Australia's largest pet care company. Next, our growth platform at $21 billion of total AUM at the end of the second quarter. As discussed, we have built our growth portfolio with a focus on sectors and teams like healthcare IT, digital transformation, and security and infrastructure were secular rather than cyclical growth drives performance. We are investing in well-established companies with strong financial profiles, and our investments are often through structured securities that provide some form of downside protection. Growth Platform had an active deployment quarter, including the completion of our investment in Mero Sodali, a leading global provider of shareholder engagement and corporate governance services. In addition, consistent with our hands-on approach and focus on bending the curve to drive transformational growth, we funded several strategic portfolio company acquisitions, including Kaseya's Take Private Datto to further scale as a leading provider of back-office infrastructure software. Denali's acquisition of Imperial Western Products to bolster its leadership position in organic waste management, Asia Healthcare Holdings acquisition of Dr. Agarwal's Healthcare, India's largest provider of eye care services, and People 2.0's acquisition of Brookson, a leading compliance and services platform for freelancers in the UK. During the quarter, we returned capital to our growth platform investors through several transactions, including partial monetizations for FreedomPay and Asia Healthcare Holdings. We also announced the strategic sale of implantable provider group to Evolent Health and completed the IPO of Campus Activewear in India. Campus is India's No. 1 sports and athleisure footwear brand and its public offering achieved the second highest subscription ever for an Indian consumer IPO at the time of pricing. Moving on, the Impact platform had total AUM of $15 billion as of June 30. During the quarter, our Impact funds deployed capital in a number of transactions such as Intersect Power, a leading integrated renewable energy platform, Summit Carbon Solutions, which is developing one of the largest carbon capture and storage systems in North America. Beta Technologies, which is developing electric aircraft capable of vertical takeoff and landing, and International Medical University, which operates medical colleges in Malaysia. I'd also note the Inflation Reduction Act is expected to stimulate substantial investment in climate-related technologies and solutions, which should provide a tailwind to some of our existing rise and rise climate portfolio companies and also create attractive investment opportunities going forward. Our real estate platform, which ended the second quarter with $20 billion of total AUM and had a substantial realization in the quarter, the sale of the remaining assets in ICON, which was our warehouse and logistics development venture in the U.K. On the deployment side, the real estate platform continues to add new investments at a measured pace, primarily across our student housing, rental housing, and life science themes. Before I turn the call over to Jack, I'd like to touch on our talent strategy, which is an integral component of TPG's culture. We remain focused on recruiting and retaining best-in-class talent. We recently announced mid-year promotions from more junior members of our investment team across six offices and five business units, and nearly 50% of these promotes identify as diverse. We also held our annual partner promotions, and this year's process was as rigorous and engaging as ever. Our successful partner candidates represented four offices globally and five different business units. And since 2019, 40% of our new partners have identified as diverse. During the quarter, our most senior leaders and I hosted our annual diversity, equity and inclusion [town hall] [ph]. This firm wide event is an important time for us to come together as a global firm to provide updates on our DEI strategy and progress and keep ourselves accountable as we continue to build our firm. I'd also like to highlight that today, we published our annual environmental, social, and governance review, which is available on our website. This report underscores TPG's commitment to advancing ESG performance within the firm and across our broader ecosystem and communities. Lastly, I'm also pleased to note that we recently added Gunther Bright as a new independent director to our board. Gunther is a distinguished leader who has delivered exceptional results as an executive at American Express, a former board member of McAfee, a member of various nonprofit boards. We are confident that his [breadth] [ph] of experience and leadership talent will enhance our board. I'd now like to turn the call over to Jack, so he can take you through our financial results. Good morning, Craig. Yes, Craig. It's Jon. First of all, I would say that our real estate portfolio, and I think we've talked about this before, is actually performing extremely well. And the places that we're exposed are places where, frankly, I think we feel good about being exposed. So, as you know, our focus from a sector perspective has been life sciences, industrial, rental, residential housing, student housing, data centers and studio content real estate. And we have very little, if any, significant exposure to office or retail, which obviously are down much more significantly. I think as a general matter, we've been reasonably conservative in terms of our marketing, even though our operating performance is actually exceptionally good. And one of the things that we do look at is we do look at across our entire business, public market comps and if you look at REITs in the market, as an example, REITs have had a pretty tough ride in this market downdraft. Just a couple of benchmarks for you. ProLogis, down 23%. EQR, down 19%. These are the largest industrial and apartment REITs. So, when you think about, sort of how we think about marking our book, I think we're being reasonably conservative in doing so. And I think that the areas where we're marking in relation to that, obviously, industrial, rental residential housing are places where we're taking into account those benchmarks relative to the rest of the portfolio, which is marked slightly stronger. So, I think it's fairly straightforward in terms of our approach to how we came through this quarter in our marks. Obviously, cap rates are up a bit with rates overall. The real estate securitization markets are much slower than they were with loan to values that are down, spread slightly wider, etcetera. Ken, just to clarify the first part of your question, I think on the [bid-ask spread] [ph], you're referring to within the [odd space] [ph], not just generally with respect to our portfolio company, right? Yes. Well, personally, [indiscernible] well, look, I think the first part of the question in terms of sort of the bid-ask spread, I think I would characterize as very, kind of bespoke or situational. It's very hard to kind of generalize because I think that we have, naturally, as we said during the IPO process, we're interested in continuing to expand our business. And as you know, most of our growth historically has been through organic developed growth. We continue to believe that will be an important growth driver for us. On the nonorganic or the acquisition side, I think that you would expect that we would be very targeted and focused on what we're adding, what the characteristics of it are? And I think there, it's very specific to the potential strategy firm people. So, I really have a hard time generalizing when it comes to that in terms of the bid-ask spread. So, people want to get paid a lot for the businesses, they do, particularly where generally the asset-class has had a tailwind over the last number of years. So, I would say that would \u2013 our judgment on it is, it continues to be quite situational and sort of one-off and specific. And I would reiterate that we do have a desire to continue to be forward leaning on filling in gaps in our business. I think that in particular, I think we continue to have some dialogue with various strategies across the credit space. We feel that generally in our rise and impact business that broadening our capabilities there in a number of different categories is something where we might be able to accelerate that by either acquiring something or something like an aqua hire, a team in a particular discipline. And so, we'll continue to be engaged in the market. Thank you. Glenn, it's Jon. Maybe what we'll do is start with monetizations. And I think I'll ask Todd who's here to talk a little bit about pace of monetizations and what we're seeing there, then we'll flip it over to deployment. And, Glenn, I think on deployment, look, I think where we're sitting, and I'm going to want to ask Jim, who is on the call as well to make a couple of comments here as well, but on the deployment pace, your observation about the level of dry powder and ours, in particular, is absolutely right. We've got a tremendous amount of dry powder, which we actually feel great about going into this cycle. We've talked about the sort of good ask spread dynamic in past calls. We still see that playing out. We clearly see from \u2013 if you go through my comments in terms of where we actually have deployed capital, we do see the adjustment process continuing. And there's actually, I think, overall, a fair amount of activity, and we really like the sectors and the themes where we've been focused for a while now. We really like what they're looking like and the opportunities that we're starting to see there. There's a lot of focus in the market, as you already know, on take privates, public to privates. And there's a lot of talk about that. I think that some of that is getting done and some of that will get done. They're not easy deals to get done, but I think they will get done because obviously, there's \u2013 given the public market reset, there's a number of clear opportunities there. So, we're engaged in some dialogue on deals like that. I think that we do start \u2013 we are starting to see some, kind of resetting of expectations in kind of sponsor-to-sponsor related activity. And then given, sort of our relative strengths here in terms of, for instance, our impact business. And when I mentioned about the new build, etcetera., Climate Technologies. I'm going to turn that over to Jim to just make a comment on that. Yes. Just last piece, Jack, why don't you talk a little bit about numbers on real estate. Jack, do you want to [indiscernible]? Sure. I would \u2013 I addressed this a little bit in my prepared remarks, but generally, the way I would characterize the way valuations came out on the private equity side is we definitely have aggregate revenue and earnings growth across our portfolio that is exceeding the comparable companies as we look at that metric. So, as we look \u2013 we, on average, took our valuation multiples down for the quarter, but that was almost offset by the growth in earnings. Sure. First of all, the current focus continues to be on completing the fundraising campaigns that we've talked about and scaling our existing businesses. In addition to that, and as I mentioned, those campaigns, TPG 9, Healthcare Partners 2, the Rise Funds, the Asia Fund, which we'll talk about our first close this quarter. We'll probably continue to play out over the next 9 months to 12 months as we complete those campaigns. In addition to that, as we've talked about in prior calls, we are continuing to focus on organic growth through new business creation. And the two areas I'd point to that we're most focused on are secondaries and life sciences. And as we play out the back half of this year, we'll update you on probably initial closes across both of those platforms, which will also by the way, which will also extend into 2023. And then on your team point, I think we have a very strong and stable team in the region in the capital business and [indiscernible] business elsewhere. And so, we feel like we're building from a really good base. And it's more steady as she goes with some incremental hiring and selective additions, but starting from a really good place. Jim, why don't you start with the [indiscernible] platform? Thanks, everyone."

            "name": "Todd Sisitsky",
            "content": "Yes. First of all, thanks, Glenn for the question. We're very cycle aware. And so, during this last period, as you know, we were very active on the monetization front. And I think our \u2013 the relationship between monetizations and new investments for us over the past year or two was one of the highest in the industry. During that time period, a substantial majority of what we did on the monetization front, we're not IPOs, but were sales. And many of those were too strategic. And I think to your point, some of these strategic sales do continue to pay. So, the dialogues that you have during those periods, they may not be quite as active during this period on as many fronts, but there still is, I think, enacted [indiscernible] some of our companies and several of our portfolios.  And so during periods like this, we see a moderation. And I think it's quite possible to end up slipping to more of a net buyer and we'll talk about the deployment pace in a moment, but the opportunities are still there. These companies that we've built over many years, we feel like we've made the more strategic, more growth. And that's why we are such a high number of companies that end up in strategic hands and those continue to be opportunities in different types of economic cycles. So, moderation, yes, the dialogues are ongoing. And frankly, we continue to feel like there's going to be opportunities in the quarters and years ahead on the modernization front. Sure. It's Todd. Thanks to question. Let me start just on the European front. This is a geography we've been in \u2013 really since the beginning of the firm. So, it is important to us. And we've made a lot of progress, I think, in recent years. I think, as Jon mentioned, we just announced a large healthcare deal, [indiscernible]. We have one of the co-heads of the TPG Capital Healthcare platform who works out London with a great team. And so, we're really building our pipeline and our presence there. In real estate, which is another of our global strengths, we have a strong presence with a number of partners and senior team members who have had a lot of success both on the investment and the \u2013 on the liquidity front. And so, Europe for us, we're continuing to grow. We have sort of leaned in, particularly in our strengths. And it also has become an increasingly important place for us from a fundraising perspective. So, I can't remember how much trips and weekends and we spent over in Europe personally. We had a dozen team members over for the [indiscernible] conference. We have a number of new relationships and we've been building across the platforms from a fund raising standpoint in Europe. So, it's an important area for us. We are putting a lot of energy against it. We're spending a lot of time as a senior leadership team in Europe trying to continue to grow the business. And fundamentally, we're leading our strengths as a global platform to keep on our European presence."

            "name": "Jim Coulter",
            "content": "The pending bill \u2013 this is Jim, by the way, the pending bill is probably should drive an interesting discussion on investment opportunities in the climate space. Those of you who have followed it know that it's unlike traditional attempts in climate mitigation. Traditional attempts have been adding cash taxes to admitters. This bill is almost 100% incentives. It's a [indiscernible] bill driven to drive investment. And obviously, that serves us well. To give you a sense, there's three things that we're focused on, first of all, in our existing portfolio, probably 60% to 70% of what we've deployed was deployed, assuming these incentives weren't in place and it has a very positive effect on that deployment, but more importantly, repeat, which is someone who scores the bill basically expects this bill to drive $3 trillion of investment in the climate space. Personally, I think of that is \u2013 that that investment is going to happen, you probably have to release double your money. So, that's a very substantial potential profit pool for investments, and that should open the aperture of deals that will make sense for us given our high hurdle.  And lastly, the U.S. tends to drive technological advancement around the world. So, driving changes in the U.S. market, I think, is going to increase our aperture globally. So, I think not well talked about yet, but interesting is looking forward for deployment in the climate space that should have a very interesting effect. Yes. Michael, it's Jim. We feel good about the progress of building the existing team. As Jon pointed out, deployment in the impact space has been strong this year. So, I'm not in any way concerned about team. Over time, I think there are opportunities for either organic or inorganic growth to allow us to expand the types of pools of capital we're deploying in the space. So, obviously, our focus right now is on Climate PE, but there are clear adjacencies around that, that we could either organically or inorganically grow into. And I think the climate bill will accelerate LP's views of the exposure they want to build in this area. Yes. Jon, I would add in that the people tend to focus on our flagship fund and perhaps miss some of the strength of our Asia franchise, given the impact and growth investing is done through our global funds I would note that we probably had the highest profile climate investment in Asia last year with our investment in \u2013 a billion investment in Tata Motors. Jon mentioned the IPO in India out of our growth platform and the most recent is investment was a Malaysian medical school. So, we have a substantial footprint across several of our platforms to grow our products out there. Yes. For impact and particularly, I'll focus on climate for a moment. It's very clear to me that the $150 trillion expected global investing in climate transition is going to spread across traditional asset classes. And just as we saw in technology that assets that started in private equity like data center and tower has eventually move into infrastructure at an accelerated pace. The same is going to happen here. It's already happening in renewables and it will happen in a number of other of the themes that we're playing. So, from our thematic approach, there's clear opportunities in infrastructure. And as the companies we create in private equity mature, there will be clear opportunities in crossover investing between the public and private market. And finally, if you look at the capital that's been set up for this transition. A lot of it will be in the private credit markets. And I think there's an opportunity to address that entering on a thematic basis, as well as entering from a credit perspective. So, this is early days in a very large area, and we're making sure that we're considering all of the adjacencies while also being prudent in capital deployment pace. Thanks."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Jack Weingart",
            "content": "Thanks Jon, and good morning everyone. I'll briefly walk through our financial results and highlight some of the more significant points regarding our second quarter performance. Our total assets under management grew from $108 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2021 to $127 billion as of June 30 of this year. The key drivers of the 17% increase were the $31 billion of capital raised that Jon mentioned, combined with $15 billion of value creation from our underlying fund investments, partially offset by $28 billion of realizations that were returned to our fund investments during the same period.  Fee Earning AUM increased from $52 billion at June 30 2021 to $67 billion at June 30, 2022. This 28% increase was driven primarily by raising nearly $17 billion in fee earning capital across our platforms, most notably in real estate and impact. Additionally, proforma for the recent activation of our next flagship Capital and Healthcare Partners funds, which I'll discuss momentarily, our fee earning AUM is now $73 billion, which is a 39% increase, compared to the second quarter of 2021. At June 30, approximately 84% of our AUM and 77% of our fee earning AUM was in either perpetual or long-dated funds with a duration at inception of 10 years or longer. In addition, 80% of our fee earning AUM at a remaining duration of five or more years at the end of the second year. We had nearly $16 billion of AUM subject to fee earning growth, including more than $13 billion, not yet earning fees at the end of the second quarter. Despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, the fundamental performance of our portfolio companies remain strong, with aggregate revenue and EBITDA growth well above market, which we believe is a result of our hands-on approach and thematic sector-based investing in areas with secular growth trends. This strong performance, partially offset the declining multiple environment in the quarter, leading to a valuation decline of 2%. Looking at our income statement, we recorded a GAAP net loss for the second quarter of $10 million. Regarding our non-GAAP results, we reported fee-related revenues for the second quarter of $256 million, an FRE of $102 million. Our FRE more than doubled versus the pro forma year ago quarter, driven by a combination of top line growth and management fees and the ongoing expansion of our FRE margin. Our FRE margin was 40% for the second quarter, up from 38% in the first quarter of this year. As we have indicated previously, we expect continued FRE margin expansion as we scale our business and drive operating leverage with an FRE margin target of 45% by the end of next year. Our after-tax distributable earnings were $162 million, which was more than 3x the pro forma year ago quarter, driven by the growth in FRE and by realized performance allocations of $60 million in the second quarter. Turning to the non-GAAP balance sheet for TPG Operating Group, as of June 30, which is reflective of our balance sheet like business model, we are well capitalized with $585 million of cash and $450 million of long-term debt. In July, we also upsized our undrawn credit facility from $300 million to $700 million to provide us with additional financial flexibility.  We also had a net accrued performance allocation balance, which represents the 20% allocation to the TPG Operating Group of $677 million. This decreased from $796 million at the end of the first quarter, driven by a $60 million of realizations and a $60 million unrealized non-cash decline in mark-to-market valuations. A notable component of our performance allocation balance as of June 30 is related to the sale of Wind River, which we've discussed on previous calls. This transaction is currently under regulatory review, and we are now targeting a closing by year-end. I'd also like to note that as of June 30, a $114 billion or 90% of our total AUM was eligible for performance allocations.  On fundraising, we delivered an exceptional quarter with $13 billion of capital raised and a record $31 billion raised over the last 12 months despite headwinds across the industry. I'd like to provide you with a bit more detail and an update regarding additional fundraising post quarter end. I mentioned on our last call that we expected to hold first closes for three funds around mid-year, our flagship TPG Capital, Healthcare Partners, and Rise Funds. In all three cases, we held rolling first closes that began at the end of the second quarter and finished after quarter-end. On TPG Capital and Healthcare Partners, where we've articulated a combined target of $18.5 billion, we closed on $8 billion during Q2, as you saw in the earnings release and another $2.7 billion in the past month bringing the combined first close to $10.6 billion. On Rise, where we've articulated a target of $3 billion, we closed on $1.3 billion during Q2 and another $300 million in the past month, bringing the total first close to $1.6 billion. On the TPG Asia front, as I mentioned on our last call, we expect to complete our first close this quarter, Q3 and we'll have more to report on this during our next earnings call. On our real estate platform, we raised $2.3 billion for our fourth opportunistic real estate funds in the second quarter. We have reached the hard cap for this fund, and we expect to complete fundraising this quarter with our internal capital commitments at a total fund size of approximately $6.8 billion. Finally, a comment on the timing of activation of TPG 9 and Healthcare Partners. We had not activated these funds as of June 30, which is why the $8 billion does not show up in our fee earning AUM numbers at quarter-end. Since then, we finished investing TPG 8 and Healthcare Partners 1, so we have now activated the new flagship funds as of mid-July.  While the remainder of our fundraising campaigns may be extended for reasons that have been well discussed across the industry. We are very pleased with our strong start, and we look forward to updating you on our continued progress in future quarters. Taking a step back, we are proud of our strong second quarter results and the momentum we're generating across our business. We believe our investment portfolios are performing well amidst the volatile market backdrop, and we're working closely with our portfolio of companies to build long-term value. In addition, we continue to expect strong growth in fee-generating assets under management, and fee-related earnings as a result of our ongoing broad-based fundraising campaigns. With that, I'd now like to turn the call back over to the operator, so we can take your questions. Yes. Thanks for the question, Craig. Look, we've been talking for a few quarters now about the fundraising market challenges and the fact that I think all fundraising campaigns across the industry will be more extended than usual. And that, I think, remains the case for the reasons you're articulating. Against that backdrop, we couldn't be happier or more proud of the progress we made as of the end of the quarter and the subsequent quarters I just referred to. I do think as we look out toward the completion of those campaigns that I wouldn't expect them to be complete by the end of the year. I think all of them will extend into next year. Sure. Thanks, Alex, it's Jack. I would say consistent with, I think, my comments on the prior call, we're definitely seeing a bit of a mix shift in the LP base, first of all, given that the current dynamics in the fundraising market are affecting some segments of the market more than others. I would say that the composition of an LP base is much more international, this cycle than it was last cycle. If you compare the TPG 9 and Healthcare Partners 2, for example, all the capital we've closed on to date, about 35% or so is domestic U.S. capital in the same funds last time, TPG Healthcare 1, it was about 47%. So, a mix shift toward more international capital and a mix shift with pensions representing a bit lower percentage and areas like sovereign wealth increasing. And then I would also say we're definitely successfully expanding our LP base during this broad-based fundraising campaign. We've added \u2013 I don't have exactly the amount of capital we've added from new LPs, but it's a substantial portion of our fundraising process. Yes. Thanks for the question, Brian. Look, I think \u2013 I mean, you guys all have models to understand how our business works. The fact that we accelerated the timing of our first closes on our large flagship funds is meaningful, and that should continue to drive good FRE margin expansion. You can never time these things exactly in terms of how our continued investment in people to grow our business coincides relative to the growth of our capital base and the activation of new capital. But now that we've activated those funds that will provide a good bolus to additional management fee growth in the back half of the year. I think that will, to answer your question, allow us to maintain or grow the 40% FRE margin in the back half of the year. Again, toward our target as we complete these fundraises. Sure, Glenn, just to give you a little more color on the realization pipeline. I think I mentioned on the last call that we had $125 million or so of realizations that were contractually committed, but had not yet closed. Obviously, you saw in the second quarter that we delivered $60 million of actual realizations. And as we sit here today, we still have over $100 million of allocable performance allocations signed, but not yet closed. I think Jon's comments were beyond that, our bias at this point is to be selective on monetizations. Given how aggressive we were at selling assets in the past 12 months to 18 months, we currently have a very young, very interesting portfolio of companies, and our bias is to work with the management teams to build those \u2013 build long-term value in that portfolio unless we see very attractive exit opportunities. Sure. On the expense front, we're definitely continuing to invest in talent to support the growth of our business. So far this year, we've added over 125 new employees to the firm, and that's been pretty broad-based across investment and services platforms. And to answer your question, we do continue to expect an increase in the comp and benefits expense line through next year. The timing of that is always hard to predict based on where we find the right people for the right roles, but through next year, I'd expect continued growth in the comp and benefits line. OpEx is up in the high 50s as our business rebounds as we have people back in the office as we're all traveling more. And that's \u2013 I would expect continued growth in that line, but it is at a more moderate pace than the comp and benefits line. I alluded to this before in my comments, but we still do have a focus on expanding the platform and unclear. At this point, we are looking \u2013 we are evaluating a couple of different options, including, as I said, acquisitions/Aqua hire, which I think would be sort of consistent with what you're talking about in terms of bringing in a team. So, we remain focused on it and at some point, hopefully, we'll have more to say on it. I mean just important to reemphasize that the flagship fund, obviously, is the base of our business, the core of our business and getting that fund raised and getting that fund raised and completed is our \u2013 frankly, right now is our real focus. I think that going forward, there are a couple of other areas that we have thought about before that could be interesting. I guess I would characterize those as real estate is one of them, which is an area that might be interesting for us going forward, big asset class in the region, obviously, credit is another area that could also be interesting. And I would say, a strategy perhaps that mirrors what we do here in our tech adjacencies fund, but perhaps in a slightly broader context of industries and verticals. And what I mean by that is essentially hybrid return type structures that might be at a slightly different return \u2013 in slightly different return category than our private equity focus in the region might also be a place that we see opportunities. So, once we get through our fund raise for our core Asia fund, we're going to be thinking about other potential opportunities. Hi, Brian, it's Jack. On retail, high net worth, we definitely continue to see longer-term high net worth, it's a big area of expansion for us. As you know, it's relatively low as a percentage of our investor base today, compared to some of our peers because our product set is really self-focused on long-term lockup funds that are really applicable to the highest end of the high net worth segment. We do have active campaigns planned or already underway for all of our products in market today with different channel partners to access high net worth capital. That would be true in TPG 9, Healthcare Partners 2, Rise 3, the Asia business, the secondaries business, life sciences, all of those, we have planned multiple engagements with high net worth channel partners. Typically, in a campaign like that, you don't lead with retail, you end up \u2013 you have your initial closes with institutions. So, the success we've had in raising capital across all these funds has actually been without much high net worth to date because we're planning those high net worth campaigns to follow the successful institutional closures that we already had. So, that's kind of upside from today forward. It's definitely the case. There's been a lot of written about this, but more weighted toward the lower end of the high net worth market, that some of the capital has been raised in more in more liquid vehicles with redemption rights. I think you're starting to see that the lower you go down the high net worth market, the more risk off mentality, we're starting to see kick in and high net worth market overall has definitely backed off of their growth at this point. We see that as a near- term issue. Longer term for us, we still see a lot of opportunity to expand our capital base in the channel. Thank you."

I'd now like to turn the call over to Jon Winkelried, Chief Executive Officer.\nJon Winkelried: Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. Following our IPO in January, we hosted our first public earnings call at the end of March. Since we spoke with you just about six weeks ago, we're going to keep today's prepared remarks relatively brief. I'll touch on our recent performance and discuss a few highlights across our business. I'll then turn the call over to Jack to provide more detail on our financial results, and then we'll take your questions. As of March 31, we had more than $120 billion of total assets under management, which increased 6% versus the prior quarter and 26% year-over-year. This growth was driven by a combination of strong investment performance and fundraising across our five platforms, partially offset by a continued pace of significant realization activity. We raised $5 billion during the quarter, driven primarily by strong demand for our fourth opportunistic real estate fund, and we raised $24 billion over the last 12 months. We invested $4 billion in the first quarter and $22 billion during the last 12 months. We also had nearly $5 billion of realizations in the quarter and $29 billion over the last 12 months. In aggregate, our investments generated value creation of 33% for the last 12 months and 7% in the first quarter. Approximately 2/3 of the Q1 value creation is attributable to exit agreements signed during the quarter at significant valuations. Adjusting for these realization events, our value creation for the quarter would have been approximately 2%. In connection with our earnings release this morning, we announced our first quarterly cash dividend of $0.44 per share of Class A common stock, representing 85% of TPG's after-tax distributable earnings. Jack will provide some more detail on the dividend. As we discussed when we spoke with you six weeks ago, the global geopolitical and economic landscape remains highly uncertain due to a number of significant macro factors, including the ongoing tragic conflict in Ukraine, a U.S. inflation rate that has reached a four-year high and a rising interest rate environment that has driven U.S. mortgage rates up 5% for the first time in more than a decade. As an investment-led organization operating in this volatile environment, we are continuing to adhere to our strategy and rigorous approach across all our platforms. We have been anticipating the onset of choppier markets, and this expectation has shaped how we've been investing our funds and managing our portfolios. We've been proactively monetizing investments and have returned significant amounts of capital to our limited partners. Over the last 12 months, during a period of very active capital deployment, we have, in fact, returned materially more capital than we invested. The current market reset is presenting us with a range of investment opportunities at more interesting valuations, and our pipeline of actionable opportunities is growing at a time when there are fewer competitive sources of capital such as IPOs and SPACs. We are fortunate to have a substantial amount of committed but uncalled capital available to invest, $30 billion as of March 31. With this backdrop in mind, I'd like to spend a few minutes walking you through some highlights across our business, starting with our largest platform, Capital, which had $57 billion of total AUM at the end of the first quarter. Our Capital funds had value accretion of 11% during the quarter. As I mentioned a minute ago, this value creation reflects several significant signed exits. Adjusting for those exits, the first quarter value creation for our Capital portfolio was approximately 2%, outperforming broader market indices. The ongoing value creation in our portfolio underscores our distinct investing style and our focus on companies and sectors that continue to grow revenue and earnings despite the volatile macro environment. During the first quarter, our capital funds invested nearly $2 billion in companies such as Confluent Medical Technologies, a leading contract development and manufacturing partner to medical device companies. This investment leverages our capabilities as one of the most active and experienced health care private equity investors and builds on our multi-decade thematic focus on value-added outsourced medical products dating back to our original investment in Quintiles. Also during the quarter, TPG Capital Asia announced an investment in Fractal Analytics, India's largest outsourced provider of artificial intelligence solutions to Fortune 500 companies. This investment stems from our position as a leading technology investor and our thematic coverage of digital services on a global scale. For the quarter, our capital funds generated total realizations of approximately $4 billion, including the $14 billion take-private of McAfee and the recapitalizations of both Novatek Health Holdings, Asia's largest biotech-focused contract research organization; and Greencross, Australia's largest pet care company. Let me turn to our Growth platform which had $22 billion of total AUM at the end of the first quarter. This platform provides flexible capital at scale for growing businesses through our growth, tech adjacencies and digital media funds. Despite the broader market weakness we have been discussing this morning, our Growth funds continue to perform well, with aggregate value creation of 1.5% in the first quarter and 23% for the last 12 months. We have built our Growth portfolio with a late cycle mindset and a focus on sectors and themes like cybersecurity, ad tech and health care where secular rather than cyclical growth is the driver of performance. In addition, given the scale of capital we're deploying, we are generally investing in later-stage companies that have strong financial profiles and where we can help bend their growth curves with the substantial resources TPG brings to bear. Looking at capital invested in the Growth platform during the quarter. In addition to the investments in project44 and express fees that we mentioned on our last call, I'd also like to highlight [TTET] and Rise's investment in Acorns, a leading mobile savings and investment platform with more than 4.7 million subscribers. This investment is a great example of how the recent market reset is accelerating the pace of investment opportunities for us as competitive sources of capital have been sidelined. Acorns have been planning to raise capital through a SPAC transaction, but with that market experiencing significant volatility, we were able to invest capital on attractive terms and position the Company for continued growth. During the first quarter, we also returned capital to our Growth fund investors through several transactions, including the full monetization of our stake in Toast, a leading SaaS provider for the restaurant industry, and a partial monetization of our investment in Asia Healthcare Holdings. Moving on, I'd like to briefly discuss our Impact platform, which had total AUM of $14 billion as of March 31. This includes our inaugural Rise Climate Fund, which recently announced its final close at its hard cap of $7.3 billion. TPG Rise Climate has already committed more than $2 billion of capital to catalyze climate action and scale companies across the sector. Our Impact funds had aggregate value creation of 1% in the first quarter and 31% for the last 12 months. During the quarter, our Impact funds invested $1.5 billion, including the first tranche of Rise Climate's investment in a newly created electrical vehicle subsidiary of India's Tata Motors. In addition, our Rise and Rise Climate Funds announced a $500 million investment in Nextracker, the number one global provider of solar tracker and software solutions for utility scale solar projects around the world. Turning to Real Estate. This platform ended the first quarter with $18 billion of total AUM, which increased more than 40% from the prior quarter, primarily due to raising an additional $4.3 billion of capital for our current opportunistic fund, which now stands at $6.4 billion raised. TPG's Real Estate platform delivered value creation of 6% for the first quarter and 26% for the last 12 months across our Opportunistic and Core Plus funds. In the first quarter, our Opportunistic fund made a follow-on investment in Dogwood Industrial Properties, a platform we established in 2019, to build a portfolio of multi-tenant logistics facilities throughout the United States. In addition, our Core Plus funds completed an investment through [Dunewood Residential Properties], which is a new platform that is building a portfolio of differentiated multifamily assets in markets with attractive secular growth dynamics and supply constraints. Finally, I'd like to touch on our Market Solutions platform, which had $10 billion of total AUM at the end of the first quarter across several strategies, including our long, short and long-only public investing funds and Private Market Solutions, which is our secondaries business focused on GP solutions. In addition, during the first quarter, our debt Capital Markets Group led seven fee-generating transactions, including the recapitalization of Greencross, which we believe was the first covenant-light direct lender deal completed in Australia and one of the largest unitranche deals ever done in Asia. Taking a step back, I'd like to highlight our talent strategy, a key element of our firm's culture and a topic we discussed in detail with many of you leading up to our IPO in January. Retaining and recruiting the best talent continues to be an important strategic area of focus for us, particularly in this competitive -- increasingly competitive job market. The strength of our culture, which is enabled by an exceptional group of talented and diverse people, is the result of deep investment over the years, and we work hard to constantly reinforce it. This manifests itself in several ways. For instance, in March, several firm leaders and I hosted a global promotions program where 140 members of the TPG team were promoted at the end of 2021. Among this promote class, 48% identify as diverse across gender, race or ethnicity. Our focus on creating career paths with enhanced opportunity and upward mobility has never been more important and it will continue to be an area of focus for our entire team. Our effort to continuously develop and engage talent goes beyond the four walls of TPG. Last month, along with a number of our peers, we engaged as a founding partner of Ownership Works, a nonprofit that seeks to accelerate the development of broad employee ownership programs. Two senior members of our management team have joined the Board of Ownership Works: our President, Todd Sisitsky and Maryanne Hancock, CEO of Y Analytics. We believe it is important to express our commitment to our people both at TPG and across our portfolio, and Ownership Works is one important example of how we can drive meaningful engagement beyond our firm. Overall, we're very pleased with our financial and operational results for the first quarter of 2022, which highlights the momentum we are continuing to generate across our five platforms despite a more challenging operating environment. We also remain intently focused on capital form risk with our broad-based fundraising campaigns. I'd now like to turn the call over to Jack.\nJack Weingart: Thanks, Jon, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to briefly walk through our financial results and highlight some of the more significant points regarding our first quarter performance. [indiscernible] grew, as Jon mentioned, from $95 billion at the end of the first quarter of '21 to more than [indiscernible]. The drivers of this 26% increase during the last 12 months include $29 billion of value creation from our underlying fund investments and $24 billion from capital raising, partially offset by $29 billion of realizations that were returned to our fund investors during the same period. Fee-earning AUM increased from $51 billion in March '21 to approximately $64 billion as of March 31, 2022. And this 26% percent increase was driven primarily [indiscernible] in fee-earning. At the end of the first quarter of '22, approximately 84% of our AUM and 79% of our fee-earning AUM was either perpetual or long-dated funds [indiscernible] of 10 years or longer. In addition, 78% of our fee-earning AUM had a [indiscernible] or more years as of the end of the first quarter. As of March 31, we had approximately $9 billion of AUM subject to fee-earning growth, including nearly $7 billion not yet earning fees, and our funds had more than $30 billion of available capital for future investment. Turning to our income statement. We recorded GAAP net income for the first quarter of $163 million. On our previous call, I provided guidance regarding our expectations for Q1 non-GAAP results and our reported results for the first quarter came in at or above that guidance on all key metrics. We reported fee-related revenues for the first quarter of $241 million, and we reported fee-related earnings, or FRE, of $92 million. Our FRE grew 38% versus the pro forma year ago quarter -- and growth in management fees [indiscernible] and margins as we continue to scale our business and generate [indiscernible] margin was 38% for the first [indiscernible] in the first quarter of 2021 on a pro forma basis. Our after-tax distributable [indiscernible] which more than tripled versus the pro forma year-ago quarter, driven by growth in FRE and by realized performance allocations of $122 million. Turning to the non-GAAP balance sheet for TPG Operating Group. As of March 31, which is reflective of our balance sheet light business model, we are well capitalized with $583 million of cash and $450 million of long-term debt. We also had net accrued performance allocation balance, which represents the 20% allocation to the TPG Operating Group, of $796 million, an increase from the $769 million at the end of '21. I'd like to note that as of March 31, $107 billion, or 89% of our total AUM, was eligible for performance allocations; and $85 billion or 71% was generating performance allocations. On the fundraising side, my comments on the last call regarding the overall market conditions remain true. The market is crowded with managers raising capital, some sooner than their clients expected and certain segments of the market are temporarily over-allocated. Fundraising campaigns industry-wide will likely take longer than usual to complete. Against that backdrop, our fundraising momentum remains strong. As Jon said, we raised over $5 billion during the first quarter, more than 3x the amount that we raised during the first quarter of 2021. On the Impact platform, we had a final close last month of our Rise Climate Fund at the hard cap of $7.3 billion, and we expect to first close on our next broad-based Impact fund around midyear. Our next opportunistic Real Estate fund is oversubscribed, and we will soon hold our final close at the hard cap of $6.5 billion. On the Capital platform, as you know, we continue to see strong demand for our three core products: TPG Capital, Healthcare Partners and TPG Asia. We expect to complete accelerated first closings for TPG Capital and Healthcare Partners around midyear, followed by TPG Asia's first close shortly thereafter. We will have more to report on these campaigns during the second quarter call. Before I wrap up my prepared remarks, I'd like to provide some additional detail regarding our first quarterly cash dividend as a public company. As a reminder, our current intention is to pay out to shareholders at least 85% of the after-tax distributable earnings attributable to TPG Inc. on a quarterly basis, subject to necessary approvals. Consistent with this approach, we announced this morning a cash dividend of $0.44 per share of Class A common stock, which will be payable on June 3 to record holders as of the close of business on May 20. I would note that the non-GAAP effective tax rate in Q1 was slightly higher than what we have previously indicated due to certain IPO-related costs recognized during the quarter that were deferred for tax purposes. Finally, our fully diluted share count at the end of the first quarter, including unvested RSUs, was approximately 320 million shares. Taking a step back, we feel very good about our first quarter results and the progress we continue to make driving growth across our business. Our investment portfolio delivered strong value creation. Despite the turbulent market backdrop, we have maintained a solid pace of capital deployment, while also returning significant amounts of capital and profits back to our investors. In addition, we continue to expect strong growth in AUM and FRE as a result of our broad-based fundraising campaigns. With that, I'd now like to turn the call back over to the operator so we can take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Craig Siegenthaler. So just starting with fundraising, and I heard the comments on certain verticals were over-allocated, but you do have a busy calendar this year. It looks like maybe private equity may be the most crowded, plus you're also dealing with the denominator effect of lower public markets. How does this impact the timing of your raises? And then also, coming back to what you said, which verticals do you view as the most over-allocated?\nJack Weingart: Yes. Thanks, Craig. When you say verticals, I would think about it more in terms of segments of the LP marketplace. And consistent with other discussions that have been had in the industry, the most impacted part of the market we see is in the traditional U.S. pension fund market kind of most over-allocated based on the metrics that you talked about. The outperformance, the alternatives in their portfolio, combined with the sell-off in the public markets, causing the denominator effect. And the third piece is a lot of GPs coming back to market faster than they had planned. So it's a credit fundraising market. And their -- that segment of the market in particular is having to make choices for the first time in a while. And what we see happening is those choices are benefiting the largest, most established GPs with the strongest relationships. And we are fortunate to be a part of that group. And I think anyone who's returned a lot of capital to LPs as opposed to really just drawing down capital and coming back to ask for more is also seeing the benefit, and we are clearly in that camp. The other segments of the market, there are lots of pockets of continued growth despite the crowded market, mostly in some of the international segments of the market, Asia, Middle East, even in Europe. So we see -- I think I would expect the result of these fund-raising campaigns, in part, to -- we'll see a shift of the composition of our LP base, reflecting the different dynamics in those different segments. So that's how I described kind of the fund-raising market overall. As it relates to our timing, like when we went public, we articulated and expected a close for the Capital funds, which are the largest pools of capital. I didn't -- we haven't yet closed. And Real Estate, just to reiterate what I just said, we had -- we'll soon have our final close on the next Opportunistic fund. On the Impact side, we raised a large climate fund. That finished closing in the first quarter. And so we have the large Capital funds, and we have the next broad-based Impact Fund Rise 3. When we -- at the IPO, we talked about the capital funds having a close and activating closer to the end of the year, and we continue to see good momentum in those campaigns and we continue to expect a first close in the Capital and Healthcare fund around midyear, as I mentioned. So we'll have more to talk about the size of those closings in the Q2 call.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Worthington from JPMorgan.\nKen Brooks: Great. TPG had an interest in rounding out its product offering, possibly creditor infrastructure via M&A. Maybe talk about how the further challenging market environment, what that really means for the interest and actually getting something done there. And maybe what you're seeing in the private market valuations versus what we're seeing in the public side at this point?\nJon Winkelried: Yes. I think we talked about -- this is Jon. We talked about that on our last call. We talked about that obviously when we were on the road. I think that we do have an interest in continuing to grow our platform and diversifying the product base. We're -- we've been in a reasonable level of dialogue just in terms of continuing to understand the market. I think we're going to be -- and this is consistent with what we've said before, we're going to be very thoughtful about what we do, both from the perspective of fit in terms of how it fits with our firm as well as value -- evaluation. And clearly, we've been through, over the course of the first quarter, as an example, right, we've been through a -- I don't have to tell you, we've been through a substantial revaluation in our own space. And probably -- I mean, I would expect, like anything else, just like we're seeing on the deal front, they take some time for value expectations in terms of where sellers are and where buyers are to adjust. But we're -- we continue to be interested in doing it. There's nothing specific that we have to report to you now on that, but we remain focused.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs.\nAlex Blostein: Well, I was hoping you could spend a couple of minutes on the valuation framework in super volatile markets that we've seen, obviously, over the last several months. And here, you pointed out positioning the portfolio to be kind of late cycle proof, and it sounds like the fundamentals of the portfolio companies are doing quite well. But I'm more curious about impacts of higher interest rates and just lower growth multiples that we're seeing in the market today and how that flows through the valuation technology you guys have in the portfolio and whether or not that's a headwind we need to be thinking about over the next couple of quarters to extend there any sort of delays in the valuation framework.\nJon Winkelried: Yes. Thanks, Alex. I think Todd Sisitsky, who's actually on our London office, is going to respond to that.\nTodd Sisitsky: Sure. Yes, I hope you can hear me well. Thank you for the question. I think there's a few sort of questions built into that. I would tell you that we actually find -- we feel very good about our strategy and our brand of growth and transformation investing in the current market. And feel like the companies, as you point out -- suggested, we feel quite positive about how the portfolio is held in there. It sounds like your question's a little bit more about the go-forward approach. I would tell you that in general, there are a lot of positives in this market for us. So this is a pretty exciting time. We have seen historically, over the 30 years we've been doing this, that really some of our best investments and vintages following this strategy have followed a public market reset. And it happens in the context of a challenging macro environment. And the first big investment that was done after the global financial crisis in 2009 was IMS, which we've followed for seven years before that, but it was really only in this environment that we were able to come up with the transaction management and the Board that worked. That company is now IQVIA, a $40-plus billion market cap company. So the question of whether we are able to find interesting growth opportunities following our strategy in this environment, I understand the macro concerns of growth. But I would tell you the way we think about it, and just maybe to use a broader construct that we think about when we invest, is that we distinguish between what we think of as interesting to us as investors, the themes and the segments that we want to follow and study every year; and what's actionable, what happens to be for sale. And we actually very intentionally deliberately focus on what we think is interesting, even if it's not actionable. So what's exciting about this moment in the cycle is we often find the areas that we've studied and are excited about. The management teams we want to back, that we've learned to develop relationships over the years. They become actionable at this moment. And when they do, we really capitalize on all the work that we've done on the teams and we work aggressively and with conviction and as a firm. So we find it actually be a very interesting market moment for us given the strategy that we have.\nJim Coulter: Yes. Alex, it's Jim Coulter. Let me take you into the front lines of the market for a second and an area that I'm spending a lot of time, which is in climate. The experience last year was often that a company would come in saying that they would like to be financed at a price of X. We would say, \"No, we're much below that.\" And it would be financed in the SPAC for -- through a momentum investor at X plus 25%. We sort of scratched our head. This year has been a complete about-face to where that company, which needs to finance given its capital plan in this environment, essentially is coming in and saying they'd like to be financed at X. We say half X. They go away and come back to us pretty quickly. So the market is resetting as you're taking out a series of competitors that were either market-based in their valuation techniques or momentum-based than what was happening in the growth marketplace. So what we're seeing here is a fundamental reset. And as net sellers last year, there's an opportunity to be very disciplined net buyers this year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Lee from KBW.\nRobert Lee: Jack, maybe a question for you. indicating that a chunk of the value creation coming from, I guess, some signed contracts on, I guess, potential exits. Can you update us on what we should be thinking about for utilization at the Q2, Q3, just given that you already signed and kind of in the bucket, so to speak?\nJack Weingart: Sure. Rob, thanks for the question. So I talked on the last call about the fact that we had over $200 million of performance allocations to TPG Inc. that were already locked based on signed contracts. What you saw come through in the first quarter of $122 million of performance allocations. Approximately -- think about half of that $200 million, call it, the $100 million of that, came from the transactions that I mentioned on the last call, and the rest came from additional monetizations that occurred during the quarter. So, as we look forward -- and we don't forecast PRE from potential sales that may or may not happen later in the year. But again, using the framework from the last call, if I just think about the companies that we've already agreed contractually to sell, what's already in the ground. That, as we look forward, we have at least $125 million of additional PRE coming in, in future quarters this year. The biggest piece of that would be the other deal I mentioned on the first quarter call, which is Wind River. And we continue to expect that to close either late Q2 or in Q3. And I think there's no question we have additional monetization activity ongoing across our platforms that we expect to add to that number during the remainder of the year, but we'll talk about those as they happen.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprys: I was hoping we could spend a moment on the Impact platform with Rise and Rise Climate. Just curious how you think about building that out further from here. it would seem that there could be some opportunities for other dedicated fund strategies. So just curious where that stands in terms of the build-out. How are you thinking about that opportunity set? And to what extent is the more challenging market backdrop that you guys alluded to Impact the sort of timing and ability to raise these newer strategies?\nJim Coulter: Michael, as we've talked about, we think there is substantial opportunity to expand the Rise platform in a number of directions. And obviously, we've been doing that over the last year while also building up for future expansion. So over time, we find interest within our client base for Impact-related investing in infrastructure, Impact-related investing in public markets, Impact-related investing in the credit markets. All of those involve a build and a -- are in the future, but I continue to think that this is a trend that, if anything, will accelerate. One of the points that -- to the second question you gave, it's interesting. Coming out of some of the activity we've recently seen. We -- I'd say the investment activity within the sectors that we're focused on in Rise is, in some ways, flattered and continue. If you think about the climate transition, higher oil prices and concerns about energy security suggests a forward build and acceleration -- accelerating build into a green climate framework. In areas like online ed, we're almost 1:1 on devices. You've seen the recent announcements on free Internet to underprivileged families. This is an area where I think there's substantial investment opportunity to come. Health care access with the rise of telehealth, so we're actually seeing across climate, across health care, financial services, access, an acceleration in the opportunities. So we have, as you know, a large and growing percent of our assets in the Impact platform, and we would continue to see the opportunity for that to expand in future years.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Fin O'Shea from Wells Fargo.\nFin O'Shea: Last quarter, you guys touched on the opportunity in preferred equity in the growth market. Just seeing if you could provide an update on that pipeline if it's expanding as expected. And also, is Private Credit increasingly a competitor in that arena?\nJon Winkelried: Well, maybe I can just comment. I think that the pipeline, I think, continues to be reasonably healthy in the growth equity market. I think that -- just reinforcing what I said in my comments, the stage of company, the type of company the type of opportunity that we're focused on, tends to be later-stage companies that are generating earnings, companies that are generating cash flow. But despite that, I think when you look at the revaluation and the reset that's gone on in the public markets -- and I think it's not unusual. You see a progression go on, right, where you see the public markets begin to reset. And I think people -- market participants are not sure how deep the reset is going to go. And so you see this moment where things slow down a little bit. Things are -- companies that are looking for funding or looking to do transactions or sponsors, for that matter, take a breather to try to figure out what their next move is. And then the reset continues, which it has. And when you look at some of these very high -- some of the -- when you look at the population of companies that have been very fast growers, that have not been profitable, the reset is very broad and very deep. And I think that we're -- as Jim was relating before, when he was talking about some of the opportunities that we see and valuation expectations and pricing, we're seeing that settle in across the entire market. So the opportunity set, I think, continues to get more interesting in a lot of respects, particularly for our form of capital. And Acorns, that I mentioned as an example in my comments, is right down the middle of the plate as it relates to that type of opportunity. Because in prior markets, I think you probably would have seen that the outcome might have been different there in terms of where they would have sourced capital. And our ability to provide growth capital for that company and also, frankly, bring to bear other resources that we have, I think is still highly attractive to the types of companies that we like to back. As far as private -- as far as Private Credit -- I think you said you asked Private Credit, in terms of whether or not that's providing some form of competition. I think there are strategies in Private Credit that are trying to cross over into kind of growth equity types of opportunities and maybe sort of hybrid forms of capital. And just a couple of things I would note there. One is that -- the reason why we grew our growth platform the way we did, which is that we have a growth equity pool of capital, we have our tech adjacencies pool of capital, as we have flexible capital across the spectrum where we can be a solutions provider to companies depending upon what kind of capital they're looking for. We felt like given the range of capital solutions in the market and investment opportunities, it was important that we had flexible capital and can do that. But I will say that the credit platforms that are evolving into that space also are set up differently. They don't necessarily have the same kind of business building resources and operational capabilities that are essentially institutionalized and built into our platform. And I think that's very important to a lot of the companies that we're capital partners to. So you're seeing some blending at the edges, I would say. But I think we feel like we're positioned pretty well for this opportunity. Two points I'd add, first of all, any incursion by the credit business into this area is more than offset by the retreat out of the crossover funds that have been very active in that type of investing. And secondly, as you know, the largest growth areas within Private Credit have been yield-based products, and clearly, the ability to get yield -- current yield out of the tech adjacency opportunities is limited.\nOperator: Next question comes from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Two-parter, if I may. Maybe first one for either Jon or Jack, just back to the distribution -- or I should say fundraising side of it with pension plans slowing down. I think almost if -- correct me if I'm wrong, but almost half of your capital is from pension funds. So just I think you mentioned on the other side of that, the international side might be picking up some of that near-term slack? Maybe if you can just talk about retail as well in terms of your expectations of growing that channel. And then second question would be for Jim. Just following up on that -- on the Rise Climate fund. I think you've already got $2 billion committed in terms of -- I know you have had conversations before of the strong demand for carbon investing or carbon -- decarbonization, I should say. Do you see that picking up to the extent where -- I know it's early, but you might be back in the market for a Rise Climate due sooner rather than later?\nJack Weingart: Brian, it's Jack. Thanks for the question -- for the two-part question. The -- on the fund-raising point, I did forget to mention high net worth. You're right about that. You reiterated the dynamics pretty well that I referred to. So I won't reiterate the point about the shifting of capital that we expect towards more international pools of capital. We do -- on the high net worth side, I would say the same thing I said last quarter, which is it is an important growth area for us. We do expect to place more of our funds with the high-net worth channel of this wave of fundraising, that we did in the last wave of fundraising, and we are building out a team to address that opportunity. Now it also remains true that the vast majority of our products are only applicable to the highest end of that market. And as we continue to move toward new areas like credit and other yield-oriented products, I think we'll see an even more significant expansion of our penetration of that client base.\nJim Coulter: On the Rise Climate question, we launched a little over a year ago, I think there were questions on both sides of what I'll describe as the two-sided marketplace. Will there be enough focused capital demand out of our investors for this type of product? And secondly, at a $7 billion scale where we ended up, would there be investment demand? A year into it, as our General Counsel would say, asked and answered. In other words, there has been very substantial demand on the product side, and we see that growing. And I have been pleasantly surprised by the scale and persistency of opportunity we're seeing in the marketplace. So as you noted, we're seeing good deployment pace here. And that, I think, calls out an opportunity for both the opportunity to scale the strategy and brings forward some of our thinking in terms of when market opportunity return might be.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Adam Beatty from UBS.\nAdam Beatty: I wanted to ask about the business in Asia. There are some idiosyncratic challenges there recently in addition to some of the global challenges that we've talked about. So I just want to get your thoughts on portfolio company operations there, how that's going, also in terms of deployment opportunity. And then lastly, you mentioned that international markets, and I would expect Asia is included, might be a source of more resilient fundraising opportunity. So if you could talk about that as well, that would be great.\nJon Winkelried: Sure. I think first of all, just again for everyone's background, we've been in the Asian markets for a very long time. We started our business there in '94. So it goes way back. And importantly, our focus in our Asia franchise is Asia. We're in a number of markets there. And I think if you look at -- and we talked about this on the road, and we may have even touched on it on the last call. If you look at the distribution of our investing activity for the last -- better part of the last probably three to four years, we have been much lighter in terms of our exposure to China, recognizing that China was becoming a more challenging place to invest for a number of different reasons. Things were happening in China and the market there that I think many investors didn't expect to happen. An example is sort of the education sector as one example, where government intervention was particularly severe in terms of its impact and a number of other things that we've all read about and have watched and witnessed. So we have been focused on where there are opportunities in the market. We've seen some really good opportunities. And if you look at our performance in Asia, it's been very strong. We've seen some really interesting opportunities. I would probably highlight for you more recently, some excellent opportunities across a number of different industries in India. I'd highlight our Australia and New Zealand business. We're now seeing some really interesting opportunities in our Korea franchise, in South Korea. And then, obviously, I think you know we're focused on Southeast Asia as well. So I think we feel pretty good about Asia as a place where we expect there to be -- in certain markets and in certain sectors, a high degree of growth. Maybe growth will -- it's possible that the growth there will exceed other parts of the world. So we're very focused on it, and we're continuing to allocate capital into certain markets there. I would say we -- our Asia approach is not different than what we do elsewhere in the world, which is we're thematic-oriented investors. So we're allocating most of that capital to certain themes and certain industries where I think we feel like there's going to be secular growth over the long term. It's hard to say exactly sort of in terms of the impact that China is going to continue to have a very big impact in the region. I think it's half the GDP of the region or thereabouts. And so as China changes, probably so will the region change. But having said that, I think we're still feeling pretty good about opportunities that we're seeing and the kind of results that we're generating there. So -- more to come on that, but we're -- that's our outlook. With respect to...\nTodd Sisitsky: Hey, Jon?\nJon Winkelried: Sorry. Yes. Yes.\nTodd Sisitsky: I'd like to add, on the portfolio, just -- because that was the last piece of the question. We, of course, at times like this, spend a lot of time making sure we understand what's happening. And the portfolio in Asia, which I think is a true statement of Asia. And our broader portfolio, has held in, I think, quite well overall. Certainly seeing the effects of which pressure and the war for talent and inflation. I think one of the outputs of Jon's explanation of really focused on secular growth and on themes on secular growth. We understand -- and those themes, by the way, apply across Asia and the U.S. and Europe. We try to pursue them globally, is that we end up typically investing in higher value-added companies with competitive differentiation and have just less commodity exposure. So stronger gross margins, healthy relationships with customers, generally the ability to pass on costs. So I think one of the most important things for us is making sure when you're thinking about our themes, that we're in the right neighborhood and ahead of the big impact in terms of exposure to inflation. So we've been targeting secular rather than cyclical growth, and so far, the portfolio seems to be bearing that out.\nJon Winkelried: It's worth noting that one of the investments out of our growth fund in India was a company called -- is a company called Campus Activewear. And you probably don't follow the Indian IPO market closely, but in the past 24, 48 hours, Campus Activewear went public very successfully in India at a very attractive multiple relative to our investment.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Rufus Hone from BMO.\nRufus Hone: I was hoping you could spend a moment on real estate and real assets more generally. Clearly, an area that's seeing outsized demand from LPs in the current environment. And I know you just raised a big opportunistic Real Estate fund, but beyond that, how are you looking to build out that platform? And can you talk through the growth of your permanent capital vehicles?\nJon Winkelried: Yes, thanks for the question. We're feeling pretty good about our Real Estate franchise and the potential for growth there. I think as we mentioned, we've raised the largest opportunistic fund that we've raised to date there. And so that's giving us a -- that's given us plenty of dry powder to take advantage of opportunities that we're seeing in the market. Just taking a step back looking at the real estate market right now, what's interesting given this reset that we've seen in corporate valuations and corporate markets, we've seen less of that at this point in real estate. Arguably, real estate is a place where people can go to get some protection from inflation because of the ability to reset rents. And the other dynamic that you have going on in real estate is that you've got -- because of inflationary pressures and supply constraints, you've got very, very high replacement cost dynamics going on. So when you look at cap rates in the real estate market more broadly, that market is holding up very well. Financing is always a question as it relates to real estate. And I think the financing markets are still actually holding up pretty well, all things considered. Although, clearly, there are -- there has been movement in underlying cost associated with financing deals on the real estate side. But -- so we're feeling pretty good about that. As you know, also, we just finished completing the raise of our first Core Plus Strategy, our first Core Plus fund. So we've added from a product set perspective and the tools that we have to take advantage of opportunities in the market, we feel pretty good about having launched that at a very interesting time, and we're already deploying that capital. So that builds out that. On the capital side and permanent capital side, I think you're aware, we have a commercial mortgage REIT that trades publicly, which is TRTX. We just recently hired a new CEO for the platform, Doug Bouchard, which joined us -- who joined us after 20 years at Goldman Sachs, where he ran commercial real estate finance there. We're excited to have Doug on board. And what we expect as a result of that is we'll be continuing to build out our real estate debt business -- our real estate credit business, and we'll look to potentially, over time, see opportunities to build up new pools of capital within that business. But that, I think, positions us well for an environment where with the reset in rates, just the structural changes that are going on in the market, I think we feel like the overall environment in which to look for opportunities on the real estate credit space, is actually improving, even in an upward rate moving market based upon what we see. So we're excited about what we can potentially build there. Over time, I think, obviously, as we expand our product set, and using Core Plus, by the way, which we call TAC Plus, as an example, we also think that gives us the ability to think about penetrating other pools of capital to raise money. The real estate market, in particular, has been pretty successful in sourcing capital through retail channels in various forms. And so as we continue to invest our Core Plus pool of capital, when we structured our TAC Plus fund, one of the things that we did is we set it up so that over a period of time, we can actually flip that structure into an open-ended fund structure. With -- after we get a certain percentage of that percent invested in that pool of capital and after the investment season a bit, we'll be evaluating opportunities to do that with that vehicle. So I feel great about our momentum in real estate. I feel like there are a lot of opportunities for us.\nOperator: This does conclude the Q&A portion of today's call. I would now like to turn the call back over to Gary Stein for any additional or closing remarks.\nGary Stein: Great. Thanks, operator. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Please feel free to follow up directly with me or Ebony, if you have any additional questions. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.\nJon Winkelried: Thanks, everyone.\nJack Weingart: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's TPG's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call and Webcast.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jon Winkelried",
            "content": "Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. Following our IPO in January, we hosted our first public earnings call at the end of March. Since we spoke with you just about six weeks ago, we're going to keep today's prepared remarks relatively brief. I'll touch on our recent performance and discuss a few highlights across our business. I'll then turn the call over to Jack to provide more detail on our financial results, and then we'll take your questions. As of March 31, we had more than $120 billion of total assets under management, which increased 6% versus the prior quarter and 26% year-over-year. This growth was driven by a combination of strong investment performance and fundraising across our five platforms, partially offset by a continued pace of significant realization activity. We raised $5 billion during the quarter, driven primarily by strong demand for our fourth opportunistic real estate fund, and we raised $24 billion over the last 12 months. We invested $4 billion in the first quarter and $22 billion during the last 12 months. We also had nearly $5 billion of realizations in the quarter and $29 billion over the last 12 months. In aggregate, our investments generated value creation of 33% for the last 12 months and 7% in the first quarter. Approximately 2/3 of the Q1 value creation is attributable to exit agreements signed during the quarter at significant valuations. Adjusting for these realization events, our value creation for the quarter would have been approximately 2%. In connection with our earnings release this morning, we announced our first quarterly cash dividend of $0.44 per share of Class A common stock, representing 85% of TPG's after-tax distributable earnings. Jack will provide some more detail on the dividend. As we discussed when we spoke with you six weeks ago, the global geopolitical and economic landscape remains highly uncertain due to a number of significant macro factors, including the ongoing tragic conflict in Ukraine, a U.S. inflation rate that has reached a four-year high and a rising interest rate environment that has driven U.S. mortgage rates up 5% for the first time in more than a decade. As an investment-led organization operating in this volatile environment, we are continuing to adhere to our strategy and rigorous approach across all our platforms. We have been anticipating the onset of choppier markets, and this expectation has shaped how we've been investing our funds and managing our portfolios. We've been proactively monetizing investments and have returned significant amounts of capital to our limited partners. Over the last 12 months, during a period of very active capital deployment, we have, in fact, returned materially more capital than we invested. The current market reset is presenting us with a range of investment opportunities at more interesting valuations, and our pipeline of actionable opportunities is growing at a time when there are fewer competitive sources of capital such as IPOs and SPACs. We are fortunate to have a substantial amount of committed but uncalled capital available to invest, $30 billion as of March 31. With this backdrop in mind, I'd like to spend a few minutes walking you through some highlights across our business, starting with our largest platform, Capital, which had $57 billion of total AUM at the end of the first quarter. Our Capital funds had value accretion of 11% during the quarter. As I mentioned a minute ago, this value creation reflects several significant signed exits. Adjusting for those exits, the first quarter value creation for our Capital portfolio was approximately 2%, outperforming broader market indices. The ongoing value creation in our portfolio underscores our distinct investing style and our focus on companies and sectors that continue to grow revenue and earnings despite the volatile macro environment. During the first quarter, our capital funds invested nearly $2 billion in companies such as Confluent Medical Technologies, a leading contract development and manufacturing partner to medical device companies. This investment leverages our capabilities as one of the most active and experienced health care private equity investors and builds on our multi-decade thematic focus on value-added outsourced medical products dating back to our original investment in Quintiles. Also during the quarter, TPG Capital Asia announced an investment in Fractal Analytics, India's largest outsourced provider of artificial intelligence solutions to Fortune 500 companies. This investment stems from our position as a leading technology investor and our thematic coverage of digital services on a global scale. For the quarter, our capital funds generated total realizations of approximately $4 billion, including the $14 billion take-private of McAfee and the recapitalizations of both Novatek Health Holdings, Asia's largest biotech-focused contract research organization; and Greencross, Australia's largest pet care company. Let me turn to our Growth platform which had $22 billion of total AUM at the end of the first quarter. This platform provides flexible capital at scale for growing businesses through our growth, tech adjacencies and digital media funds. Despite the broader market weakness we have been discussing this morning, our Growth funds continue to perform well, with aggregate value creation of 1.5% in the first quarter and 23% for the last 12 months. We have built our Growth portfolio with a late cycle mindset and a focus on sectors and themes like cybersecurity, ad tech and health care where secular rather than cyclical growth is the driver of performance. In addition, given the scale of capital we're deploying, we are generally investing in later-stage companies that have strong financial profiles and where we can help bend their growth curves with the substantial resources TPG brings to bear. Looking at capital invested in the Growth platform during the quarter. In addition to the investments in project44 and express fees that we mentioned on our last call, I'd also like to highlight [TTET] and Rise's investment in Acorns, a leading mobile savings and investment platform with more than 4.7 million subscribers. This investment is a great example of how the recent market reset is accelerating the pace of investment opportunities for us as competitive sources of capital have been sidelined. Acorns have been planning to raise capital through a SPAC transaction, but with that market experiencing significant volatility, we were able to invest capital on attractive terms and position the Company for continued growth. During the first quarter, we also returned capital to our Growth fund investors through several transactions, including the full monetization of our stake in Toast, a leading SaaS provider for the restaurant industry, and a partial monetization of our investment in Asia Healthcare Holdings. Moving on, I'd like to briefly discuss our Impact platform, which had total AUM of $14 billion as of March 31. This includes our inaugural Rise Climate Fund, which recently announced its final close at its hard cap of $7.3 billion. TPG Rise Climate has already committed more than $2 billion of capital to catalyze climate action and scale companies across the sector. Our Impact funds had aggregate value creation of 1% in the first quarter and 31% for the last 12 months. During the quarter, our Impact funds invested $1.5 billion, including the first tranche of Rise Climate's investment in a newly created electrical vehicle subsidiary of India's Tata Motors. In addition, our Rise and Rise Climate Funds announced a $500 million investment in Nextracker, the number one global provider of solar tracker and software solutions for utility scale solar projects around the world. Turning to Real Estate. This platform ended the first quarter with $18 billion of total AUM, which increased more than 40% from the prior quarter, primarily due to raising an additional $4.3 billion of capital for our current opportunistic fund, which now stands at $6.4 billion raised. TPG's Real Estate platform delivered value creation of 6% for the first quarter and 26% for the last 12 months across our Opportunistic and Core Plus funds. In the first quarter, our Opportunistic fund made a follow-on investment in Dogwood Industrial Properties, a platform we established in 2019, to build a portfolio of multi-tenant logistics facilities throughout the United States. In addition, our Core Plus funds completed an investment through [Dunewood Residential Properties], which is a new platform that is building a portfolio of differentiated multifamily assets in markets with attractive secular growth dynamics and supply constraints. Finally, I'd like to touch on our Market Solutions platform, which had $10 billion of total AUM at the end of the first quarter across several strategies, including our long, short and long-only public investing funds and Private Market Solutions, which is our secondaries business focused on GP solutions. In addition, during the first quarter, our debt Capital Markets Group led seven fee-generating transactions, including the recapitalization of Greencross, which we believe was the first covenant-light direct lender deal completed in Australia and one of the largest unitranche deals ever done in Asia. Taking a step back, I'd like to highlight our talent strategy, a key element of our firm's culture and a topic we discussed in detail with many of you leading up to our IPO in January. Retaining and recruiting the best talent continues to be an important strategic area of focus for us, particularly in this competitive -- increasingly competitive job market. The strength of our culture, which is enabled by an exceptional group of talented and diverse people, is the result of deep investment over the years, and we work hard to constantly reinforce it. This manifests itself in several ways. For instance, in March, several firm leaders and I hosted a global promotions program where 140 members of the TPG team were promoted at the end of 2021. Among this promote class, 48% identify as diverse across gender, race or ethnicity. Our focus on creating career paths with enhanced opportunity and upward mobility has never been more important and it will continue to be an area of focus for our entire team. Our effort to continuously develop and engage talent goes beyond the four walls of TPG. Last month, along with a number of our peers, we engaged as a founding partner of Ownership Works, a nonprofit that seeks to accelerate the development of broad employee ownership programs. Two senior members of our management team have joined the Board of Ownership Works: our President, Todd Sisitsky and Maryanne Hancock, CEO of Y Analytics. We believe it is important to express our commitment to our people both at TPG and across our portfolio, and Ownership Works is one important example of how we can drive meaningful engagement beyond our firm. Overall, we're very pleased with our financial and operational results for the first quarter of 2022, which highlights the momentum we are continuing to generate across our five platforms despite a more challenging operating environment. We also remain intently focused on capital form risk with our broad-based fundraising campaigns. I'd now like to turn the call over to Jack. Yes. I think we talked about -- this is Jon. We talked about that on our last call. We talked about that obviously when we were on the road. I think that we do have an interest in continuing to grow our platform and diversifying the product base. We're -- we've been in a reasonable level of dialogue just in terms of continuing to understand the market. I think we're going to be -- and this is consistent with what we've said before, we're going to be very thoughtful about what we do, both from the perspective of fit in terms of how it fits with our firm as well as value -- evaluation. And clearly, we've been through, over the course of the first quarter, as an example, right, we've been through a -- I don't have to tell you, we've been through a substantial revaluation in our own space. And probably -- I mean, I would expect, like anything else, just like we're seeing on the deal front, they take some time for value expectations in terms of where sellers are and where buyers are to adjust. But we're -- we continue to be interested in doing it. There's nothing specific that we have to report to you now on that, but we remain focused. Yes. Thanks, Alex. I think Todd Sisitsky, who's actually on our London office, is going to respond to that. Well, maybe I can just comment. I think that the pipeline, I think, continues to be reasonably healthy in the growth equity market. I think that -- just reinforcing what I said in my comments, the stage of company, the type of company the type of opportunity that we're focused on, tends to be later-stage companies that are generating earnings, companies that are generating cash flow. But despite that, I think when you look at the revaluation and the reset that's gone on in the public markets -- and I think it's not unusual. You see a progression go on, right, where you see the public markets begin to reset. And I think people -- market participants are not sure how deep the reset is going to go.

And then the reset continues, which it has. And when you look at some of these very high -- some of the -- when you look at the population of companies that have been very fast growers, that have not been profitable, the reset is very broad and very deep. And I think that we're -- as Jim was relating before, when he was talking about some of the opportunities that we see and valuation expectations and pricing, we're seeing that settle in across the entire market. So the opportunity set, I think, continues to get more interesting in a lot of respects, particularly for our form of capital. And Acorns, that I mentioned as an example in my comments, is right down the middle of the plate as it relates to that type of opportunity. Because in prior markets, I think you probably would have seen that the outcome might have been different there in terms of where they would have sourced capital. And our ability to provide growth capital for that company and also, frankly, bring to bear other resources that we have, I think is still highly attractive to the types of companies that we like to back. As far as private -- as far as Private Credit -- I think you said you asked Private Credit, in terms of whether or not that's providing some form of competition.

And just a couple of things I would note there.

And so as China changes, probably so will the region change. But having said that, I think we're still feeling pretty good about opportunities that we're seeing and the kind of results that we're generating there. So -- more to come on that, but we're -- that's our outlook. With respect to... Sorry. Yes. Yes. It's worth noting that one of the investments out of our growth fund in India was a company called -- is a company called Campus Activewear. And you probably don't follow the Indian IPO market closely, but in the past 24, 48 hours, Campus Activewear went public very successfully in India at a very attractive multiple relative to our investment. Yes, thanks for the question. We're feeling pretty good about our Real Estate franchise and the potential for growth there. I think as we mentioned, we've raised the largest opportunistic fund that we've raised to date there. And so that's giving us a -- that's given us plenty of dry powder to take advantage of opportunities that we're seeing in the market. Just taking a step back looking at the real estate market right now, what's interesting given this reset that we've seen in corporate valuations and corporate markets, we've seen less of that at this point in real estate. Arguably, real estate is a place where people can go to get some protection from inflation because of the ability to reset rents. And the other dynamic that you have going on in real estate is that you've got -- because of inflationary pressures and supply constraints, you've got very, very high replacement cost dynamics going on. So when you look at cap rates in the real estate market more broadly, that market is holding up very well. Financing is always a question as it relates to real estate. And I think the financing markets are still actually holding up pretty well, all things considered. Although, clearly, there are -- there has been movement in underlying cost associated with financing deals on the real estate side. But -- so we're feeling pretty good about that. As you know, also, we just finished completing the raise of our first Core Plus Strategy, our first Core Plus fund. So we've added from a product set perspective and the tools that we have to take advantage of opportunities in the market, we feel pretty good about having launched that at a very interesting time, and we're already deploying that capital. So that builds out that. On the capital side and permanent capital side, I think you're aware, we have a commercial mortgage REIT that trades publicly, which is TRTX. We just recently hired a new CEO for the platform, Doug Bouchard, which joined us -- who joined us after 20 years at Goldman Sachs, where he ran commercial real estate finance there. We're excited to have Doug on board. And what we expect as a result of that is we'll be continuing to build out our real estate debt business -- our real estate credit business, and we'll look to potentially, over time, see opportunities to build up new pools of capital within that business. But that, I think, positions us well for an environment where with the reset in rates, just the structural changes that are going on in the market, I think we feel like the overall environment in which to look for opportunities on the real estate credit space, is actually improving, even in an upward rate moving market based upon what we see. So we're excited about what we can potentially build there. Over time, I think, obviously, as we expand our product set, and using Core Plus, by the way, which we call TAC Plus, as an example, we also think that gives us the ability to think about penetrating other pools of capital to raise money. The real estate market, in particular, has been pretty successful in sourcing capital through retail channels in various forms. And so as we continue to invest our Core Plus pool of capital, when we structured our TAC Plus fund, one of the things that we did is we set it up so that over a period of time, we can actually flip that structure into an open-ended fund structure. With -- after we get a certain percentage of that percent invested in that pool of capital and after the investment season a bit, we'll be evaluating opportunities to do that with that vehicle. So I feel great about our momentum in real estate. I feel like there are a lot of opportunities for us. Thanks, everyone."

            "name": "Todd Sisitsky",
            "content": "Sure. Yes, I hope you can hear me well. Thank you for the question. I think there's a few sort of questions built into that. I would tell you that we actually find -- we feel very good about our strategy and our brand of growth and transformation investing in the current market. And feel like the companies, as you point out -- suggested, we feel quite positive about how the portfolio is held in there. It sounds like your question's a little bit more about the go-forward approach. I would tell you that in general, there are a lot of positives in this market for us. So this is a pretty exciting time. We have seen historically, over the 30 years we've been doing this, that really some of our best investments and vintages following this strategy have followed a public market reset. And it happens in the context of a challenging macro environment. And the first big investment that was done after the global financial crisis in 2009 was IMS, which we've followed for seven years before that, but it was really only in this environment that we were able to come up with the transaction management and the Board that worked. That company is now IQVIA, a $40-plus billion market cap company. So the question of whether we are able to find interesting growth opportunities following our strategy in this environment, I understand the macro concerns of growth. But I would tell you the way we think about it, and just maybe to use a broader construct that we think about when we invest, is that we distinguish between what we think of as interesting to us as investors, the themes and the segments that we want to follow and study every year; and what's actionable, what happens to be for sale. And we actually very intentionally deliberately focus on what we think is interesting, even if it's not actionable. So what's exciting about this moment in the cycle is we often find the areas that we've studied and are excited about. The management teams we want to back, that we've learned to develop relationships over the years. They become actionable at this moment. And when they do, we really capitalize on all the work that we've done on the teams and we work aggressively and with conviction and as a firm. So we find it actually be a very interesting market moment for us given the strategy that we have. Hey, Jon? I'd like to add, on the portfolio, just -- because that was the last piece of the question. We, of course, at times like this, spend a lot of time making sure we understand what's happening. And the portfolio in Asia, which I think is a true statement of Asia. And our broader portfolio, has held in, I think, quite well overall. Certainly seeing the effects of which pressure and the war for talent and inflation. I think one of the outputs of Jon's explanation of really focused on secular growth and on themes on secular growth. We understand -- and those themes, by the way, apply across Asia and the U.S. and Europe. We try to pursue them globally, is that we end up typically investing in higher value-added companies with competitive differentiation and have just less commodity exposure. So stronger gross margins, healthy relationships with customers, generally the ability to pass on costs. So I think one of the most important things for us is making sure when you're thinking about our themes, that we're in the right neighborhood and ahead of the big impact in terms of exposure to inflation. So we've been targeting secular rather than cyclical growth, and so far, the portfolio seems to be bearing that out."

            "name": "Jim Coulter",
            "content": "Yes. Alex, it's Jim Coulter. Let me take you into the front lines of the market for a second and an area that I'm spending a lot of time, which is in climate. The experience last year was often that a company would come in saying that they would like to be financed at a price of X. We would say, \"No, we're much below that.\" And it would be financed in the SPAC for -- through a momentum investor at X plus 25%. We sort of scratched our head. This year has been a complete about-face to where that company, which needs to finance given its capital plan in this environment, essentially is coming in and saying they'd like to be financed at X. We say half X. They go away and come back to us pretty quickly. So the market is resetting as you're taking out a series of competitors that were either market-based in their valuation techniques or momentum-based than what was happening in the growth marketplace. So what we're seeing here is a fundamental reset. And as net sellers last year, there's an opportunity to be very disciplined net buyers this year. Michael, as we've talked about, we think there is substantial opportunity to expand the Rise platform in a number of directions. And obviously, we've been doing that over the last year while also building up for future expansion. So over time, we find interest within our client base for Impact-related investing in infrastructure, Impact-related investing in public markets, Impact-related investing in the credit markets. All of those involve a build and a -- are in the future, but I continue to think that this is a trend that, if anything, will accelerate. One of the points that -- to the second question you gave, it's interesting. Coming out of some of the activity we've recently seen. We -- I'd say the investment activity within the sectors that we're focused on in Rise is, in some ways, flattered and continue. If you think about the climate transition, higher oil prices and concerns about energy security suggests a forward build and acceleration -- accelerating build into a green climate framework. In areas like online ed, we're almost 1:1 on devices. You've seen the recent announcements on free Internet to underprivileged families. This is an area where I think there's substantial investment opportunity to come. Health care access with the rise of telehealth, so we're actually seeing across climate, across health care, financial services, access, an acceleration in the opportunities. So we have, as you know, a large and growing percent of our assets in the Impact platform, and we would continue to see the opportunity for that to expand in future years. On the Rise Climate question, we launched a little over a year ago, I think there were questions on both sides of what I'll describe as the two-sided marketplace. Will there be enough focused capital demand out of our investors for this type of product? And secondly, at a $7 billion scale where we ended up, would there be investment demand? A year into it, as our General Counsel would say, asked and answered. In other words, there has been very substantial demand on the product side, and we see that growing. And I have been pleasantly surprised by the scale and persistency of opportunity we're seeing in the marketplace. So as you noted, we're seeing good deployment pace here. And that, I think, calls out an opportunity for both the opportunity to scale the strategy and brings forward some of our thinking in terms of when market opportunity return might be."

            "name": "Jack Weingart",
            "content": "Thanks, Jon, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to briefly walk through our financial results and highlight some of the more significant points regarding our first quarter performance. [indiscernible] grew, as Jon mentioned, from $95 billion at the end of the first quarter of '21 to more than [indiscernible]. The drivers of this 26% increase during the last 12 months include $29 billion of value creation from our underlying fund investments and $24 billion from capital raising, partially offset by $29 billion of realizations that were returned to our fund investors during the same period. Fee-earning AUM increased from $51 billion in March '21 to approximately $64 billion as of March 31, 2022. And this 26% percent increase was driven primarily [indiscernible] in fee-earning. At the end of the first quarter of '22, approximately 84% of our AUM and 79% of our fee-earning AUM was either perpetual or long-dated funds [indiscernible] of 10 years or longer. In addition, 78% of our fee-earning AUM had a [indiscernible] or more years as of the end of the first quarter. As of March 31, we had approximately $9 billion of AUM subject to fee-earning growth, including nearly $7 billion not yet earning fees, and our funds had more than $30 billion of available capital for future investment. Turning to our income statement. We recorded GAAP net income for the first quarter of $163 million. On our previous call, I provided guidance regarding our expectations for Q1 non-GAAP results and our reported results for the first quarter came in at or above that guidance on all key metrics. We reported fee-related revenues for the first quarter of $241 million, and we reported fee-related earnings, or FRE, of $92 million. Our FRE grew 38% versus the pro forma year ago quarter -- and growth in management fees [indiscernible] and margins as we continue to scale our business and generate [indiscernible] margin was 38% for the first [indiscernible] in the first quarter of 2021 on a pro forma basis. Our after-tax distributable [indiscernible] which more than tripled versus the pro forma year-ago quarter, driven by growth in FRE and by realized performance allocations of $122 million. Turning to the non-GAAP balance sheet for TPG Operating Group. As of March 31, which is reflective of our balance sheet light business model, we are well capitalized with $583 million of cash and $450 million of long-term debt. We also had net accrued performance allocation balance, which represents the 20% allocation to the TPG Operating Group, of $796 million, an increase from the $769 million at the end of '21. I'd like to note that as of March 31, $107 billion, or 89% of our total AUM, was eligible for performance allocations; and $85 billion or 71% was generating performance allocations. On the fundraising side, my comments on the last call regarding the overall market conditions remain true. The market is crowded with managers raising capital, some sooner than their clients expected and certain segments of the market are temporarily over-allocated. Fundraising campaigns industry-wide will likely take longer than usual to complete. Against that backdrop, our fundraising momentum remains strong. As Jon said, we raised over $5 billion during the first quarter, more than 3x the amount that we raised during the first quarter of 2021. On the Impact platform, we had a final close last month of our Rise Climate Fund at the hard cap of $7.3 billion, and we expect to first close on our next broad-based Impact fund around midyear. Our next opportunistic Real Estate fund is oversubscribed, and we will soon hold our final close at the hard cap of $6.5 billion. On the Capital platform, as you know, we continue to see strong demand for our three core products: TPG Capital, Healthcare Partners and TPG Asia. We expect to complete accelerated first closings for TPG Capital and Healthcare Partners around midyear, followed by TPG Asia's first close shortly thereafter. We will have more to report on these campaigns during the second quarter call. Before I wrap up my prepared remarks, I'd like to provide some additional detail regarding our first quarterly cash dividend as a public company. As a reminder, our current intention is to pay out to shareholders at least 85% of the after-tax distributable earnings attributable to TPG Inc. on a quarterly basis, subject to necessary approvals. Consistent with this approach, we announced this morning a cash dividend of $0.44 per share of Class A common stock, which will be payable on June 3 to record holders as of the close of business on May 20. I would note that the non-GAAP effective tax rate in Q1 was slightly higher than what we have previously indicated due to certain IPO-related costs recognized during the quarter that were deferred for tax purposes. Finally, our fully diluted share count at the end of the first quarter, including unvested RSUs, was approximately 320 million shares. Taking a step back, we feel very good about our first quarter results and the progress we continue to make driving growth across our business. Our investment portfolio delivered strong value creation. Despite the turbulent market backdrop, we have maintained a solid pace of capital deployment, while also returning significant amounts of capital and profits back to our investors. In addition, we continue to expect strong growth in AUM and FRE as a result of our broad-based fundraising campaigns. With that, I'd now like to turn the call back over to the operator so we can take your questions. Yes. Thanks, Craig. When you say verticals, I would think about it more in terms of segments of the LP marketplace. And consistent with other discussions that have been had in the industry, the most impacted part of the market we see is in the traditional U.S. pension fund market kind of most over-allocated based on the metrics that you talked about. The outperformance, the alternatives in their portfolio, combined with the sell-off in the public markets, causing the denominator effect. And the third piece is a lot of GPs coming back to market faster than they had planned. So it's a credit fundraising market. And their -- that segment of the market in particular is having to make choices for the first time in a while. And what we see happening is those choices are benefiting the largest, most established GPs with the strongest relationships. And we are fortunate to be a part of that group. And I think anyone who's returned a lot of capital to LPs as opposed to really just drawing down capital and coming back to ask for more is also seeing the benefit, and we are clearly in that camp. The other segments of the market, there are lots of pockets of continued growth despite the crowded market, mostly in some of the international segments of the market, Asia, Middle East, even in Europe. So we see -- I think I would expect the result of these fund-raising campaigns, in part, to -- we'll see a shift of the composition of our LP base, reflecting the different dynamics in those different segments. So that's how I described kind of the fund-raising market overall. As it relates to our timing, like when we went public, we articulated and expected a close for the Capital funds, which are the largest pools of capital. I didn't -- we haven't yet closed. And Real Estate, just to reiterate what I just said, we had -- we'll soon have our final close on the next Opportunistic fund. On the Impact side, we raised a large climate fund. That finished closing in the first quarter. And so we have the large Capital funds, and we have the next broad-based Impact Fund Rise 3. When we -- at the IPO, we talked about the capital funds having a close and activating closer to the end of the year, and we continue to see good momentum in those campaigns and we continue to expect a first close in the Capital and Healthcare fund around midyear, as I mentioned. So we'll have more to talk about the size of those closings in the Q2 call. Sure. Rob, thanks for the question. So I talked on the last call about the fact that we had over $200 million of performance allocations to TPG Inc. that were already locked based on signed contracts. What you saw come through in the first quarter of $122 million of performance allocations. Approximately -- think about half of that $200 million, call it, the $100 million of that, came from the transactions that I mentioned on the last call, and the rest came from additional monetizations that occurred during the quarter. So, as we look forward -- and we don't forecast PRE from potential sales that may or may not happen later in the year. But again, using the framework from the last call, if I just think about the companies that we've already agreed contractually to sell, what's already in the ground. That, as we look forward, we have at least $125 million of additional PRE coming in, in future quarters this year. The biggest piece of that would be the other deal I mentioned on the first quarter call, which is Wind River. And we continue to expect that to close either late Q2 or in Q3. And I think there's no question we have additional monetization activity ongoing across our platforms that we expect to add to that number during the remainder of the year, but we'll talk about those as they happen. Brian, it's Jack. Thanks for the question -- for the two-part question. The -- on the fund-raising point, I did forget to mention high net worth. You're right about that. You reiterated the dynamics pretty well that I referred to. So I won't reiterate the point about the shifting of capital that we expect towards more international pools of capital. We do -- on the high net worth side, I would say the same thing I said last quarter, which is it is an important growth area for us. We do expect to place more of our funds with the high-net worth channel of this wave of fundraising, that we did in the last wave of fundraising, and we are building out a team to address that opportunity. Now it also remains true that the vast majority of our products are only applicable to the highest end of that market. And as we continue to move toward new areas like credit and other yield-oriented products, I think we'll see an even more significant expansion of our penetration of that client base. Thank you."

Please go to TPG's IR website to obtain the earnings materials. I will now turn the call over to Gary Stein, Head of Investor Relations at TPG. Thank you. You may begin.\nGary Stein: Great. Thanks, operator, and welcome, everyone. Joining me this morning are Jon Winkelried, Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Weingart, Chief Financial Officer. In addition, our Executive Chairman and Co-Founder, Jim Coulter; and our President, Todd Sisitsky, will be available for the Q&A portion of this morning's call. I'd like to remind you this call may include forward-looking statements that do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to TPG's Earnings Release and SEC filings for factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. TPG undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.  Within our discussion and earnings release, we're presenting GAAP and non-GAAP measures, reflecting the close of the Angelo Gordon transaction on November 1, 2023. We also present pro forma GAAP and non-GAAP measures that assume the transaction closed on January 1, 2023. Please refer to TPG's earnings release for details on the pro forma financial information.  We believe certain non-GAAP measures that we discuss on this call are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to the nearest GAAP figures in TPG's earnings release, which is available on our website. Please note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase, an interest in any TPG fund.  Looking briefly at our results for the fourth quarter. We reported GAAP net income attributable to TPG Inc. of $13 million and after-tax distributable earnings of $206 million or $0.51 per share of Class A common stock. We declared a dividend of $0.44 per share of Class A common stock, which will be paid on March 8 to holders of record, as of February 23.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Jon.\nJon Winkelried: Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone. 2023 was a transformative year for TPG, and I'll begin today by sharing several updates on our progress.  On last February's earnings call, we laid out a growth agenda for the year that included three key components. First, scaling our existing strategies and in particular, completing several important fundraises, second, continuing our strong track record of driving organic growth and innovation; and third, expanding our business through targeted acquisitions. We're excited about the progress we've made in all three of these areas. Looking at our business today, we manage more than $220 billion across private equity, credit and real estate and we furthered our position as a scaled, differentiated investment firm.  I'll review a few highlights from the past year and also discuss our outlook. First, as it relates to existing strategies, we have completed the fundraises for the next generation of our TPG Capital, Healthcare partners and Rise funds. We have grown our fund sizes, vintage over vintage, across each of these campaigns which is a significant accomplishment given the persistent industry headwinds in private equity fundraising. This is a direct result of TPG's differentiated investment strategies, outstanding performance track record and strong and growing client relationships. Specifically, for TPG Capital 9 and Healthcare Partners too, we held our final close with $15.6 billion of aggregate commitments, up 10% from the prior vintage. And for Rise 3, we closed on $2.7 billion, up 24%. In addition to expanding our existing relationships, we also added many new clients to TPG from around the world with notable progress in the Middle East and Asia. We believe these new client relationships create significant potential for embedded growth in successor funds, as well as the opportunity to expand engagement across additional TPG strategies and products.  For our ongoing Capital Asia campaign, we have raised $4.3 billion of capital as of year-end and will hold a final close in the coming months. Our clients continue to express strong interest, and we expect to fund to be larger than its predecessor. Second, we continue to demonstrate our ability to grow organically by launching and scaling products in parts of the market, where we have distinct competitive advantages. I'll highlight a few of these initiatives. Our new real estate credit strategy received more than $750 million of commitments and closed on approximately $650 million in the fourth quarter. We are now actively investing and the current market backdrop is one of the most interesting environments we've seen since the early 2000s, for real estate credit, given the dynamics of higher rates, declining asset values and a significant pullback in commercial real estate lending. Our strategy is purpose-built for this part of the cycle, and we intend to continue to raise capital in 2024.  Turning to climate. At COP 28 this past December, we announced a $1.5 billion commitment to the next generation of TPG Rise Climate Private Equity Funds from Altera, the UAE's $30 billion climate-focused investment manager. This includes a $1 billion commitment to our second Rise Climate Fund and a $500 million commitment to our new Global Solve initiative. The UAE selection of TPG as its first private equity partner is a testament to the strong brand and leadership position, we've built in the Climate and Impact space.  Within our Climate strategy, we are also preparing to launch our Inova Climate Transition Infrastructure Fund. And just last week, we announced that Scott Lebo will be joining TPG later this year as the Head of Infrastructure for TPG Rise Climate. Scott most recently served as a global co-head and co-CIO of infrastructure investing at Goldman Sachs, and we're excited for him to help bring our differentiated strategy to market. Finally, we closed the acquisition of Angelo Gordon in the fourth quarter, meaningfully expanding our capabilities across credit and real estate and further enhancing our presence in Europe and Asia. We believe the acquisition of Angelo Gordon will be a significant growth driver for the firm in a number of ways. One key area is furthering our penetration in high-growth distribution channels, such as private wealth and insurance. And so far this year, we have secured new distribution relationships for our direct lending BDC and Credit Solutions Fund with several large wire houses and private banking partners. We are focused on delivering additional products that provide private wealth investors access to our strategies, and we look forward to sharing more with you in the future.  We also continue to make progress on standing up new revenue opportunities and businesses that leverage the combined expertise and capabilities of TPG and AG. The most near term is the ability to generate incremental fee revenue from the integration of our Capital Markets business into TPG AG Credit, which is already well underway. Our strategic growth initiatives over the last few years have led to a step function change in our business. Through both organic innovation and the acquisition of AG, we have substantially expanded the breadth of our franchise across private equity, credit, real estate and soon-to-be infrastructure. As a result, the cadence and consistency of our capital raising and overall growth profile have fundamentally changed. We will be in the market on a steadier, more consistent basis across both the Institutional and Private Wealth channels.  Looking ahead, we expect our growth this year to be driven by five primary vectors, including: one, credit fundraising across all our TPG AG strategies; two, the newest vintages of our growth and Rise climate private equity funds; three, the launch of our climate transition infrastructure strategy, four, the completion of several first-time fund raises, including real estate credit and GP secondaries; and five, new product and channel development.  Turning to our fourth quarter results. We had a strong year -- a strong end to the year with $8.8 billion of capital raised in the quarter, primarily across the campaigns, I discussed earlier. We believe we are well positioned with $51 billion of dry powder to deploy into what we view as an improving market backdrop.  You may remember that during our second quarter '23 earnings call, we discussed several factors that were contributing to a ramp-up in our transaction pipelines, including narrowing bid-ask spreads, greater receptivity among corporates to strategically realign their businesses and GP is increasingly seeking creative solutions for monetizations.  These forces have been accelerating, and TPG has continued to deploy capital by leveraging our long-dated themes and core strains, such as executing corporate carve-outs and structuring proprietary creative financing solutions. As we look ahead in areas such as real estate, we expect to see more attractive assets for sale this year that would otherwise typically not come to market, as companies find themselves under increasing pressure for liquidity. In Private Equity, given TPG's deep sector focus, commitment to business building and strong track record of structuring win-win transactions. We continue to be a partner of choice for companies looking to strategically reposition their businesses and help drive growth. And in Credit, as we mentioned during the TPG AG Teach-In, the opportunity set continues to expand and we see -- we expect a significant increase in deployment this year, which will grow our base of fee earning AUM. The origination pipeline is robust across all of our Credit platforms, as borrowers seek alternatives to public debt financing with greater flexibility to meet their needs. We also expect a more active M&A pipeline, as the economy continues to show signs of steadier growth, leading to new origination opportunities. Our investment teams have been very busy deploying nearly $12 billion in the fourth quarter. Deployment picked up significantly across our platforms in the second half of the year, and we invested over $22 billion of capital in 2023. We expect our robust pace of deployment to continue in 2024. Looking briefly at activity within our Private Equity strategies. For Capital Asia, 2023 was a record year for deployment, with investments closed in almost every region where we operate. In the fourth quarter alone, we closed three transactions, including a very interesting platform building investment that combines several hospital groups in Southeast Asia. This unique transaction led by our existing portfolio company, Columbia, Asia, creates one of the largest hospital ecosystems in Southeast Asia and aligns with our thematic focus on building regional platforms of scale, with high strategic value. In our Growth platform, we expect to see greater deployment across both our Growth and Tech adjacencies funds in 2024, as companies address pressing needs for primary capital, as well as pressure for secondary liquidity. We raised $1.1 billion of capital for our sixth growth fund during the rolling first close in the quarter and activated the fund. Our Impact platform has remained extremely active, with strong investment pace across both our Rise and Rise Climate funds. Our first Rise Climate Fund is now approximately 75% invested and reserved, across a diverse portfolio of 21 companies, that grew revenue nearly 30% in 2023. Additionally, our two IPOs last year, Nextracker and Tata Technologies have both traded up more than 100% from their respective IPO offer prices, and we recently monetized a portion of our ownership in Nextracker. We are well positioned with strong momentum, as we prepare to launch our second Climate Private Equity fund and new Climate Transition Infrastructure strategy. Turning to our Credit strategies. Our middle market direct lending platform, TPG Twin Brook, has maintained its strong performance through a sector-driven strategy and disciplined approach in providing loans at the top of the capital structure with robust covenant protections. Despite the volatile market backdrop during 2023, Twin Brook had no realized credit losses and deployed nearly $3 billion of capital on a pro forma basis into more than 30 new companies and over 260 add-on investments to existing borrowers. Our Corporate Credit Strategy Credit Solutions continued to perform well during the quarter, and this contributed to its excellent full year results. In 2023, both the U.S. high-yield and leveraged loan indices were up over 13% and each of our active credit solutions funds outperformed these indices by several hundred basis points. In terms of capital activity, Credit Solutions invested more than $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter, notably in a number of bespoke, privately structured financing transactions and deployed nearly $2.7 billion of capital in 2023 and both on a pro forma basis. In addition, our Essential Housing business originated financing projects during the year with more than $4 billion of aggregate land and site development costs. Turning to asset-based lending and specialty finance. These strategies have become an increasingly important part of the private credit ecosystem. Clients are looking to diversify underlying cash flows away from corporate EBITDA and shift fixed income allocations to price structured credit opportunities. In addition, public securitized credit continues to trade with an attractive excess spread relative to corporate credit. Finally, last year's regional banking prices further enhanced, both the investment opportunity set and client interest in the space. As a result of the dislocation and traditional structured credit providers, we have already deployed more than 60% of TPG AG's and Norwell [ph] asset-based private credit fund and more than 30 transactions, and we expect to scale this strategy over time. And in Real Estate, we continue to see compelling opportunities to acquire attractive assets from sellers in need of capital -- in need of solutions capital. For example, in the fourth quarter, our TREP Fund acquired a majority interest in two Class A Industrial business parks in the Greater Toronto area, which we view as one of the best performing industrial markets in North America with a sub-2% vacancy rate and high barriers to entry. Additionally, TPG AG Real Estate had $7.3 billion of dry powder at year-end, with dedicated funds in the U.S., Europe and Asia and a global network of approximately 200 operating partners, TPG AG real estate is well positioned to deploy its flexible and opportunistic capital across a range of attractive opportunities. Finally, I want to highlight TPG Next, which completed its inaugural investment this quarter in the visualized group, a new investment manager. TPG will serve as a significant anchor investor and visualizes private equity strategy and will provide the firm with institutional resources to support business building and scale. This strategic partnership is a strong example of our commitment to augmenting diverse leadership within our industry, and we look forward to continuing to see high potential investment managers. Although we remain cautious due to an uncertain macro environment characterized by increasing valuations, anticipation of Fed policy decisions and significant geopolitical tensions, 2024 is off to a very active start for TPG. We have a robust pipeline of interesting investment opportunities. We are engaged in high-quality dialogue with many existing and new clients and we see a number of levers to drive further growth and innovation across our business.  We have a lot of work to do this year, but I'm confident in our ability to continue to deliver for our clients and build long-term value for our shareholders.  Now I'll turn it over to Jack to review our financial results.\nJack Weingart : Thank you, John. As Gary mentioned earlier, I'll be discussing our results today on an actual basis, which includes two months of TPG Angelo Gordon from the acquisition close date of November 1, through December 31. In our earnings release, we've also provided pro forma financials for the fourth quarter and full year 2023, which assumed the transaction closed on January 1, 2023. We ended the year with $222 billion of total assets under management, up 64% year-over-year. This was driven by $75 billion of acquired AUM, $16 billion of capital raised and value creation of $7 billion, partially offset by $10 billion of realizations and $1 billion in outflows over the last 12 months. As John mentioned, we had a strong quarter for fundraising, due to the final closes across our capital and Rise funds, as well as the rolling first close of our growth fund. Fee earning AUM increased 76% year-over-year to $137 billion, and we had more than $51 billion of dry powder available to deploy, representing 38% of fee-earning AUM. We also had AUM subject to fee earning growth of $24 billion at the end of the year, of which $14 billion was not yet earning fees. This represents a significant embedded growth driver of potential management fee growth, as we deploy this capital, particularly across our credit vehicles. Fee-related revenue was $465 million in the quarter, up 45% sequentially and 51% year-over-year and $1.3 billion for the year, up 23% from 2022. Management fees totaled $396 million in the quarter and grew 42% sequentially, due in part to the inclusion of TPG AG in our results, as well as substantial catch-up fees related to the final closes for the capital and Rise Funds. Transaction fees increased 79% sequentially and 20% year-over-year to $55 million in Q4. A record level and totaled $108 million for the full year. Our fourth quarter transaction fees were elevated by the closing of several large transactions, where TPG was the sole or lead arranger for the debt financing. As Jon noted, over time, we expect to drive growth in transaction fee revenues, as we expand our broker-dealer capabilities to TPG AG. However, Q1 is often a seasonally light quarter for deal closings, as we saw last year. And we expect that to be the case again this year.  Fee-related earnings were $226 million for the fourth quarter, up 45% sequentially and 62% year-over-year. And $606 million for 2023, up 34% from 2022. Our FRE margin was 49% for the fourth quarter and 45% for the last 12 months, a 350 basis point improvement from 2022. On a pro forma basis, assuming the AG acquisition closed on January 1, our FRE margin would have been 47% for the fourth quarter and 40% for the full year. It's important to note that these pro forma margins were elevated by the significant catch-up fees and transaction revenues in the fourth quarter. As we've discussed previously, our normalized margin has blended down through the inclusion of TPG AG, and we now have a meaningful opportunity to drive profitable growth through our margin expansion. We expect our FRE margin to exceed 40% for the year in 2024, as we realize operating leverage and synergies from the integration and scaling of our business. While also investing in growth initiatives we've described. We will continue to maintain strong expense discipline and over the longer term, we expect our margin to scale back up to and exceed 45%. After-tax distributable earnings for the fourth quarter were $206 million or $0.51 per share of Class A common stock, including $19 million from realized performance allocations. Our realization activity last year reflected our bias in a volatile market to focus on building value in our relatively young portfolios, and we remained selective in our exit activity. That being said, as markets have begun to normalize, our pipeline of potential monetizations has increased. Assuming markets remain supportive, we expect realized performance allocations to increase in 2024.  In the fourth quarter, we also incurred $18 million of non-core expenses related to the closing of the Angelo Gordon acquisition, which is included in our realized investment income and other line item. While we will continue to incur ongoing integration costs, we expect this to normalize now the transaction is closed.  Turning to our non-GAAP balance sheet. We used a portion of our cash and revolver capacity to fund the closing of the AG transaction in the fourth quarter. We ended the year with $105 million of cash and cash equivalents, approximately $500 million drawn on a revolver and $450 million of other long-term debt. As I've mentioned previously, we upsized our revolver from $700 million to $1.2 billion last September and currently have approximately $700 million of undrawn capacity. Our balance sheet post closing remains conservative, with moderate leverage and ample liquidity.  Our net accrued performance balance at the end of the year was $891 million, compared to $692 million in the third quarter. This 29% increase was driven by $141 million of accrued carry attributable to TPG AG, at the acquisition date and the $77 million increase in the value of our investments, partially offset by $19 million in realized gains. While our operating model is FRE-centric, we have significant embedded performance-related earnings potential, and we expect our financial results will benefit from the eventual pickup in realizations. At the end of the year, our performance eligible AUM totaled $192 billion or 87% of our total AUM, of which $151 billion was performance fee generating. Our portfolio has continued to demonstrate resilience, through a period of high volatility, underpinned by our deep sector expertise and careful investment selection in assets with strong growth and durable margins. Our Private Equity portfolio, which includes our Capital, Growth and Impact platforms, appreciated approximately 4% in the quarter and 9% over the last 12 months. In aggregate, our portfolio companies grew revenue by more than 20% over the last 12 months. The operating environment is normalizing, and our portfolio continues to demonstrate strong cost management and stable margins.  TPG AG's credits appreciation of 4% in the quarter and 14% in 2023 on a pro forma basis, was driven by strong credit selection and a low annualized loss ratio across the portfolio. Our strategies also benefited from the broad credit market rally heading into the end of the year. In Real Estate, the performance of our portfolio reflects the broader challenges in the sector, resulting from higher rates. Although the fundamentals across our underlying core sectors and assets remain strong.  Looking forward, I'll reiterate the guidance that we provided at our Teach-In in November. We expect our total private equity and infrastructure capital raised in 2024 to grow compared to 2023, driven by the fundraises for growth and Rise Climate as well as the launch of our Climate Transition Infrastructure Strategy. Additionally, in 2024, we expect fundraising for TPG AG Credit to exceed $10 billion, more than doubling the capital raised by the platform in 2023 on a pro forma basis.  On credit deployment, as Jon indicated, we expect a significant increase in each of our core strategies this year, which will grow our base of fee earning AUM. Stepping back, we're excited about the progress we've made over the past two years, in executing against our strategic priorities. We've scaled and diversified our business, while maintaining a strong focus on delivering excellent returns for our clients. Looking forward, we're equally excited about our path ahead. We have great visibility into the next phase of our growth with multiple levers to expand our asset base and drive revenue growth and operating leverage. We're confident in our ability to continue delivering differentiated performance for our clients and long-term value for our shareholders.  Now I'll turn the call back to the operator to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.\nAlex Blostein : Hi, good morning, everybody. Thank you for the question. My first question is around credit, albeit it's got two quick parts to it. So the first is, hear you on the expectations for accelerating fundraising? And I think you reiterated over the $10 billion number that you talked about previously. Can you just spend a minute on what that comprised of, in terms of the key strategies, but also how much of that growth is sort of like embedded legacy AG relationships or you're also incorporating some of the incremental cross-selling opportunities that we talked about between AG and TPG?  And then on the deployment side, and that's the second question here. I was just curious, within the $132 million of sort of shadow fees, how much of that is related to credit? Thanks. \nJon Winkelried : Thanks, Alex. I'll start and then on the last part of it, we'll see if we dig that out. But -- and if not, we'll follow up with you. But, first of all, on the capital formation side, I think that we expect a healthy mix between capital formation, from existing relationships that the AG Credit team currently has, and we're actively involved in those dialogues really across the strategies. We also expect that as we've talked about before, given the lack of overlap in the LP base of both TPG and AG, that there continues to be an exceptional opportunity for us to expand the breadth of capital formation to relationships that TPG has that AG is being introduced to now.  And I think you and I have talked about this before, but we're spending a lot of time even since the -- prior to the close, but certainly post close, we're spending a lot of time with our capital formation team focused on expanding the breadth of those relationships on the Credit side. And we feel like we're making good progress. So I'd expect that when we finish this year that will have a nice broadening and deepening of AG credit relationships that will contribute to that and also form the base for future growth in those strategies.  We're also in the market. I think I mentioned in my comments, we're also in the market with -- and in process of a number of vehicles for TPG AG Credit, that will be raising capital in the Wealth channel, and that will be a continued focus of ours in terms of expanding the access and reach in the Wealth channel and creating multiple vehicles for each of these strategies, so that the capital raising also becomes more of an ongoing capability as we expand that reach. And I think I mentioned, we have a number of channel partners that have already started that process with us.  So I'd expect to see deep and further penetration there as well, given the increase in the brand recognition with TPG AG together, as well as, frankly, the track record that they've created as a result of the investing activity. So I expect to see that as well.  And I think that, as I said, we're in the market with all of our Credit strategies. And so expect that the growth in fundraising will occur. It's hard for me to say exactly how it will break down between the three different pillars of our credit strategies, but the growth will occur across all three.\nJack Weingart : And Alex, this is Jack. On your question about the $132 million of estimated annual fee opportunity from both AUM, not yet earning fees and subject fee step-up, that's weighted toward the AUM not yet earning fees, as you expect. Probably $100 million of that is in that bucket and $30 million or so is in the fee step-up category. And within the AUM not yet earning fees, the biggest components would be across AG's Credit and Real Estate business is probably half of that, call it, $50 million of the $100 million and the remainder kind of weighted toward TPG Growth and Real Estate platforms. And in the FAUM subject to step up, that $30 million, the biggest component of that would be in the Capital platform because you remember, we had the J-curve mitigant structure in some of our capital that steps up as we invest capital. And about $10 million is in the AG Real Estate business.\nAlex Blostein : Great. Thank you both. \nOperator: The next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.\nKen Worthington : Hi, [indiscernible] through a more aggressive realization phase as part of the IPO --\nJon Winkelried : Ken, your first part of your question broke up. We couldn't hear you. Can you start again?\nKen Worthington : Yeah, I apologize. As we think about net accrued carry, you've called out a number of times that you went through a more aggressive realization phase, prior to the IPO. But if we looked at the accrued carry today by vintage, 80% is older than five years, and it would seem like realizations should be front-end loaded. How do we think about 2024, from a realization perspective, if the market environment remains benign?  And can you remind us how the European Waterfall Structure and the Angelo Gordon fund should reasonably play out over the next few years?\nJon Winkelried : Do you want to -- Todd, do you want to comment on realizations on the private equity side, first?\nTodd Sisitsky : Yeah. Let me -- I'll start on that. This is certainly an area we spend a lot of time focusing on as a partner group. It's important to our investors. It's important to our good fund management. And we spent the last few years really investing in our companies, and we have some very well-performing companies that I think should be in a good position to realize value in the year and years ahead. It is, I think, worth noting we've had some important successes in recent quarters. I think, we mentioned the sale of CAA in the second half of last year, which was a strong exit that was, again, to your point about duration. That was a 13-year partnership and we waited and really picked our spot.  We also had actually an important realization in recent weeks. We sold a sizable block of shares in Nextracker, which is a company went public in the first quarter of '23, is up about 130% from its IPO price. One more example of just how we really are able to pick our spots, particularly on the Private Equity side. Over the last two years, we launched seven IPOs in India and all the positions that we still hold are trading well above their IPO offer price. And of course, IPOs are leading indicators of liquidity. So some opportunities there.  So there have been important recent successes. But overall, to your -- the start of your question, we've been selective, and we've really been building value in the portfolio after a very big cycle of realizations in '21 and '22. But as far as the go forward, we're very focused on driving liquidity to the firm. And as the market recovers, we are actively managing the private equity, as a partner group in each business unit. And with -- with the growing momentum in the overall deal market and the strength of these portfolio companies, we do feel like there's going to be an increasing number of opportunities to drive liquidity this year.\nKen Worthington : Great. Thank you. \nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Cyprus with Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprys : Hi good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to come back to the Private Wealth opportunity. I was hoping you could maybe elaborate on the positioning now that you guys have within the Private Wealth marketplace. Maybe talk to some of the products that you have. I think you alluded to bringing some new products to the marketplace, as well. How are you thinking about that? What sort of traction are you seeing on the existing products, in the marketplace, maybe talk to some of the steps that you're looking to take here in '24? Thank you. \nJon Winkelried : Yeah. Well, I think we've been actively engaged in dialogue with a number of channel partners. And I think, Mike, you know that prior to the AG acquisition, raising some capital through our Private Equity and Real Estate strategies through those channel partners was a routine part of what we were doing on essentially campaign by campaign. The relationship dialogue now is taking a completely sort of different step function. It's like a step function change because with the expansion of our strategies as a result of the AG acquisition, and the ability to offer more continuously offered vehicles, such as BDCs, et cetera, that -- and the pre-existing dialogue that AG had with a number of channel partners, we've come together now, and we've been having a series of really kind of strategic dialogue with our channel partners about a more holistic approach to how we're approaching that channel. And I've actually had several of those meetings myself over the course of the last month or so. And what I would say to you is that there is a very strong appetite from the Wealth channel partners in having a more holistic product offering from TPG. There's a strong desire in the channel. I mean you obviously know what the data looks like yourself in terms of the available capacity in the Wealth channel, wanting to allocate to various strategies. And we're seeing strong demand for having some level of diversification in brands that are driving products through the channel.  And so as a result of that, I would say that we're very encouraged by what we're hearing from those channel partners, and we're actively deploying into those opportunities. If you look at our resource here, our resource as a result of the combined two firms, more than doubled in terms of our team that's focused on the penetration of the channel product creation, product structuring, as well as essentially feet on the street and from a marketing and relationship management point of view. And so that's been a noticeable step function change for us.  So we have products that are up in the channel and will continue to be across our direct lending business for Twin Brook. We have products that are up on the channel for our Structured Credit business. And besides, obviously, some of our private equity strategies that were also going to offer through the channel. So it's now looking like a complete menu of product capabilities, I should have mentioned also including our real estate capability as well. So it's now looking like a complete menu.  And our brand is a very strong brand, and it's gaining more and more traction in the channel, as we continue to as we continue to put resources behind it. So we're feeling pretty good about what we expect to do in the Wealth channels over time. And I think it will -- and we've said before, I think over the course of the last two years, we've talked about it, our objective for strengthening our distribution base there and also having become a larger part of our sourcing of capital. And we're on a path to do that.\nMichael Cyprys : Great. Thank you. \nOperator: The next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America.\nCraig Siegenthaler : Hey, good morning, everyone. So for my question, I wanted to hit on the FRE margin target. Your 47% pro forma FRE margin already beat your 45% long-term target, although I think this was driven by catch-up fees and transaction fees. And then starting '24, Angelo Gordon initially will weigh on the margin, but this will reverse as you realize cost synergies. So as you pull all this together, isn't your 40% 2024 and 45% long-term targets too conservative? Or is this also implying a healthy level of investing?\nJack Weingart : Thanks, Craig, for the question. We think it's the right target for us to be articulating at this point. I think you mentioned some of the key drivers. The fourth quarter margins, as I mentioned in my comments, were elevated by the catch-up fees. They also benefited from above expected core fundraising but also strong transaction fees. So some of those will not reoccur in 2024. Think about the fundraising waves we're in the middle of, over a longer arc, right? We just completed the large flagship private equity fund raises. Those had some natural elevated catch-up fees towards the end of them. Now we're entering the market with some big new flagships like the new Private Equity fund in Climate, the Infrastructure Funding Climate, the new growth fund those will likely complete in 2025. And as you get toward the end of campaigns, you'll see some more catch-up fees again in '25 in connection with those funds. So when you -- and on your cost synergy point, we mentioned at the Analyst Day, that we had achieved $9 million of cost synergies. We've also said consistently that this transaction is much more about growth and diversification and investing and growing our platform over the years and not really about dropping cost synergies to the bottom line. We are finding additional cost synergies above the $9 million. Our intention is to reinvest those in long-term growth.  So when we take all that into account, we think the margins we're targeting for this year are appropriate. And longer term, we certainly will be scaling our businesses and generating operating leverage.\nCraig Siegenthaler : Thanks, Jack.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mike Brown with KBW.\nMike Brown : Great, good morning. I wanted to start with the -- maybe the insurance opportunity. I guess it's few months since you closed in Angelo Gordon, I just wanted to see if there was any update on the opportunities there in terms of the opportunity of looking at from strategic partners?  And then when you think about the broader platform now you've got full diversification across a lot of the major product lines. But is there any element of the Credit business that you think you want to continue to bolster and build out to really fully service the insurance balance sheet?\nJon Winkelried : Sure. Yeah, it's a good question because it's very much something that we're focused on and we've been focused on. Let me just say that -- just reiterate that the insurance opportunity, I think, is both sort of -- there's two categories of opportunity. One is we currently have a number of insurance companies that are clients of ours, across a range of our products. So think of the insurance sector is also a source of LP penetration, and that exists here to date on both sides of the firm, both across all of our strategies. And I think with the expansion of our general product capabilities, I think we are able to have a dialogue with insurance companies that's a bit more holistic, and we're already seeing the benefits of that and we have a dedicated team covering the insurance sector, as LPs with the embedded knowledge of what's important to insurance companies in terms of their asset selection process. So, that, I would say, is one part of it that continues to grow and continues to be a great opportunity for us, and it's also a global opportunity.  Secondly, on the strategic side, obviously, we've talked about this before with our expansion into -- across the range of asset classes. The opportunity to have a more strategic dialogue with a number of insurance companies is clearly there, it's front and center for us. And I would say that since the announcement of the acquisition of Angelo Gordon, that dialogue has picked up quite meaningfully. And so we're doing a lot of work on it. I would say we're evaluating opportunities. And of course, we'll be very selective and careful in terms of what we ultimately do so that we position ourselves in the most strategic way we can. And as far as the product lines, particularly on the Credit side, we feel we feel great about the mix of product capability that we have in AG. I mean one of the things that attracted us to Angelo Gordon, was that it was a multi-strategy platform. It wasn't a mono line that, for instance, was only doing direct lending. It was a multi-strategy platform. So it had a direct lending capability. It has a Credit Solutions capability, and it has a Structured Credit capability. And in particular, I would say one of the things that is very important in the process of managing assets on behalf of insurance companies is making sure that you have product structuring capabilities, whether it's creating rated note structures, risk tranching and asset sourcing capabilities outside of just pure essentially EBITDA risk, outside of purely the corporate side, you've got to also be able to reach and source product on the non-EBITDA side. So our Structured Credit business in terms of asset-based finance, specialty finance, securitized mortgage product, across the whole range of those products, we have a -- we have a business that's been built out over the last 15 years that has infrastructure, servicing capability and product breadth. So, now we'll never be done building those businesses. We'll continue to build those businesses and expand them as we're able to scale them with respect to more capital, but we feel pretty good about the tools that we have.  So that\u2019s how we feel we\u2019re positioned right now.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brian McKenna with Citizens JMP.\nBrian Mckenna : Great, thanks. So performance in Rise Climate is pretty impressive today with an IRR of 27%. It would be great just to get some color on really what's driving this outperformance? And then with the next rise climate and infrastructure funds coming down the pike, what are your initial base case expectations for performance for these strategies?\nJon Winkelried : James, I think you're on.\nJames Coulter : Thanks for the questions and greetings from Geneva, where I'm above about the 10th city of the Rise Climate launch. So I'm well positioned to answer those questions. I'd say the outperformance last year was really being in the right place ahead of a wave. We started the decarbonization investment journey almost seven years ago. And as a result, I think we ourselves in a position to lead the market in terms of deployment and opportunity creation. Last year, I think the value creation for the fund was up 37%, which is obviously a standout in Private Equity. But in particular, we were able to execute two very important IPOs in a market, where IPOs were certainly rare. And that's because I think that the public market is ready for the next generation of climate forward companies. So this fund is fund that so far in a world where we live has happened as expected in Private Equity. It's been invested in exactly the three years that we told the market to be invested. It's in 20-plus companies well diversified. And so far, the performance, I think, as you pointed out, has been strong.  Going forward, we continue to think we're well positioned to show the market differentiated opportunities, and we should be able to continue to generate the Private Equity target returns that we've been focused on in this fund. In the Infrastructure world, I think you continue to see a fair amount of interest in decarbonization and our position essentially expanding from Private Equity into the Infrastructure adjacency offers, I think, a significant opportunity for us. So this is a period of time that investors are looking for sector differentiation, and I think we're in a good position to continue to offer it in live climate.\nJack Weingart : And Brian, in terms of in terms of fundraising targets for the business, if that's what you're referring to, we did say publicly when the commitment was announced that we were targeting at least $10 billion, across our next Private Equity fund, TRC 2, combined with the Global South initiative. So those numbers do not include the Infrastructure business. That won't all be raised this year. It will be raised over this year and next year. And assume that those funds will be activated more toward the end of the year.\nBrian Mckenna : Great, thanks, Jack. \nOperator: The next question comes from Luke Mason with BNP Paribas.\nLuke Mason : Yeah, thanks for taking my question. It's just on transaction fees. You talked about pipelines picking up back Q1 seasonally weaker and you integrate AG there. So I'm just wondering how we should think about the potential growth in kind of capital markets transaction fee revenue in the coming years, if we issue more benign markets? Thank you. \nJack Weingart : Good question, Luke. If you separate that into kind of the legacy TPG businesses and the Capital Markets business, we're building here and then think about adding Capital Markets fees through the integration of AG, particularly on the Credit side. What we've said historically is we think of a normal run rate for that TPG Capital Markets business, at today's level to be around $100 million. So on a quarterly basis, $55 million is high, relative to that normal run rate.  Now that's going to be growing over time as we grow our businesses. And then you layer on top of that opportunities from AG, which were in the early innings of developing. So I would think of the AG contribution growing, during the course of the year this year. And then the TPG side, stepping down to a below normal level in Q1 because of the seasonally light number of deals closing in Q1. So the TPG side back loaded and the AG side also kind of feathering in, during the course of the year and growing during the course of the year.  So much like this year, where you saw our Capital Markets revenue line start low and grow toward the back of the year, I'd expect the same kind of pattern this year.\nLuke Mason : Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. \nJack Weingart : Yeah, thanks. \nOperator: The next question comes from Bill Katz with TD Cowen.\nBill Katz: Okay. Thank you very much for taking the question, this morning. Just want to pick up on that last question. As you think about the opportunity set for the capital markets platform within the Angelo Gordon, would Apollo be a reasonable directional view? And then how much of that assumption is embedded in the 45% long-term FRE margin target? Thank you. \nJack Weingart : Yeah, good question. We -- I think what Apollo is doing is a decent kind of directional proxy for the opportunity set. I would say we're pretty early in kind of underwriting that opportunity for ourselves. So we're not ready to put a target number out there. But the longer-term FRE margin of 45%, I would say, only incorporates a piece of that opportunity.\nBill Katz: That\u2019s it for me, thank you. \nJack Weingart : Thanks. \nOperator: The next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.\nBrian Bedell : Great, good morning, folks. Maybe my questions were answered. But maybe just some perspective on the timing of the deployment that you outlined on Slide 18, in terms of the $132 million and thanks for the color on breaking or segmenting that $132 million. But just if you can give us some color on how you think that might be deployed over the course of this year? Is it -- are we in a situation where we're likely to see that $132 million be reflected, say, mostly by year-end? Or is it much more dependent on credit conditions within AG?\nJack Weingart : Well, I would say, as I said a few minutes ago, most of that $132 million is associated with capital not yet deployed, not the natural step-up of capital already deployed on fees, the step-up structures -- funds or step-up structures.  So just thinking about your question, real time, that capital underlying the capital not yet deployed probably has just taken a kind of swag a three-year deployment pace to it on average across those funds. So if I had to take a guess, I'd say that would kind of feather in over about a three-year period.\nBrian Bedell : Great. Thank you. \nJack Weingart : Thanks. \nOperator: The next question comes from Adam Beatty with UBS.\nAdam Beatty : Thank you and good morning. I just want to ask about performance within the Credit portfolio. I appreciate the earlier comments around I think it was either equity or firm-wide, 20% revenue growth with stable margins. But there is some concern these days around middle market credit despite the growth there. Obviously, AG Credit performance was quite good. And I know there's pretty intense monitoring and tight docks around that. So just wondering, any detail you could share about how those companies are performing, whether or not there's been equity backstops or what have you? Thanks very much. \nJack Weingart : General question on that in a second, but I just want to finish that last question that Brian asked, the 132. So I don't want to leave the impression that, that's like a onetime opportunity that comes in over a three-year period. As that capital is deployed, we're obviously raising a lot more credit capital, as we've talked about. So the $10 billion of credit capital plus that we expect to raise this year will all come in with no fees yet. And have whatever fee rate you want to assume across our Credit business, we've provided some detail there.  So that 132 of fee opportunity should be growing over time as we're realizing was embedded today.\nJon Winkelried : Just to pick up on the question on -- in terms of credit quality and what's happening in the portfolio. I think that, as I mentioned or alluded to, performance has been across our Credit strategies has been very, very good. And just to give you some -- maybe a little bit more color on some data on it. If you look at our Direct Lending business through Twin Brook, here, by the way, our pipeline is up reasonably meaningfully this year based upon transaction activity that we're seeing. We're also seeing generally a quality uptrend, just in terms of the opportunities that we're seeing. But if you look at the performance of the business over the course of last year, we had no credit losses in the business. And the performance of the portfolio was generally reflective, I think, of what was happening overall within our Private Equity portfolios. Remember that Twin Brooks business is very sector focused. And so across things like Business Services and Health Care within their portfolio, they saw strong performance.  And so I think on the -- at least from -- at least in terms of our selection criteria, what we do, we obviously have a very a very selective process of how we're underwriting. We also are underwriting in that business with lower leverage on average, as a result of the lower middle market nature of it, as well as covenant protections across our portfolio, which obviously allows us to get back to the table and work with sponsors to the extent that we need to. But portfolio was very strong overall. And I would say the outlook in terms of the pipeline continues to be on an uptrend, in terms of quality generally.  In Credit Solutions, if you look across our business, I think I said in my comments that our performance was very strong, in excess of 300 basis point premium, over where the indices ended up. I think Jack alluded to the fact that there was a strong rally in Credit spreads at the end of the year. That obviously had a significant impact on the portfolio. And any -- and generally, what we've done is where we see a change in valuation like that and return to historical tight spreads, we've been generally net sellers of the public credit opportunity, as a result of that. So we've been -- we've been liquidating a number of positions across our Credit Solutions book. And we've essentially pivoted our focus from kind of public opportunities because of the tightness of the market, to really more private opportunities, more bespoke private opportunities, which are a combination of structuring private credit opportunities as well as rescue finance opportunities. And the opportunity set there in front of us is very, very substantial and very large. If you look at the structure of the market. There's over $1 trillion of single B-rated or CCC rated capital structures that are essentially coming due over the course of the next several years. If you look at the market right now, about almost half of the leveraged loan market has less than two times interest coverage, which is -- and that's probably more typically like 20% of the market, historically has less than two times interest coverage. So with those -- with that structural dynamic in force in the market right now, it's going to create a lot of very interesting private opportunities for us to execute on. And there, we're able to use we're able to use our sector knowledge and our industry knowledge, across both our Credit business as well as our Private Equity business, in order to underwrite those credits and value those companies. So we feel like that the dynamics in terms of the way that's setting up is very positive for us.  And then lastly, on the Structured Credit side, the biggest theme here is, what's going on with respect to the need for capital. And when you look at the community and regional bank stresses that are going on in the market and continuing to go on in the market, we think we're very early in terms of that dynamic playing out. It's kind of a second or third inning dynamic with respect to regional bank deleveraging, and we're going to continue to see that stress drive asset sales and credit risk transfer. And I think overall, we're also seeing an opportunity to upgrade the quality of the counterparties that we're working with, looking for that risk transfer. And on average, I would say non-EBITDA credit has not participated in the rally that corporate credit has participated in. So in terms of relative value, we see a lot of interesting opportunities there. And there have been a number of situations recently, for instance, we just purchased a portfolio, a $600 million portfolio of consumer secured loans from a community bank with really attractive return characteristics to it.  So, the portfolio is in great shape and the opportunity set is even better. So that -- hopefully, that gives you some guidance on how we're positioned.\nAdam Beatty : Very helpful.

            "content": "Thanks for the questions and greetings from Geneva, where I'm above about the 10th city of the Rise Climate launch. So I'm well positioned to answer those questions. I'd say the outperformance last year was really being in the right place ahead of a wave. We started the decarbonization investment journey almost seven years ago. And as a result, I think we ourselves in a position to lead the market in terms of deployment and opportunity creation. Last year, I think the value creation for the fund was up 37%, which is obviously a standout in Private Equity. But in particular, we were able to execute two very important IPOs in a market, where IPOs were certainly rare. And that's because I think that the public market is ready for the next generation of climate forward companies. So this fund is fund that so far in a world where we live has happened as expected in Private Equity. It's been invested in exactly the three years that we told the market to be invested. It's in 20-plus companies well diversified. And so far, the performance, I think, as you pointed out, has been strong.  Going forward, we continue to think we're well positioned to show the market differentiated opportunities, and we should be able to continue to generate the Private Equity target returns that we've been focused on in this fund. In the Infrastructure world, I think you continue to see a fair amount of interest in decarbonization and our position essentially expanding from Private Equity into the Infrastructure adjacency offers, I think, a significant opportunity for us. So this is a period of time that investors are looking for sector differentiation, and I think we're in a good position to continue to offer it in live climate."

            "name": "Jon Winkelried",
            "content": "Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone. 2023 was a transformative year for TPG, and I'll begin today by sharing several updates on our progress.  On last February's earnings call, we laid out a growth agenda for the year that included three key components. First, scaling our existing strategies and in particular, completing several important fundraises, second, continuing our strong track record of driving organic growth and innovation; and third, expanding our business through targeted acquisitions. We're excited about the progress we've made in all three of these areas. Looking at our business today, we manage more than $220 billion across private equity, credit and real estate and we furthered our position as a scaled, differentiated investment firm.  I'll review a few highlights from the past year and also discuss our outlook. First, as it relates to existing strategies, we have completed the fundraises for the next generation of our TPG Capital, Healthcare partners and Rise funds. We have grown our fund sizes, vintage over vintage, across each of these campaigns which is a significant accomplishment given the persistent industry headwinds in private equity fundraising. This is a direct result of TPG's differentiated investment strategies, outstanding performance track record and strong and growing client relationships. Specifically, for TPG Capital 9 and Healthcare Partners too, we held our final close with $15.6 billion of aggregate commitments, up 10% from the prior vintage. And for Rise 3, we closed on $2.7 billion, up 24%. In addition to expanding our existing relationships, we also added many new clients to TPG from around the world with notable progress in the Middle East and Asia. We believe these new client relationships create significant potential for embedded growth in successor funds, as well as the opportunity to expand engagement across additional TPG strategies and products.  For our ongoing Capital Asia campaign, we have raised $4.3 billion of capital as of year-end and will hold a final close in the coming months. Our clients continue to express strong interest, and we expect to fund to be larger than its predecessor. Second, we continue to demonstrate our ability to grow organically by launching and scaling products in parts of the market, where we have distinct competitive advantages. I'll highlight a few of these initiatives. Our new real estate credit strategy received more than $750 million of commitments and closed on approximately $650 million in the fourth quarter. We are now actively investing and the current market backdrop is one of the most interesting environments we've seen since the early 2000s, for real estate credit, given the dynamics of higher rates, declining asset values and a significant pullback in commercial real estate lending. Our strategy is purpose-built for this part of the cycle, and we intend to continue to raise capital in 2024.  Turning to climate. At COP 28 this past December, we announced a $1.5 billion commitment to the next generation of TPG Rise Climate Private Equity Funds from Altera, the UAE's $30 billion climate-focused investment manager. This includes a $1 billion commitment to our second Rise Climate Fund and a $500 million commitment to our new Global Solve initiative. The UAE selection of TPG as its first private equity partner is a testament to the strong brand and leadership position, we've built in the Climate and Impact space.  Within our Climate strategy, we are also preparing to launch our Inova Climate Transition Infrastructure Fund. And just last week, we announced that Scott Lebo will be joining TPG later this year as the Head of Infrastructure for TPG Rise Climate. Scott most recently served as a global co-head and co-CIO of infrastructure investing at Goldman Sachs, and we're excited for him to help bring our differentiated strategy to market. Finally, we closed the acquisition of Angelo Gordon in the fourth quarter, meaningfully expanding our capabilities across credit and real estate and further enhancing our presence in Europe and Asia. We believe the acquisition of Angelo Gordon will be a significant growth driver for the firm in a number of ways. One key area is furthering our penetration in high-growth distribution channels, such as private wealth and insurance. And so far this year, we have secured new distribution relationships for our direct lending BDC and Credit Solutions Fund with several large wire houses and private banking partners. We are focused on delivering additional products that provide private wealth investors access to our strategies, and we look forward to sharing more with you in the future.  We also continue to make progress on standing up new revenue opportunities and businesses that leverage the combined expertise and capabilities of TPG and AG. The most near term is the ability to generate incremental fee revenue from the integration of our Capital Markets business into TPG AG Credit, which is already well underway. Our strategic growth initiatives over the last few years have led to a step function change in our business. Through both organic innovation and the acquisition of AG, we have substantially expanded the breadth of our franchise across private equity, credit, real estate and soon-to-be infrastructure. As a result, the cadence and consistency of our capital raising and overall growth profile have fundamentally changed. We will be in the market on a steadier, more consistent basis across both the Institutional and Private Wealth channels.  Looking ahead, we expect our growth this year to be driven by five primary vectors, including: one, credit fundraising across all our TPG AG strategies; two, the newest vintages of our growth and Rise climate private equity funds; three, the launch of our climate transition infrastructure strategy, four, the completion of several first-time fund raises, including real estate credit and GP secondaries; and five, new product and channel development.  Turning to our fourth quarter results. We had a strong year -- a strong end to the year with $8.8 billion of capital raised in the quarter, primarily across the campaigns, I discussed earlier. We believe we are well positioned with $51 billion of dry powder to deploy into what we view as an improving market backdrop.  You may remember that during our second quarter '23 earnings call, we discussed several factors that were contributing to a ramp-up in our transaction pipelines, including narrowing bid-ask spreads, greater receptivity among corporates to strategically realign their businesses and GP is increasingly seeking creative solutions for monetizations.  These forces have been accelerating, and TPG has continued to deploy capital by leveraging our long-dated themes and core strains, such as executing corporate carve-outs and structuring proprietary creative financing solutions. As we look ahead in areas such as real estate, we expect to see more attractive assets for sale this year that would otherwise typically not come to market, as companies find themselves under increasing pressure for liquidity. In Private Equity, given TPG's deep sector focus, commitment to business building and strong track record of structuring win-win transactions. We continue to be a partner of choice for companies looking to strategically reposition their businesses and help drive growth. And in Credit, as we mentioned during the TPG AG Teach-In, the opportunity set continues to expand and we see -- we expect a significant increase in deployment this year, which will grow our base of fee earning AUM. The origination pipeline is robust across all of our Credit platforms, as borrowers seek alternatives to public debt financing with greater flexibility to meet their needs. We also expect a more active M&A pipeline, as the economy continues to show signs of steadier growth, leading to new origination opportunities. Our investment teams have been very busy deploying nearly $12 billion in the fourth quarter. Deployment picked up significantly across our platforms in the second half of the year, and we invested over $22 billion of capital in 2023. We expect our robust pace of deployment to continue in 2024. Looking briefly at activity within our Private Equity strategies. For Capital Asia, 2023 was a record year for deployment, with investments closed in almost every region where we operate. In the fourth quarter alone, we closed three transactions, including a very interesting platform building investment that combines several hospital groups in Southeast Asia. This unique transaction led by our existing portfolio company, Columbia, Asia, creates one of the largest hospital ecosystems in Southeast Asia and aligns with our thematic focus on building regional platforms of scale, with high strategic value. In our Growth platform, we expect to see greater deployment across both our Growth and Tech adjacencies funds in 2024, as companies address pressing needs for primary capital, as well as pressure for secondary liquidity. We raised $1.1 billion of capital for our sixth growth fund during the rolling first close in the quarter and activated the fund. Our Impact platform has remained extremely active, with strong investment pace across both our Rise and Rise Climate funds. Our first Rise Climate Fund is now approximately 75% invested and reserved, across a diverse portfolio of 21 companies, that grew revenue nearly 30% in 2023. Additionally, our two IPOs last year, Nextracker and Tata Technologies have both traded up more than 100% from their respective IPO offer prices, and we recently monetized a portion of our ownership in Nextracker. We are well positioned with strong momentum, as we prepare to launch our second Climate Private Equity fund and new Climate Transition Infrastructure strategy. Turning to our Credit strategies. Our middle market direct lending platform, TPG Twin Brook, has maintained its strong performance through a sector-driven strategy and disciplined approach in providing loans at the top of the capital structure with robust covenant protections. Despite the volatile market backdrop during 2023, Twin Brook had no realized credit losses and deployed nearly $3 billion of capital on a pro forma basis into more than 30 new companies and over 260 add-on investments to existing borrowers. Our Corporate Credit Strategy Credit Solutions continued to perform well during the quarter, and this contributed to its excellent full year results. In 2023, both the U.S. high-yield and leveraged loan indices were up over 13% and each of our active credit solutions funds outperformed these indices by several hundred basis points. In terms of capital activity, Credit Solutions invested more than $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter, notably in a number of bespoke, privately structured financing transactions and deployed nearly $2.7 billion of capital in 2023 and both on a pro forma basis. In addition, our Essential Housing business originated financing projects during the year with more than $4 billion of aggregate land and site development costs. Turning to asset-based lending and specialty finance. These strategies have become an increasingly important part of the private credit ecosystem. Clients are looking to diversify underlying cash flows away from corporate EBITDA and shift fixed income allocations to price structured credit opportunities. In addition, public securitized credit continues to trade with an attractive excess spread relative to corporate credit. Finally, last year's regional banking prices further enhanced, both the investment opportunity set and client interest in the space. As a result of the dislocation and traditional structured credit providers, we have already deployed more than 60% of TPG AG's and Norwell [ph] asset-based private credit fund and more than 30 transactions, and we expect to scale this strategy over time. And in Real Estate, we continue to see compelling opportunities to acquire attractive assets from sellers in need of capital -- in need of solutions capital. For example, in the fourth quarter, our TREP Fund acquired a majority interest in two Class A Industrial business parks in the Greater Toronto area, which we view as one of the best performing industrial markets in North America with a sub-2% vacancy rate and high barriers to entry. Additionally, TPG AG Real Estate had $7.3 billion of dry powder at year-end, with dedicated funds in the U.S., Europe and Asia and a global network of approximately 200 operating partners, TPG AG real estate is well positioned to deploy its flexible and opportunistic capital across a range of attractive opportunities. Finally, I want to highlight TPG Next, which completed its inaugural investment this quarter in the visualized group, a new investment manager. TPG will serve as a significant anchor investor and visualizes private equity strategy and will provide the firm with institutional resources to support business building and scale. This strategic partnership is a strong example of our commitment to augmenting diverse leadership within our industry, and we look forward to continuing to see high potential investment managers. Although we remain cautious due to an uncertain macro environment characterized by increasing valuations, anticipation of Fed policy decisions and significant geopolitical tensions, 2024 is off to a very active start for TPG. We have a robust pipeline of interesting investment opportunities. We are engaged in high-quality dialogue with many existing and new clients and we see a number of levers to drive further growth and innovation across our business.  We have a lot of work to do this year, but I'm confident in our ability to continue to deliver for our clients and build long-term value for our shareholders.  Now I'll turn it over to Jack to review our financial results. Thanks, Alex. I'll start and then on the last part of it, we'll see if we dig that out. But -- and if not, we'll follow up with you. But, first of all, on the capital formation side, I think that we expect a healthy mix between capital formation, from existing relationships that the AG Credit team currently has, and we're actively involved in those dialogues really across the strategies. We also expect that as we've talked about before, given the lack of overlap in the LP base of both TPG and AG, that there continues to be an exceptional opportunity for us to expand the breadth of capital formation to relationships that TPG has that AG is being introduced to now.  And I think you and I have talked about this before, but we're spending a lot of time even since the -- prior to the close, but certainly post close, we're spending a lot of time with our capital formation team focused on expanding the breadth of those relationships on the Credit side. And we feel like we're making good progress. So I'd expect that when we finish this year that will have a nice broadening and deepening of AG credit relationships that will contribute to that and also form the base for future growth in those strategies.  We're also in the market. I think I mentioned in my comments, we're also in the market with -- and in process of a number of vehicles for TPG AG Credit, that will be raising capital in the Wealth channel, and that will be a continued focus of ours in terms of expanding the access and reach in the Wealth channel and creating multiple vehicles for each of these strategies, so that the capital raising also becomes more of an ongoing capability as we expand that reach. And I think I mentioned, we have a number of channel partners that have already started that process with us.  So I'd expect to see deep and further penetration there as well, given the increase in the brand recognition with TPG AG together, as well as, frankly, the track record that they've created as a result of the investing activity. So I expect to see that as well.  And I think that, as I said, we're in the market with all of our Credit strategies. And so expect that the growth in fundraising will occur. It's hard for me to say exactly how it will break down between the three different pillars of our credit strategies, but the growth will occur across all three. Ken, your first part of your question broke up. We couldn't hear you. Can you start again? Do you want to -- Todd, do you want to comment on realizations on the private equity side, first? Yeah. Well, I think we've been actively engaged in dialogue with a number of channel partners. And I think, Mike, you know that prior to the AG acquisition, raising some capital through our Private Equity and Real Estate strategies through those channel partners was a routine part of what we were doing on essentially campaign by campaign. The relationship dialogue now is taking a completely sort of different step function. It's like a step function change because with the expansion of our strategies as a result of the AG acquisition, and the ability to offer more continuously offered vehicles, such as BDCs, et cetera, that -- and the pre-existing dialogue that AG had with a number of channel partners, we've come together now, and we've been having a series of really kind of strategic dialogue with our channel partners about a more holistic approach to how we're approaching that channel. And I've actually had several of those meetings myself over the course of the last month or so. And what I would say to you is that there is a very strong appetite from the Wealth channel partners in having a more holistic product offering from TPG. There's a strong desire in the channel. I mean you obviously know what the data looks like yourself in terms of the available capacity in the Wealth channel, wanting to allocate to various strategies. And we're seeing strong demand for having some level of diversification in brands that are driving products through the channel.  And so as a result of that, I would say that we're very encouraged by what we're hearing from those channel partners, and we're actively deploying into those opportunities. If you look at our resource here, our resource as a result of the combined two firms, more than doubled in terms of our team that's focused on the penetration of the channel product creation, product structuring, as well as essentially feet on the street and from a marketing and relationship management point of view. And so that's been a noticeable step function change for us.  So we have products that are up in the channel and will continue to be across our direct lending business for Twin Brook. We have products that are up on the channel for our Structured Credit business. And besides, obviously, some of our private equity strategies that were also going to offer through the channel. So it's now looking like a complete menu of product capabilities, I should have mentioned also including our real estate capability as well. So it's now looking like a complete menu.  And our brand is a very strong brand, and it's gaining more and more traction in the channel, as we continue to as we continue to put resources behind it. So we're feeling pretty good about what we expect to do in the Wealth channels over time. And I think it will -- and we've said before, I think over the course of the last two years, we've talked about it, our objective for strengthening our distribution base there and also having become a larger part of our sourcing of capital. And we're on a path to do that. Sure. Yeah, it's a good question because it's very much something that we're focused on and we've been focused on. Let me just say that -- just reiterate that the insurance opportunity, I think, is both sort of -- there's two categories of opportunity. One is we currently have a number of insurance companies that are clients of ours, across a range of our products. So think of the insurance sector is also a source of LP penetration, and that exists here to date on both sides of the firm, both across all of our strategies. And I think with the expansion of our general product capabilities, I think we are able to have a dialogue with insurance companies that's a bit more holistic, and we're already seeing the benefits of that and we have a dedicated team covering the insurance sector, as LPs with the embedded knowledge of what's important to insurance companies in terms of their asset selection process. So, that, I would say, is one part of it that continues to grow and continues to be a great opportunity for us, and it's also a global opportunity.  Secondly, on the strategic side, obviously, we've talked about this before with our expansion into -- across the range of asset classes. The opportunity to have a more strategic dialogue with a number of insurance companies is clearly there, it's front and center for us. And I would say that since the announcement of the acquisition of Angelo Gordon, that dialogue has picked up quite meaningfully. And so we're doing a lot of work on it. I would say we're evaluating opportunities. And of course, we'll be very selective and careful in terms of what we ultimately do so that we position ourselves in the most strategic way we can. And as far as the product lines, particularly on the Credit side, we feel we feel great about the mix of product capability that we have in AG. I mean one of the things that attracted us to Angelo Gordon, was that it was a multi-strategy platform. It wasn't a mono line that, for instance, was only doing direct lending. It was a multi-strategy platform. So it had a direct lending capability. It has a Credit Solutions capability, and it has a Structured Credit capability. And in particular, I would say one of the things that is very important in the process of managing assets on behalf of insurance companies is making sure that you have product structuring capabilities, whether it's creating rated note structures, risk tranching and asset sourcing capabilities outside of just pure essentially EBITDA risk, outside of purely the corporate side, you've got to also be able to reach and source product on the non-EBITDA side. So our Structured Credit business in terms of asset-based finance, specialty finance, securitized mortgage product, across the whole range of those products, we have a -- we have a business that's been built out over the last 15 years that has infrastructure, servicing capability and product breadth. So, now we'll never be done building those businesses. We'll continue to build those businesses and expand them as we're able to scale them with respect to more capital, but we feel pretty good about the tools that we have.  So that's how we feel we're positioned right now. James, I think you're on. Just to pick up on the question on -- in terms of credit quality and what's happening in the portfolio. I think that, as I mentioned or alluded to, performance has been across our Credit strategies has been very, very good. And just to give you some -- maybe a little bit more color on some data on it. If you look at our Direct Lending business through Twin Brook, here, by the way, our pipeline is up reasonably meaningfully this year based upon transaction activity that we're seeing. We're also seeing generally a quality uptrend, just in terms of the opportunities that we're seeing. But if you look at the performance of the business over the course of last year, we had no credit losses in the business. And the performance of the portfolio was generally reflective, I think, of what was happening overall within our Private Equity portfolios. Remember that Twin Brooks business is very sector focused. And so across things like Business Services and Health Care within their portfolio, they saw strong performance.  And so I think on the -- at least from -- at least in terms of our selection criteria, what we do, we obviously have a very a very selective process of how we're underwriting. We also are underwriting in that business with lower leverage on average, as a result of the lower middle market nature of it, as well as covenant protections across our portfolio, which obviously allows us to get back to the table and work with sponsors to the extent that we need to. But portfolio was very strong overall. And I would say the outlook in terms of the pipeline continues to be on an uptrend, in terms of quality generally.  In Credit Solutions, if you look across our business, I think I said in my comments that our performance was very strong, in excess of 300 basis point premium, over where the indices ended up. I think Jack alluded to the fact that there was a strong rally in Credit spreads at the end of the year. That obviously had a significant impact on the portfolio. And any -- and generally, what we've done is where we see a change in valuation like that and return to historical tight spreads, we've been generally net sellers of the public credit opportunity, as a result of that. So we've been -- we've been liquidating a number of positions across our Credit Solutions book. And we've essentially pivoted our focus from kind of public opportunities because of the tightness of the market, to really more private opportunities, more bespoke private opportunities, which are a combination of structuring private credit opportunities as well as rescue finance opportunities. And the opportunity set there in front of us is very, very substantial and very large. If you look at the structure of the market. There's over $1 trillion of single B-rated or CCC rated capital structures that are essentially coming due over the course of the next several years. If you look at the market right now, about almost half of the leveraged loan market has less than two times interest coverage, which is -- and that's probably more typically like 20% of the market, historically has less than two times interest coverage. So with those -- with that structural dynamic in force in the market right now, it's going to create a lot of very interesting private opportunities for us to execute on. And there, we're able to use we're able to use our sector knowledge and our industry knowledge, across both our Credit business as well as our Private Equity business, in order to underwrite those credits and value those companies. So we feel like that the dynamics in terms of the way that's setting up is very positive for us.  And then lastly, on the Structured Credit side, the biggest theme here is, what's going on with respect to the need for capital. And when you look at the community and regional bank stresses that are going on in the market and continuing to go on in the market, we think we're very early in terms of that dynamic playing out. It's kind of a second or third inning dynamic with respect to regional bank deleveraging, and we're going to continue to see that stress drive asset sales and credit risk transfer. And I think overall, we're also seeing an opportunity to upgrade the quality of the counterparties that we're working with, looking for that risk transfer. And on average, I would say non-EBITDA credit has not participated in the rally that corporate credit has participated in. So in terms of relative value, we see a lot of interesting opportunities there. And there have been a number of situations recently, for instance, we just purchased a portfolio, a $600 million portfolio of consumer secured loans from a community bank with really attractive return characteristics to it.  So, the portfolio is in great shape and the opportunity set is even better. So that -- hopefully, that gives you some guidance on how we're positioned. Thanks, everyone."

            "name": "Todd Sisitsky",
            "content": "Yeah. Let me -- I'll start on that. This is certainly an area we spend a lot of time focusing on as a partner group. It's important to our investors. It's important to our good fund management. And we spent the last few years really investing in our companies, and we have some very well-performing companies that I think should be in a good position to realize value in the year and years ahead. It is, I think, worth noting we've had some important successes in recent quarters. I think, we mentioned the sale of CAA in the second half of last year, which was a strong exit that was, again, to your point about duration. That was a 13-year partnership and we waited and really picked our spot.  We also had actually an important realization in recent weeks. We sold a sizable block of shares in Nextracker, which is a company went public in the first quarter of '23, is up about 130% from its IPO price. One more example of just how we really are able to pick our spots, particularly on the Private Equity side. Over the last two years, we launched seven IPOs in India and all the positions that we still hold are trading well above their IPO offer price. And of course, IPOs are leading indicators of liquidity. So some opportunities there.  So there have been important recent successes. But overall, to your -- the start of your question, we've been selective, and we've really been building value in the portfolio after a very big cycle of realizations in '21 and '22. But as far as the go forward, we're very focused on driving liquidity to the firm. And as the market recovers, we are actively managing the private equity, as a partner group in each business unit. And with -- with the growing momentum in the overall deal market and the strength of these portfolio companies, we do feel like there's going to be an increasing number of opportunities to drive liquidity this year."

            "content": "Thank you, John. As Gary mentioned earlier, I'll be discussing our results today on an actual basis, which includes two months of TPG Angelo Gordon from the acquisition close date of November 1, through December 31. In our earnings release, we've also provided pro forma financials for the fourth quarter and full year 2023, which assumed the transaction closed on January 1, 2023. We ended the year with $222 billion of total assets under management, up 64% year-over-year. This was driven by $75 billion of acquired AUM, $16 billion of capital raised and value creation of $7 billion, partially offset by $10 billion of realizations and $1 billion in outflows over the last 12 months. As John mentioned, we had a strong quarter for fundraising, due to the final closes across our capital and Rise funds, as well as the rolling first close of our growth fund. Fee earning AUM increased 76% year-over-year to $137 billion, and we had more than $51 billion of dry powder available to deploy, representing 38% of fee-earning AUM. We also had AUM subject to fee earning growth of $24 billion at the end of the year, of which $14 billion was not yet earning fees. This represents a significant embedded growth driver of potential management fee growth, as we deploy this capital, particularly across our credit vehicles. Fee-related revenue was $465 million in the quarter, up 45% sequentially and 51% year-over-year and $1.3 billion for the year, up 23% from 2022. Management fees totaled $396 million in the quarter and grew 42% sequentially, due in part to the inclusion of TPG AG in our results, as well as substantial catch-up fees related to the final closes for the capital and Rise Funds. Transaction fees increased 79% sequentially and 20% year-over-year to $55 million in Q4. A record level and totaled $108 million for the full year. Our fourth quarter transaction fees were elevated by the closing of several large transactions, where TPG was the sole or lead arranger for the debt financing. As Jon noted, over time, we expect to drive growth in transaction fee revenues, as we expand our broker-dealer capabilities to TPG AG. However, Q1 is often a seasonally light quarter for deal closings, as we saw last year. And we expect that to be the case again this year.  Fee-related earnings were $226 million for the fourth quarter, up 45% sequentially and 62% year-over-year. And $606 million for 2023, up 34% from 2022. Our FRE margin was 49% for the fourth quarter and 45% for the last 12 months, a 350 basis point improvement from 2022. On a pro forma basis, assuming the AG acquisition closed on January 1, our FRE margin would have been 47% for the fourth quarter and 40% for the full year. It's important to note that these pro forma margins were elevated by the significant catch-up fees and transaction revenues in the fourth quarter. As we've discussed previously, our normalized margin has blended down through the inclusion of TPG AG, and we now have a meaningful opportunity to drive profitable growth through our margin expansion. We expect our FRE margin to exceed 40% for the year in 2024, as we realize operating leverage and synergies from the integration and scaling of our business. While also investing in growth initiatives we've described. We will continue to maintain strong expense discipline and over the longer term, we expect our margin to scale back up to and exceed 45%. After-tax distributable earnings for the fourth quarter were $206 million or $0.51 per share of Class A common stock, including $19 million from realized performance allocations. Our realization activity last year reflected our bias in a volatile market to focus on building value in our relatively young portfolios, and we remained selective in our exit activity. That being said, as markets have begun to normalize, our pipeline of potential monetizations has increased. Assuming markets remain supportive, we expect realized performance allocations to increase in 2024.  In the fourth quarter, we also incurred $18 million of non-core expenses related to the closing of the Angelo Gordon acquisition, which is included in our realized investment income and other line item. While we will continue to incur ongoing integration costs, we expect this to normalize now the transaction is closed.  Turning to our non-GAAP balance sheet. We used a portion of our cash and revolver capacity to fund the closing of the AG transaction in the fourth quarter. We ended the year with $105 million of cash and cash equivalents, approximately $500 million drawn on a revolver and $450 million of other long-term debt. As I've mentioned previously, we upsized our revolver from $700 million to $1.2 billion last September and currently have approximately $700 million of undrawn capacity. Our balance sheet post closing remains conservative, with moderate leverage and ample liquidity.  Our net accrued performance balance at the end of the year was $891 million, compared to $692 million in the third quarter. This 29% increase was driven by $141 million of accrued carry attributable to TPG AG, at the acquisition date and the $77 million increase in the value of our investments, partially offset by $19 million in realized gains. While our operating model is FRE-centric, we have significant embedded performance-related earnings potential, and we expect our financial results will benefit from the eventual pickup in realizations. At the end of the year, our performance eligible AUM totaled $192 billion or 87% of our total AUM, of which $151 billion was performance fee generating. Our portfolio has continued to demonstrate resilience, through a period of high volatility, underpinned by our deep sector expertise and careful investment selection in assets with strong growth and durable margins. Our Private Equity portfolio, which includes our Capital, Growth and Impact platforms, appreciated approximately 4% in the quarter and 9% over the last 12 months. In aggregate, our portfolio companies grew revenue by more than 20% over the last 12 months. The operating environment is normalizing, and our portfolio continues to demonstrate strong cost management and stable margins.  TPG AG's credits appreciation of 4% in the quarter and 14% in 2023 on a pro forma basis, was driven by strong credit selection and a low annualized loss ratio across the portfolio. Our strategies also benefited from the broad credit market rally heading into the end of the year. In Real Estate, the performance of our portfolio reflects the broader challenges in the sector, resulting from higher rates. Although the fundamentals across our underlying core sectors and assets remain strong.  Looking forward, I'll reiterate the guidance that we provided at our Teach-In in November. We expect our total private equity and infrastructure capital raised in 2024 to grow compared to 2023, driven by the fundraises for growth and Rise Climate as well as the launch of our Climate Transition Infrastructure Strategy. Additionally, in 2024, we expect fundraising for TPG AG Credit to exceed $10 billion, more than doubling the capital raised by the platform in 2023 on a pro forma basis.  On credit deployment, as Jon indicated, we expect a significant increase in each of our core strategies this year, which will grow our base of fee earning AUM. Stepping back, we're excited about the progress we've made over the past two years, in executing against our strategic priorities. We've scaled and diversified our business, while maintaining a strong focus on delivering excellent returns for our clients. Looking forward, we're equally excited about our path ahead. We have great visibility into the next phase of our growth with multiple levers to expand our asset base and drive revenue growth and operating leverage. We're confident in our ability to continue delivering differentiated performance for our clients and long-term value for our shareholders.  Now I'll turn the call back to the operator to take your questions. And Alex, this is Jack. On your question about the $132 million of estimated annual fee opportunity from both AUM, not yet earning fees and subject fee step-up, that's weighted toward the AUM not yet earning fees, as you expect. Probably $100 million of that is in that bucket and $30 million or so is in the fee step-up category. And within the AUM not yet earning fees, the biggest components would be across AG's Credit and Real Estate business is probably half of that, call it, $50 million of the $100 million and the remainder kind of weighted toward TPG Growth and Real Estate platforms. And in the FAUM subject to step up, that $30 million, the biggest component of that would be in the Capital platform because you remember, we had the J-curve mitigant structure in some of our capital that steps up as we invest capital. And about $10 million is in the AG Real Estate business. Thanks, Craig, for the question. We think it's the right target for us to be articulating at this point. I think you mentioned some of the key drivers. The fourth quarter margins, as I mentioned in my comments, were elevated by the catch-up fees. They also benefited from above expected core fundraising but also strong transaction fees. So some of those will not reoccur in 2024. Think about the fundraising waves we're in the middle of, over a longer arc, right? We just completed the large flagship private equity fund raises. Those had some natural elevated catch-up fees towards the end of them. Now we're entering the market with some big new flagships like the new Private Equity fund in Climate, the Infrastructure Funding Climate, the new growth fund those will likely complete in 2025. And as you get toward the end of campaigns, you'll see some more catch-up fees again in '25 in connection with those funds. So when you -- and on your cost synergy point, we mentioned at the Analyst Day, that we had achieved $9 million of cost synergies. We've also said consistently that this transaction is much more about growth and diversification and investing and growing our platform over the years and not really about dropping cost synergies to the bottom line. We are finding additional cost synergies above the $9 million. Our intention is to reinvest those in long-term growth.  So when we take all that into account, we think the margins we're targeting for this year are appropriate. And longer term, we certainly will be scaling our businesses and generating operating leverage. And Brian, in terms of in terms of fundraising targets for the business, if that's what you're referring to, we did say publicly when the commitment was announced that we were targeting at least $10 billion, across our next Private Equity fund, TRC 2, combined with the Global South initiative. So those numbers do not include the Infrastructure business. That won't all be raised this year. It will be raised over this year and next year. And assume that those funds will be activated more toward the end of the year. Good question, Luke. If you separate that into kind of the legacy TPG businesses and the Capital Markets business, we're building here and then think about adding Capital Markets fees through the integration of AG, particularly on the Credit side. What we've said historically is we think of a normal run rate for that TPG Capital Markets business, at today's level to be around $100 million. So on a quarterly basis, $55 million is high, relative to that normal run rate.  Now that's going to be growing over time as we grow our businesses. And then you layer on top of that opportunities from AG, which were in the early innings of developing. So I would think of the AG contribution growing, during the course of the year this year. And then the TPG side, stepping down to a below normal level in Q1 because of the seasonally light number of deals closing in Q1. So the TPG side back loaded and the AG side also kind of feathering in, during the course of the year and growing during the course of the year.  So much like this year, where you saw our Capital Markets revenue line start low and grow toward the back of the year, I'd expect the same kind of pattern this year. Yeah, thanks. Yeah, good question. We -- I think what Apollo is doing is a decent kind of directional proxy for the opportunity set. I would say we're pretty early in kind of underwriting that opportunity for ourselves. So we're not ready to put a target number out there. But the longer-term FRE margin of 45%, I would say, only incorporates a piece of that opportunity. Thanks. Well, I would say, as I said a few minutes ago, most of that $132 million is associated with capital not yet deployed, not the natural step-up of capital already deployed on fees, the step-up structures -- funds or step-up structures.  So just thinking about your question, real time, that capital underlying the capital not yet deployed probably has just taken a kind of swag a three-year deployment pace to it on average across those funds. So if I had to take a guess, I'd say that would kind of feather in over about a three-year period. Thanks. General question on that in a second, but I just want to finish that last question that Brian asked, the 132. So I don't want to leave the impression that, that's like a onetime opportunity that comes in over a three-year period. As that capital is deployed, we're obviously raising a lot more credit capital, as we've talked about. So the $10 billion of credit capital plus that we expect to raise this year will all come in with no fees yet. And have whatever fee rate you want to assume across our Credit business, we've provided some detail there.  So that 132 of fee opportunity should be growing over time as we're realizing was embedded today. Thank you."

Currently, all callers have been placed in a listen-only mode and following the management's prepared remarks, the call will be opened up for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's call is being recorded. Please go to TPG's IR website to obtain the earnings materials. I will now turn the call over to Gary Stein, Head of Investor Relations at TPG. Thank you. You may begin.\nGary Stein: Great. Thanks Angela and welcome everyone. Joining me this morning are Jon Winkelried, Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Weingart, Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to remind you this call may include forward-looking statements that do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to TPG's earnings release and SEC filings for factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. TPG undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements except as required by law. Within our discussion and earnings release, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call that we believe are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to the nearest GAAP figures in TPG's earnings release, which is available on our website. Please note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any TPG fund. Looking briefly at our results for the third quarter, we reported GAAP net income attributable to TPG Inc. of $15 million and after tax attributable earnings of $196 million or $0.56 per share of Class A common stock. We declared a dividend of $0.48 per share of Class A common stock which will be paid on December 1st to holders of record as of November 17th. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jon.\nJon Winkelried: Thanks Gary. Good morning everyone. I want to start by acknowledging the recent tragic events and continued loss of life in the Middle East. We strongly condemn the terrorist attacks against Israel and are deeply saddened by the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the region. We're focused on supporting our colleagues and their families and our thoughts are with all who have been impacted by these terrific events. Turning to earnings, it's been a busy and productive quarter at TPG. We remain highly focused on our core business and are excited about the progress we've made across investing, capital formation, and organic initiatives. At the same time, we've made substantial progress on integrating Angelo Gordon into our firm. In my comments today I'll begin with a brief update on the AG transaction and then share some highlights from across our business. We closed our acquisition of Angelo Gordon on November 1st. Now, as one firm, we've strengthened our position as a scaled global alternative asset manager with six investment platforms, totaling $212 billion of AUM as of September 30. This strategic transaction marks an important and exciting milestone in TPG's evolution, providing us with several complementary business lines as well as additional levers to accelerate growth. We believe the addition of Angelo Gordon, together with our differentiated deal flow and strong investment track record, puts us in an advantaged position to capitalize on a number of long-term secular trends shaping the alternatives industry today including; one. a desire amongst the largest institutional LPs to allocate more capital to a shortness of scaled GPs who can partner with them across multiple asset classes. Two, in the important private wealth channel of growing demand for alternatives, especially in semi-liquid structures and yield-oriented asset classes like credit and real estate. And three, in the insurance sector, a strong interest in partnering with alternative managers that offer differentiated credit capabilities. Additionally, our new credit capabilities expand the set of solutions, we're able to offer the companies we invest in which furthers our ability to structure unique and creative partnerships. This is particularly valuable given our history of leveraging our sector themes and geographic depth across business units and strategies. Although the transaction process a few days ago, we're already beginning to see the benefits of our strategic combination. For example, in capital formation, we've made key introductions among our highly complementary client bases with only 10% overlap, across approximately 900 combined institutional LPs. A number of these clients are in active dialogue with us to broaden and deepen their commitments, given our expanded set of strategies across the risk return spectrum. Additionally our dialogue with insurance clients has fundamentally shifted. We are now able to have more targeted and deliberate discussions, given our multi-strategy credit capabilities. As discussed, we believe there is significant growth potential for us in the insurance space. On the deal front, we're seeing the positive impact, of combining our intellectual capital and distinctive sourcing engines. Our investment teams are already engaging with our other collaborating on shared ideas and identifying opportunities to potentially pursue sizable transactions together. We have also been working in a very rigorous and systematic way, to identify and prioritize joint growth opportunities. This entails launching new products that leverage the expertise and intellectual property of our combined platforms. We're evaluating compelling opportunities in areas that are natural extensions of our business. And we look forward to sharing more details with you overtime. Next Wednesday November 15th, we'll be hosting a key-gen with TPG sell-side analysts to dive into AG's business in detail. In connection with this, we will publicly share a comprehensive set of materials on our website. We look forward to introducing TPG AG's deep bench of talent and differentiated investment style, portfolio construction and growth drivers across its strategies. Now I'll spend some time discussing, how we've been driving growth and executing on our core business over the past quarter. We continue to make progress on our fundraises with $3.4 billion of capital raised in the third quarter, including successful closes in TPG Capital IX, Healthcare Partners II and Asia VIII. Each of our flagship campaigns remains on track to surpass the commitments of its predecessor. And we continue to have high-quality dialogue with clients, as we work towards final closings. In addition to fundraising, our investment teams have been busy across a number of dimensions, including pursuing attractive exits, driving performance in our portfolios and deploying our significant dry powder into new opportunities. While we continue to see strong top line growth and stable margins across our portfolio companies, value creation for the quarter was relatively flat, as solid performance was largely offset, by multiple compression, Jack will provide more details on both capital formation and value creation in his remarks. In terms of realization activity I'd like to highlight two, notable liquidity events. During the quarter, we closed the sale of Creative Artists Agency or CAA, one of the world's leading entertainment and sports agencies to Artemis, The Investment Company by Fran\u00e7ois Pinault. We first invested in CAA 13 years ago. And over the course of our ownership, EBITDA grew more than seven-fold. In 2021, we sold CAA from our communal fund into a single asset continuation vehicle, which enabled us to return capital to TPG Capital six investors, while continuing to partner with the company through its next leg of growth. We believe it was one of the largest vehicles of its type to be raised at the time and our recent exit, which generated over two times our money in two years is one of the most successful examples of a continuation of vehicle monetization to-date. In aggregate, both TPG Capital six investment and the continuation vehicle. CAA generated $2.4 billion of gains. It is a cornerstone transaction and our long and successful track record investing behind the secular tailwinds of media and content creation. We've built a unique ecosystem in the space and we believe there will be many opportunities to leverage our capabilities going forward. In our Asia business during the third quarter, we successfully completed the IPO of RR Campo a manufacturer and seller of branded electrical wires and cables in India. The IPO was very strongly received with high-quality interest from both domestic and international loan-only investors. The stock has performed well and is currently trading up 36% from the IPO price. We partially monetized our stake at attractive valuations highlighting the continued strength of TPG's franchise in India. Turning to deployment. Our sector specialization and long-term thematic investment approach have continued to generate differentiated opportunities for us. In particular, our deep industry expertise and proven ability to accelerate portfolio company growth have positioned TPG as a partner of choice for many corporates. This has led to bespoke and often proprietary carve-outs, as well as other structured partnerships over many years. Despite our general caution around the broader market today, we continue to find these types of compelling opportunities in spaces we know well. And these are investments we would pursue at any point in the cycle. In the third quarter, we deployed $5.5 billion of capital across our platforms a significant increase over the activity levels in the first two quarters of this year and our pipelines remain robust. In TPG Capital, we closed the acquisition of Nextech a leading provider of electronic medical records practice management payments and related solutions for specialty health care providers. Nextech follows our thematic focus on health care provider efficiency tools and patient payments, which is reinforced by our successful investment in WellSky. The deal team was combed by investors from both our health care and software and enterprise technology teams, which reflects the collaborative culture we've built. In TPG Capital Asia, we received shareholder approval last week to take InvoCare Private in Australia. TPG has spent many years tracking InvoCare, we only add scale vertically integrated provider of funeral services in the region. We strategically acquired an initial public stake in the company earlier this year as a key step towards the eventual take private of the company. Our Impact Platform, which invests under the Rise brand continues to be a significant differentiator for TPG and positions us well as we move into the next decade of investing. Our Rise, in Rise climate funds have been built to address changing societal needs while providing non-concessionary and competitive financial returns. As a testament to the franchise our team has built, the Rise platform was proud to be recognized recently our Fortune's Change the World list for the second consecutive year. This annual list acknowledges companies that have had a positive societal impact through activities that are part of their core business strategy. TPG continues to be the only global multi-strategy alternative asset manager to earn this distinction since the list inception. We have maintained a steady investment pace in our impact platform. I'll discuss some recent examples. Rise and Rise climate agreed to invest in Tata Technologies, one of India's largest automated and aerospace-focused engineering R&D service providers, aiming to decarbonize transportation. This investment represents our second partnership with the Tata family, the first being with Tata Motors passenger electric vehicle business. Given the strong relationship we've developed with Tata, we were able to structure this opportunity on a proprietary basis, ahead with a potential public offering. Our rise phones also agreed to acquire a majority stake in A-Gas, a global leader in the supply and life cycle management of refrigerant gases with first-class recovery reclamation and repurposing processes. This built on Rise thematic focus on supporting the circular economy and advancing the adoption of clean molecules to meet global decarbonization targets. Another particularly compelling area of investment opportunity for us today is real estate, where global markets have entered into a highly unusual period. Certain parts of the market are experiencing significant disruption, driven by rapid step function changes in interest rates and valuations, as well as fundamental underlying changes to sectors such as office and retail. From ours, this is creating distinctive opportunities to acquire assets that would not typically be available for sale. We believe our real estate platform is particularly well suited for this environment, as we raised nearly $7 billion for our current flagship opportunistic fund TREP for over a year ago. We intentionally moderated our investment pace in anticipation of more attractive opportunities and we are beginning to see them now. During the quarter, TREP completed the $1.5 billion transaction in partnership with Digital Realty Trust to capitalize a portfolio of high-quality data centers in Northern Virginia with more than one million square feet in total. We also recently announced a $1.5 billion tender offer to take Intervest Private, a leading Benelux-based logistics REIT. The team has spent a number of years building conviction around the compelling market fundamentals of industrial real estate in the region and developing a relationship with the company's management team, with stock trading down approximately 50% of its peak value. We leveraged our knowledge and expertise to approach Intervest about a take private, resulting in this sizable transaction. In addition to our existing opportunistic equity funds, we have launched our new real estate credit strategy, TRECO the combination of downward pressure on real estate values, reduced lending appetite, and elevated borrowing cost has created what we believe to be one of the most interesting investing environments we have seen in at least two decades. We believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this, given the broad reach of our global real estate and credit investment platform. Jack will provide an update on our fundraising for TRECO strategy in a few minutes. Together with TPG AG Real Estate, we now have a combined real estate platform totaling $36 billion of AUM, as of September 30 and we're well positioned to play offense for several reasons. We have combined dry powder of $15 billion. We invest in defensive sectors, where we have long-standing expertise and the ability to collaborate with other TPG platforms in areas such as content production and life sciences. With TPG AG, we have expanded our geographic footprint to include Asia. From our perspective, these markets are fragmented and particularly hard to enter from a standing start. And we believe the two decade-long focus of Angelo Gordon in markets like Tokyo and Seoul is incredibly valuable in advantageous. And we have added a net lease capability, which provides attractive growth opportunities to a hybrid for the financing and real estate markets. Before I wrap up, I also want to spend a few minutes on our credit business. As we'll discuss in more detail next week, we're entering the credit space with a diversified multi-strategy and scaled platform that's well equipped to capitalize on the significant tailwinds in this asset class. TPG AG's activity and performance over the last several quarters have reinforced our thesis in several ways. Let me share a few examples. Asset-backed lending and specialty finance strategies have become an increasingly important part of the private credit ecosystem. Current market volatility, especially as it relates to concerns around corporate earnings has accelerated demand for products that lend against cash generating stable assets. Additionally, the regional banking crisis earlier this year has further enhanced interest in the space. In 2021, TPG Angelo Gordon identified a significant opportunity and raised over $1 billion for our first time asset-backed lending fund. Since activation, the team has already deployed over half of the fund's capital into more than 20 transactions. We expect to substantially scale this strategy over time. TPG AG Credit Solutions, our corporate credit strategy is also taking advantage of the current market dislocation with its flexible mandate and the ability to pivot between public and private markets. The platform invested more than $750 million in the third quarter alone and our proprietary essential housing business originated financing projects with more than $2 billion of associated land and site development costs year-to-date. And finally, Twin Brook, our middle market direct lending platform has demonstrated its resilience, as a result of its sector-driven strategy focused on high-quality companies with strong covenant protections. Despite increased volatility, Twin Brook has no realized credit losses year-to-date and through the third quarter has deployed approximately $2 million of capital into more than 20 new companies and over 150 add-on investments to existing borrowers. I'll close out my remarks by highlighting some important firm events. A few weeks ago, we held our annual TPG Capital Investor Conference. We have 200 of our limited partners and attendants, together with nearly every professional on the TPG Capital team. We were able to highlight our strong momentum including the differentiated investments we've recently made in TPG Capital 9 and Healthcare Partners too that exemplify our distinct playbook and flywheel. Although this event is focused on TPG Capital, we have always had the leadership from all of our business units end. And this year we also included our Angela Gordon colleagues. We took the opportunity to showcase our talent, team and further connections between our LPs and the leaders across our firm. Coinciding with this, we also hosted our CEO conference for the first time since 2018, with over 100 TPG portfolio company CEOs and senior advisers participating. Of all the events we hold, I find the CEO conference to be one of the most powerful examples of our ecosystem in action and we deliberately schedule it alongside our investor conference so that our LPs have an opportunity to engage with our CEOs directly. Now I'll turn it over to Jack to review our financial results.\nJack Weingart: Thanks Jon. As a reminder, the results I'll be discussing reflect TPG on a standalone basis. They do not include Angela Gordon, since the transaction closed subsequent to the end of the third quarter. TPG had a record quarter for fee-related revenues, with FRR of $321 million, up 12% sequentially and 14% year-over-year. This was a result of strong growth in both management fees and transaction fees. Management fees totaled $279 million and grew 9% from the second quarter due to improved fundraising combined with an increase in catch-up fees. Transaction fees increased 83% sequentially to $31 million and continue to be driven primarily by our lead role in structuring and placing the debt financing in connection with new investments across our platforms. Our well-established debt capital markets business continues to be a strategic weapon providing us and our portfolio companies with differentiated access to capital which is particularly valuable in the current credit market environment. FRE was $156 million for the third quarter up 24% sequentially and 29% year-over-year. This significant growth was due to the FRR growth I just mentioned as well as continued strong expense management resulting in an FRE margin of 49% for the third quarter. This is more than a 560 basis point improvement from the year ago quarter. Our FRE margin for the last 12 months was 44%, which reflects the consistent progress we've been making towards the 45% FRE margin target we had set for the end of this year. While our FRE margin in the fourth quarter will blend down with the acquisition of Angelo Gordon, we believe this provides us with a meaningful margin expansion opportunity as we look to realize significant operating leverage from the combination and scaling of our businesses. After-tax distributable earnings for the third quarter were $196 million or $0.56 per share of Class A common stock. This includes $43 million in net realized performance allocations which were primarily attributable to the successful CAA realization that Jon discussed. Additionally, similar to the previous two quarters we incurred non-core expenses related to the acquisition of Angelo Gordon of $9 million for the third quarter, which is included in our realized investment income and other line item. Turning to our non-GAAP balance sheet. We had $647 million of cash and cash equivalents and $450 million of long-term debt at the end of the third quarter. In late September, we upsized our revolver from $700 million to $1.2 billion and extended the maturity of both the revolver and our term loan. As a result of the financial strength of our business we were able to maintain the attractive pricing on our facilities and further enhance our liquidity position to provide ourselves with ample financial flexibility. When we went public early last year we capitalized our balance sheet with excess cash in anticipation of a potential strategic acquisition. Last week, we closed the acquisition of AG and use this excess cash in addition to drawing down $470 million from our upsized revolver. Pro forma for the cash used at closing our non-GAAP cash and cash equivalents at September 30 would have been approximately $170 million. Our net accrued performance allocations at the end of the third quarter were $692 million compared to $760 million in the prior quarter. This decrease was driven by the realized gains I mentioned earlier as well as a $24 million decline in the value of our investments. Our aggregate portfolio depreciated less than 1% in the third quarter and appreciated 6% over the last 12 months. This performance reflects continued top-line growth and stable margins across our companies offset by multiple contraction. Specifically our private equity portfolio grew revenues by 26% over the last 12 months and our companies generally continue to effectively navigate inflationary pressures by passing through higher input costs. Within real estate higher cap rates were largely offset by our careful sector selection and favorable secular growth trends across our sub-sectors. Such as light industrials, student housing, data centers, purpose-built single-family rentals and life sciences, which collectively make up approximately 65% of our unrealized value. Across our portfolio, net operating income for the last 12 months grew 11% year-over-year. We finished the third quarter with $136 billion of assets under management, up 1% year-over-year. This was driven by $11 billion of capital raised and value creation of $3 billion, partially offset by $13 billion of realizations over the last 12 months. Fee-earning AUM was $79 million and AUM subject to fee earning growth totaled $11 billion at the end of Q3, of which $9 billion was not yet earning fees. Moving to fundraising. We raised $3.4 billion during the quarter and continue to make progress across our flagship fundraises. As Jon mentioned, we continue to expect each fund to be larger than its predecessor. For TPG Capital IX and Healthcare Partners II, we expect to hold final closes towards the end of this year. For Asia VIII, we expect a final close in the first half of next year. And for Rise III, we held our final close for the fund over the weekend, bringing total fund size to $2.7 billion. This is a 24% increase from Rise II and demonstrates the strong support from both our new and existing LPs. As we complete these campaigns, we're experiencing nice momentum as we launch our next flagship campaigns. First, we recently launched fundraising for our sixth growth fund and are in the process of holding a strong first close. Second, we are now approximately 65% invested and committed for our $7 billion Rise Climate Fund and we're actively working towards launching the next vintage. Finally, as we launch those next-generation flagship funds, we're making solid progress across the new business initiatives I've discussed previously. For our inaugural real estate credit strategy, after quarter end we received commitments of more than $750 million. We have closed on approximately $650 million of this capital and we expect to close on the remainder as we raise additional capital for the TrackO [ph] fund. In our Climate business, in addition to launching the next flagship private equity fund, we're continuing to make progress on the launch of our inaugural climate transition infrastructure fund. We're seeing strong interest from anchor LPs and expect to be in the market in the first half of 2024. Overall, we remain very active across all of our strategies and we're confident in our ability to continue delivering differentiated performance. Our growth engine is strong and with the addition of TPG Angelo Gordon and our combined capital formation capabilities, we believe we're in an excellent position to drive consistent, meaningful and diversified growth across our business. Now, I'll turn the call over to Angela to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAlex Blostein: Hi, good morning everybody. Thank you for the question. I was hoping we could start with a quick discussion on Angela Gordon and I understand, we're going to spend more time on it next week. So maybe this is a little bit of a preview. But as you look at some of the information you put out on the business, a couple of weeks ago, it looks like fundraising Angelo Gordon was fair to muted. I think it was only about $2 billion through the first half of 2023. So, help us maybe unpack, what were some of the sources of constraints in that business? Was that sort of deal related and uncertainty related? And how do you expect the fundraising to evolve from here, action of any sort of synergies with TPG? Thanks.\nJon Winkelried: Yes, Alex I can -- it's John. I can take a shot at that and Jack, could add in as well. But I think if you look at the fundraising momentum that Angela Gordon had prior to our transaction, they had substantial -- that made substantial progress across a number of the parts of their business. And when we -- I think it ultimately announced, our transaction, I think that as you would have expected, there was a bit of a pause that I think it was experienced really across the strategies from LPs, who naturally we wanted to understand exactly, what was happening in the transaction. On several fronts by the way, wanting to understand, how Angelo Gordon will be integrated into our firm, wanted to understand whether or not decision-making would be changing in any respect in terms of the investment process, wanting to understand whether or not there would be any changes in people, et cetera. So I think that -- not surprisingly, I think the number of the LPs took a bit of a step back and wanted to have an opportunity to understand the scope of what we were doing and also frankly to meet with us, and spend some time with both firms together to hear from us directly. So, we have spent a fair amount of time now going out together, even prior to the actual close of the transaction, meeting with LPs, and familiarizing them with TPG, how we were thinking of bringing the two firms together. A number of us spent some time at their annual LPAC meeting, which basically across all of their different strategies and had an opportunity to do a fireside chat in the front of the room. I did a fireside chat and firm in the room as well as individual one-off meetings for the question of the LPs. And this will be a continuing process. But I think that the reaction and response that we're getting from their LP base overall, I think now that we've had a chance to spend some time with them and we'll continue to do that. I think it's been very good. And I think that we've been clear about how Angelo Gordon, will be positioned inside of the broader organization. And it feels to me like we're getting back to sort of more business as usual, as we sort of -- unless we've now closed the transaction and we'll continue the engagement with the LP base together. So -- not surprising, I think in the context of a transaction that is somewhat transformational, for both organizations. And so I think we appreciate LP's desire to learn more to understand it. But I think we're very confident coming out of it that we'll be able to accelerate capital formation together.\nJack Weingart: Yes. I would only add to that, Jon that in addition to the temporary pause from their existing LPs as they wrap their minds around this and make sure they're comfortable with the with the combination of the stability the real longer-term opportunity here is expanding their LP base and introducing them to some of our larger LPs. And that's something that we've already been actively working on that takes a while to play out, but we're encouraged by the early engagement with some of our larger LPs to help expand their capital. So we would expect a reacceleration of their fundraising as we enter next year.\nAlex Blostein: Great. That's helpful. Thanks. And then my second question around TPG's fundraising. It's great to see you guys come through with the existing campaigns and getting closer to the end of that as you mentioned your -- I think are on track to launch Climate 2 for next year. And just given the fact that we've seen a more challenging environment for broader private market fund raising over the course of the year. How different do you think this strategy will be received by LP given that it is a little bit more nuanced and it is syncratic to you guys? And their ability to sort of upsize the size the fund relative to the processor is an strategy?\nJack Weingart: Yes. On the climate -- sorry look, I would take a step back on the fundraising mark overall and think about as we went public in early last year, we knew we had this kind of the big super cycle of our flagship funds coming for the next couple of years. As I talked about on the call, we're approaching the end of that. I think the work we've been doing in the meantime has been positioning ourselves for the next wave of growth as we enter next year and the year after. And I'd say, we feel good about the progress we've made both in terms of new business creation like the Climate Infrastructure Fund that you're referring to. And the Treco fund that we talked about, and the acquisition of Angelo Gordon. So now we've got a whole new growth curve ahead of us. On your question in particular Alex, I would think about the Climate private equity fund the next generation of our $7 billion fund and the Climate Infrastructure Fund together. And we'll obviously be updating you all as we make progress there. But I would say, the early engagement is very high. I think we're -- continue to be viewed to have a leading position in that market. And across those two funds I would expect substantial growth off of the size of the first private equity fund. And when you take all of what I talked about into account with Angelo Gordon's funds the growth in credit the launch of climate we expect fundraising activity to increase next year over this year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thanks. Good morning everyone. We wanted to focus on the growth capital business.\nJack Weingart: Good morning, Craig.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Good morning, Jack. So TPG has almost $9 billion of unrealized value across growth 1 5. So we're curious how are those portfolio companies performing against the higher rate backdrop? And if you have any fresh data points like revenue or EBITDA trends to date that would be helpful to.\nJack Weingart: Sure. I mean, I talked about the overall portfolio performance across our private equity portfolios in my comments Greg in growth the same dynamics apply still strong revenue growth kind of probably mid-teens in the growth portfolio strong EBIT -- stronger EBITDA growth. So we're actually seeing margin expansion in the growth portfolio. So the portfolio health is quite good. The broader growth equity market is very interesting and we continue to feel like we're very well positioned there. It was obviously the market that saw the biggest spike in activity towards the end of 2021 and kind of the most active part of the market. As you know from looking at our results, we were relatively patient in that environment. Now with the IPO market becoming more difficult, some of those companies needing to raise follow-on capital with our position as kind of a solution provider adding more than just capital. We're pretty well positioned to capitalize on that disruption in the market. And you see that in both our growth and TTAD funds. I mentioned that we accelerated the first close process and growth, because we're seeing a pickup in investment activity. So that happened after the end of the third quarter. So we'll be talking about it in the fourth quarter earnings call, our progress in starting to raise the next growth fund. But the reason we're accelerating it, is because of the new investment activity we're seeing. And likewise in TTAD, we're now over half deployed in the relatively new TTAD fund.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nKen Worthington: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. TPG generated meaningful carry and the continuation on the United Artists this quarter. And John, you mentioned that you see opportunities to leverage continuation funds as we look forward. So maybe first, are there more opportunities like United Artists in your portfolios? And is that something we can expect if the PE environment actually remains challenging? And then second, last quarter I think you mentioned TPG back continuation vehicles in India, Germany and the US. So are there different ways for TPG to participate in continuation funds, either by asset class or regions as we look forward?\nJon Winkelried: Yeah. Let me take a shot at it. The -- I think first of all the continuation vehicle market and the evolution of that within private equity, I would say continues to become a more and more important part of the toolkit that firms like TPG or other firms for that matter have. The -- clearly, I think you've seen an environment where exit activity, exit volume is lower. I think that for what it's worth, I think we would expect generally that trend to continue. I think that given what's going on in terms of volatility in the market valuations, we already talked about multiple compression and the -- just overall -- the overall kind of dynamics of the exit environment. I think you should expect that to continue to be less active. And in that context, I think there's still a tremendous amount of pressure within our industry to find ways of returning capital to LPs. And I think as you know LPs are somewhat constrained as a result of a number of factors but one of the clear factors is a slowdown and exit activity. So, I think that the continuation vehicle market has become I think better understood and more and more accepted in the market. I think that frankly going back several years ago, I think there was some level of hesitation on the part of LPs generally to understand what was going on with continuation vehicles and how that would affect their ability to both get capital out but also the dynamics of assets moving from one fund to new vehicles and things like that. And I think over time it's become a much better understood part of the market. So, in that respect, I think that we will strategically look at using continuation vehicles for our own portfolio where it makes sense. I would say that it's a I still expect it to be sort of the exception not the rule in terms of the level of activity in terms of exits. But I do think that there are -- there is a place for it in the market. And obviously CAA is a great example of the type of company where by virtue of our partnership with the management team for a very long time by virtue of having a view that there was a significant amount of growth still in front of the company. And having been held in a fund that had essentially timed out. And so the desire that we had to try to return some capital, but also continue to be able to benefit from the growth made it a perfect example of why one might use a continuation vehicle. So, we'll use -- I think we'll continue to be -- and by the way the success in the CAA vehicle I think gives us a tremendous amount of credibility with respect to the sources of capital in that part of the market. On the other -- on the flip side, obviously, the reason that we have stood up and are now fundraising for TGS, which is our GP solution strategy, is exactly the same dynamic, which is that we continue to see more and more sponsors looking to partner with capital sources that understand how to value companies can be can really provide evaluation in the process of the CD that LPs can rely on. And frankly, in some cases you have sponsors coming to TPG for GP solutions because they also know that we have deep sector expertise across a number of these different sectors. So, we view ourselves as being in an excellent position strategically in order to be a partner of choice in that market. And you mentioned a number of the deals we did, but there has been really no abatement in terms of the level of deal flow that we're seeing in that market. And so ultimately I think it's important that it's absolutely a strategy we believe can be scaled over time. And it -- among the markets in private equity that we deal in very few markets are undercapitalized. This is one of them in terms of the capabilities of the firms that are active in the space. So we would expect it to continue to be a very good opportunity to form capital around.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMichael Cyprys: Hey. Good morning. I wanted to ask on the real estate credit strategy checkout. I was just hoping you can update us on the build-out of the platform there where you're seeing some of the most compelling opportunities to put capital to work now in the real estate credit marketplace the types investments? And then, how are you thinking of building out this platform as you look out over the next three to five years, just in terms of how you're thinking about enhancing your origination capacity? Thank you.\nJon Winkelried: Mike thanks for the question. I think first of all, we're waiting with to leverage our origination capability that comes out of our public REIT. So that was obviously pre-existing. So we're already well seeded into the market in terms of flows with respect to some of the real estate credit opportunities. Check is really broader frankly in terms of the types of opportunities that we'll pursue. So over time, we'll continue to add to our origination capabilities. We feel like we're well connected to the sources of flow, if you look across both the banks in particular that are systemically under pressure looking to shed assets in certain cases. That's a clear opportunity for us in this market. If you look at financing solutions, that certain real estate players have in the market right now. It's a very disruptive market as I'm sure you're aware. And so, as a result of that, I think we'll be -- because of our deep relationships across the real estate market as a result of both our franchise building out of trip as well as Angelo Gordon's franchise in a number of different markets. I think we have deep credibility across the landscape as a financing provider that understands the market and understands the space. So to us, it really looks like a very interesting and scalable opportunity over time. Real estate financing, overall, right now is a pretty broken market. And so, I think as a result of that, we expect it by virtue of have an approval of liquidity to be able to do this. And given our expertise, we expect to be able to be a value-add solutions provider and understand the risks of what the market is currently looking like. There's also just a lot of dislocation and what you were thinking as public markets and publicly traded securities in the real estate world. So our expectation is that, we will be able to flex between public markets and private markets as a result of having a pool of capital. The team -- by the way the team at Angelo Gordon on the structured credit side, there's also seeing those types of opportunities as well. So more to come on this, but I think we'll scale the business in a way that's consistent with what we see the opportunity to be and both in terms of resources and footprint but we think it's a great opportunity.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Brown with KBW. Please go ahead.\nMichael Brown: Great. So as you know Jon, the addition of Angelo Gordon certainly gives you much broader diversification and capabilities to better service the insurance industry and we'll truly hear more about this next week. But I just wanted to maybe hear a little bit about, how you're approaching that channel, thinking about that playbook and maybe how long it would take you to meaningfully tap into the opportunity there? And what's the incremental investment that may be needed just to get you to where you want to be over time?\nJon Winkelried: Yes. I mean, it's a good question. I think you heard in my prepared remarks that the type of dialogue that we're experiencing right now has meaningfully shifted. And that is -- it's very tangible. Just to put it in perspective, prior to the Angela Gordon transaction, we had dialogue with a number of insurance companies that were LPs of ours, but really fundamentally only being able to serve them from a private equity and real estate perspective. We also had a number of insurance companies, particularly life and annuity players that have approached us about a more holistic relationship but -- and I wanted to understand what our plans were for credit as an asset class overall. And so we had a series of conversations that were hard to execute on. Post the Angelo Gordon transaction, we've had a very substantial I would say inflection in the type and quality of dialogue that we're having with a number of players in the industry. And those dialogue -- that dialogue has ranged from I guess what I would describe, I mean I put them in two categories. One would be general LP-type relationships and credit strategies participation in SMAs or permanent funds. The other would be a more strategic type of relationship similar to what you've seen other alternative asset managers execute in the market. And so, we currently have several dialogues going on that I would put in that category. Exactly how long it will take to advance the ball that. Hard to say, but I would say that it's a very high level of focus for us as a combined firm now. We have a team that we put together between TPG and AG that is sort of dedicated to focus on this. I think over time, naturally, we'll continue to attract some talent in the industry with respect to knowledge and understanding about effective asset management for life and annuity players, what you would think of as sort of insurance solutions type of expertise. So I think that we'll be adding some capability in that respect over time. So -- it's a very exciting opportunity for us. It's exciting area for us, now that we're together as one firm, because this is an area where I think we can play a very, very competitive role. And if you look by the way at Angelo Gordon's business across the credit spectrum, one of the things that was really attractive to us about AG was that it's a multi-strategy credit capability, a multi-strategy credit platform. So, a combination of credit solutions on the corporate side structured credit the asset-backed asset-related side and then Twin Brook, which is direct lending platform really incorporates a broad capability that is really required to fully service the insurance industry and the insurance needs. So we're very focused on it. We think we're well positioned now. And obviously we'll keep everybody informed as we continue to go down that road.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. Good -- almost afternoon.\nJon Winkelried: Good afternoon.\nBrian Bedell: Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But do you have one on the LP conference and then related of course to Rise climate and climate infrastructure. Just I guess in terms of the -- what you're hearing from the LPs in terms of demand for those two asset classes individually. So obviously, the demand is very good for energy transition. But how are they thinking about that for infrastructure? And then I guess what I'm getting at is what are they substituting if they've got limited capacity to invest what are they substituting either infrastructure or energy transition for?\nJon Winkelried: Look, I think, first of all, I think that the climate PE strategy and also transitional infrastructure is I would say a kind of a frontier in our markets that is very, very unique. First of all, I think, we -- having dedicated the resources that we've dedicated to the sector and the space now for the better part of the last five years and building this capability, I think, that we're in a small category with respect to the number of firms that are very credible in this space. And for us it's been a very deliberate strategic build because we do believe that over the course of the next as I mentioned in my remarks over the course of the next decade plus the amount of capital required to solve some of these climate-related issues is just absolutely enormous. And the number of credible solutions providers and partners that are in the market right now is actually quite limited. And we view ourselves in a very distinctive category as it relates to what we've built and our capability. I think what we're seeing from LPs is that are looking at this they're looking at this in a range of different ways but I think what we're seeing from LPs is they view this as a hard to navigate part of the market. And as a result of that because of our leadership in it the robustness of our dialogue with LPs in this area is really -- is frankly pretty extraordinary. And what we're finding from LPs is that they're looking at this depending -- be looking at this in a number of different ways. Some look at this as sort of a piece of their private equity strategy. Some are looking at this as sort of a part of some LPs have this innovation pool of capital and they're looking -- they're starting their allocation of capital from the innovation pool. And then ultimately, we'll sort of mainstream it into their private equity allocations. This is too important in area and too big an area for most large pools of capital now to ignore. And so as a result of that, we're seeing, as Jack had mentioned before, I mean we're seeing really strong engagement here, really strong engagement. I think Jack mentioned that we'll expect to raise more capital, as we move into climate to an infrastructure one that we'll expect to raise more capital than we did the first time. And everything that we're seeing from LP so far, I think suggest that that is in fact the case and we expect a pretty strong level of engagement from our LPs. On the infrastructure side, what I would say too is that \u2013 and I think Jack alluded to this, when he said that think of these things as sort of in some respects kind of joined at the hip. What we're seeing in the market is that as the climate \u2013 as climate technologies and the capital requirements continue to evolve in a fairly rapid way, we're seeing kind of a natural trend that you've seen over time, over the history of this business you've seen this as an example in assets like real estate, which starts with opportunistic and it moves down the cost of capital spectrum to things like cores plus or core. But we're seeing some of those trends in this market, where some of the capital requirements and therefore, the cost of capital required to fund these build-outs of different parts of the industry are quite large. And so we're seeing infrastructure capital move to it in a fairly aggressive way. But what we're finding is that the relationship between the private equity pool of capital and an infrastructure pool of capital provides a flexibility and puts us in a position to create solutions for good companies and different partners that's really differentiated because of our knowledge base across the sector generally. So I think that this is going to be one of the more interesting areas to watch. We're in a very differentiated position. And I expect that the capital allocated to the sector is going to continue to meaningfully increase.\nJack Weingart: Yes, Brian. I would only add just to amplify Jon's comments that the breadth of LPs interested in this area has expanded significantly. If you think about the last \u2013 the first Rise Climate fund we raised was two or three years ago. And certainly since the first Rise fund we raised seven \u2013 six, seven years ago, the awareness among our LP base of the investment opportunity, the capital needed in these areas has expanded significantly. So while it may be the case that any one LP is more capital constrained today than they were two or three years ago, I think as we embark upon this next wave of fundraising across climate generally, the number of LPs around the world who have identified this as an important investment area for them has increased significantly.\nOperator: The next question comes from Adam Beatty with UBS. Please go ahead.\nAdam Beatty: Thank you and good afternoon. I appreciate your staying on making time for us. I want to follow up on real estate. Thanks, Jack. On real estate maybe a little bit more on the equity side. I was intriguing what Jon said before about potential sort of multi-decade opportunity. So right now TPG is positioned in some of the more resilient real estate subsectors, certain areas of housing, light industrial life sciences. Just wondering whether you're thinking about deepening the involvement and investment in those areas or maybe seeing opportunities in some of the less favored real estate sectors like office or retail? And then, if you could maybe just a quick thumbnail, what Angelo Gordon brings in the areas of value-add and Triple Net. Thanks very much.\nJon Winkelried: Yeah. I think -- I would say that, we are very sector focused, as you know. And that's been sort of a core underpinning our strategy. And I would say sort of what's got us here, in terms of being very deliberate about, where we're investing capital and how we're investing it. And so with respect to your question on maybe do we look at some of the less favorite areas? I would say, in general, one of the things that's kind of marched our approach to investing on the equity side is that we have looked at different sectors overtime, done our work on them. And if we felt like the opportunity wasn't quite there yet either from a valuation perspective or a fundamentals perspective, sort of wait until that opportunity is upon us. And we did that actually by the way in sectors like for instance, hospitality. We have not really been involved much in hospitality until, we got through COVID and we saw an opportunity to actually make a couple of investments in that space. With respect to office and retail right now, I think we view the market as sort of sufficiently dislocated and efficiently uncertain, that I think in the near-term we probably don't see compelling enough opportunities there. But obviously we continue to watch it. But right now our office exposure, on the TPG side is I think 2% of our portfolio. So it's probably not an area that we're going to go anytime soon. I think the -- what's more interesting about the market right now is, sort of what I said in my prepared remarks which is that, we're seeing things that really kind of need to happen right now because of certain investors' desire and need for liquidity and capital. And as a result of that, it's creating a dynamic where we're seeing larger discrete actionable opportunities in core sectors that we know very, very well. And we still like fundamentally kind of the -- we still like the fundamentals in those sectors. So the Take-private that we're doing in Europe right now as an example, is about sort of 80% industrial, 20% office. They're exiting the office exposure that's within that portfolio. And they've been in the process of doing that. So it's really an industrial play. And it's a part of the market that we've been watching for a while. It's really the sort of industrial corridor between water dam and the ports down into Germany. And so, it's an area that we've watched for a while. Harder to enter, harder to get access to it, but this gave us basically an entry point that we thought was compelling. A similar situation for the data centers that we are engaged in with -- in Northern Virginia which is sort of the core data centers. Hard to enter the market without either having to pay too much or be able to do it with enough capital deployed. So this gave us the opportunity to do that. We're working on another industrial deal that we hopefully signed very soon that is in North America that we also think is sort of kind of core-to-core as it relates to industrial. So, we think these are great risk-reward opportunities now as a result of pricing. And they're just the general dislocation. So I think we'll continue to be focused on that. On the Angelo Gordon side, the Angelo Gordon business does a number of different things for us as a combined effort. One, as that I mentioned in my remarks, was geographical penetration that we haven't historically had. So the Asia business as an example, it's very hard to enter market. And Angelo Gordon has been in that market for sometime now, so kind of a compelling opportunity for us to be able to continue to grow that. And I think our footprint as a firm in Asia on the PE side and AG's footprint on the real estate side, I think provides an opportunity to potentially continue to scale that. We continue to build that. On the net lease side, I think net lease is a business that we actually looked at prior to the Angelo Gordon acquisition. And in this environment, given what's gone on with the regional banks and the lack of financing availability, net leasing in a lot of respects is a financing product for corporates that are looking to use assets in order to get cost-effective financing. So, we think this is actually a pretty good environment to try to build on what is the core of our net lease strategy in AG. So you'll hear more from us about it but that's our perspective.\nOperator: The next question comes from Luke Mason with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nLuke Mason: Yes. Thanks for taking my question guys, and appreciate as more detail next week but my question is on Gordon's FRE margin, which was 23% in H1. Just wondering how quickly you think that can scale up. I think you mentioned previously the mid to high-20s on longer time is running more than the FRE margin of enjoy going shouldn't be in the 40s like a TPG stand-alone? Thank you.\nJack Weingart: Yes. Good question. We will talk more about this next week. But one of the things we really liked about the Angel Gordon platform. John talked about the breadth of it and how important that is for things like the insurance market. But having the multi-strategy coverage of virtually every aspect of private credit was super important to us as we thought about the right platform to grow from. Now, it's also expensive to support all that, to build an operating platform to support each of those businesses and they have fully built out scalable operating platforms to support each of those businesses. So now, as we come together as a combined firm, find additional synergies and ability to operate better together and scale their businesses, we absolutely expect that we will get their margin. Our combined -- really what we're focused on now is our combined margin. And getting -- beginning the same margin expansion opportunity that we saw for TPG on a stand-alone basis we now see for the combined business. And I think your comments over time that their credit platform, if it were a stand-alone company and scale should get into the 40s is absolutely correct.\nOperator: This concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I would now like to turn the call back over to Gary Stein for any additional or closing remarks.\nGary Stein: Great. Thanks Angela, and thanks everyone for joining us today for taking on such a busy day, appreciate it. And if you have any follow-up questions please feel free to circle back to us. Otherwise we'll look forward to speaking to you again next quarter. Thank you.\nJack Weingart: Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today's TPG Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call and webcast.

            "content": "Thanks Gary. Good morning everyone. I want to start by acknowledging the recent tragic events and continued loss of life in the Middle East. We strongly condemn the terrorist attacks against Israel and are deeply saddened by the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the region. We're focused on supporting our colleagues and their families and our thoughts are with all who have been impacted by these terrific events. Turning to earnings, it's been a busy and productive quarter at TPG. We remain highly focused on our core business and are excited about the progress we've made across investing, capital formation, and organic initiatives. At the same time, we've made substantial progress on integrating Angelo Gordon into our firm. In my comments today I'll begin with a brief update on the AG transaction and then share some highlights from across our business. We closed our acquisition of Angelo Gordon on November 1st. Now, as one firm, we've strengthened our position as a scaled global alternative asset manager with six investment platforms, totaling $212 billion of AUM as of September 30. This strategic transaction marks an important and exciting milestone in TPG's evolution, providing us with several complementary business lines as well as additional levers to accelerate growth. We believe the addition of Angelo Gordon, together with our differentiated deal flow and strong investment track record, puts us in an advantaged position to capitalize on a number of long-term secular trends shaping the alternatives industry today including; one. a desire amongst the largest institutional LPs to allocate more capital to a shortness of scaled GPs who can partner with them across multiple asset classes. Two, in the important private wealth channel of growing demand for alternatives, especially in semi-liquid structures and yield-oriented asset classes like credit and real estate. And three, in the insurance sector, a strong interest in partnering with alternative managers that offer differentiated credit capabilities. Additionally, our new credit capabilities expand the set of solutions, we're able to offer the companies we invest in which furthers our ability to structure unique and creative partnerships. This is particularly valuable given our history of leveraging our sector themes and geographic depth across business units and strategies. Although the transaction process a few days ago, we're already beginning to see the benefits of our strategic combination. For example, in capital formation, we've made key introductions among our highly complementary client bases with only 10% overlap, across approximately 900 combined institutional LPs. A number of these clients are in active dialogue with us to broaden and deepen their commitments, given our expanded set of strategies across the risk return spectrum. Additionally our dialogue with insurance clients has fundamentally shifted. We are now able to have more targeted and deliberate discussions, given our multi-strategy credit capabilities. As discussed, we believe there is significant growth potential for us in the insurance space. On the deal front, we're seeing the positive impact, of combining our intellectual capital and distinctive sourcing engines. Our investment teams are already engaging with our other collaborating on shared ideas and identifying opportunities to potentially pursue sizable transactions together. We have also been working in a very rigorous and systematic way, to identify and prioritize joint growth opportunities. This entails launching new products that leverage the expertise and intellectual property of our combined platforms. We're evaluating compelling opportunities in areas that are natural extensions of our business. And we look forward to sharing more details with you overtime. Next Wednesday November 15th, we'll be hosting a key-gen with TPG sell-side analysts to dive into AG's business in detail. In connection with this, we will publicly share a comprehensive set of materials on our website. We look forward to introducing TPG AG's deep bench of talent and differentiated investment style, portfolio construction and growth drivers across its strategies. Now I'll spend some time discussing, how we've been driving growth and executing on our core business over the past quarter. We continue to make progress on our fundraises with $3.4 billion of capital raised in the third quarter, including successful closes in TPG Capital IX, Healthcare Partners II and Asia VIII. Each of our flagship campaigns remains on track to surpass the commitments of its predecessor. And we continue to have high-quality dialogue with clients, as we work towards final closings. In addition to fundraising, our investment teams have been busy across a number of dimensions, including pursuing attractive exits, driving performance in our portfolios and deploying our significant dry powder into new opportunities. While we continue to see strong top line growth and stable margins across our portfolio companies, value creation for the quarter was relatively flat, as solid performance was largely offset, by multiple compression, Jack will provide more details on both capital formation and value creation in his remarks. In terms of realization activity I'd like to highlight two, notable liquidity events. During the quarter, we closed the sale of Creative Artists Agency or CAA, one of the world's leading entertainment and sports agencies to Artemis, The Investment Company by Franc\u0327ois Pinault. We first invested in CAA 13 years ago. And over the course of our ownership, EBITDA grew more than seven-fold. In 2021, we sold CAA from our communal fund into a single asset continuation vehicle, which enabled us to return capital to TPG Capital six investors, while continuing to partner with the company through its next leg of growth. We believe it was one of the largest vehicles of its type to be raised at the time and our recent exit, which generated over two times our money in two years is one of the most successful examples of a continuation of vehicle monetization to-date. In aggregate, both TPG Capital six investment and the continuation vehicle. CAA generated $2.4 billion of gains. It is a cornerstone transaction and our long and successful track record investing behind the secular tailwinds of media and content creation. We've built a unique ecosystem in the space and we believe there will be many opportunities to leverage our capabilities going forward. In our Asia business during the third quarter, we successfully completed the IPO of RR Campo a manufacturer and seller of branded electrical wires and cables in India. The IPO was very strongly received with high-quality interest from both domestic and international loan-only investors. The stock has performed well and is currently trading up 36% from the IPO price. We partially monetized our stake at attractive valuations highlighting the continued strength of TPG's franchise in India. Turning to deployment. Our sector specialization and long-term thematic investment approach have continued to generate differentiated opportunities for us. In particular, our deep industry expertise and proven ability to accelerate portfolio company growth have positioned TPG as a partner of choice for many corporates. This has led to bespoke and often proprietary carve-outs, as well as other structured partnerships over many years. Despite our general caution around the broader market today, we continue to find these types of compelling opportunities in spaces we know well. And these are investments we would pursue at any point in the cycle. In the third quarter, we deployed $5.5 billion of capital across our platforms a significant increase over the activity levels in the first two quarters of this year and our pipelines remain robust. In TPG Capital, we closed the acquisition of Nextech a leading provider of electronic medical records practice management payments and related solutions for specialty health care providers. Nextech follows our thematic focus on health care provider efficiency tools and patient payments, which is reinforced by our successful investment in WellSky. The deal team was combed by investors from both our health care and software and enterprise technology teams, which reflects the collaborative culture we've built. In TPG Capital Asia, we received shareholder approval last week to take InvoCare Private in Australia. TPG has spent many years tracking InvoCare, we only add scale vertically integrated provider of funeral services in the region. We strategically acquired an initial public stake in the company earlier this year as a key step towards the eventual take private of the company. Our Impact Platform, which invests under the Rise brand continues to be a significant differentiator for TPG and positions us well as we move into the next decade of investing. Our Rise, in Rise climate funds have been built to address changing societal needs while providing non-concessionary and competitive financial returns. As a testament to the franchise our team has built, the Rise platform was proud to be recognized recently our Fortune's Change the World list for the second consecutive year. This annual list acknowledges companies that have had a positive societal impact through activities that are part of their core business strategy. TPG continues to be the only global multi-strategy alternative asset manager to earn this distinction since the list inception. We have maintained a steady investment pace in our impact platform. I'll discuss some recent examples. Rise and Rise climate agreed to invest in Tata Technologies, one of India's largest automated and aerospace-focused engineering R&D service providers, aiming to decarbonize transportation. This investment represents our second partnership with the Tata family, the first being with Tata Motors passenger electric vehicle business. Given the strong relationship we've developed with Tata, we were able to structure this opportunity on a proprietary basis, ahead with a potential public offering. Our rise phones also agreed to acquire a majority stake in A-Gas, a global leader in the supply and life cycle management of refrigerant gases with first-class recovery reclamation and repurposing processes. This built on Rise thematic focus on supporting the circular economy and advancing the adoption of clean molecules to meet global decarbonization targets. Another particularly compelling area of investment opportunity for us today is real estate, where global markets have entered into a highly unusual period. Certain parts of the market are experiencing significant disruption, driven by rapid step function changes in interest rates and valuations, as well as fundamental underlying changes to sectors such as office and retail. From ours, this is creating distinctive opportunities to acquire assets that would not typically be available for sale. We believe our real estate platform is particularly well suited for this environment, as we raised nearly $7 billion for our current flagship opportunistic fund TREP for over a year ago. We intentionally moderated our investment pace in anticipation of more attractive opportunities and we are beginning to see them now. During the quarter, TREP completed the $1.5 billion transaction in partnership with Digital Realty Trust to capitalize a portfolio of high-quality data centers in Northern Virginia with more than one million square feet in total. We also recently announced a $1.5 billion tender offer to take Intervest Private, a leading Benelux-based logistics REIT. The team has spent a number of years building conviction around the compelling market fundamentals of industrial real estate in the region and developing a relationship with the company's management team, with stock trading down approximately 50% of its peak value. We leveraged our knowledge and expertise to approach Intervest about a take private, resulting in this sizable transaction. In addition to our existing opportunistic equity funds, we have launched our new real estate credit strategy, TRECO the combination of downward pressure on real estate values, reduced lending appetite, and elevated borrowing cost has created what we believe to be one of the most interesting investing environments we have seen in at least two decades. We believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this, given the broad reach of our global real estate and credit investment platform. Jack will provide an update on our fundraising for TRECO strategy in a few minutes. Together with TPG AG Real Estate, we now have a combined real estate platform totaling $36 billion of AUM, as of September 30 and we're well positioned to play offense for several reasons. We have combined dry powder of $15 billion. We invest in defensive sectors, where we have long-standing expertise and the ability to collaborate with other TPG platforms in areas such as content production and life sciences. With TPG AG, we have expanded our geographic footprint to include Asia. From our perspective, these markets are fragmented and particularly hard to enter from a standing start. And we believe the two decade-long focus of Angelo Gordon in markets like Tokyo and Seoul is incredibly valuable in advantageous. And we have added a net lease capability, which provides attractive growth opportunities to a hybrid for the financing and real estate markets. Before I wrap up, I also want to spend a few minutes on our credit business. As we'll discuss in more detail next week, we're entering the credit space with a diversified multi-strategy and scaled platform that's well equipped to capitalize on the significant tailwinds in this asset class. TPG AG's activity and performance over the last several quarters have reinforced our thesis in several ways. Let me share a few examples. Asset-backed lending and specialty finance strategies have become an increasingly important part of the private credit ecosystem. Current market volatility, especially as it relates to concerns around corporate earnings has accelerated demand for products that lend against cash generating stable assets. Additionally, the regional banking crisis earlier this year has further enhanced interest in the space. In 2021, TPG Angelo Gordon identified a significant opportunity and raised over $1 billion for our first time asset-backed lending fund. Since activation, the team has already deployed over half of the fund's capital into more than 20 transactions. We expect to substantially scale this strategy over time. TPG AG Credit Solutions, our corporate credit strategy is also taking advantage of the current market dislocation with its flexible mandate and the ability to pivot between public and private markets. The platform invested more than $750 million in the third quarter alone and our proprietary essential housing business originated financing projects with more than $2 billion of associated land and site development costs year-to-date. And finally, Twin Brook, our middle market direct lending platform has demonstrated its resilience, as a result of its sector-driven strategy focused on high-quality companies with strong covenant protections. Despite increased volatility, Twin Brook has no realized credit losses year-to-date and through the third quarter has deployed approximately $2 million of capital into more than 20 new companies and over 150 add-on investments to existing borrowers. I'll close out my remarks by highlighting some important firm events. A few weeks ago, we held our annual TPG Capital Investor Conference. We have 200 of our limited partners and attendants, together with nearly every professional on the TPG Capital team. We were able to highlight our strong momentum including the differentiated investments we've recently made in TPG Capital 9 and Healthcare Partners too that exemplify our distinct playbook and flywheel. Although this event is focused on TPG Capital, we have always had the leadership from all of our business units end. And this year we also included our Angela Gordon colleagues. We took the opportunity to showcase our talent, team and further connections between our LPs and the leaders across our firm. Coinciding with this, we also hosted our CEO conference for the first time since 2018, with over 100 TPG portfolio company CEOs and senior advisers participating. Of all the events we hold, I find the CEO conference to be one of the most powerful examples of our ecosystem in action and we deliberately schedule it alongside our investor conference so that our LPs have an opportunity to engage with our CEOs directly. Now I'll turn it over to Jack to review our financial results. Yes, Alex I can -- it's John. I can take a shot at that and Jack, could add in as well. But I think if you look at the fundraising momentum that Angela Gordon had prior to our transaction, they had substantial -- that made substantial progress across a number of the parts of their business. And when we -- I think it ultimately announced, our transaction, I think that as you would have expected, there was a bit of a pause that I think it was experienced really across the strategies from LPs, who naturally we wanted to understand exactly, what was happening in the transaction. On several fronts by the way, wanting to understand, how Angelo Gordon will be integrated into our firm, wanted to understand whether or not decision-making would be changing in any respect in terms of the investment process, wanting to understand whether or not there would be any changes in people, et cetera. So I think that -- not surprisingly, I think the number of the LPs took a bit of a step back and wanted to have an opportunity to understand the scope of what we were doing and also frankly to meet with us, and spend some time with both firms together to hear from us directly. So, we have spent a fair amount of time now going out together, even prior to the actual close of the transaction, meeting with LPs, and familiarizing them with TPG, how we were thinking of bringing the two firms together. A number of us spent some time at their annual LPAC meeting, which basically across all of their different strategies and had an opportunity to do a fireside chat in the front of the room. I did a fireside chat and firm in the room as well as individual one-off meetings for the question of the LPs. And this will be a continuing process. But I think that the reaction and response that we're getting from their LP base overall, I think now that we've had a chance to spend some time with them and we'll continue to do that. I think it's been very good. And I think that we've been clear about how Angelo Gordon, will be positioned inside of the broader organization. And it feels to me like we're getting back to sort of more business as usual, as we sort of -- unless we've now closed the transaction and we'll continue the engagement with the LP base together. So -- not surprising, I think in the context of a transaction that is somewhat transformational, for both organizations. And so I think we appreciate LP's desire to learn more to understand it. But I think we're very confident coming out of it that we'll be able to accelerate capital formation together. Yeah. Let me take a shot at it. The -- I think first of all the continuation vehicle market and the evolution of that within private equity, I would say continues to become a more and more important part of the toolkit that firms like TPG or other firms for that matter have. The -- clearly, I think you've seen an environment where exit activity, exit volume is lower. I think that for what it's worth, I think we would expect generally that trend to continue. I think that given what's going on in terms of volatility in the market valuations, we already talked about multiple compression and the -- just overall -- the overall kind of dynamics of the exit environment. I think you should expect that to continue to be less active. And in that context, I think there's still a tremendous amount of pressure within our industry to find ways of returning capital to LPs. And I think as you know LPs are somewhat constrained as a result of a number of factors but one of the clear factors is a slowdown and exit activity. So, I think that the continuation vehicle market has become I think better understood and more and more accepted in the market. I think that frankly going back several years ago, I think there was some level of hesitation on the part of LPs generally to understand what was going on with continuation vehicles and how that would affect their ability to both get capital out but also the dynamics of assets moving from one fund to new vehicles and things like that. And I think over time it's become a much better understood part of the market. So, in that respect, I think that we will strategically look at using continuation vehicles for our own portfolio where it makes sense. I would say that it's a I still expect it to be sort of the exception not the rule in terms of the level of activity in terms of exits. But I do think that there are -- there is a place for it in the market. And obviously CAA is a great example of the type of company where by virtue of our partnership with the management team for a very long time by virtue of having a view that there was a significant amount of growth still in front of the company. And having been held in a fund that had essentially timed out. And so the desire that we had to try to return some capital, but also continue to be able to benefit from the growth made it a perfect example of why one might use a continuation vehicle. So, we'll use -- I think we'll continue to be -- and by the way the success in the CAA vehicle I think gives us a tremendous amount of credibility with respect to the sources of capital in that part of the market. On the other -- on the flip side, obviously, the reason that we have stood up and are now fundraising for TGS, which is our GP solution strategy, is exactly the same dynamic, which is that we continue to see more and more sponsors looking to partner with capital sources that understand how to value companies can be can really provide evaluation in the process of the CD that LPs can rely on. And frankly, in some cases you have sponsors coming to TPG for GP solutions because they also know that we have deep sector expertise across a number of these different sectors. So, we view ourselves as being in an excellent position strategically in order to be a partner of choice in that market. And you mentioned a number of the deals we did, but there has been really no abatement in terms of the level of deal flow that we're seeing in that market. And so ultimately I think it's important that it's absolutely a strategy we believe can be scaled over time. And it -- among the markets in private equity that we deal in very few markets are undercapitalized. This is one of them in terms of the capabilities of the firms that are active in the space. So we would expect it to continue to be a very good opportunity to form capital around. Mike thanks for the question. I think first of all, we're waiting with to leverage our origination capability that comes out of our public REIT. So that was obviously pre-existing. So we're already well seeded into the market in terms of flows with respect to some of the real estate credit opportunities. Check is really broader frankly in terms of the types of opportunities that we'll pursue. So over time, we'll continue to add to our origination capabilities. We feel like we're well connected to the sources of flow, if you look across both the banks in particular that are systemically under pressure looking to shed assets in certain cases. That's a clear opportunity for us in this market. If you look at financing solutions, that certain real estate players have in the market right now. It's a very disruptive market as I'm sure you're aware. And so, as a result of that, I think we'll be -- because of our deep relationships across the real estate market as a result of both our franchise building out of trip as well as Angelo Gordon's franchise in a number of different markets. I think we have deep credibility across the landscape as a financing provider that understands the market and understands the space. So to us, it really looks like a very interesting and scalable opportunity over time. Real estate financing, overall, right now is a pretty broken market. And so, I think as a result of that, we expect it by virtue of have an approval of liquidity to be able to do this. And given our expertise, we expect to be able to be a value-add solutions provider and understand the risks of what the market is currently looking like. There's also just a lot of dislocation and what you were thinking as public markets and publicly traded securities in the real estate world. So our expectation is that, we will be able to flex between public markets and private markets as a result of having a pool of capital. The team -- by the way the team at Angelo Gordon on the structured credit side, there's also seeing those types of opportunities as well. So more to come on this, but I think we'll scale the business in a way that's consistent with what we see the opportunity to be and both in terms of resources and footprint but we think it's a great opportunity. Yes. I mean, it's a good question. I think you heard in my prepared remarks that the type of dialogue that we're experiencing right now has meaningfully shifted. And that is -- it's very tangible. Just to put it in perspective, prior to the Angela Gordon transaction, we had dialogue with a number of insurance companies that were LPs of ours, but really fundamentally only being able to serve them from a private equity and real estate perspective. We also had a number of insurance companies, particularly life and annuity players that have approached us about a more holistic relationship but -- and I wanted to understand what our plans were for credit as an asset class overall. And so we had a series of conversations that were hard to execute on. Post the Angelo Gordon transaction, we've had a very substantial I would say inflection in the type and quality of dialogue that we're having with a number of players in the industry. And those dialogue -- that dialogue has ranged from I guess what I would describe, I mean I put them in two categories. One would be general LP-type relationships and credit strategies participation in SMAs or permanent funds. The other would be a more strategic type of relationship similar to what you've seen other alternative asset managers execute in the market. And so, we currently have several dialogues going on that I would put in that category. Exactly how long it will take to advance the ball that. Hard to say, but I would say that it's a very high level of focus for us as a combined firm now. We have a team that we put together between TPG and AG that is sort of dedicated to focus on this. I think over time, naturally, we'll continue to attract some talent in the industry with respect to knowledge and understanding about effective asset management for life and annuity players, what you would think of as sort of insurance solutions type of expertise. So I think that we'll be adding some capability in that respect over time. So -- it's a very exciting opportunity for us. It's exciting area for us, now that we're together as one firm, because this is an area where I think we can play a very, very competitive role. And if you look by the way at Angelo Gordon's business across the credit spectrum, one of the things that was really attractive to us about AG was that it's a multi-strategy credit capability, a multi-strategy credit platform. So, a combination of credit solutions on the corporate side structured credit the asset-backed asset-related side and then Twin Brook, which is direct lending platform really incorporates a broad capability that is really required to fully service the insurance industry and the insurance needs. So we're very focused on it. We think we're well positioned now. And obviously we'll keep everybody informed as we continue to go down that road. Good afternoon. Look, I think, first of all, I think that the climate PE strategy and also transitional infrastructure is I would say a kind of a frontier in our markets that is very, very unique. First of all, I think, we -- having dedicated the resources that we've dedicated to the sector and the space now for the better part of the last five years and building this capability, I think, that we're in a small category with respect to the number of firms that are very credible in this space. And for us it's been a very deliberate strategic build because we do believe that over the course of the next as I mentioned in my remarks over the course of the next decade plus the amount of capital required to solve some of these climate-related issues is just absolutely enormous. And the number of credible solutions providers and partners that are in the market right now is actually quite limited. And we view ourselves in a very distinctive category as it relates to what we've built and our capability. I think what we're seeing from LPs is that are looking at this they're looking at this in a range of different ways but I think what we're seeing from LPs is they view this as a hard to navigate part of the market. And as a result of that because of our leadership in it the robustness of our dialogue with LPs in this area is really -- is frankly pretty extraordinary. And what we're finding from LPs is that they're looking at this depending -- be looking at this in a number of different ways. Some look at this as sort of a piece of their private equity strategy. Some are looking at this as sort of a part of some LPs have this innovation pool of capital and they're looking -- they're starting their allocation of capital from the innovation pool. And then ultimately, we'll sort of mainstream it into their private equity allocations. This is too important in area and too big an area for most large pools of capital now to ignore. And so as a result of that, we're seeing, as Jack had mentioned before, I mean we're seeing really strong engagement here, really strong engagement. I think Jack mentioned that we'll expect to raise more capital, as we move into climate to an infrastructure one that we'll expect to raise more capital than we did the first time. And everything that we're seeing from LP so far, I think suggest that that is in fact the case and we expect a pretty strong level of engagement from our LPs. On the infrastructure side, what I would say too is that \u2013 and I think Jack alluded to this, when he said that think of these things as sort of in some respects kind of joined at the hip. What we're seeing in the market is that as the climate \u2013 as climate technologies and the capital requirements continue to evolve in a fairly rapid way, we're seeing kind of a natural trend that you've seen over time, over the history of this business you've seen this as an example in assets like real estate, which starts with opportunistic and it moves down the cost of capital spectrum to things like cores plus or core. But we're seeing some of those trends in this market, where some of the capital requirements and therefore, the cost of capital required to fund these build-outs of different parts of the industry are quite large. And so we're seeing infrastructure capital move to it in a fairly aggressive way. But what we're finding is that the relationship between the private equity pool of capital and an infrastructure pool of capital provides a flexibility and puts us in a position to create solutions for good companies and different partners that's really differentiated because of our knowledge base across the sector generally. So I think that this is going to be one of the more interesting areas to watch. We're in a very differentiated position. And I expect that the capital allocated to the sector is going to continue to meaningfully increase. Yeah. I think -- I would say that, we are very sector focused, as you know. And that's been sort of a core underpinning our strategy. And I would say sort of what's got us here, in terms of being very deliberate about, where we're investing capital and how we're investing it. And so with respect to your question on maybe do we look at some of the less favorite areas? I would say, in general, one of the things that's kind of marched our approach to investing on the equity side is that we have looked at different sectors overtime, done our work on them. And if we felt like the opportunity wasn't quite there yet either from a valuation perspective or a fundamentals perspective, sort of wait until that opportunity is upon us. And we did that actually by the way in sectors like for instance, hospitality. We have not really been involved much in hospitality until, we got through COVID and we saw an opportunity to actually make a couple of investments in that space. With respect to office and retail right now, I think we view the market as sort of sufficiently dislocated and efficiently uncertain, that I think in the near-term we probably don't see compelling enough opportunities there. But obviously we continue to watch it. But right now our office exposure, on the TPG side is I think 2% of our portfolio. So it's probably not an area that we're going to go anytime soon. I think the -- what's more interesting about the market right now is, sort of what I said in my prepared remarks which is that, we're seeing things that really kind of need to happen right now because of certain investors' desire and need for liquidity and capital. And as a result of that, it's creating a dynamic where we're seeing larger discrete actionable opportunities in core sectors that we know very, very well. And we still like fundamentally kind of the -- we still like the fundamentals in those sectors. So the Take-private that we're doing in Europe right now as an example, is about sort of 80% industrial, 20% office. They're exiting the office exposure that's within that portfolio. And they've been in the process of doing that. So it's really an industrial play. And it's a part of the market that we've been watching for a while. It's really the sort of industrial corridor between water dam and the ports down into Germany. And so, it's an area that we've watched for a while. Harder to enter, harder to get access to it, but this gave us basically an entry point that we thought was compelling. A similar situation for the data centers that we are engaged in with -- in Northern Virginia which is sort of the core data centers. Hard to enter the market without either having to pay too much or be able to do it with enough capital deployed. So this gave us the opportunity to do that. We're working on another industrial deal that we hopefully signed very soon that is in North America that we also think is sort of kind of core-to-core as it relates to industrial. So, we think these are great risk-reward opportunities now as a result of pricing. And they're just the general dislocation. So I think we'll continue to be focused on that. On the Angelo Gordon side, the Angelo Gordon business does a number of different things for us as a combined effort. One, as that I mentioned in my remarks, was geographical penetration that we haven't historically had. So the Asia business as an example, it's very hard to enter market. And Angelo Gordon has been in that market for sometime now, so kind of a compelling opportunity for us to be able to continue to grow that. And I think our footprint as a firm in Asia on the PE side and AG's footprint on the real estate side, I think provides an opportunity to potentially continue to scale that. We continue to build that. On the net lease side, I think net lease is a business that we actually looked at prior to the Angelo Gordon acquisition. And in this environment, given what's gone on with the regional banks and the lack of financing availability, net leasing in a lot of respects is a financing product for corporates that are looking to use assets in order to get cost-effective financing. So, we think this is actually a pretty good environment to try to build on what is the core of our net lease strategy in AG. So you'll hear more from us about it but that's our perspective."

            "content": "Thanks Jon. As a reminder, the results I'll be discussing reflect TPG on a standalone basis. They do not include Angela Gordon, since the transaction closed subsequent to the end of the third quarter. TPG had a record quarter for fee-related revenues, with FRR of $321 million, up 12% sequentially and 14% year-over-year. This was a result of strong growth in both management fees and transaction fees. Management fees totaled $279 million and grew 9% from the second quarter due to improved fundraising combined with an increase in catch-up fees. Transaction fees increased 83% sequentially to $31 million and continue to be driven primarily by our lead role in structuring and placing the debt financing in connection with new investments across our platforms. Our well-established debt capital markets business continues to be a strategic weapon providing us and our portfolio companies with differentiated access to capital which is particularly valuable in the current credit market environment. FRE was $156 million for the third quarter up 24% sequentially and 29% year-over-year. This significant growth was due to the FRR growth I just mentioned as well as continued strong expense management resulting in an FRE margin of 49% for the third quarter. This is more than a 560 basis point improvement from the year ago quarter. Our FRE margin for the last 12 months was 44%, which reflects the consistent progress we've been making towards the 45% FRE margin target we had set for the end of this year. While our FRE margin in the fourth quarter will blend down with the acquisition of Angelo Gordon, we believe this provides us with a meaningful margin expansion opportunity as we look to realize significant operating leverage from the combination and scaling of our businesses. After-tax distributable earnings for the third quarter were $196 million or $0.56 per share of Class A common stock. This includes $43 million in net realized performance allocations which were primarily attributable to the successful CAA realization that Jon discussed. Additionally, similar to the previous two quarters we incurred non-core expenses related to the acquisition of Angelo Gordon of $9 million for the third quarter, which is included in our realized investment income and other line item. Turning to our non-GAAP balance sheet. We had $647 million of cash and cash equivalents and $450 million of long-term debt at the end of the third quarter. In late September, we upsized our revolver from $700 million to $1.2 billion and extended the maturity of both the revolver and our term loan. As a result of the financial strength of our business we were able to maintain the attractive pricing on our facilities and further enhance our liquidity position to provide ourselves with ample financial flexibility. When we went public early last year we capitalized our balance sheet with excess cash in anticipation of a potential strategic acquisition. Last week, we closed the acquisition of AG and use this excess cash in addition to drawing down $470 million from our upsized revolver. Pro forma for the cash used at closing our non-GAAP cash and cash equivalents at September 30 would have been approximately $170 million. Our net accrued performance allocations at the end of the third quarter were $692 million compared to $760 million in the prior quarter. This decrease was driven by the realized gains I mentioned earlier as well as a $24 million decline in the value of our investments. Our aggregate portfolio depreciated less than 1% in the third quarter and appreciated 6% over the last 12 months. This performance reflects continued top-line growth and stable margins across our companies offset by multiple contraction. Specifically our private equity portfolio grew revenues by 26% over the last 12 months and our companies generally continue to effectively navigate inflationary pressures by passing through higher input costs. Within real estate higher cap rates were largely offset by our careful sector selection and favorable secular growth trends across our sub-sectors. Such as light industrials, student housing, data centers, purpose-built single-family rentals and life sciences, which collectively make up approximately 65% of our unrealized value. Across our portfolio, net operating income for the last 12 months grew 11% year-over-year. We finished the third quarter with $136 billion of assets under management, up 1% year-over-year. This was driven by $11 billion of capital raised and value creation of $3 billion, partially offset by $13 billion of realizations over the last 12 months. Fee-earning AUM was $79 million and AUM subject to fee earning growth totaled $11 billion at the end of Q3, of which $9 billion was not yet earning fees. Moving to fundraising. We raised $3.4 billion during the quarter and continue to make progress across our flagship fundraises. As Jon mentioned, we continue to expect each fund to be larger than its predecessor. For TPG Capital IX and Healthcare Partners II, we expect to hold final closes towards the end of this year. For Asia VIII, we expect a final close in the first half of next year. And for Rise III, we held our final close for the fund over the weekend, bringing total fund size to $2.7 billion. This is a 24% increase from Rise II and demonstrates the strong support from both our new and existing LPs. As we complete these campaigns, we're experiencing nice momentum as we launch our next flagship campaigns. First, we recently launched fundraising for our sixth growth fund and are in the process of holding a strong first close. Second, we are now approximately 65% invested and committed for our $7 billion Rise Climate Fund and we're actively working towards launching the next vintage. Finally, as we launch those next-generation flagship funds, we're making solid progress across the new business initiatives I've discussed previously. For our inaugural real estate credit strategy, after quarter end we received commitments of more than $750 million. We have closed on approximately $650 million of this capital and we expect to close on the remainder as we raise additional capital for the TrackO [ph] fund. In our Climate business, in addition to launching the next flagship private equity fund, we're continuing to make progress on the launch of our inaugural climate transition infrastructure fund. We're seeing strong interest from anchor LPs and expect to be in the market in the first half of 2024. Overall, we remain very active across all of our strategies and we're confident in our ability to continue delivering differentiated performance. Our growth engine is strong and with the addition of TPG Angelo Gordon and our combined capital formation capabilities, we believe we're in an excellent position to drive consistent, meaningful and diversified growth across our business. Now, I'll turn the call over to Angela to take your questions. Yes. I would only add to that, Jon that in addition to the temporary pause from their existing LPs as they wrap their minds around this and make sure they're comfortable with the with the combination of the stability the real longer-term opportunity here is expanding their LP base and introducing them to some of our larger LPs. And that's something that we've already been actively working on that takes a while to play out, but we're encouraged by the early engagement with some of our larger LPs to help expand their capital. So we would expect a reacceleration of their fundraising as we enter next year. Yes. On the climate -- sorry look, I would take a step back on the fundraising mark overall and think about as we went public in early last year, we knew we had this kind of the big super cycle of our flagship funds coming for the next couple of years. As I talked about on the call, we're approaching the end of that. I think the work we've been doing in the meantime has been positioning ourselves for the next wave of growth as we enter next year and the year after. And I'd say, we feel good about the progress we've made both in terms of new business creation like the Climate Infrastructure Fund that you're referring to. And the Treco fund that we talked about, and the acquisition of Angelo Gordon. So now we've got a whole new growth curve ahead of us. On your question in particular Alex, I would think about the Climate private equity fund the next generation of our $7 billion fund and the Climate Infrastructure Fund together. And we'll obviously be updating you all as we make progress there. But I would say, the early engagement is very high. I think we're -- continue to be viewed to have a leading position in that market. And across those two funds I would expect substantial growth off of the size of the first private equity fund. And when you take all of what I talked about into account with Angelo Gordon's funds the growth in credit the launch of climate we expect fundraising activity to increase next year over this year. Good morning, Craig. Sure. I mean, I talked about the overall portfolio performance across our private equity portfolios in my comments Greg in growth the same dynamics apply still strong revenue growth kind of probably mid-teens in the growth portfolio strong EBIT -- stronger EBITDA growth. So we're actually seeing margin expansion in the growth portfolio. So the portfolio health is quite good. The broader growth equity market is very interesting and we continue to feel like we're very well positioned there. It was obviously the market that saw the biggest spike in activity towards the end of 2021 and kind of the most active part of the market. As you know from looking at our results, we were relatively patient in that environment. Now with the IPO market becoming more difficult, some of those companies needing to raise follow-on capital with our position as kind of a solution provider adding more than just capital. We're pretty well positioned to capitalize on that disruption in the market. And you see that in both our growth and TTAD funds. I mentioned that we accelerated the first close process and growth, because we're seeing a pickup in investment activity. So that happened after the end of the third quarter. So we'll be talking about it in the fourth quarter earnings call, our progress in starting to raise the next growth fund. But the reason we're accelerating it, is because of the new investment activity we're seeing. And likewise in TTAD, we're now over half deployed in the relatively new TTAD fund. Yes, Brian. I would only add just to amplify Jon's comments that the breadth of LPs interested in this area has expanded significantly. If you think about the last \u2013 the first Rise Climate fund we raised was two or three years ago. And certainly since the first Rise fund we raised seven \u2013 six, seven years ago, the awareness among our LP base of the investment opportunity, the capital needed in these areas has expanded significantly. So while it may be the case that any one LP is more capital constrained today than they were two or three years ago, I think as we embark upon this next wave of fundraising across climate generally, the number of LPs around the world who have identified this as an important investment area for them has increased significantly. Yes. Good question. We will talk more about this next week. But one of the things we really liked about the Angel Gordon platform. John talked about the breadth of it and how important that is for things like the insurance market. But having the multi-strategy coverage of virtually every aspect of private credit was super important to us as we thought about the right platform to grow from. Now, it's also expensive to support all that, to build an operating platform to support each of those businesses and they have fully built out scalable operating platforms to support each of those businesses. So now, as we come together as a combined firm, find additional synergies and ability to operate better together and scale their businesses, we absolutely expect that we will get their margin. Our combined -- really what we're focused on now is our combined margin. And getting -- beginning the same margin expansion opportunity that we saw for TPG on a stand-alone basis we now see for the combined business. And I think your comments over time that their credit platform, if it were a stand-alone company and scale should get into the 40s is absolutely correct. Thanks, everyone."

Please go to TPG's IR website to obtain the earnings materials. I will now turn the call over to Gary Stein, Head of Investor Relations at TPG. Thank you, and you may begin, sir.\nGary Stein : Great. Thanks, Chelsea. Welcome, everyone. Joining me this morning are Jon Winkelried, Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Weingart, Chief Financial Officer. In addition, our Executive Chairman and Co-Founder, Jim Coulter; and our President, Todd Sisitsky, are also here and will be available for the Q&A portion of this morning's call. I'd like to remind you this call may include forward-looking statements that do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to TPG's earnings release and SEC filings for factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. TPG undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.  Within our discussion and earnings release, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call that we believe are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to the nearest GAAP figures in TPG's earnings release, which is available on our website. Please note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any TPG fund. Looking briefly at our results for the second quarter. We reported GAAP net income attributable to TPG Inc. of $27 million and after-tax distributable earnings of $96 million or $0.26 per share of Class A common stock. We declared a dividend of $0.22 per share of Class A common stock, which will be paid on September 1 to holders of record as of August 18. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jon.\nJon Winkelried : Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin with an update on Angelo Gordon and our ongoing work to prepare for integration and to position ourselves to maximize the opportunities for the combined platform. I'll then share my thoughts on 2 areas within our core business where we have seen substantial activity in progress.  The first is investment activity. Consistent with the observations I made in our previous earning calls regarding our building pipeline, it feels to us that the market has settled into an attractive period for deploying capital across primary and secondary private equity, real estate and impact investing.  As I'll describe, our teams are capitalizing on the opportunity and have announced or closed a number of interesting and distinctive deals. The second is organic growth. I've reviewed several of our organic growth initiatives with you over the past few quarters, and I'm pleased to update you today on the meaningful progress we have made in fundraising, team building and investing across these opportunities.  On Angelo Gordon, we received HSR clearance in July and are anticipating additional required government approvals at time for our expected closing in the fourth quarter. Our overall integration planning effort has 2 objectives. The first is operational readiness and the second is business integration and revenue growth. More than 150 people across our 2 firms are involved in integration planning.  Well in advance of signing the transaction, we stood up 7 working groups focused on critical areas such as capital formation, people and culture and firm operations. Each group is co-led by Senior TPG and Angelo Gordon Leaders and includes representatives from various business units and functions. Given the complexity of integrating our service functions, including finance and accounting, IT and operations, we established a dedicated integration management office to bring project management rigor and expertise to those activities. On the revenue synergy and growth side, we stood up a senior team that is fully dedicated to identifying opportunities to leverage the combined power of our platforms. The group, which includes more than 20 business leaders from Angelo Gordon and TPG is scoping and fleshing out a series of combined growth initiatives and building execution plans around each one. While we are still in early innings, we believe the opportunity set is even larger than we anticipated. We're prioritizing among those opportunities and preparing to execute in the quarters after closing. Overall, our working groups have made considerable progress on their objectives. Importantly, these working groups have also become a forum for engagement and relationship development between TPG and Angelo Gordon. From my seat as CEO, I've been encouraged to see how naturally our teams have engaged with one another and the clear compatibility of our cultures. I've grown even more confident around the scope of the opportunity for our combined firm post-closing and there's a clear sense of momentum and collective enthusiasm. The connectivity and shared purpose across our firms is tangible and exciting. At the same time that we've been working towards the closing the Angelo Gordon acquisition, we've been very active in our core business, and I want to provide you with an update on the strong progress we've made across several areas.  On our last call, we noted that our transaction pipelines have begun to pick up considerably, and that trend has continued to accelerate. From our perspective, a few key factors are driving more favorable investing conditions. First, the bid-ask spread among buyers and sellers is now narrowed despite continued market volatility. After a prolonged period of buyers and sellers doing the world too differently to bridge valuation gaps, sellers are increasingly showing more willingness to adjust valuation expectations in order to consummate transactions, including, in some cases, whole company take privates. We anticipate this trend will continue into the back half of the year. Second, corporates have become significantly more active in restructuring their portfolios, pursuing acquisitions and divesting certain assets. Given the amount of time we spend working with strategics on relationship building and proactive sourcing, our activity around carve-outs and structured partnerships has picked up meaningfully. And third, many GPs are searching for ways to appropriately return capital to their fund investors, which is helping to increase the flow of attractive investment opportunities. This dynamic has driven both new investments as well as opportunities for us to invest in our existing portfolio companies to grow and strengthen their positioning in their respective markets. Our style of private equity investing, which focuses on transforming high-quality companies and accelerating growth is particularly well suited for the environment in which we are operating. In particular, we have spent years building ecosystems of knowledge and relationships and developing conviction in the sectors, themes and companies into which we want to invest. Accordingly, when actionable opportunities arise, we move nimbly and with the confidence of our full partnership to lean in.  We've also established a strong track record of building high-growth, strategic businesses and structuring win-win relationships with corporate partners. Many of our unique strategic investments, such as our partnership with AmerisourceBergen to acquire One Oncology, which we closed this past quarter are distinctive within the realm of private capital. Recent activity in TPG Capital, our flagship bio fund highlights our investment style and ability to capitalize on the attractive environment. Among our recent deals or 3 corporate carve-outs, a proprietary partnership with a unique put call arrangement and a take private we just announced.  Last week, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire New Relic and a $6.5 billion take-private transaction. New Relic is a leading provider of cloud-based application performance management and observability software, which has been a long-running thematic focus area for our software and enterprise technology team, given its mission-critical nature and durable growth characteristics. In June, we agreed to carve out Forcepoint's global governments and critical infrastructure business. This builds on our track record in cybersecurity and thesis on the secular tailwinds around government and commercial cyber spending. As I mentioned earlier, we closed our acquisition of one oncology in the second quarter which we pursue jointly with AmerisourceBergen and the excellent management team that is currently in place. Although we only closed 2 months ago, we are already finding compelling opportunities to expand and grow the platform. Similarly, in Capital Asia, transaction activity has increased across the region. During the second quarter, Inova Pharmaceuticals, which we acquired in late 2022, agreed to carve out Mundipharma's Consumer Healthcare division. This strategic -- this is highly strategic for Inova, positioning the combined business as a leading Asia consumer health care platform of scale. This is a great example of how we build strong platform companies through both organic investment and targeted acquisitions.  We have several other interesting deals near the finish line that we look forward to discussing with you next quarter. Consistent with our expectations, there has also been an uptick in secondary activity as GPs globally seek strategic liquidity solutions for their best performing assets.  We are generating greater deal flow globally through NewQuest in Asia and TGP TP solutions in Europe and North America. In the second quarter, we backed continuation vehicle funds in India, Germany and the U.S. Notably, TPG was the lead investor in the continuation fund for IU Group, one of the largest and fastest-growing for-profit universities in Germany. We believe this is the single largest -- we believe this is the largest single asset deal in Europe so far this year. This transaction was sourced through the Rise team's multiyear thematic focus on education. It's also a great example of our successful organic growth strategy, where we build new platforms on the full chassis of TPG and create shared incentives for our investment professionals to source opportunities and collaborate across business units. Finally, within real estate, we are seeing signs of an improving backdrop for deployment, and we are well positioned with $6 billion of dry powder at quarter end and our latest opportunistic fund. The significant market dislocation is creating unique opportunities for us to acquire high-quality assets that rarely become available for sale. Our pipeline continues to build as we source investments across numerous geographies and within attractive subsectors such as life sciences, data centers, industrials and student housing. During the second quarter, we completed the acquisition of a portfolio of assets for alloy properties, which is our life sciences real estate platform in the Boston area. This transaction highlights how we can play offense in a tough market and build value in our portfolio of companies through strategic add-ons. We were able to acquire these outstanding properties in the Boston suburbs on a proprietary basis as a direct result of our deep sector expertise. Just a few weeks ago, we closed a $1.5 billion transaction in partnership with Digital Realty Trust to we capitalize a portfolio of high-quality data center assets in Northern Virginia with more than 1 million square feet in total. The portfolio is located in one of the largest and most interconnected data center markets in the world, which also benefits from supply constraints due to structural barriers.  Taking a step back and consistent with the highlights I just shared, we are seeing a notable increase in transaction activity across our platforms, and we are well positioned to continue our momentum. We deployed $2.3 billion in the first quarter and $2.8 billion in the second quarter. And if we aggregate the investments that we have signed, but not yet closed, this represents an incremental $5.5 billion of capital that will be deployed. In addition to our day-to-day focus on our core investment activities, we have also seen significant momentum across TPG and building new investment platforms with substantial growth potential. At the time of our IPO, we described how important organic innovation has been to our historic growth, and we also shared our expectation that it will continue to be a key driver for us going forward. Despite a challenging fundraising environment, we have already raised anchor capital in connection with several funds and have begun investing.  Collectively, we have raised or have near-term visibility to raising more than $2.6 billion of capital for these first-time funds, and we believe each of these initiatives can drive significant and highly accretive growth for TPG over time. Our normal European and North American GP-led secondaries fund had a closing after quarter end, bringing total committed capital to approximately $750 million and the fund is line of sight to reaching $1 billion of capital. To date, the team has completed 4 deals out of its inaugural fund, all within sectors where TPG has deep expertise. We believe this is a marketing strategy that has potential to scale meaningfully over time. Our Inaugural Life Sciences fund, which targets earlier stage opportunities across therapeutic, medical devices, diagnostics and innovative services continues to raise capital and completed 2 investments in the second quarter. We've raised over $250 million of capital with clear momentum toward raising a $500 million fund. Turning to Treco, our private real estate credit strategy. We have visibility to raising over $750 million for the first close dedicated to the strategy, including notable anchor commitments from some of our most active relationships. And finally, we previously discussed the considerable amount of infrastructure capital required to address climate and energy transition globally. As a result of our leadership position with our Rise and Rise Climate Funds, we see a significant amount of deal flow and believe a dedicated climate infrastructure fund will extend our unique position in this market.  We are in the process of lining up anchor LPs and look forward to sharing more with you in the coming quarters. As you can see, we've made meaningful progress and reached key milestones across each of these organic growth initiatives. We feel highly confident about the trajectory of our core business and with the pending acquisition of Angelo Gordon, TPG is positioned to continue delivering strong performance and diversified growth for our investors. Now I'll turn the call over to Jack to review our financial results.\nJack Weingart : Thank you, Jon, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Our second quarter financial results were in line with our expectations and reflect broader industry dynamics and the current macroeconomic environment. All the numbers I'll be discussing are for TPG on a stand-alone basis and do not include Angelo Gordon.  We expect to publicly file a comprehensive information statement around the time of the transaction closing, which will include historical financials for Angelo Gordon and pro forma financials for TPG and Angelo Gordon on a combined basis. We finished the second quarter with $139 billion of assets under management, up 9% year-over-year. This was driven by $15 billion of capital raised and value creation of $7 billion partially offset by $10 billion of realizations over the past 12 months. Fee-earning AUM was $79 billion at the end of Q2, which grew 17% from a year ago. AUM subject to fee earning growth totaled $11 billion, of which $9 billion was not yet earning fees. Management fees totaled $257 million in the second quarter, which grew 15% year-over-year. As expected, transaction and monitoring fees rebounded to $17 million in the quarter, and we expect this will further normalize as our pace of deployment increases. Total fee-related revenue for the quarter was $286 million, up 8% sequentially and 12% compared to Q2 '22. We reported fee-related earnings of $125 million in the second quarter, which increased 23% year-over-year. Our FRE margin for the quarter was 44%. This margin improvement from the first quarter is a result of increased management fees higher capital markets revenue and continued strong expense discipline across the firm. After-tax distributable earnings for the second quarter were $96 million or $0.26 per share of Class A common stock. This was impacted by a couple of items.  First, our net realized performance allocations continue to reflect our moderated pace of realizations. While we will selectively monetize investments in this environment, and we have several in process. Our priority continues to be driving growth across our portfolio of companies. Second, similar to last quarter, we incurred non-core expenses related to the Angelo Gordon acquisition. These costs reduced our distributable earnings by $15 million this quarter. Excluding these expenses, our after-tax DE would have been $111 million or $0.31 per share of Class A common stock. Turning to our non-GAAP balance sheet. We had $578 million of cash and $450 million of long-term debt as of June 30th. Our net accrued performance allocation balance was $760 million, which represents the 20% allocation to the TPG Operating Group. This increased 7% from the first quarter, driven by $58 million of value creation. This value creation was a result of our aggregate portfolio appreciating 2% in the second quarter and 9% over the last 12 months. Our companies are showing continued resilience in this period of economic uncertainty with average revenue growth over the past 12 months of 22%. Finally, on fundraising. We raised $1.5 billion during the quarter and $15 billion over the last 12 months. As you'll recall from last quarter, we updated our targets for our flagship funds given the challenging fundraising environment. We're continuing to manage our business toward these revised targets, and we're pleased with the quality and breadth of the dialogue we're having with LPs. While we continue to make good progress in our LP discussions, there is a more pronounced barbell effect across the industry, where the middle period of campaigns has been elongated. Therefore, we expect the remainder of our flagship fundraises to be weighted toward the end of these processes.  As we work towards completing these flagship campaigns, we're also actively engaging with LPs to capitalize the organic growth initiatives that Jon described. We've made tangible progress and are now actively investing in a number of those strategies. In addition, at the end of the second quarter, we began raising our sixth growth fund. Looking forward, I want to reiterate the compelling growth we see ahead for TPG. Through the addition of Angelo Gordon and our various organic growth initiatives, we're entering what we believe will be the next leg of significant growth across our franchise. We're confident in our ability to generate additional fee earning assets and build long-term shareholder value. Now I'll turn the call back to the operator to take your questions. Chelsea?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.\nKen Worthington : I wanted to focus on fundraising, probably not surprising. You talked about the flagship funds needing about $7 billion to get to your newer target last quarter and you sort of talked about that guidance again. I assume that your confidence in reaching these targets is somewhat based on LP verbal commitments that they're making to you. Are there consequences for LPs that tell you one thing on fundraising and then deliver something else? And then along the lines of fundraising, the FT reported that GPs are offering sweeteners to secure fundraising commitments and the FT included TPG and its reporting what are the incentives that you are offering? And what are you seeing in the broader marketplace?\nJack Weingart: Ken, it's Jack. Let me start there and others can chime in. First of all, just to make one minor correction. In last quarter, when I talked about our revised targets, I talked about needing to raise $5 billion to $6 billion to get to those revised targets. I think you mentioned $6 billion to $7 billion. And as I mentioned on the call, we do continue to work towards those objectives and expect the remainder of that beyond raised in the second quarter here to be backloaded towards the end of the campaigns.  I'm not -- you asked if there are consequences to LPs who say one thing and do another, like we have 20- to 30-year relationships with a lot of these LPs and when we are engaged in fundraising discussions with them, we don't generally find that to be the case. So -- and then on the other question around incentives, look, I think everyone in the industry is getting -- is finding the largest LPs in the market to be good partners in helping build new businesses. And that comes in lots of different forms. And we believe that that's an attractive way for us to build new businesses like the ones John described.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.\nGlenn Schorr : This might be a little nitty-gritty, but Rise III was a little weird. It has -- I know it's early, but it has a 1.1x [Indiscernible] gross, but then there was a weird big negative net NIR IRR. Was there a fee taken? Did something turn on or off? Was there a loss in there? I'm just curious in that, it's just an important line of business.\nJon Winkelried : Glenn, it's Jon. I'm not sure what you're looking at, and maybe --\nGlenn Schorr : We can come back. It's nitty-gritty. I'll reserve that one for later, and I'll go to another topic --\nJon Winkelried : We'll follow up with you on that one because I'm not sure exactly what that is. \nGlenn Schorr : So you're showing a lot of feet. You laid out a lot of numbers, almost too many for me to write down. What does it all add up to in terms of the line-of-sight commitments that you have on the combination of the new organic builds and the Fund II, Fund III, Fund IVs that you have in motion. Do you have any metrics without including Angelo Gordon, on what we could be looking at over the next 12 to 18 months on the fundraising side?\nJack Weingart: You're talking about the new initiatives in particular, Glenn?\nJon Winkelried : No, no, he's talking about both. He's trying to, I think --\nGlenn Schorr : Aggregate.\nJon Winkelried : Aggregate. He's trying to get a sense for aggregate.\nJack Weingart: Well, we -- obviously, we announced that we raised $1.5 billion in Q2. Out of the $5 billion to $6 billion. Start with the flagship funds, right? We talked last quarter about the need to raise $5 billion to $6 billion to get to our revised targets. We just raised, call it, $1 billion to $1.5 billion of that. So leaving $4 billion to $5 billion. So assuming we're successful at getting to our flagship fundraising targets by early next year when most of those campaigns are completed, that would be that amount. And then we're launching our growth fund, as I mentioned, just launched haven't had to close yet. We're targeting $4 billion for that fund, which is up 10% or so from the prior fund.  And then add to that, the initiatives John talked about where he mentioned we have line of sight to raising about $2.6 billion. for those initiatives. And that's only a start to some of those initiatives. So we expect further fundraising for those beyond that. There's -- without thinking about Anglo Gordon, those are the primary fundraising levers that I would highlight.\nGlenn Schorr : And [Indiscernible] Angela Gordon on line of site of Angelo Gordon, sorry.\nJack Weingart: Yes, we're going to be disclosing more complete financial information about Angelo Gordon that matches what we talk about with TPG around the time of closing with a comprehensive information statement, then we'll have more to talk about.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.\nAlex Blostein : So you guys talked about a pretty meaningful pickup in deployment pipeline. You started kind of alluded to that last quarter and I think there's more evidence of that. Can you spend a couple of minutes on maybe the composition of that pipeline what does that look like between take privates versus kind of strategic and sponsor sales? And I guess, more importantly, as you sort of settle into our higher borrowing costs for the industry, have your expectations for sort of prospective returns changed at all? Or the purchase multiples you think have adjusted low enough where you could still generate, call it, a high teen to 20% IRR.\nJon Winkelried : Why don't you take that across private equity.\nJack Weingart: Sure. Let me add thanks for the question. From a composition standpoint, maybe I'll start with just a sort of overall look at some of the deals that Jon walked through quickly. I think we have seen consistent with Jon's sort of observation a significant pickup in corporate dialogues, which in many cases for us has resulted in a number of different carve-outs. So everything from Forcepoint deal Elite and then several carve-outs in connection, I know, which is our Asia platform in consumer health care acquired a really attractive asset that was also a carve-out.  So we're seeing a lot more activity. And again, as we've talked about in the past, we feel like we're particularly well positioned for carve-out by virtue of our operating skills, but also sort of the relationships we've built with our strategics that are the likely partners there. Beyond carve-outs, we actually have also seen situations, and this, I think, again, is some of the more unique things that TPG does relative to our competitors that look more like corporate partnerships, a very unusual and interesting partnership with AmerisourceBergen around One Oncology is a good example.  If you look at our pipeline, we have seen a number of transactions continue to evaluate a number of transactions that fall into both of those buckets and the second bucket feel a little less like a clear selling, clear buyer and more like just 2 parties trying to figure out how to create value. You mentioned take private. We have seen a pickup in the take private opportunities as some of the valuations that we set. So in software, for example, we've seen some multiples in the lower growth side we set by 20% and higher growth, even greater percentages. And that has opened the door take private in a way that probably hasn't been as robust and interesting in the last 3, 4, 5 years.  So that resulted in the new route take private, which we recently announced. And I think there are more of those in the pipeline that, from my standpoint, it's always early even until the end, but look pretty interesting and may result in a pretty compelling valuation proposition. So it's an environment where we feel like the opportunity of deployment is increasing. And the short answer to your question of whether we feel like the same returns are available is yes. Actually like there's -- yes, actually like we're factoring in, of course, the higher cost of capital on the debt side. That's part of the model.  As I said, we've been very conservative in our exit multiple assumptions relative to our entry multiple here for the whole last cycle, probably a little too early relative to the continued strength of the economy. But the net result of that is that we've been investing in very growthy businesses, secular growing businesses, and we continue to feel like the opportunities for strong returns are there, and in some cases, we feel that the opportunities are better than they were 2 or 3 years ago.\nJon Winkelried : Yes. I think Alex also on the real estate side, as I mentioned, there are a couple of opportunities that we thought were very attractive that we've taken advantage of. And given what's going on in the real estate market where there's meaningful dislocation, financing obviously has become much more difficult there overall. The nature of our strategy in real estate part equity partners being opportunistic and having obviously a fair amount of dry powder as a result of our capital reserves put us in a pretty opportunistic position be able to do some interesting things, both with our existing portfolio as well as beyond that. So I think we very much kind of like that opportunity. And clearly, there's been an uptick in the nature of the dialogue there, where there are, in some cases, funds or owners of assets that have to do something based upon needing to sell certain assets sell assets that are high-quality assets in certain cases because those are the ones they can sell. So we feel pretty good about that opportunity that's in front of us there.  And if you look at, I mean, you obviously follow the banks and follow the M&A activity that's going on in the market. If you look at what's going on in the market, there has been a very substantial uptick in corporates optimizing their mix of businesses, and that really is very much in our sweet spot. That's been a core part of our investing across the platform now whether it's capital, whether it's our growth franchise, whether it's our impact franchise. And so that reach and the nature of that dialogue for us that I think is putting us in a position where we're seeing some interesting things, and it's kind of right in our power alley in terms of historically what we've done well.\nJack Weingart: One last comment I set to mention just on the secondary front. That platform for us has been very busy. And in some ways, the fact it's been a little harder for the sponsor community to find liquidity has created, I think, even more of an opportunity there. So that platform has been busy, it's been busy in Europe, it's been busy in the U.S. and the pipeline has picked up pretty significantly, if you look over the last 6 to 12 months. So that's another, I think, area that we think will be fruitful in the few -- next few quarters for certain.\nJim Coulter: Chelsea, just hang on 1 minute. Back to the question of Rise III for, this is James Coulter, over the many years of the private equity industry, we had something called the J-curve, which tells you that early in a fund, you get anomalies in IRRs that don't reflect the ongoing progress in the fund. I think today, we will name a new phenomenon, which is the on the line anomaly, which essentially as funds are set up to draw capital on the line. When they draw their first capital call essentially, during that period, if you annualize the short-term effect of that quarter's first draw, taking down expenses and as you put in the ground, the first investments the annualization of that brief quarterly moment creates anomalies in the numbers.  And that's what happened here is Rise 3 got to its 1-year anniversary and started to call capital that had previously been called on the line, you get a near-term effect, which will ameliorate over time. So early in fund LPs and GPs now understand that the effect of the line will create swings around the long-term [Indiscernible] phenomenon. Those are not indicative of the progress, which in the fund is quite good.\nJon Winkelried : Okay. We're ready for that question.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprys : I wanted to circle back to some of your commentary on Angelo Gordon, I think you mentioned that the opportunity set is larger than anticipated. I was hoping you could elaborate on that. What areas are larger, how you might sort of quantify that, how you came to that view? And then if you could just update us on your latest views around the cost and revenue synergies, how that's evolving.\nJon Winkelried : Yes. Mike. I guess I'll make a couple of comments, then maybe I'll make a couple of comments, and then we'll see if anybody else has anything to add to it. But first of all, I think that we mentioned this when we obviously announced the deal, but at a simplistic high level, one of the things that we see lots of opportunity in is expanding the capital base within Angelo Gordon. They're investing and seeing opportunities, I think, that can support a meaningfully larger capital base.  And so when you look at our LP relationships historically, the number of institutional LP relationships we have, I think we talked at the time about having -- on our end, we have close to 600 institutional LP relationships Angela Gordon has 500 institutional LP relationships, we basically overlap at about 100. So the opportunity to really kind of leverage both of those relationship bases. And in particular, when you look at sort of the size of the LP base that TPG has and bringing some of that -- bringing their product capabilities and some of the strategies into our relationship base, we feel like there is clearly an opportunity to do that.  Number 2 is the opportunity to extend into channels that our product base has limited us around historically. So one of the things we've talked about in the past is obviously this insurance phenomena in our industry. In the past, before Angelo Gordon, we've had dialogue and some interaction with some of the insurance players in the market. We've been limited from a product capability perspective because of, obviously, the focus on credit product, yield product, and this gives us an opportunity coming together to really have the full product suite in terms of what we need to do to be able to be -- to partner with a number of players in the insurance industry, and pre-closing some of that dialogue has already started.  We are beginning to work together to develop a strategy there. But also, we've had a number of proactive reach outs from certain players on the insurance side, and we've picked up some of the active dialogues that we have had. So I think we're excited about that prospect in terms of that being a real opportunity for us to source capital from a channel that we haven't historically sourced it from. And obviously, you're well familiar with the nature of those arrangements in the alternatives business. So that's another area.  A third area would be the whole kind of mass affluent retail channel, where we feel that a combined brand of TPG and Angelo Gordon together, will be a strong partner in those channels. And I think there are a number of opportunities for us to expand our partnerships with channel partners and also, to some extent, evolve some of the product capabilities at Angelo Gordon to meet sort of the kind of semi-liquid product in alternatives that has obviously been meaningful to the channel.  If you look at the various businesses, there are other interesting opportunities that we see. So just quickly tick through them. On the direct lending side, if you look at the twin Brook business that Angela Gordon has built, which is a lower middle market direct lending franchise, there are clearly opportunities there for us to, number one, expand the capital base just if you look at the origination from that platform and what they hold versus what they syndicate, there's a basic opportunity, which is hold more of what they originate, and that's dependent on, again, growing the capital base.  And so that's one of the things that we're focused on, and we will be focused on coming out of the box. Secondly, there's this question of as a lower middle market focused lending franchise following their borrowers for longer, many of their borrowers grow over time. They've been very focused on covenant structure and the style of lending, and perhaps there is a way for us to grow with some of our borrowers over time as they get larger and as the need -- as the borrowing need changes.  So those are 2 examples in Twin Brook. In Credit Solutions, which obviously, in this market environment, there is a -- it's a really interesting opportunity now in sort of what I would describe as kind of middle of to higher up in the capital structure opportunity with our reach as a firm with Angelo Gordon's reach as a firm, I think that the power of the sourcing franchise in terms of seeing really interesting opportunities is clearly going to grow.  We had an off-site together between our private equity businesses and the Credit Solutions business out here on the West Coast 1.5 weeks ago, and we spent time talking about what those opportunities are. And we're very encouraged that there are going to be some really interesting ways of forming capital around what we think is kind of hybrid capital structure type opportunity. So that's another place where we feel like there's going to be some really interesting opportunity.  And then obviously, across the real estate franchises, our real estate businesses focus on different parts of the market. And again, we feel like there are going to be some really interesting opportunities there in conjunction also with what we're building on the real estate credit side. Our 2 firms come at it from a slightly different perspective. We're -- as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're raising a fund around real estate credit opportunities, what we call Treco, and we've made good progress there. We are now in the market looking at investments.  We're also focused on team build, but we have -- the cycle of raising these funds is basically -- and the cycle of raising these new strategies is find partners among our LP base that want to build these businesses with us, get in the market and invest. And then that obviously provides us with a different narrative when we go back to the market to raise additional capital. People can see what we're doing, and they can see tangible evidence of the strategy. So the connection between real estate equity and real estate credit right now in the market is very interesting given what's going on in the market. And we see that from the side of real estate -- from Treco, particularly as it relates to whole loan opportunities and dislocation in the market there.  Angelo Gordon is seeing it from the structured credit side, where they are seeing real opportunities and dislocation in the market in CMBS and other securitized markets, et cetera. So -- and then the last thing, I guess, I would say in structured credit, as you probably saw Angelo Gordon announced raising over $1 billion in what they call their asset-backed fund, we call it the ABC fund. This is a place where I think private credit is just really beginning to come into its own with respect to providing asset-based financing, specialty asset-based financing in the market, particularly given what's going on with the regional banks and contraction of availability of liquidity, et cetera. So that's an area that we're pretty excited about as well. So I would say that kind of is how we -- just a quick snapshot of how we see the opportunity.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Mike Brown with KBW.\nMike Brown : Maybe just a narrowing on the investment income line a little bit. So the $15 million of Angelo Gordon related costs this quarter, can you just unpack those a little bit and then maybe share some thoughts how we should think about the second half here? And then I guess, underneath that, it looks like investment income would have been negative, excluding those costs. So could you just expand on maybe what's the drivers there, and how we should think about that excluding those costs for the second half as well?\nJack Weingart: Sure. Thanks for the question, Mike. First of all, that line, as you point out, is not just the $15 million of Angelo Gordon expenses. The $23 million of kind of costs running through that line include those. They also include another $4 million or so of other non-core expenses, and there are $4 million of investment losses running through there, largely tied to a couple of legacy companies from older funds that we wrote off during the quarter. On the Angelo Gordon expenses, most of that is related to due diligence and integration work, things like third-party spending on lawyers and consultants. We expect some of that to continue, but it will come down a fair bit in Q3. And then in Q4, when we close the transaction, we'll pay the adviser fees that that will also run through that line, but that line will be tapering off from its current run rate.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.\nBrian Bedell : If you could switch the conversation back to the Impact platform, 2-part question. First on Rise Climate, it looks like that's 44% deployed as of now. Maybe just some commentary around how you're seeing the pace of deployment continue to progress there and what stage deployed would you begin to start talking to LPs about Rise Climate 2? And then on the climate infrastructure product, I realize there's more to come there. But should we be thinking of that broadly similar to the -- a lot of your peers with fairly large infrastructure funds and Rise Climate itself being quite large. Should we be thinking of the potential size of that fund in that vein? So maybe not quite as big as the classic capital funds, but second largest basically.\nJim Coulter: First of all, in terms of deployment, I think there's a bit of on the line effect to in your number of 40%. The actual fund deployment is closer to 60% on a gross basis. And fundraising documents typically allow fundraising for the next generation to start as you get to 75% deployed. So we're approaching a period where it would clearly make sense to launch Rise Climate 2. And generally, that would probably make sense to think about it as we begin 2024 for 24 allocations. So you note that it's getting to be that time is exactly right. And the marketplace remains very robust, both in terms of opportunities and in terms of LP interest in this particular part of the market.  In terms of the assets portion of the business, you're right that infrastructure opportunities do scale. By their nature, they require large capital pools. We are not at a position yet to announce targets for either of the funds. But you could imagine that we would want to approach the market together with them from a timing point of view. And while it takes a while to build a new product, our aspirations here would be in the range you're talking about, where it's a fund size, it should, over time, reflect what's happening in private equity.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Brian McKenna with JMP Securities.\nBrian McKenna : So you noted that fundraising for your next growth on commenced right at quarter end. And if I look at growth 5, the fund has generated a net IRR of 22%. So given this performance, coupled with the macro environment more broadly for fundraising, what's the expectation around the size of this fund? Do you think you can surpass the predecessor fund size, which totaled about $3.5 billion? And then how long do you think this one will be in the market for?\nJack Weingart: Yes, it's Jack. I think I mentioned earlier that we have announced LPs a target for that fund of $4 billion. The opportunity set in growth equity investing has gotten much more interesting now. And we think there's plenty interesting investment activity to warrant that kind of fund size, and we have confidence that we'll hit that target. We're just starting. We haven't had a first close yet. We launched, as you mentioned, toward the end of the second quarter. And I think you should expect that fund to be in the market through '24 and probably into early '25 when you take into account when our first close will take place.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Luke Mason with BNP Paribas.\nLuke Mason : Just on your comments around kind of the exit pipeline I guess what needs to happen for -- in the market for that pace of realizations to return in terms of the pipeline? And then just if I look at your accrued performance fees, a larger portion of that $760 million relates to funds from 2017 and prior. So I'm just wondering, is there any conversations that are they starting to want more capital back from those kind of funds and just time line around that, please?\nTodd Sisitsky: Sure. Let me start just with the question around the exit pace. I think the first thing to mention in the context of us in particular, is that if you look during the period of sort of 2020, 2021, we were significant net sellers. We were selling it at a multiple of the dollars we're deploying, we're deploying, frankly, at a pretty healthy pace as well as we continue to find some interesting opportunities. And so that was deliberate. It was sort of a view that the multiples were in a very attractive place to sell.  On the capital side, we sold every software company in TPG 7 and prior as an example. And so that was quite deliberate. We're now in a phase where actually the opportunity is more interesting. So we have switched -- flipped a bit to net buyer. But with that said, and we have younger companies as a result of having sold a lot of what was in our portfolio. With that said, we are working on a number of exits. And I think we've made some good progress in those dialogues, hopefully, more to report in the quarters to come. And we're always open to -- at the right moment, we feel like the growth and transformational efforts that we put against our companies, and we feel like they're starting to bear fruit. That's when we really start to focus on exits.  So it's always a combination of variables as most things are on like both the overall market and the activity level of strategics in particular, and where we stand in our -- in the individual investments in the portfolios in terms of having things that have started to reflect the work that we put against our companies. But again, we have some interesting prospects right now. So we'll continue to selectively find exit an environment where we're mostly in build mode, and then we'll read at investors.\nJack Weingart: On your question, it's Jack, just to add a little bit. As Todd mentioned, we were much more aggressive than most of our peers in 2021. So that's one of the reasons you see our dry powder as a percentage being as high as it is, we did sell a lot back in 2021. That was very intentional.  If you focus on our buyout business, our 2015 vintage fund, TPG 7 is about 2x capital returned to investors. So there's definitely a lot of pressure on GPs in the market who have not returned a lot of capital and have a lot of unrealized investments in their fund. And you're seeing, as I think Jon mentioned during the call, some of that play through to our secondaries business that we're building to help those GPs realize investments.  We honestly don't feel on a lot of that pressure because we were so aggressive at selling back when multiples were higher. We've got a younger portfolio than average in the industry, and we're focused on building value in that portfolio, more so than selling. That being said, the market to sell is picking up a little bit. We have several in process, as Todd mentioned, but we don't feel the pressure that you're alluding to.\nOperator: This concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I would now like to turn the call back over to Gary Stein for any additional or closing remarks.\nGary Stein : Great. Thanks, operator, and thanks, again, everyone, for joining us this morning. If you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to circle back with the IR team, and we'll look forward to speaking to you again next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's TPG's second quarter 2023 earnings call and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jon Winkelried",
            "content": "Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin with an update on Angelo Gordon and our ongoing work to prepare for integration and to position ourselves to maximize the opportunities for the combined platform. I'll then share my thoughts on 2 areas within our core business where we have seen substantial activity in progress.  The first is investment activity. Consistent with the observations I made in our previous earning calls regarding our building pipeline, it feels to us that the market has settled into an attractive period for deploying capital across primary and secondary private equity, real estate and impact investing.  As I'll describe, our teams are capitalizing on the opportunity and have announced or closed a number of interesting and distinctive deals. The second is organic growth. I've reviewed several of our organic growth initiatives with you over the past few quarters, and I'm pleased to update you today on the meaningful progress we have made in fundraising, team building and investing across these opportunities.  On Angelo Gordon, we received HSR clearance in July and are anticipating additional required government approvals at time for our expected closing in the fourth quarter. Our overall integration planning effort has 2 objectives. The first is operational readiness and the second is business integration and revenue growth. More than 150 people across our 2 firms are involved in integration planning.  Well in advance of signing the transaction, we stood up 7 working groups focused on critical areas such as capital formation, people and culture and firm operations. Each group is co-led by Senior TPG and Angelo Gordon Leaders and includes representatives from various business units and functions. Given the complexity of integrating our service functions, including finance and accounting, IT and operations, we established a dedicated integration management office to bring project management rigor and expertise to those activities. On the revenue synergy and growth side, we stood up a senior team that is fully dedicated to identifying opportunities to leverage the combined power of our platforms. The group, which includes more than 20 business leaders from Angelo Gordon and TPG is scoping and fleshing out a series of combined growth initiatives and building execution plans around each one. While we are still in early innings, we believe the opportunity set is even larger than we anticipated. We're prioritizing among those opportunities and preparing to execute in the quarters after closing. Overall, our working groups have made considerable progress on their objectives. Importantly, these working groups have also become a forum for engagement and relationship development between TPG and Angelo Gordon. From my seat as CEO, I've been encouraged to see how naturally our teams have engaged with one another and the clear compatibility of our cultures. I've grown even more confident around the scope of the opportunity for our combined firm post-closing and there's a clear sense of momentum and collective enthusiasm. The connectivity and shared purpose across our firms is tangible and exciting. At the same time that we've been working towards the closing the Angelo Gordon acquisition, we've been very active in our core business, and I want to provide you with an update on the strong progress we've made across several areas.  On our last call, we noted that our transaction pipelines have begun to pick up considerably, and that trend has continued to accelerate. From our perspective, a few key factors are driving more favorable investing conditions. First, the bid-ask spread among buyers and sellers is now narrowed despite continued market volatility. After a prolonged period of buyers and sellers doing the world too differently to bridge valuation gaps, sellers are increasingly showing more willingness to adjust valuation expectations in order to consummate transactions, including, in some cases, whole company take privates. We anticipate this trend will continue into the back half of the year. Second, corporates have become significantly more active in restructuring their portfolios, pursuing acquisitions and divesting certain assets. Given the amount of time we spend working with strategics on relationship building and proactive sourcing, our activity around carve-outs and structured partnerships has picked up meaningfully. And third, many GPs are searching for ways to appropriately return capital to their fund investors, which is helping to increase the flow of attractive investment opportunities. This dynamic has driven both new investments as well as opportunities for us to invest in our existing portfolio companies to grow and strengthen their positioning in their respective markets. Our style of private equity investing, which focuses on transforming high-quality companies and accelerating growth is particularly well suited for the environment in which we are operating. In particular, we have spent years building ecosystems of knowledge and relationships and developing conviction in the sectors, themes and companies into which we want to invest. Accordingly, when actionable opportunities arise, we move nimbly and with the confidence of our full partnership to lean in.  We've also established a strong track record of building high-growth, strategic businesses and structuring win-win relationships with corporate partners. Many of our unique strategic investments, such as our partnership with AmerisourceBergen to acquire One Oncology, which we closed this past quarter are distinctive within the realm of private capital. Recent activity in TPG Capital, our flagship bio fund highlights our investment style and ability to capitalize on the attractive environment. Among our recent deals or 3 corporate carve-outs, a proprietary partnership with a unique put call arrangement and a take private we just announced.  Last week, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire New Relic and a $6.5 billion take-private transaction. New Relic is a leading provider of cloud-based application performance management and observability software, which has been a long-running thematic focus area for our software and enterprise technology team, given its mission-critical nature and durable growth characteristics. In June, we agreed to carve out Forcepoint's global governments and critical infrastructure business. This builds on our track record in cybersecurity and thesis on the secular tailwinds around government and commercial cyber spending. As I mentioned earlier, we closed our acquisition of one oncology in the second quarter which we pursue jointly with AmerisourceBergen and the excellent management team that is currently in place. Although we only closed 2 months ago, we are already finding compelling opportunities to expand and grow the platform. Similarly, in Capital Asia, transaction activity has increased across the region. During the second quarter, Inova Pharmaceuticals, which we acquired in late 2022, agreed to carve out Mundipharma's Consumer Healthcare division. This strategic -- this is highly strategic for Inova, positioning the combined business as a leading Asia consumer health care platform of scale. This is a great example of how we build strong platform companies through both organic investment and targeted acquisitions.  We have several other interesting deals near the finish line that we look forward to discussing with you next quarter. Consistent with our expectations, there has also been an uptick in secondary activity as GPs globally seek strategic liquidity solutions for their best performing assets.  We are generating greater deal flow globally through NewQuest in Asia and TGP TP solutions in Europe and North America. In the second quarter, we backed continuation vehicle funds in India, Germany and the U.S. Notably, TPG was the lead investor in the continuation fund for IU Group, one of the largest and fastest-growing for-profit universities in Germany. We believe this is the single largest -- we believe this is the largest single asset deal in Europe so far this year. This transaction was sourced through the Rise team's multiyear thematic focus on education. It's also a great example of our successful organic growth strategy, where we build new platforms on the full chassis of TPG and create shared incentives for our investment professionals to source opportunities and collaborate across business units. Finally, within real estate, we are seeing signs of an improving backdrop for deployment, and we are well positioned with $6 billion of dry powder at quarter end and our latest opportunistic fund. The significant market dislocation is creating unique opportunities for us to acquire high-quality assets that rarely become available for sale. Our pipeline continues to build as we source investments across numerous geographies and within attractive subsectors such as life sciences, data centers, industrials and student housing. During the second quarter, we completed the acquisition of a portfolio of assets for alloy properties, which is our life sciences real estate platform in the Boston area. This transaction highlights how we can play offense in a tough market and build value in our portfolio of companies through strategic add-ons. We were able to acquire these outstanding properties in the Boston suburbs on a proprietary basis as a direct result of our deep sector expertise. Just a few weeks ago, we closed a $1.5 billion transaction in partnership with Digital Realty Trust to we capitalize a portfolio of high-quality data center assets in Northern Virginia with more than 1 million square feet in total. The portfolio is located in one of the largest and most interconnected data center markets in the world, which also benefits from supply constraints due to structural barriers.  Taking a step back and consistent with the highlights I just shared, we are seeing a notable increase in transaction activity across our platforms, and we are well positioned to continue our momentum. We deployed $2.3 billion in the first quarter and $2.8 billion in the second quarter. And if we aggregate the investments that we have signed, but not yet closed, this represents an incremental $5.5 billion of capital that will be deployed. In addition to our day-to-day focus on our core investment activities, we have also seen significant momentum across TPG and building new investment platforms with substantial growth potential. At the time of our IPO, we described how important organic innovation has been to our historic growth, and we also shared our expectation that it will continue to be a key driver for us going forward. Despite a challenging fundraising environment, we have already raised anchor capital in connection with several funds and have begun investing.  Collectively, we have raised or have near-term visibility to raising more than $2.6 billion of capital for these first-time funds, and we believe each of these initiatives can drive significant and highly accretive growth for TPG over time. Our normal European and North American GP-led secondaries fund had a closing after quarter end, bringing total committed capital to approximately $750 million and the fund is line of sight to reaching $1 billion of capital. To date, the team has completed 4 deals out of its inaugural fund, all within sectors where TPG has deep expertise. We believe this is a marketing strategy that has potential to scale meaningfully over time. Our Inaugural Life Sciences fund, which targets earlier stage opportunities across therapeutic, medical devices, diagnostics and innovative services continues to raise capital and completed 2 investments in the second quarter. We've raised over $250 million of capital with clear momentum toward raising a $500 million fund. Turning to Treco, our private real estate credit strategy. We have visibility to raising over $750 million for the first close dedicated to the strategy, including notable anchor commitments from some of our most active relationships. And finally, we previously discussed the considerable amount of infrastructure capital required to address climate and energy transition globally. As a result of our leadership position with our Rise and Rise Climate Funds, we see a significant amount of deal flow and believe a dedicated climate infrastructure fund will extend our unique position in this market.  We are in the process of lining up anchor LPs and look forward to sharing more with you in the coming quarters. As you can see, we've made meaningful progress and reached key milestones across each of these organic growth initiatives. We feel highly confident about the trajectory of our core business and with the pending acquisition of Angelo Gordon, TPG is positioned to continue delivering strong performance and diversified growth for our investors. Now I'll turn the call over to Jack to review our financial results. Glenn, it's Jon. I'm not sure what you're looking at, and maybe -- We'll follow up with you on that one because I'm not sure exactly what that is. No, no, he's talking about both. He's trying to, I think -- Aggregate. He's trying to get a sense for aggregate. Why don't you take that across private equity. Yes. I think Alex also on the real estate side, as I mentioned, there are a couple of opportunities that we thought were very attractive that we've taken advantage of. And given what's going on in the real estate market where there's meaningful dislocation, financing obviously has become much more difficult there overall. The nature of our strategy in real estate part equity partners being opportunistic and having obviously a fair amount of dry powder as a result of our capital reserves put us in a pretty opportunistic position be able to do some interesting things, both with our existing portfolio as well as beyond that. So I think we very much kind of like that opportunity. And clearly, there's been an uptick in the nature of the dialogue there, where there are, in some cases, funds or owners of assets that have to do something based upon needing to sell certain assets sell assets that are high-quality assets in certain cases because those are the ones they can sell. So we feel pretty good about that opportunity that's in front of us there.  And if you look at, I mean, you obviously follow the banks and follow the M&A activity that's going on in the market. If you look at what's going on in the market, there has been a very substantial uptick in corporates optimizing their mix of businesses, and that really is very much in our sweet spot. That's been a core part of our investing across the platform now whether it's capital, whether it's our growth franchise, whether it's our impact franchise. And so that reach and the nature of that dialogue for us that I think is putting us in a position where we're seeing some interesting things, and it's kind of right in our power alley in terms of historically what we've done well. Okay. We're ready for that question. Yes. Mike. I guess I'll make a couple of comments, then maybe I'll make a couple of comments, and then we'll see if anybody else has anything to add to it. But first of all, I think that we mentioned this when we obviously announced the deal, but at a simplistic high level, one of the things that we see lots of opportunity in is expanding the capital base within Angelo Gordon. They're investing and seeing opportunities, I think, that can support a meaningfully larger capital base.  And so when you look at our LP relationships historically, the number of institutional LP relationships we have, I think we talked at the time about having -- on our end, we have close to 600 institutional LP relationships Angela Gordon has 500 institutional LP relationships, we basically overlap at about 100. So the opportunity to really kind of leverage both of those relationship bases. And in particular, when you look at sort of the size of the LP base that TPG has and bringing some of that -- bringing their product capabilities and some of the strategies into our relationship base, we feel like there is clearly an opportunity to do that.  Number 2 is the opportunity to extend into channels that our product base has limited us around historically. So one of the things we've talked about in the past is obviously this insurance phenomena in our industry. In the past, before Angelo Gordon, we've had dialogue and some interaction with some of the insurance players in the market. We've been limited from a product capability perspective because of, obviously, the focus on credit product, yield product, and this gives us an opportunity coming together to really have the full product suite in terms of what we need to do to be able to be -- to partner with a number of players in the insurance industry, and pre-closing some of that dialogue has already started.  We are beginning to work together to develop a strategy there. But also, we've had a number of proactive reach outs from certain players on the insurance side, and we've picked up some of the active dialogues that we have had. So I think we're excited about that prospect in terms of that being a real opportunity for us to source capital from a channel that we haven't historically sourced it from. And obviously, you're well familiar with the nature of those arrangements in the alternatives business. So that's another area.  A third area would be the whole kind of mass affluent retail channel, where we feel that a combined brand of TPG and Angelo Gordon together, will be a strong partner in those channels. And I think there are a number of opportunities for us to expand our partnerships with channel partners and also, to some extent, evolve some of the product capabilities at Angelo Gordon to meet sort of the kind of semi-liquid product in alternatives that has obviously been meaningful to the channel.  If you look at the various businesses, there are other interesting opportunities that we see. So just quickly tick through them. On the direct lending side, if you look at the twin Brook business that Angela Gordon has built, which is a lower middle market direct lending franchise, there are clearly opportunities there for us to, number one, expand the capital base just if you look at the origination from that platform and what they hold versus what they syndicate, there's a basic opportunity, which is hold more of what they originate, and that's dependent on, again, growing the capital base.  And so that's one of the things that we're focused on, and we will be focused on coming out of the box. Secondly, there's this question of as a lower middle market focused lending franchise following their borrowers for longer, many of their borrowers grow over time. They've been very focused on covenant structure and the style of lending, and perhaps there is a way for us to grow with some of our borrowers over time as they get larger and as the need -- as the borrowing need changes.  So those are 2 examples in Twin Brook. In Credit Solutions, which obviously, in this market environment, there is a -- it's a really interesting opportunity now in sort of what I would describe as kind of middle of to higher up in the capital structure opportunity with our reach as a firm with Angelo Gordon's reach as a firm, I think that the power of the sourcing franchise in terms of seeing really interesting opportunities is clearly going to grow.  We had an off-site together between our private equity businesses and the Credit Solutions business out here on the West Coast 1.5 weeks ago, and we spent time talking about what those opportunities are. And we're very encouraged that there are going to be some really interesting ways of forming capital around what we think is kind of hybrid capital structure type opportunity. So that's another place where we feel like there's going to be some really interesting opportunity.  And then obviously, across the real estate franchises, our real estate businesses focus on different parts of the market. And again, we feel like there are going to be some really interesting opportunities there in conjunction also with what we're building on the real estate credit side. Our 2 firms come at it from a slightly different perspective. We're -- as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're raising a fund around real estate credit opportunities, what we call Treco, and we've made good progress there. We are now in the market looking at investments.  We're also focused on team build, but we have -- the cycle of raising these funds is basically -- and the cycle of raising these new strategies is find partners among our LP base that want to build these businesses with us, get in the market and invest. And then that obviously provides us with a different narrative when we go back to the market to raise additional capital. People can see what we're doing, and they can see tangible evidence of the strategy. So the connection between real estate equity and real estate credit right now in the market is very interesting given what's going on in the market. And we see that from the side of real estate -- from Treco, particularly as it relates to whole loan opportunities and dislocation in the market there.  Angelo Gordon is seeing it from the structured credit side, where they are seeing real opportunities and dislocation in the market in CMBS and other securitized markets, et cetera. So -- and then the last thing, I guess, I would say in structured credit, as you probably saw Angelo Gordon announced raising over $1 billion in what they call their asset-backed fund, we call it the ABC fund. This is a place where I think private credit is just really beginning to come into its own with respect to providing asset-based financing, specialty asset-based financing in the market, particularly given what's going on with the regional banks and contraction of availability of liquidity, et cetera. So that's an area that we're pretty excited about as well. So I would say that kind of is how we -- just a quick snapshot of how we see the opportunity."

            "name": "Todd Sisitsky",
            "content": "Sure. Let me start just with the question around the exit pace. I think the first thing to mention in the context of us in particular, is that if you look during the period of sort of 2020, 2021, we were significant net sellers. We were selling it at a multiple of the dollars we're deploying, we're deploying, frankly, at a pretty healthy pace as well as we continue to find some interesting opportunities. And so that was deliberate. It was sort of a view that the multiples were in a very attractive place to sell.  On the capital side, we sold every software company in TPG 7 and prior as an example. And so that was quite deliberate. We're now in a phase where actually the opportunity is more interesting. So we have switched -- flipped a bit to net buyer. But with that said, and we have younger companies as a result of having sold a lot of what was in our portfolio. With that said, we are working on a number of exits. And I think we've made some good progress in those dialogues, hopefully, more to report in the quarters to come. And we're always open to -- at the right moment, we feel like the growth and transformational efforts that we put against our companies, and we feel like they're starting to bear fruit. That's when we really start to focus on exits.  So it's always a combination of variables as most things are on like both the overall market and the activity level of strategics in particular, and where we stand in our -- in the individual investments in the portfolios in terms of having things that have started to reflect the work that we put against our companies. But again, we have some interesting prospects right now. So we'll continue to selectively find exit an environment where we're mostly in build mode, and then we'll read at investors."

            "name": "Jim Coulter",
            "content": "Chelsea, just hang on 1 minute. Back to the question of Rise III for, this is James Coulter, over the many years of the private equity industry, we had something called the J-curve, which tells you that early in a fund, you get anomalies in IRRs that don't reflect the ongoing progress in the fund. I think today, we will name a new phenomenon, which is the on the line anomaly, which essentially as funds are set up to draw capital on the line. When they draw their first capital call essentially, during that period, if you annualize the short-term effect of that quarter's first draw, taking down expenses and as you put in the ground, the first investments the annualization of that brief quarterly moment creates anomalies in the numbers.  And that's what happened here is Rise 3 got to its 1-year anniversary and started to call capital that had previously been called on the line, you get a near-term effect, which will ameliorate over time. So early in fund LPs and GPs now understand that the effect of the line will create swings around the long-term [Indiscernible] phenomenon. Those are not indicative of the progress, which in the fund is quite good. First of all, in terms of deployment, I think there's a bit of on the line effect to in your number of 40%. The actual fund deployment is closer to 60% on a gross basis. And fundraising documents typically allow fundraising for the next generation to start as you get to 75% deployed. So we're approaching a period where it would clearly make sense to launch Rise Climate 2. And generally, that would probably make sense to think about it as we begin 2024 for 24 allocations. So you note that it's getting to be that time is exactly right. And the marketplace remains very robust, both in terms of opportunities and in terms of LP interest in this particular part of the market.  In terms of the assets portion of the business, you're right that infrastructure opportunities do scale. By their nature, they require large capital pools. We are not at a position yet to announce targets for either of the funds. But you could imagine that we would want to approach the market together with them from a timing point of view. And while it takes a while to build a new product, our aspirations here would be in the range you're talking about, where it's a fund size, it should, over time, reflect what's happening in private equity."

            "name": "Jack Weingart",
            "content": "Thank you, Jon, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Our second quarter financial results were in line with our expectations and reflect broader industry dynamics and the current macroeconomic environment. All the numbers I'll be discussing are for TPG on a stand-alone basis and do not include Angelo Gordon.  We expect to publicly file a comprehensive information statement around the time of the transaction closing, which will include historical financials for Angelo Gordon and pro forma financials for TPG and Angelo Gordon on a combined basis. We finished the second quarter with $139 billion of assets under management, up 9% year-over-year. This was driven by $15 billion of capital raised and value creation of $7 billion partially offset by $10 billion of realizations over the past 12 months. Fee-earning AUM was $79 billion at the end of Q2, which grew 17% from a year ago. AUM subject to fee earning growth totaled $11 billion, of which $9 billion was not yet earning fees. Management fees totaled $257 million in the second quarter, which grew 15% year-over-year. As expected, transaction and monitoring fees rebounded to $17 million in the quarter, and we expect this will further normalize as our pace of deployment increases. Total fee-related revenue for the quarter was $286 million, up 8% sequentially and 12% compared to Q2 '22. We reported fee-related earnings of $125 million in the second quarter, which increased 23% year-over-year. Our FRE margin for the quarter was 44%. This margin improvement from the first quarter is a result of increased management fees higher capital markets revenue and continued strong expense discipline across the firm. After-tax distributable earnings for the second quarter were $96 million or $0.26 per share of Class A common stock. This was impacted by a couple of items.  First, our net realized performance allocations continue to reflect our moderated pace of realizations. While we will selectively monetize investments in this environment, and we have several in process. Our priority continues to be driving growth across our portfolio of companies. Second, similar to last quarter, we incurred non-core expenses related to the Angelo Gordon acquisition. These costs reduced our distributable earnings by $15 million this quarter. Excluding these expenses, our after-tax DE would have been $111 million or $0.31 per share of Class A common stock. Turning to our non-GAAP balance sheet. We had $578 million of cash and $450 million of long-term debt as of June 30th. Our net accrued performance allocation balance was $760 million, which represents the 20% allocation to the TPG Operating Group. This increased 7% from the first quarter, driven by $58 million of value creation. This value creation was a result of our aggregate portfolio appreciating 2% in the second quarter and 9% over the last 12 months. Our companies are showing continued resilience in this period of economic uncertainty with average revenue growth over the past 12 months of 22%. Finally, on fundraising. We raised $1.5 billion during the quarter and $15 billion over the last 12 months. As you'll recall from last quarter, we updated our targets for our flagship funds given the challenging fundraising environment. We're continuing to manage our business toward these revised targets, and we're pleased with the quality and breadth of the dialogue we're having with LPs. While we continue to make good progress in our LP discussions, there is a more pronounced barbell effect across the industry, where the middle period of campaigns has been elongated. Therefore, we expect the remainder of our flagship fundraises to be weighted toward the end of these processes.  As we work towards completing these flagship campaigns, we're also actively engaging with LPs to capitalize the organic growth initiatives that Jon described. We've made tangible progress and are now actively investing in a number of those strategies. In addition, at the end of the second quarter, we began raising our sixth growth fund. Looking forward, I want to reiterate the compelling growth we see ahead for TPG. Through the addition of Angelo Gordon and our various organic growth initiatives, we're entering what we believe will be the next leg of significant growth across our franchise. We're confident in our ability to generate additional fee earning assets and build long-term shareholder value. Now I'll turn the call back to the operator to take your questions. Chelsea? Ken, it's Jack. Let me start there and others can chime in. First of all, just to make one minor correction. In last quarter, when I talked about our revised targets, I talked about needing to raise $5 billion to $6 billion to get to those revised targets. I think you mentioned $6 billion to $7 billion. And as I mentioned on the call, we do continue to work towards those objectives and expect the remainder of that beyond raised in the second quarter here to be backloaded towards the end of the campaigns.  I'm not -- you asked if there are consequences to LPs who say one thing and do another, like we have 20- to 30-year relationships with a lot of these LPs and when we are engaged in fundraising discussions with them, we don't generally find that to be the case. So -- and then on the other question around incentives, look, I think everyone in the industry is getting -- is finding the largest LPs in the market to be good partners in helping build new businesses. And that comes in lots of different forms. And we believe that that's an attractive way for us to build new businesses like the ones John described. You're talking about the new initiatives in particular, Glenn? Well, we -- obviously, we announced that we raised $1.5 billion in Q2. Out of the $5 billion to $6 billion. Start with the flagship funds, right? We talked last quarter about the need to raise $5 billion to $6 billion to get to our revised targets. We just raised, call it, $1 billion to $1.5 billion of that. So leaving $4 billion to $5 billion. So assuming we're successful at getting to our flagship fundraising targets by early next year when most of those campaigns are completed, that would be that amount. And then we're launching our growth fund, as I mentioned, just launched haven't had to close yet. We're targeting $4 billion for that fund, which is up 10% or so from the prior fund.  And then add to that, the initiatives John talked about where he mentioned we have line of sight to raising about $2.6 billion. for those initiatives. And that's only a start to some of those initiatives. So we expect further fundraising for those beyond that. There's -- without thinking about Anglo Gordon, those are the primary fundraising levers that I would highlight. Yes, we're going to be disclosing more complete financial information about Angelo Gordon that matches what we talk about with TPG around the time of closing with a comprehensive information statement, then we'll have more to talk about. Sure. Let me add thanks for the question. From a composition standpoint, maybe I'll start with just a sort of overall look at some of the deals that Jon walked through quickly. I think we have seen consistent with Jon's sort of observation a significant pickup in corporate dialogues, which in many cases for us has resulted in a number of different carve-outs. So everything from Forcepoint deal Elite and then several carve-outs in connection, I know, which is our Asia platform in consumer health care acquired a really attractive asset that was also a carve-out.  So we're seeing a lot more activity. And again, as we've talked about in the past, we feel like we're particularly well positioned for carve-out by virtue of our operating skills, but also sort of the relationships we've built with our strategics that are the likely partners there. Beyond carve-outs, we actually have also seen situations, and this, I think, again, is some of the more unique things that TPG does relative to our competitors that look more like corporate partnerships, a very unusual and interesting partnership with AmerisourceBergen around One Oncology is a good example.  If you look at our pipeline, we have seen a number of transactions continue to evaluate a number of transactions that fall into both of those buckets and the second bucket feel a little less like a clear selling, clear buyer and more like just 2 parties trying to figure out how to create value. You mentioned take private. We have seen a pickup in the take private opportunities as some of the valuations that we set. So in software, for example, we've seen some multiples in the lower growth side we set by 20% and higher growth, even greater percentages. And that has opened the door take private in a way that probably hasn't been as robust and interesting in the last 3, 4, 5 years.  So that resulted in the new route take private, which we recently announced. And I think there are more of those in the pipeline that, from my standpoint, it's always early even until the end, but look pretty interesting and may result in a pretty compelling valuation proposition. So it's an environment where we feel like the opportunity of deployment is increasing. And the short answer to your question of whether we feel like the same returns are available is yes. Actually like there's -- yes, actually like we're factoring in, of course, the higher cost of capital on the debt side. That's part of the model.  As I said, we've been very conservative in our exit multiple assumptions relative to our entry multiple here for the whole last cycle, probably a little too early relative to the continued strength of the economy. But the net result of that is that we've been investing in very growthy businesses, secular growing businesses, and we continue to feel like the opportunities for strong returns are there, and in some cases, we feel that the opportunities are better than they were 2 or 3 years ago. One last comment I set to mention just on the secondary front. That platform for us has been very busy. And in some ways, the fact it's been a little harder for the sponsor community to find liquidity has created, I think, even more of an opportunity there. So that platform has been busy, it's been busy in Europe, it's been busy in the U.S. and the pipeline has picked up pretty significantly, if you look over the last 6 to 12 months. So that's another, I think, area that we think will be fruitful in the few -- next few quarters for certain. Sure. Thanks for the question, Mike. First of all, that line, as you point out, is not just the $15 million of Angelo Gordon expenses. The $23 million of kind of costs running through that line include those. They also include another $4 million or so of other non-core expenses, and there are $4 million of investment losses running through there, largely tied to a couple of legacy companies from older funds that we wrote off during the quarter. On the Angelo Gordon expenses, most of that is related to due diligence and integration work, things like third-party spending on lawyers and consultants. We expect some of that to continue, but it will come down a fair bit in Q3. And then in Q4, when we close the transaction, we'll pay the adviser fees that that will also run through that line, but that line will be tapering off from its current run rate. Yes, it's Jack. I think I mentioned earlier that we have announced LPs a target for that fund of $4 billion. The opportunity set in growth equity investing has gotten much more interesting now. And we think there's plenty interesting investment activity to warrant that kind of fund size, and we have confidence that we'll hit that target. We're just starting. We haven't had a first close yet. We launched, as you mentioned, toward the end of the second quarter. And I think you should expect that fund to be in the market through '24 and probably into early '25 when you take into account when our first close will take place. On your question, it's Jack, just to add a little bit. As Todd mentioned, we were much more aggressive than most of our peers in 2021. So that's one of the reasons you see our dry powder as a percentage being as high as it is, we did sell a lot back in 2021. That was very intentional.  If you focus on our buyout business, our 2015 vintage fund, TPG 7 is about 2x capital returned to investors. So there's definitely a lot of pressure on GPs in the market who have not returned a lot of capital and have a lot of unrealized investments in their fund. And you're seeing, as I think Jon mentioned during the call, some of that play through to our secondaries business that we're building to help those GPs realize investments.  We honestly don't feel on a lot of that pressure because we were so aggressive at selling back when multiples were higher. We've got a younger portfolio than average in the industry, and we're focused on building value in that portfolio, more so than selling. That being said, the market to sell is picking up a little bit. We have several in process, as Todd mentioned, but we don't feel the pressure that you're alluding to."

Currently all callers have been placed in a listen-only mode and following management's prepared remarks, the call will be opened for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's call is being recorded. Please go to TPG's IR website to obtain earning materials. I will now turn the call over to Gary Stein, Head of Investor Relations at TPG. Thank you, you may begin.\nGary Stein: Great. Thanks, Ashley. Thank you all for joining us on our first quarter conference call. We're also excited to announce that we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Angelo Gordon and we will be discussing the transaction today in detail. Earlier this morning, in addition to posting our standard quarterly earnings materials to our Investor Relations website, we issued a press release announcing the acquisition and posted an investor presentation that we will be referring to during this call. With me this morning are Chief Executive Officer, Jon Winkelried and our Chief Financial Officer, Jack Weingart. Our Executive Chairman and Co-Founder, Jim Coulter and our President, Todd Sisitsky will also be available for the Q&A portion of this call. Additionally, we are pleased to be joined this morning by Josh Baumgarten and Adam Schwartz, the Co-Chief Executive Officers of Angelo Gordon. I'd like to remind you, this call may include forward-looking statements that do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to TPG's SEC filings for factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. TPG undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements except as required by law. Within our discussion and earnings release, we're presenting GAAP measures, non-GAAP measures and pro-forma non-GAAP measures reflecting the reorganization that was completed during 2021 and immediately prior to TPG's IPO. We believe it's helpful for investors and analysts to understand the historic results through the lens of our go-forward structure and please refer to TPG's earnings release for details on the pro-forma financial information. We'll also be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call that we believe are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to the nearest GAAP figures in TPG's earnings release which is available on our website. Please note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any TPG Funds. Looking briefly at our results for the first quarter, we reported GAAP net income attributable to TPG Inc. of $25 million and after tax distributable earnings of $88 million or $0.24 per share of Class A common stock. We also declared a dividend of $0.20 per share of Class A common stock, which will be paid on June 5th to holders of record as of May 25th. With that I will turn the call over to Jon.\nJon Winkelried: Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we made a very important announcement. TPG has agreed to acquire Angelo Gordon, a fully-integrated and scaled multi-strategy alternatives platform in credit and real estate with approximately $73 billion in AUM and $50 billion in fee earning AUM at the end of 2022. This transaction is highly compelling and advances our position as a diversified global alternative asset manager. We've been focused on strategic diversification since our IPO and we believe Angelo Gordon, puts us in a strong position to continue delivering growth and scale. We have a lot to cover this morning. So Jack and I will briefly review our quarterly results before discussing the Angelo Gordon transaction in detail. During the quarter, the timing of fundraising and deal activity continue to be impacted by market volatility and increased macro uncertainty. However, we've navigated through similar dynamics in prior cycles and continue to feel very good about our long-term growth trajectory particularly with the addition of Angelo Gordon. We raised $27 billion of capital over the last 12 months and $2 billion in the quarter in a challenging fundraising environment. The $27 billion represents a 9% increase over the last 12 months ending first quarter 2022, while fundraising in the industry was down 11% during the same period. We continue to engage in robust, high-quality conversations with clients around the world. Interest remains strong. The timelines for capital commitments across the industry have been elongated. Similar to what you've already heard from other alternative asset managers, we believe near-term fundraising will remain difficult for the industry and Jack will discuss what this means for our funds. We really don't know how long the remainder of our current flagship campaigns will last, but we'll make thoughtful decisions around the timing of our final closes. As discussed broadly across the industry, deal activity in the first quarter was slow. We deployed $2 billion in the first quarter and $14 billion over the last 12 months. However, we've recently seen a significant pickup in our deal pipelines and our investment committees are very active. TPG's long-term, patient and sector driven approach to investing is well-suited for this environment. We believe the intellectual capital and ecosystems we built around our core themes, along with $43 billion of dry powder, leave us well positioned to capitalize on unique deployment opportunities. This includes an increasing proportion of corporate carve-outs, big privates, our proprietary partnerships, and we recently signed a number of differentiated deals. At TPG Capital, we agreed to carve-out Elite, a provider of financial and practice management solutions for leading law firms from Thomson Reuters Corporations. We also announced the acquisition of OneOncology in partnership with AmerisourceBergen. This is an example of a creative proprietary corporate partnership from our leading healthcare franchise and the transaction includes a unique structure with significant downside protection. In Capital Asia, we announced an investment in Manipal hospitals, the second-largest pan-Indian healthcare services platform out of our current fund after originally investing from TPG Capital Asia VI in 2015. This investment was done alongside the Company's Founder and Temasek, both of whom were eager to bring in TPG for the next leg of value-creation, given our track-record of driving significant growth over the last eight years. Our impact platform continues to deploy capital at a healthy pace. Rise Climate and the Rise Fund recently invested in Palmetto Clean Technology, a fast-growing rooftop solar platform in the US. Rise was also the lead investor in the latest round of funding for Ohmium, a leader in the development and the implementation of hydrogen electrolyzer technology. Across our current funds, we feel very good about our solid portfolio construction in sectors where we have strong thematic conviction and deep expertise. Our portfolios continue to perform well and in aggregate, they appreciated 3% in the first-quarter and 4% over the last 12 months. On an LTM basis, aggregate portfolio company revenue growth across all our platforms was 25%. A low inflationary pressures persist. Aggregate EBITDA margins have remained stable and our companies have been able to effectively manage pricing and costs. Realizations across our platforms were more than $2 billion in the first quarter and $13 billion over the last 12 months. Given the long-dated nature of our capital, we will be very targeted and deliberate around monetizing investments during this part of the cycle. We're prepared for this type of environment in our underwriting and believe now is an opportune time to continue building value and driving growth in our portfolio coverage. Now Jack will spend a few minutes on our financial results.\nJack Weingart: Thanks, Jon. Good morning, everyone. At the end of the first quarter, we had assets under management of $137 billion, which is up 14% year-over-year. This was driven by $27 billion of capital raised and value creation of $3 billion, partially offset by $13 billion of realizations during the last 12 months. Fee earning AUM increased 23% year-over-year to $79 billion at the end of Q1. AUM subject to fee earning growth totaled $13 billion. Before I walk through our financials, I want to call out a few quarter-specific factors that impacted our first quarter results. First, the step-down of our predecessor Asia Funds, which resulted in a one-time step-down in management fees of approximately $9 million during the quarter. Second, an unusually light quarter in our Capital Markets business resulting from the timing of our investment activity. As a reminder, in Q4 of last year, we highlighted that our transaction fees of $45 million were unusually high. We believe that the average of these two quarters or approximately $20 million to $25 million represents a normalized quarter for our transaction fees. Non-core expenses totaled approximately $11 million, primarily related to diligence, legal and accounting work in connection with our acquisition of Angelo Gordon. This resulted in a one-time reduction in our distributable earnings for the quarter, which is reflected through our realized investment income in other line item. The unusually low capital markets fees plus the one-time M&A expenses caused our distributable earnings to be approximately $30 million lower than they would have otherwise been during the quarter. That being said first quarter management fees of $248 million increased 22% compared to the year-ago quarter and were relatively unchanged from Q4 '22. This is due to the one-time step-down of the prior Capital Asia Fund that I just described. Total fee related revenue was $265 million in Q1, a 10% increase year-over-year. While transaction and monitoring fees were late in the quarter, based on the robust transaction pipeline that Jon referenced, we expect capital markets revenue to pick back up to more normalized levels over the balance of the year as our pace of deployment increases. Fee related earnings totaled $99 million in the first quarter up 8% year-over-year. LTM FRE of $461 million, notably, grew 31% compared to the pro-forma last 12 months ended Q1 '22. Our first quarter FRE margin of 37% was impacted by lower capital markets revenue as well as the Asia step-down. Given the inherent fluctuations in capital markets activity quarter-to-quarter and the one-time nature of the step-down, we believe that our run-rate FRE margin is better represented by our margin over the last 12 months, which was 42%. This is in line with our full-year 2022 results and a 335 basis point improvement from the pro-forma last 12 months ended Q1 '22. We continue to be very disciplined around cost management and are working toward our 45% FRE margin target, which we believe we remain on-track to hit by year end for TPG on a standalone basis. I'll touch more on the impact of the integration of Angelo Gordon to our FRE margin in a few minutes. We ended the first quarter with $709 million in net accrued performance allocations, which is a 10% increase from the fourth quarter of '22. After tax distributable earnings for the first-quarter were $88 million or $0.24 per share of Class A common stock and $589 million over the last 12 months. We announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share of Class A common stock, representing 85% of our after tax distributable earnings. Moving onto an update on fundraising. We raised $2 billion in the first quarter, as Jon mentioned and $27 billion over the last 12 months. Notably, in the first quarter, we completed the final close of our highly successful campaign for TTAD II, our technology adjacency fund. We raised an aggregate of $3.4 billion from TTAD II, more than doubling the size of the Inaugural fund. We believe the strength of TPG's brand, client relationships, investment style and returns continue to stand-out among alternative asset managers. As Jon mentioned, we have strong ongoing engagement with both new and existing LPs. However, we set our original flagship fundraising targets under different market conditions. We still expect each fund to grow compared to its predecessor. But in aggregate, they may not grow as much as we previously expected. We've already been managing the business with this in mind as you can see from our cost discipline in the first quarter. To dimensionalize this for you, I would note the following. Across our flagship funds currently in market, TPG 9, Healthcare Partners 2, Asia 8 and Rise 3, our original targets totaled $27.5 billion. While it's too -- still too early to tell what the outcome of each fundraise will be, we're currently managing the business, assuming we'll raise an aggregate of approximately $23 billion to $24 billion, which would represent greater than 10% growth over the aggregate predecessor funds. This implies we would need to raise approximately an incremental $7 billion across these four funds. Based on our strong pipeline of LP engagement, we have confidence in our ability to achieve this outcome. Finally, we continue to make good progress capitalizing our new strategies including TPG Next, Life Sciences and TRECO, our real estate credit funding, as well as preparing to launch our first climate infrastructure fund. We expect to have a further update on these organic initiatives in the coming quarters. Given the significant fundraising headwinds, I want to acknowledge the strong progress we've made in our campaigns and the considerable growth in our fee earning AUM. We have a near-record level of dry powder available to invest in growing pipelines and increasingly interesting opportunities across our platforms. So there's a lot to look forward to. Now I'll turn the call back over to Jon to talk about the Angelo Gordon transaction in greater detail.\nJon Winkelried: Thanks, Jack. Since our IPO early last year, we've consistently signaled our desire to drive continued growth and diversification through both organic initiatives and strategic transactions. We always seek to build long-term shareholder value and there have been focused on scaling our existing platforms and providing a broader array of high-quality investment solutions to our clients. We believe the Angelo Gordon transaction delivers on these objectives. We've been seeking a platform that we believe will generate strong returns for our limited partners. Angelo Gordon has done that historically, as evidenced by their proven investment track record and their significant recent AUM growth. And we believe they are well-positioned to continue delivering attractive risk-adjusted returns going forward. Assuming TPG and Angelo Gordon have been combined at the end of 2022. We would have had approximately $208 billion of total AUM and $128 billion of fee-earning AUM with approximately 1,800 employees located in 18 cities around the world. We expect this transaction to be mid to high single-digit accretive on an FRE and after tax DE per share basis in 2024 before any revenue or cost synergies. The acquisition of Angelo Gordon with its scale of credit and real estate businesses is directly on-target with our strategic objectives to further diversify and unlock new avenues for growth and innovation in attractive and complementary asset classes. First, Angelo Gordon's $55 billion credit platform brings significant momentum to TPG in what is widely recognized as a multi-trillion dollar market opportunity in credit investing. This business has grown AUM at a 15% CAGR from 2017 to 2022. Importantly, this growth is diversified across four major scale strategies along the credit spectrum, including corporate credit and special situations, direct lending through their Twin Brook business and structured credit. Angelo Gordon's credit platform is not concentrated within a single product, but rather offers multiple compelling paths for growth as we look ahead. Second, Angelo Gordon's $18 billion real estate platform has also demonstrated strong momentum with AUM growing at a 14% CAGR over the last five years and is very complementary to our existing fast-growing platform. The combination with Angelo Gordon will expand our current real estate presence in Europe, open new geographies with their business in Asia, broaden our product set to include strategies such as net lease and enhance our global sourcing capabilities. Combined, we will have meaningful scale with $38 billion collected real estate AUM as of the end of 2022. We believe this transaction offers multiple ways to accelerate growth. There are clear synergies with our core investment processes and deep combined sector knowledge. We also see numerous opportunities to expand our product set by offering joint new strategies to a much larger client base that has minimal overlap. In addition to attractive growth opportunities, this transaction significantly diversifies TPG. With Angelo Gordon, our strategies outside of private-equity increased as a percentage of our total AUM by 30 percentage points from approximately 20% to half our total AUM. Our institutional client relationships will increase more than 60% from 550 to approximately 900 and we'll have the ability to offer them broad range of products across 27 total strategies. From a cultural standpoint, we've been very focused and deliberate about identifying a firm with a culture and approach to doing business similar to ours. We first met the Angelo Gordon team over a year ago, and since then, has spent considerable amount of time building relationships and getting to know one another. What stood out from the beginning was the close and unique alignment of our two firms. Since our first meetings in early 2022, Angelo Gordon's sustained culture came through and was consistently reinforced in our regular interactions over the last year. The culture at Angelo Gordon is entrepreneurial, collaborative, nimble and respectful. They approach business with high ethical standards and a strong commitment to ownership and accountability. We really enjoyed getting to know them and it's clear that Angelo Gordon's culture is strong and highly complementary to everything we do at TPG. We also share similar histories. TPG and Angelo Gordon were both founded more than 30 years ago and have evolved in similar ways, transitioning from founder-led businesses into leading next-generation firms. Both firms place a strong emphasis on business building and innovation, which is evidenced by the significant growth each of us has experienced in recent years. Between our two firms, we launched 13 new products over the last five years and we've already had extensive conversations about the many types of businesses and strategies we can create together. The Angelo Gordon partners joining us had been at the firm for an average of 13 years and we admire the outstanding business they've build. Importantly, this transaction is structured to create long-term alignment between TPG and Angelo Gordon. Non-founding partners at Angelo Gordon will receive approximately 85% of their consideration in equity with multi-year vesting and lockup provisions. This ensures alignment between our respective teams that are coming together as one firm as well as with our LPs and public shareholders over the long-term. Finally, we both have a deep bench with extremely talented and dedicated employees that we believe the combination will create exciting new opportunities for our combined team going-forward. On slide seven of the investor presentation, you'll see an overview of their favorable long-term dynamics driving growth in credit investing. The markets have been experiencing multi-decade trend of non-bank lenders stepping into fill the void created by the retrenchment of traditional lending sources. At the same time, the continued scaling of private-equity has increased demand for flexible and alternative financing solutions and following a prolonged period of low-interest rates, which drove institutional investors to search for yield, alternative credit has become a core component of institutional portfolio allocations. As a result, credit has been growing at a steady pace, and this is projected to continue well into the future. Slide eight provides a high-level overview of Angelo Gordon. The firm was founded nearly 35 years ago, currently has more than 650 employees including 245 investment professionals located in 12 offices around the world. Angelo Gordon has built a scaled alternatives business with a broad-spectrum of investment strategies across both credit and real-estate. Based on their strong investment track record and focus on innovation over the last five years, they have generated significant growth doubling AUM and fee AUM, $73 billion and $50 billion, respectively. Slide nine highlights the broad spectrum of alternative solutions we'll be able to provide to our clients following the combination of TPG and Angelo Gordon. As you can see in the chart on the left, the combined entity will have a much broader suite of investment strategies across a number of asset classes. In addition, the right slide shows transaction will substantially expand our offerings to target a wider range of risk and return profiles. On slide ten, we highlight the strategic rationale and benefits of this transaction. With a broader spectrum of investment strategies, we'll be even more compelling partner and solution provider for clients globally. Additionally, we will be able to offer customized multi-asset class solutions that include credit, real estate and private-equity. Looking at the client bases of TPG and Angelo Gordon, they are highly complementary. This provides us with a substantial opportunity to expand our respective relationships across a broader range of platforms and strategies. On the closing of this transaction, we expect to have more than 900 combined institutional LP relationships that will be well-diversified by both geography and channel and there's minimal overlap between the two client bases. Only around 10% of our relationships are currently shared. The combined company will benefit from shared intellectual capital including sector and investing expertise, broader deal sourcing and the support of robust infrastructure. We expect this will drive enhanced opportunities for growth, business expansion and product development. Through the broader-based clients and investment strategies, we believe the combined company will be well-positioned to expand our distribution capabilities in high-growth channels such as insurance, high-net worth and retail. We're incredibly excited to bring our businesses together. I want to thank Josh and Adam and the broader teams at both TPG and Angelo Gordon who have put in countless hours over the last year to make this happen. Of course, there is still a tremendous amount of work in front of us to execute on what we've outlined here today. This has been an extraordinary team effort. I know I speak for the entire leadership team of both organizations and taking all of you for your partnership, execution and continued focus. I'll turn the call over to Josh and Adam to make a few comments.\nJosh Baumgarten: It's Jon. I'm very excited to finally get the opportunity to discuss the transaction with you all today. It's been a long year. Today marks a major milestone for Angelo Gordon. It's truly a testament to the team and the business we have built of our nearly 35 year history. I'm very excited to be speaking with you all this morning. I'm going to briefly discuss why this is the opportune time for a combination with TPG and why TPG is the ideal partner for us. As many people know, we're seeing a steady shift in the dynamics across our industry. Assets LP capital is more competitive today than ever before and many LPs want to build larger, strategic relationships with more established best-in-class managers who offer diverse set of process. There is no doubt today that there is a clear competitive advantage in scale and diversification. As a firm, we've reached an inflection point, where we're now routinely competing with some of the largest alt managers in the world on a daily basis. We have big ambitions as the firm's talented professionals who are focused on delivering for our LP, smart and strategic growth is an absolute imperative. We have the brand, the people, and the solution set to continue to grow and drive performance for our clients. But at the same time, we've always had an eye towards strategic opportunities that would expand our capabilities and product offerings. Importantly, our firm is not for sale. However, given what we want to accomplish and after our meetings with our new partners at TPG, we recognize the opportunity and unique power of this combination. And we've had many decisions we made, we'd remain uncompromising on our deep commitment to a firm culture of collaboration and investment philosophy built on fundamental research and downside protection, and an unwavering focus on our clients. We believe the combination with TPG reflects all of these commitments and also deliver significant opportunities for all of our employees. I'm now going to turn the call to my partner, Adam Schwartz.\nAdam Schwartz: Thanks, Josh. Good morning, everyone. So, we believe that this is a transaction that will strongly deliver benefits of scale, diversification and opportunity for both firms. TPG will bring expanded investment capabilities, significant industry and domain expertise and a broad and deep base of LPs, all of which we believe will help accelerate and expand the trajectory of Angelo Gordon. Consistent with Jon's comments, I want to reiterate that we are confident that the combination represents a strong strategic and cultural fit. When the transaction closes, TPG and Angelo Gordon will join to from a leading investment platform with a shared philosophy of firm culture, investment excellence and delivering for clients. And importantly, our firms are entirely aligned on achieving growth through performance. Our investment teams will have the opportunity to leverage TPG's deep industry and sector expertise in areas such as healthcare, technology, Internet and digital media, consumer and business services. And the scale of the combined platform will enhance our access to capital, unlocking new opportunities to expand our deal pipelines and driving performance for our LPs. With the power of our combined platform, we will be able to pursue new solutions for our clients across the risk and return spectrum by leveraging our individual and collective investment capabilities and approaches. Ultimately, this transaction is about growth and capitalizing on our collective momentum in order to do more together. Our priority is focusing on execution to realize the opportunities that we are confident exist, which ultimately will be a positive, as Josh said, for our people and our clients. Josh and I've spent a lot of time with Jon, Jack, Jim, Todd, Anilu and many others at TPG over the last year. It's been a great team effort getting to this result today. We are very excited about this partnership and how our businesses fit together. We couldn't be more enthusiastic about joining together with them to drive growth and create significant long-term value. Jack will now walk through the transaction details and the financial benefits.\nJack Weingart: Thanks, Adam. As you can tell, we're all looking-forward to working together as partners. I'll close out our prepared remarks by reviewing the financial impact of this transaction. We're acquiring Angelo Gordon in a cash and equity transaction valued at approximately $2.7 billion, based on TPG share price as of Friday. This includes approximately $970 million in cash and up to $62.5 million common units and RSUs of TPG, which represents approximately 16% of the equity of the combined company. We believe the transaction has been well structured to ensure a clear alignment of interests. Angelo Gordon's active partners will generally receive 85% of their consideration in equity while the founders of Angelo Gordon will receive 90% of their consideration in cash and 10% in equity. The unvested common units and RSUs that the Angelo Gordon non-Founder partners are receiving will generally vest ratably over a five-year period, with a full lock-up during the first year post-closing. Importantly, a portion of Angelo Gordon's equity consideration will be distributed to its employees, creating broad-based employee ownership. This is similar to the IPO award given to TPG employees when we went public, ensuring everyone who is a shareholder and directly benefits from the growth of the business. This transaction also includes post-closing contingent consideration, which is valued at up to $400 million. This earn-out is based on Angelo Gordon achieving certain fee-related revenue milestones in 2026, and if earned, will pay it out in 2027. In order to receive 100% of the earn-out, Angelo Gordon will need to grow its annual FRR by 16% per annum through 2026 and TPG will have flexibility to determine the cash and equity mix used to fund any earn-out payment due. Consistent with our business model, the transaction then structures the 20% of performance allocations generated by Angelo Gordon funds will flow-through to TPG operating group with public shareholders receiving their customary proportion. Upon closing, Angelo Gordon will become a new significant investing platform within TPG. In terms of management, Angelo Gordon's Co-CEOs, Josh and Adam will become co-managing partners of the platform, reporting directly to Jon. It's expected that Angelo Gordon's other executives and senior management will continue in their current roles upon the closing of the transaction. Finally, a senior Angelo Gordon partner will also join TPG's Board of Directors. Looking briefly at the pro-forma financial impact, as Jon mentioned, we expect this transaction to be mid-to-high single-digit accretive to TPG's FRE and after-tax DE per share in 2024 and that's before any revenue or couple of cost synergies that we may realize. We'll provide more specific financial disclosure around the time of close. But in the meantime, I wanted to provide the following framework. At the end of 2022, Angelo Gordon's fee earning AUM was $50 billion. This FAUM has more than doubled over the past five years growing at a 17% CAGR. The average fee rate for 2022 was approximately 85 basis points to 90 basis points across all real estate and credit funds. Additionally, I would note that several of their core credit products pay fees on drawn capital only. Due to their strong recent fundraising momentum, Angelo Gordon had AUM not yet earning fees of approximately $11 billion at the end of 2022. As they invest this capital, it will flow into FAUM and begin paying management fees. Next, Angelo Gordon has been pursuing an expansion of their FRE margin much like TPG. Given the firm's recent growth and investment in their business, they're earlier in their execution in the process of realizing operating leverage and margin expansion. We expect Angelo Gordon's FRE margin on a standalone basis in 2023 to be in the mid to-high 20s. Post-closing, we expect our combined FRE margins to blend down to the high 30s, creating an opportunity for us to resume our margin expansion, benefiting from operating leverage across a much larger base of fee-related revenue as we integrate and scale the businesses. Finally on PRE, as I mentioned, we're acquiring 20% of historical and go forward carried interest across Angelo Gordon funds and expect to flow this through to TPG shareholders. At the end of 2022 Angelo Gordon had accrued unrealized carried interest of approximately $760 million. So the 20% allocable to TPG shareholders was approximately $150 million. This will be additive to the current TPG balance of $709 million. In terms of funding the cash portion of the acquisition to close, we expect to use our current cash balance and undrawn revolver. Upon completion of the transaction, our leverage will remain conservative and we'll have ample liquidity and significant financial flexibility. Lastly, the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions including Hart-Scott-Rodino, international regulatory approvals and other clients and third-party consents. The transaction was unanimously approved by TPG's Board of Directors and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year. Before I turn the call back over to the operator so we can take your questions, I'd like to echo Jon, Josh and Adam's enthusiasm for this transaction, and thank everyone at TPG and Angelo Gordon for helping us reach this milestone. We look forward to building a great combined business together in the coming years. Ashely, we're ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi, thanks very much.\nJon Winkelried: Hi Glenn.\nGlenn Schorr: Hello. So, I guess I'll go with, thank you for the FRE margin, but I'm getting hit up by some people asking what was FRE? What was DE? What multiple do you feel you're paying for this business you bought? I understand all the synergies. And then, maybe with a 90% cash payout for the founders, maybe talk about any lessons learned from the past experience with Sixth Street and how you went about this transaction and structuring it to keep both sides engaged? Thanks so much.\nJack Weingart: Yeah, I think, Glenn, the intent in providing the roadmap I did on financial information was to give people enough data to kind of calculate what they believe FRE is for the business. We're not disclosing an acquisition multiple, but hopefully the framework helped. And I would add that we feel like we paid a fair value for the business and we feel good about the buy-in price.\nJon Winkelried: Well, I think there's a couple of things as it relates to the structure of the transaction and I guess lessons learned. Importantly, Angelo Gordon is joining the firm as another platform at large, you know how we're structured with respect to the various platforms in the firm and Angelo Gordon is coming into the firm as another significant platform of the firm managed and run consistently with the rest of the platform's governance structure the same, control structure the same and as you might recall, when Sixth Street was part of the platform, was really operating as kind of an independent entity underneath sort of the umbrella. And so it's really, from the very start, it's really being structured in a different way and we're all collectively, ourselves and Angelo Gordon, are enthusiastic about doing that. I think we also structured the consideration in a way where I think as you heard that other than the two founders, the estate of John Angelo and Michael Gordon, the rest of the team that's coming on-board, is coming on-board with about 85%, approximately 85% of the consideration in equity and I think that I can -- I won't speak for my two new partners here and the work here, but they can talk about their desire to own the stock and the desire of the rest of their team own the stock.\nJosh Baumgarten: Yeah, thank you. Yeah, for the non-founding partners, it was very critical in terms of the consideration mix to receive as much equity as they possibly could, for obviously, alignment reasons, but also we all want to contribute and participate alongside the combined growth that we expect to offer the TPG platform. So, equity as part of consideration was absolutely critical to all of us.\nAdam Schwartz: And I would just add that the majority of the consideration is going to the non-founder partners. So the redeeming founders or a minority interest -- were a minority portion of the consideration.\nGlenn Schorr: I appreciate all that. Thanks.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Kenneth Worthington with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAlexander Bernstein: Hi, this is Alex Bernstein on for Ken Worthington. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the transaction. You mentioned the $55 billion in AUM for Angelo Gordon's credit business, can you give us any sort of rough break-out around the size of this perhaps CLO direct lending and structured credit businesses. And then maybe indirectly and specifically, just given the expected big opportunity set there in the market more broadly, can you talk about what proportion of that is sponsor and non-sponsor driven? Thanks so much.\nJosh Baumgarten: Sure, I'm happy to grab that. So, the $55 billion of credit that's broken down broadly, I guess we think about as three significant sectors. About $22.5 million is going to be in corporate credit and multi-strategy. The two biggest components of that would be about $13 billion in our Credit Solutions business, about $8 billion in our performing loan or CLO business. And actually that, as you mentioned, in our lending business, Twin Brook about $18.5 billion in terms of AUM. And then lastly from our structured credit business about $14.2 billion. To your second question on the lending Twin Brook and all of its AUM it's a 100% sponsor-backed. So we are serving borrowers in the lower-middle market generally, sub $25 million EBITDA. But all will be sponsor-backed opportunities.\nJack Weingart: I would say, it's Jack, we agree with your comment that there's real significant opportunity in direct lending area. For those of you who know the Twin Brook brand, it's an excellent, excellent business, focused very sharply on the lower-middle market space as Josh mentioned, lending to companies with below $25 million of EBITDA and we see a real opportunity to scale the business into larger company lending.\nAlexander Bernstein: Super helpful. Thanks a lot.\nJon Winkelried: Thanks.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Hey, it's Craig Siegenthaler. Good morning, Jon, Jack. Hope everyone's doing well and congrats on finding your credit manager.\nJon Winkelried: Thank you.\nCraig Siegenthaler: So, my first one is on your existing portfolios, especially in the capital business. We all know, the economic backdrop is getting a little more challenged. It's also not surprising to see that we're starting to see some defaults emerge across private markets. I wonder how you think about it? Are you expecting to see a larger number of defaults if the economy deteriorates into the second half? And as you construct your portfolios, we have 15 or 20 portfolio companies for fund. How do you plan for defaults in funds and is it common to have one or two in a fund, which of course be offset by multiple stronger performing investments.\nJon Winkelried: I think Todd is going to give you some color on that.\nTodd Sisitsky: Thanks, Craig. I think your point that there are a lot of conflicting signs in the economy is certainly very well taken, and we're spending a lot of time sort of looking not only at results, but leading indicators for companies. I would say that so far, we feel quite good about the performance of our portfolio in US, specifically with the private equity side. So I'll focus on that. And if you look across our private platforms of capital, Asia, growth and impact. Our average LTM growth is sort of mid-20% and that's probably on the high side for the fact that most of our companies are scaled companies. But I think it really speaks to the strategy that we have. We're very sector focused. We focus a lot of time just in a forward-looking way to try and figure out how to make sure we're in the right neighborhoods. And then we spend a lot of time trying to develop some of the interesting proprietary opportunities that Jon went through earlier in the call. So we are cautious about the overall environment in which these companies are operating, but we feel like we've been pretty well served by virtue of where we sit at the spaces we're in and the level of condition we build up in most cases, over many years in studying the space and building relationships with the CEO is just relatively back. To your second question, in the large-scale investment areas that we focus on, which is the vast majority of what we do in private equity, we do not think of it as, we certainly view as a portfolio, but we focus on concentrating in companies and areas we really are -- have conviction about. And we really do not focus on the idea of taking long shot that might end up defaulting. We really want all of our companies to succeed. That's not to say that in retrospect that some won't underperform because that's always the case in any portfolio that they will. But we are not looking for two or three home runs to offset some laggards. Our focus is really trying to generate strong risk-adjusted returns across the portfolio in companies and in spaces where we have deep conviction. And so far, as Jon said, we had a nice -- despite the volatile market, tick up in valuation this quarter. And that really reflects the fact that, as I said earlier, we have very strong underlying growth in the portfolio even through bumpy times.\nJon Winkelried: I would just add to your question that the reason why our two new partners are sitting here next to us is because in this cycle that we're going into whether or not we have recession or not, one thing that's obviously very different than the last kind of reset cycle that we went through is that interest rates now are meaningfully higher, term structure is meaningfully different than it was back in the GFC, when we had essentially near-zero interest rates and refinancing stresses were very different and the realities of that were very different. So we're in a different kind of environment right now and I think that environment creates a lot of opportunity. I mean we have to manage our portfolios on the private-equity side like Todd described and we do that and that's core to our business, but we also foresee a tremendous amount of opportunity, whether that's triggered by default or whether that's just triggered by capital structure re-balancing or refinancing, we expect to see a number of interesting -- we're seeing a number of interesting opportunities across capital structures. So, the Angelo Gordon team obviously is going to create a really nice strategic fit as it relates to capitalizing on those opportunities.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Jon, Todd. Thank you.\nJon Winkelried: Thank you.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBrian Bedell: Hello. Great, thanks, good morning. And also congrats on the acquisition. If I can ask maybe if I could squeeze a two partner and here, just quickly on the closing approvals for international, if you could just touch on which markets and which regulators that would be. And then as we think about the FRE margin profile, again this excludes the synergies, like you said. But how are you thinking about aligning those you know the FRE margin between the two. I guess the AG platform versus TPG is there -- are there easy structural things to eliminate to bring that margin up or is it more of a longer-term project?\nJon Winkelried: Yeah, Brian on the -- let me start with the FRE margin. On the FRE margin, as I mentioned, Angelo Gordon has been expanding their FRE and on a standalone basis, would have seen continued operating leverage as they scale each of the businesses we talked about. They're earlier in that journey. So they are in the high 20s today. We see it as a real opportunity and you've seen our discipline in expanding our FRE margin to around 45% target. On a combined basis, we believe that over the coming years, there is no reason we shouldn't get to a higher number together than we would have by ourselves, with a larger platform scaling over-time. We're not providing a specific target date for an FRE margin until we get a little bit further into the integration of the businesses, but we do see a real opportunity. This is not a transaction that's premised on immediate cost takeout. We see real opportunity from growing our businesses faster together. We'll certainly find some costs, but it's really premised more on faster growth and operating leverage. Brad, I think are you -- can you respond to the regulatory question?\nBradford Berenson: Yeah, I'm happy to Jon. There are a number of foreign regulators from whom we will need to seek approval. We're not anticipating any difficulties or unusual problems with any of them. The one that we expect will take the longest, just based on how transactions are being processed around the world right now is the FCA in the UK, but there are several others given the global nature of our business and Angelo Gordon's business.\nBrian Bedell: Okay, it's great. That's helpful. That's helpful.\nJon Winkelried: That was Brad Berenson, our General Counsel\nBrian Bedell: Sure. Thank you.\nJon Winkelried: Thanks Brian.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMichael Cyprys: Hey, good morning. Congratulations on the deal and thanks for taking the question. Just with Josh and Adam on the line. I was just curious if they wouldn't mind sharing their perspective on what they see as most differentiated with Angelo Gordon in the marketplace versus others, and if they could maybe also elaborate on the approach to sourcing of investments that they take on the credit side? Thank you.\nJosh Baumgarten: I'll start on the credit side and then particularly the last question. From a sourcing perspective, we've taken a very deliberate pivot from our brand over the past couple of years. Traditionally people knew us as a sharp [indiscernible] distressed investor. We since pivoted that more of a partnership approach, but we are doing our best to actively work alongside of the companies private-equity sponsors of asset owners to solve their capital needs and what we've seen in particular over the past two to three years is an explosion in terms of origination as a result. People want to come to us because they know we are trying to work with them across all of our different business lines. And I would say, as Jon mentioned earlier, from an opportunity set perspective, while we're not seeing much in the way the stress in our portfolio. Frankly in markets what we are seeing is a significant increase in terms of origination opportunity that are significantly greater than our capital base today and that's one of the things we're so excited about partnering with TPG is working with them working with their clients to create new solutions for all the opportunity we're seeing. But I would say this partnership approach has yielded massive, massive improvements in terms of our sourcing.\nJon Winkelried: Yeah, let me just add to that. When we first engaged with our new partners at Angelo Gordon, I think one of the things that we were focused on is that if you listen to Josh before describe the distribution of strategies on the credit side across Angelo Gordon, it's clear that they've grown themselves into an approach where they're attacking the credit markets through multiple disciplines. They have direct lending business. They have the opportunistic business. They have structured credit business, multiple, multiple angles in terms of attacking the opportunity. As we got more familiar with the platform, in some respects, it reminded us a little bit of our approach on the private-equity side, where we've grown in a number of different strategies. We never necessarily kind of maxed out for one particular fund or the size of one particular fund. If you remember, when we took people through that at our IPO, but rather we had grown our pools of capital laterally with step-out strategies, trying to take advantage of the ability to grow over-time through multiple vehicles because obviously, none of us know exactly where the flows are going to go or where the real opportunities are going to be and so, it creates a nimbleness in terms of being able to raise capital and also attack the market opportunity. And in the environment that we're in right now. I think it's -- what I think was different about the Angelo Gordon platform relative to other platforms we actually met with because we met with a number is that, it was, it wasn't a monoline business, it wasn't just focusing on one aspect of the market, let's say like the direct lending opportunity. It was focused across the range of opportunities and overtime, as the platform pivoted, as Josh just described, what they did is they invested heavily in their business, they went out and attracted a cross section of new people and new talent. Josh originally came from Blackstone, a number of other people on the platform did. And so, from that -- from the credit, just on the -- just focusing on the credit side, this pivot that Josh mentioned from sort of the distressed world into a kind of a multi-strategy role within credit was something that was very attractive to us and it's differentiated. If you look along -- throughout the market and you say, what are different credit managers doing and who has approached the market in this multi-disciplined approach and who has -- and as a result of that, who has some kind of minimal scale level in terms of the size and scale and kind of balanced in the platform. They're actually not that many managers that had actually successfully done that and they reinvested heavily in their business, just like we did in approaching our IPO. And so obviously that has margin consequences to Jack's point before. But once you hit that point of being able to really scale the platform, which we think we'll be able to do on a combined basis, we have a lot of confidence that we'll be able to accelerate growth.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thank you.\nJon Winkelried: Thank you.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Finian O'Shea with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nFinian O'Shea: Hey, everyone. Good morning and congratulations as well. Can you touch on what Angelo Gordon brings in terms of the retail channel for fundraising? And then also Jack you mentioned that you would work to grow Twin Brook from its lower-middle market orientation to large market. How quickly can that happen? Is that immediate or sort of a multi-year journey? Thank you.\nJack Weingart: Hey, Finian, thanks. Look, do you want to talk about the retail first?\nJosh Baumgarten: Yeah. Sure, just briefly.\nJack Weingart: I mean where you are now?\nJosh Baumgarten: Yeah. On the retail side or retail and intermediary distribution side, it's been a key area of focus for us. We have significant retail exposure in a number of our open-end fund and more recently, increasing our closed-end fund structures. It's actually one of the areas that I think, from a client side perspective that both ourselves and TPG highlighted a real need to lean in there and get more exposure to that channel. I think when we're working our math together very early on.\nAdam Schwartz: I mean, on that topic, the combined brand between the two firms obviously and our ability to deliver product to our retail channel partners is greatly enhanced by this transaction. I mean we are -- I think as you know we're already distributing our private equity products through the channel consistently. Essentially in every capital raise we do, we have a channel partner that's taking us to the market in that. What we don't have is, we don't have more yield-oriented products currently, we obviously know what's been interesting to the market of our floating-rate interest-rate exposure through the loan business et cetera. So we feel like this will give us -- greater importance for us frankly as a channel partner. And so we're excited to expand that part of the platform.\nJack Weingart: Yeah. Well, I would say, since we've been working together for a year now, trying to create this partnership, we've already been talking to each other about new products and new structures to create to be attractive to the channel. So we expect to begin that work relatively quickly. I'd say more broadly on the fundraising side, this has been alluded to, but when you think about the institutional mix, Angelo Gordon's current mix is almost 80% Americas across their businesses and a little over 20% international. As you all know, from the time we spent together, we've built a very significant LTE presence in some of the bigger areas internationally with growing AUM and we think there's real opportunity given the lack of overlap with our LPs to expand faster together on the institutional side as well as the retail side. On your direct lending question, like as I mentioned Twin Brook is very focused on lower-middle market, they've become real differentiated in that area. I think to accomplish a scaling of that business, it's going to be -- it's going to take a little time. We're going to have to raise additional pools of capital focused on other segments of the market, but we strongly believe that Angelo Gordon's got credit infrastructure to support that build-out.\nJon Winkelried: Even on the basis of the business now, by the way, I mean if you look at obviously I don't have to tell anybody about what's going on in the regional bank world and the contraction of credit that's continuing. I mean it's really this year unfortunately, it sort of has shifted into another gear in terms of the contraction of credit, the provision of credit from the traditional banking channels, and that's going be accentuated as a result of the regional banking crisis, that's going to be accentuated for the mid-market to lower-middle market. So, there's just a very large opportunity period for an established brand like Twin Brook in the lending markets. So we intend to be the beneficiaries of that.\nJosh Baumgarten: And just to highlight that, in terms of the responses to that more retail investor base in Twin Brook specifically, we've actually look to diversify our capital structure of that business. So we're actually -- while we might be in the market for our traditional next series fund in the market, we're also raising B, Cs and evergreen pools of capital, specifically because that investor channel is demanding access to ongoing permanent capital vehicles as we've been met there with significant success so far.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Bill Katz with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nWilliam Katz: Okay. Thank you very much for taking the question and congrats as well on the transaction. Just coming back to the opportunity to grow the franchise. I think in your supplement, you talked about high net worth retail and insurance. I was wondering if you can maybe prioritize where you might see the growth first? And then one for Jack just as you think about on the other side of the transaction, what kind of leverage are you comfortable running the franchise at and how would you think about maybe negating some of the stock dilution from the share issuance? Thank you.\nJon Winkelried: Well, let me just touch on the opportunity with respect to additional growth and diversification of capital sourcing. We've talked about this before with everyone in terms of our franchise and our ability to penetrate retail and insurance in particular and I think that one of the reasons that we've been focused on adding a series of new products and new capabilities is that in order to service the insurance market I think we clearly needed to build out our product capabilities. In terms of return profiles and the structural profile of these products. I mean if you look at what's happening in the insurance market, obviously having helping some of the insurers players fund liabilities, it's a mix across an array of products from traditional fixed-income to more structured private debt and fixed-income to some higher returning private-equity opportunities. So the ability to offer a cross section of those products and customize structured solutions for insurance partners is something that we're -- post this transaction, we're in a much stronger position to do. And even prior to this transaction, we've been approach by a number of insurance players that view our -- that view TPG as an attractive partner because of our reputation our history and our global brand. So this really kind of like unlocks from a number of perspectives, our ability to do that. On the retail side, I mean, look, we have -- we've had a product mix at TPG that's been quite appropriate for what you would think of as high-net worth, but probably not mass-affluent and the retail channel. And so this is simply -- this is transformative as it relates to our ability to service that channel with a different type of product array. And also, the other thing that this does for us as well, which we're excited about is that the ability to do some to bring some of our capabilities along with, for instance, the debt origination side of the business. As an example, something like impact and climate where there's a reasonable amount of interest and demand from retail channels and things like impact of this lending products as an example. We have leading I mean we think of ourselves as the leader as it relates to impact and our capabilities across that market and so this gives us again, several other tools, and we should grow into that market with a differentiated product.\nJack Weingart: And Bill, on your on your balance sheet question, as you know, at IPO, we set ourselves up with significant flexibility to accomplish something like this. We had, as I mentioned at the end-of-the quarter and end the first-quarter about six -- little over $600 million of cash on the balance sheet. This transaction will result in us using about $450 million of that cash to bring us down to a normalized cash level of 100 -- between $150 million and $200 million for flexibility. We'll also be dipping into our revolver, $700 million. So we do believe that this transaction creates a step toward a more efficient balance sheet and creates a really efficient use of the capacity we created at IPO. After this, we'll still have pretty modest leverage. And thinking about the revolver, plus our existing balance sheet leverage, it will be relatively modest, kind of call it 1.5 times leverage. So, we continue, post this transaction to have significant flexibility. There is no intent near-term to buy-back stock to offset the dilution, we want to increase our float, not reduce our float in the near-term. And as we mentioned, we're only issuing about 16% of the pro-forma share base. And over time, we'll think about how to continue to use our balance sheet to create growth.\nWilliam Katz: Thank you.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Adam Beatty with UBS. Please go ahead.\nAdam Beatty: Thank you and congratulations. Just wanted to ask about revenue synergies in particular in the historically strong areas for TPG private-equity and growth-oriented investing. Appreciate the very small overlap with Angelo Gordon's existing LPs and just wanted to get your thoughts around how you're thinking about maybe taking some wallet share there. What -- how you would approach that, that incremental opportunity. And also given that you have some flagships still out in the market, wondering if you are expecting any of the Angelo Gordon LPs to maybe participate in some of the fundraising this year? Thank you.\nJon Winkelried: Well, thanks for the question. I guess, yes, yes and yes. I mean. I think that when we got together with our new partners, one of the things that was really interesting, and almost to some extent, surprising, was that we have modest overlap in terms of our LP basis. And I think that presents a real interesting opportunity for us to both -- to introduce one another to important relationships that we both have and we've -- before we did this or before we announced this transaction, I think, you're probably well aware that on the last, I don't know how many earnings calls we've had now, about six. On the last six earnings calls, we've been asked about this strategy on all six in terms of what we were doing to expand our product mix and expand our product offerings and consistent with that, we've probably been asked, since we went public, by most of our LPs, how we were thinking about this part of the market. And we take our LP partnerships incredibly seriously and one of the things that we have as a core objective is to be as strategic partner as we possibly can be with our LP partners and that means holistically providing kind of multiple products, multiple return streams to our LPs. If you're watching what's going on in our market, obviously, generally, there's been a concentration of capital formation from the larger alternative asset management firms in the market where we're providing -- we're engaged with our LPs across multiple strategies, strategic relationships, developing partnerships with LTEs. And so, the inclusion of the Angelo Gordon capabilities across credit, real estate I think are really -- a great benefit to our ability to do that. And we've already been asked by many of our LP partners, we're looking-forward to, once you guys sort of solidify this partnership, we're looking forward to meeting your new partners and exploring opportunities. So that's clearly a big opportunity for us. I can tell you that our combined capital formation groups, which on a combined basis, really powers up our capability there. We already, as you know, we're investing in our Capital Formation and our fundraising capabilities, that's been an area of focus for us. This more than doubles our -- the size of our team. It brings other disciplines that we didn't have and other product knowledge that we didn't have necessarily within our -- within our core team. So it expands our capability to form capital in a meaningful way. So lots of opportunity kind of back and forth between our both of our respective franchises that we think will have a meaningful impact on our ability to accelerate growth.\nJim Coulter: This is Jim Coulter. I'd say, we've already, this morning been in contact with trillions of dollars of capital in our partner group to let them know about this and was very well received. And I would note that we have a history of successfully introducing our LP base to credit platforms in a way that has been highly accretive.\nAdam Beatty: Jon and Jim, thanks very much. Appreciate it.\nJon Winkelried: Thanks\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Brian McKenna from JMP Securities. Please go ahead.\nBrian McKenna: Thanks. Good morning all and congrats on the deal. So, it's clearly been a tough backdrop for fundraising, specifically in private equity. But could you talk about fundraising trends at Angelo Gordon over the past year or so. And then I'm assuming more parts of this business raise capital on a more recurring basis given the mix of AUM. So how should we think about the cadence and consistency of fund raising on a pro-forma basis at TPG longer-term?\nJosh Baumgarten: Sure. I'll start on the credit side. We've actually had really, really solid momentum over the past couple of years. There were about 1,500 new LPs of the firm over the past five years. As it relates to credit specifically, on corporate credit, we successfully raised two vehicles throughout 2022, both of which closed above our target return expectations. We deployed a good amount of capital, but we have significant dry powder there to be prepared to invest in what we think will probably be the next and probably the largest opportunity set in our careers in the credit market going-forward. Twin Brook middle market lending, as I mentioned earlier, we're in the market now for our traditional series of funds. And as announced, also as mentioned, we're changing the capital structure of that business to obviously raising more permanent capital. Permanent capital at Angelo Gordon is $5 billion, $5.5 billion right now. It's something that our investors have been demanding. We expect it to be significantly greater as a proportion of our capital base going forward. But right now we have very solid momentum across our middle-market lending franchise. And then you're going to structured credit, when people talk about private credit. It's interesting, you're talking a lot more about corporate middle-market lending, but structured credit is everything in our world that touches the consumer in all different forms and I would pass it over the next five, 10 years, it will be at least as big as what people refer to as the current private credit market, it's at the most nascent stage right now, we've been in that market for well over a decade. So we expect that we are just scratching the surface and in particular, what happened in March. Banks are exiting this market or changing their cost in this market faster by the day, we expect that to continue and we think we're going to be a significant leader and beneficiary there. So we're just scratching the surface in terms of structured credit and specialty finance. It's a multi-trillion dollar opportunity and again we're one of the few who has been there for well over a decade.\nAdam Schwartz: Real estate side I'll echo the sentiment we're seeing very good support from investors or excited about this vintage for the real-estate opportunity as we're all seeing day to day in the news and so without being able to comment specifically on funds that are in the market, because we are actually in the market on all of our real estate products, we are seeing strong response.\nJack Weingart: Yeah, Brian, I'd say, more -- it's Jack. More generally, as Jon mentioned, one of the things we really found attractive just structurally about Angelo Gordon is the number of different products they have across those credit real estate. There is lot of monoline credit firms out there that have blown up one category and would come if we had gone that direction with much more concentrated risk under single fundraising cycle. In Angelo Gordon's case, they've got multiple well-positioned strategies across most segments of credit and therefore are less reliant upon one single fundraising cycle. And obviously, on a combined basis, that does a lot to diversify our own exposure to single fundraising cycles. And then on the kind of you referred to the always on kind of more continuous nature of fundraising. As Josh has alluded to, I think, Angelo Gordon is relatively early in the establishment of the structures to enable that kind of constant fundraising, but that's one of the real growth opportunities for us together.\nBrian McKenna: Got it. Super helpful. Thank you.\nJack Weingart: Thanks.\nOperator: And we will go next to Luke Mason with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nLuke Mason: Yeah, good morning, and thanks for taking my question. It's just around the fundraising targets and I appreciate the much more challenging environment. I'm just wondering if you had any specifically on funds and more challenged within the flagships. And then, as it relates to the impact platform.\nJon Winkelried: Luke, we can't, sorry, we can't hear you. You're coming through. I think he was asking about quite muffled differentiated among the flagships in terms of you know what's easier or harder to get raised. I think that was the question.\nLuke Mason: Yeah, that was the question. Thanks.\nJon Winkelried: Luke, let's say, relative to the difficult backdrop, among the flagships I talked about, we're making similar progress across all of them, all of them have good investment performance backing the fund raising campaigns and all of them are continuing to see progress towards targets. We just think across -- and so I wouldn't say one blowing out one struggling, they're all doing well relative to a tough backdrop. But we think it's prudent to plan for slightly smaller fund sizes as we think about our cost base and as I mentioned on the call, we still expect in all cases that we're going to see growth versus the prior fund in each business.\nLuke Mason: Thank you.\nJon Winkelried: Thanks.\nOperator: And this concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I would now like to turn the call back over to Gary Stein for additional or closing remarks.\nGary Stein: Great. Thanks, operator. Thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. Please feel free to follow-up with me or Abenie if you have any questions.\nOperator: Thank you. And this concludes today's TPG conference call and webcast. You may now disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jon Winkelried",
            "content": "Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we made a very important announcement. TPG has agreed to acquire Angelo Gordon, a fully-integrated and scaled multi-strategy alternatives platform in credit and real estate with approximately $73 billion in AUM and $50 billion in fee earning AUM at the end of 2022. This transaction is highly compelling and advances our position as a diversified global alternative asset manager. We've been focused on strategic diversification since our IPO and we believe Angelo Gordon, puts us in a strong position to continue delivering growth and scale. We have a lot to cover this morning. So Jack and I will briefly review our quarterly results before discussing the Angelo Gordon transaction in detail. During the quarter, the timing of fundraising and deal activity continue to be impacted by market volatility and increased macro uncertainty. However, we've navigated through similar dynamics in prior cycles and continue to feel very good about our long-term growth trajectory particularly with the addition of Angelo Gordon. We raised $27 billion of capital over the last 12 months and $2 billion in the quarter in a challenging fundraising environment. The $27 billion represents a 9% increase over the last 12 months ending first quarter 2022, while fundraising in the industry was down 11% during the same period. We continue to engage in robust, high-quality conversations with clients around the world. Interest remains strong. The timelines for capital commitments across the industry have been elongated. Similar to what you've already heard from other alternative asset managers, we believe near-term fundraising will remain difficult for the industry and Jack will discuss what this means for our funds. We really don't know how long the remainder of our current flagship campaigns will last, but we'll make thoughtful decisions around the timing of our final closes. As discussed broadly across the industry, deal activity in the first quarter was slow. We deployed $2 billion in the first quarter and $14 billion over the last 12 months. However, we've recently seen a significant pickup in our deal pipelines and our investment committees are very active. TPG's long-term, patient and sector driven approach to investing is well-suited for this environment. We believe the intellectual capital and ecosystems we built around our core themes, along with $43 billion of dry powder, leave us well positioned to capitalize on unique deployment opportunities. This includes an increasing proportion of corporate carve-outs, big privates, our proprietary partnerships, and we recently signed a number of differentiated deals. At TPG Capital, we agreed to carve-out Elite, a provider of financial and practice management solutions for leading law firms from Thomson Reuters Corporations. We also announced the acquisition of OneOncology in partnership with AmerisourceBergen. This is an example of a creative proprietary corporate partnership from our leading healthcare franchise and the transaction includes a unique structure with significant downside protection. In Capital Asia, we announced an investment in Manipal hospitals, the second-largest pan-Indian healthcare services platform out of our current fund after originally investing from TPG Capital Asia VI in 2015. This investment was done alongside the Company's Founder and Temasek, both of whom were eager to bring in TPG for the next leg of value-creation, given our track-record of driving significant growth over the last eight years. Our impact platform continues to deploy capital at a healthy pace. Rise Climate and the Rise Fund recently invested in Palmetto Clean Technology, a fast-growing rooftop solar platform in the US. Rise was also the lead investor in the latest round of funding for Ohmium, a leader in the development and the implementation of hydrogen electrolyzer technology. Across our current funds, we feel very good about our solid portfolio construction in sectors where we have strong thematic conviction and deep expertise. Our portfolios continue to perform well and in aggregate, they appreciated 3% in the first-quarter and 4% over the last 12 months. On an LTM basis, aggregate portfolio company revenue growth across all our platforms was 25%. A low inflationary pressures persist. Aggregate EBITDA margins have remained stable and our companies have been able to effectively manage pricing and costs. Realizations across our platforms were more than $2 billion in the first quarter and $13 billion over the last 12 months. Given the long-dated nature of our capital, we will be very targeted and deliberate around monetizing investments during this part of the cycle. We're prepared for this type of environment in our underwriting and believe now is an opportune time to continue building value and driving growth in our portfolio coverage. Now Jack will spend a few minutes on our financial results. Thanks, Jack. Since our IPO early last year, we've consistently signaled our desire to drive continued growth and diversification through both organic initiatives and strategic transactions. We always seek to build long-term shareholder value and there have been focused on scaling our existing platforms and providing a broader array of high-quality investment solutions to our clients. We believe the Angelo Gordon transaction delivers on these objectives. We've been seeking a platform that we believe will generate strong returns for our limited partners. Angelo Gordon has done that historically, as evidenced by their proven investment track record and their significant recent AUM growth. And we believe they are well-positioned to continue delivering attractive risk-adjusted returns going forward. Assuming TPG and Angelo Gordon have been combined at the end of 2022. We would have had approximately $208 billion of total AUM and $128 billion of fee-earning AUM with approximately 1,800 employees located in 18 cities around the world. We expect this transaction to be mid to high single-digit accretive on an FRE and after tax DE per share basis in 2024 before any revenue or cost synergies. The acquisition of Angelo Gordon with its scale of credit and real estate businesses is directly on-target with our strategic objectives to further diversify and unlock new avenues for growth and innovation in attractive and complementary asset classes. First, Angelo Gordon's $55 billion credit platform brings significant momentum to TPG in what is widely recognized as a multi-trillion dollar market opportunity in credit investing. This business has grown AUM at a 15% CAGR from 2017 to 2022. Importantly, this growth is diversified across four major scale strategies along the credit spectrum, including corporate credit and special situations, direct lending through their Twin Brook business and structured credit. Angelo Gordon's credit platform is not concentrated within a single product, but rather offers multiple compelling paths for growth as we look ahead. Second, Angelo Gordon's $18 billion real estate platform has also demonstrated strong momentum with AUM growing at a 14% CAGR over the last five years and is very complementary to our existing fast-growing platform. The combination with Angelo Gordon will expand our current real estate presence in Europe, open new geographies with their business in Asia, broaden our product set to include strategies such as net lease and enhance our global sourcing capabilities. Combined, we will have meaningful scale with $38 billion collected real estate AUM as of the end of 2022. We believe this transaction offers multiple ways to accelerate growth. There are clear synergies with our core investment processes and deep combined sector knowledge. We also see numerous opportunities to expand our product set by offering joint new strategies to a much larger client base that has minimal overlap. In addition to attractive growth opportunities, this transaction significantly diversifies TPG. With Angelo Gordon, our strategies outside of private-equity increased as a percentage of our total AUM by 30 percentage points from approximately 20% to half our total AUM. Our institutional client relationships will increase more than 60% from 550 to approximately 900 and we'll have the ability to offer them broad range of products across 27 total strategies. From a cultural standpoint, we've been very focused and deliberate about identifying a firm with a culture and approach to doing business similar to ours. We first met the Angelo Gordon team over a year ago, and since then, has spent considerable amount of time building relationships and getting to know one another. What stood out from the beginning was the close and unique alignment of our two firms. Since our first meetings in early 2022, Angelo Gordon's sustained culture came through and was consistently reinforced in our regular interactions over the last year. The culture at Angelo Gordon is entrepreneurial, collaborative, nimble and respectful. They approach business with high ethical standards and a strong commitment to ownership and accountability. We really enjoyed getting to know them and it's clear that Angelo Gordon's culture is strong and highly complementary to everything we do at TPG. We also share similar histories. TPG and Angelo Gordon were both founded more than 30 years ago and have evolved in similar ways, transitioning from founder-led businesses into leading next-generation firms. Both firms place a strong emphasis on business building and innovation, which is evidenced by the significant growth each of us has experienced in recent years. Between our two firms, we launched 13 new products over the last five years and we've already had extensive conversations about the many types of businesses and strategies we can create together. The Angelo Gordon partners joining us had been at the firm for an average of 13 years and we admire the outstanding business they've build. Importantly, this transaction is structured to create long-term alignment between TPG and Angelo Gordon. Non-founding partners at Angelo Gordon will receive approximately 85% of their consideration in equity with multi-year vesting and lockup provisions. This ensures alignment between our respective teams that are coming together as one firm as well as with our LPs and public shareholders over the long-term. Finally, we both have a deep bench with extremely talented and dedicated employees that we believe the combination will create exciting new opportunities for our combined team going-forward. On slide seven of the investor presentation, you'll see an overview of their favorable long-term dynamics driving growth in credit investing. The markets have been experiencing multi-decade trend of non-bank lenders stepping into fill the void created by the retrenchment of traditional lending sources. At the same time, the continued scaling of private-equity has increased demand for flexible and alternative financing solutions and following a prolonged period of low-interest rates, which drove institutional investors to search for yield, alternative credit has become a core component of institutional portfolio allocations. As a result, credit has been growing at a steady pace, and this is projected to continue well into the future. Slide eight provides a high-level overview of Angelo Gordon. The firm was founded nearly 35 years ago, currently has more than 650 employees including 245 investment professionals located in 12 offices around the world. Angelo Gordon has built a scaled alternatives business with a broad-spectrum of investment strategies across both credit and real-estate. Based on their strong investment track record and focus on innovation over the last five years, they have generated significant growth doubling AUM and fee AUM, $73 billion and $50 billion, respectively. Slide nine highlights the broad spectrum of alternative solutions we'll be able to provide to our clients following the combination of TPG and Angelo Gordon. As you can see in the chart on the left, the combined entity will have a much broader suite of investment strategies across a number of asset classes. In addition, the right slide shows transaction will substantially expand our offerings to target a wider range of risk and return profiles. On slide ten, we highlight the strategic rationale and benefits of this transaction. With a broader spectrum of investment strategies, we'll be even more compelling partner and solution provider for clients globally. Additionally, we will be able to offer customized multi-asset class solutions that include credit, real estate and private-equity. Looking at the client bases of TPG and Angelo Gordon, they are highly complementary. This provides us with a substantial opportunity to expand our respective relationships across a broader range of platforms and strategies. On the closing of this transaction, we expect to have more than 900 combined institutional LP relationships that will be well-diversified by both geography and channel and there's minimal overlap between the two client bases. Only around 10% of our relationships are currently shared. The combined company will benefit from shared intellectual capital including sector and investing expertise, broader deal sourcing and the support of robust infrastructure. We expect this will drive enhanced opportunities for growth, business expansion and product development. Through the broader-based clients and investment strategies, we believe the combined company will be well-positioned to expand our distribution capabilities in high-growth channels such as insurance, high-net worth and retail. We're incredibly excited to bring our businesses together. I want to thank Josh and Adam and the broader teams at both TPG and Angelo Gordon who have put in countless hours over the last year to make this happen. Of course, there is still a tremendous amount of work in front of us to execute on what we've outlined here today. This has been an extraordinary team effort. I know I speak for the entire leadership team of both organizations and taking all of you for your partnership, execution and continued focus. I'll turn the call over to Josh and Adam to make a few comments. Hi Glenn. Well, I think there's a couple of things as it relates to the structure of the transaction and I guess lessons learned. Importantly, Angelo Gordon is joining the firm as another platform at large, you know how we're structured with respect to the various platforms in the firm and Angelo Gordon is coming into the firm as another significant platform of the firm managed and run consistently with the rest of the platform's governance structure the same, control structure the same and as you might recall, when Sixth Street was part of the platform, was really operating as kind of an independent entity underneath sort of the umbrella. And so it's really, from the very start, it's really being structured in a different way and we're all collectively, ourselves and Angelo Gordon, are enthusiastic about doing that. I think we also structured the consideration in a way where I think as you heard that other than the two founders, the estate of John Angelo and Michael Gordon, the rest of the team that's coming on-board, is coming on-board with about 85%, approximately 85% of the consideration in equity and I think that I can -- I won't speak for my two new partners here and the work here, but they can talk about their desire to own the stock and the desire of the rest of their team own the stock. Thanks. Thank you. I think Todd is going to give you some color on that. I would just add to your question that the reason why our two new partners are sitting here next to us is because in this cycle that we're going into whether or not we have recession or not, one thing that's obviously very different than the last kind of reset cycle that we went through is that interest rates now are meaningfully higher, term structure is meaningfully different than it was back in the GFC, when we had essentially near-zero interest rates and refinancing stresses were very different and the realities of that were very different. So we're in a different kind of environment right now and I think that environment creates a lot of opportunity. I mean we have to manage our portfolios on the private-equity side like Todd described and we do that and that's core to our business, but we also foresee a tremendous amount of opportunity, whether that's triggered by default or whether that's just triggered by capital structure re-balancing or refinancing, we expect to see a number of interesting -- we're seeing a number of interesting opportunities across capital structures. So, the Angelo Gordon team obviously is going to create a really nice strategic fit as it relates to capitalizing on those opportunities. Thank you. Yeah, Brian on the -- let me start with the FRE margin. On the FRE margin, as I mentioned, Angelo Gordon has been expanding their FRE and on a standalone basis, would have seen continued operating leverage as they scale each of the businesses we talked about. They're earlier in that journey. So they are in the high 20s today. We see it as a real opportunity and you've seen our discipline in expanding our FRE margin to around 45% target. On a combined basis, we believe that over the coming years, there is no reason we shouldn't get to a higher number together than we would have by ourselves, with a larger platform scaling over-time. We're not providing a specific target date for an FRE margin until we get a little bit further into the integration of the businesses, but we do see a real opportunity. This is not a transaction that's premised on immediate cost takeout. We see real opportunity from growing our businesses faster together. We'll certainly find some costs, but it's really premised more on faster growth and operating leverage. Brad, I think are you -- can you respond to the regulatory question? That was Brad Berenson, our General Counsel Thanks Brian. Yeah, let me just add to that. When we first engaged with our new partners at Angelo Gordon, I think one of the things that we were focused on is that if you listen to Josh before describe the distribution of strategies on the credit side across Angelo Gordon, it's clear that they've grown themselves into an approach where they're attacking the credit markets through multiple disciplines. They have direct lending business. They have the opportunistic business. They have structured credit business, multiple, multiple angles in terms of attacking the opportunity. As we got more familiar with the platform, in some respects, it reminded us a little bit of our approach on the private-equity side, where we've grown in a number of different strategies. We never necessarily kind of maxed out for one particular fund or the size of one particular fund. If you remember, when we took people through that at our IPO, but rather we had grown our pools of capital laterally with step-out strategies, trying to take advantage of the ability to grow over-time through multiple vehicles because obviously, none of us know exactly where the flows are going to go or where the real opportunities are going to be and so, it creates a nimbleness in terms of being able to raise capital and also attack the market opportunity. And in the environment that we're in right now. I think it's -- what I think was different about the Angelo Gordon platform relative to other platforms we actually met with because we met with a number is that, it was, it wasn't a monoline business, it wasn't just focusing on one aspect of the market, let's say like the direct lending opportunity. It was focused across the range of opportunities and overtime, as the platform pivoted, as Josh just described, what they did is they invested heavily in their business, they went out and attracted a cross section of new people and new talent. Josh originally came from Blackstone, a number of other people on the platform did. And so, from that -- from the credit, just on the -- just focusing on the credit side, this pivot that Josh mentioned from sort of the distressed world into a kind of a multi-strategy role within credit was something that was very attractive to us and it's differentiated. If you look along -- throughout the market and you say, what are different credit managers doing and who has approached the market in this multi-disciplined approach and who has -- and as a result of that, who has some kind of minimal scale level in terms of the size and scale and kind of balanced in the platform. They're actually not that many managers that had actually successfully done that and they reinvested heavily in their business, just like we did in approaching our IPO. And so obviously that has margin consequences to Jack's point before. But once you hit that point of being able to really scale the platform, which we think we'll be able to do on a combined basis, we have a lot of confidence that we'll be able to accelerate growth. Thank you. Even on the basis of the business now, by the way, I mean if you look at obviously I don't have to tell anybody about what's going on in the regional bank world and the contraction of credit that's continuing. I mean it's really this year unfortunately, it sort of has shifted into another gear in terms of the contraction of credit, the provision of credit from the traditional banking channels, and that's going be accentuated as a result of the regional banking crisis, that's going to be accentuated for the mid-market to lower-middle market. So, there's just a very large opportunity period for an established brand like Twin Brook in the lending markets. So we intend to be the beneficiaries of that. Well, let me just touch on the opportunity with respect to additional growth and diversification of capital sourcing. We've talked about this before with everyone in terms of our franchise and our ability to penetrate retail and insurance in particular and I think that one of the reasons that we've been focused on adding a series of new products and new capabilities is that in order to service the insurance market I think we clearly needed to build out our product capabilities. In terms of return profiles and the structural profile of these products. I mean if you look at what's happening in the insurance market, obviously having helping some of the insurers players fund liabilities, it's a mix across an array of products from traditional fixed-income to more structured private debt and fixed-income to some higher returning private-equity opportunities. So the ability to offer a cross section of those products and customize structured solutions for insurance partners is something that we're -- post this transaction, we're in a much stronger position to do. And even prior to this transaction, we've been approach by a number of insurance players that view our -- that view TPG as an attractive partner because of our reputation our history and our global brand. So this really kind of like unlocks from a number of perspectives, our ability to do that. On the retail side, I mean, look, we have -- we've had a product mix at TPG that's been quite appropriate for what you would think of as high-net worth, but probably not mass-affluent and the retail channel. And so this is simply -- this is transformative as it relates to our ability to service that channel with a different type of product array. And also, the other thing that this does for us as well, which we're excited about is that the ability to do some to bring some of our capabilities along with, for instance, the debt origination side of the business. As an example, something like impact and climate where there's a reasonable amount of interest and demand from retail channels and things like impact of this lending products as an example. We have leading I mean we think of ourselves as the leader as it relates to impact and our capabilities across that market and so this gives us again, several other tools, and we should grow into that market with a differentiated product. Well, thanks for the question. I guess, yes, yes and yes. I mean. I think that when we got together with our new partners, one of the things that was really interesting, and almost to some extent, surprising, was that we have modest overlap in terms of our LP basis. And I think that presents a real interesting opportunity for us to both -- to introduce one another to important relationships that we both have and we've -- before we did this or before we announced this transaction, I think, you're probably well aware that on the last, I don't know how many earnings calls we've had now, about six. On the last six earnings calls, we've been asked about this strategy on all six in terms of what we were doing to expand our product mix and expand our product offerings and consistent with that, we've probably been asked, since we went public, by most of our LPs, how we were thinking about this part of the market. And we take our LP partnerships incredibly seriously and one of the things that we have as a core objective is to be as strategic partner as we possibly can be with our LP partners and that means holistically providing kind of multiple products, multiple return streams to our LPs. If you're watching what's going on in our market, obviously, generally, there's been a concentration of capital formation from the larger alternative asset management firms in the market where we're providing -- we're engaged with our LPs across multiple strategies, strategic relationships, developing partnerships with LTEs. And so, the inclusion of the Angelo Gordon capabilities across credit, real estate I think are really -- a great benefit to our ability to do that. And we've already been asked by many of our LP partners, we're looking-forward to, once you guys sort of solidify this partnership, we're looking forward to meeting your new partners and exploring opportunities. So that's clearly a big opportunity for us. I can tell you that our combined capital formation groups, which on a combined basis, really powers up our capability there. We already, as you know, we're investing in our Capital Formation and our fundraising capabilities, that's been an area of focus for us. This more than doubles our -- the size of our team. It brings other disciplines that we didn't have and other product knowledge that we didn't have necessarily within our -- within our core team. So it expands our capability to form capital in a meaningful way. So lots of opportunity kind of back and forth between our both of our respective franchises that we think will have a meaningful impact on our ability to accelerate growth. Thanks Luke, we can't, sorry, we can't hear you. You're coming through. I think he was asking about quite muffled differentiated among the flagships in terms of you know what's easier or harder to get raised. I think that was the question. Luke, let's say, relative to the difficult backdrop, among the flagships I talked about, we're making similar progress across all of them, all of them have good investment performance backing the fund raising campaigns and all of them are continuing to see progress towards targets. We just think across -- and so I wouldn't say one blowing out one struggling, they're all doing well relative to a tough backdrop. But we think it's prudent to plan for slightly smaller fund sizes as we think about our cost base and as I mentioned on the call, we still expect in all cases that we're going to see growth versus the prior fund in each business. Thanks."

            "content": "It's Jon. I'm very excited to finally get the opportunity to discuss the transaction with you all today. It's been a long year. Today marks a major milestone for Angelo Gordon. It's truly a testament to the team and the business we have built of our nearly 35 year history. I'm very excited to be speaking with you all this morning. I'm going to briefly discuss why this is the opportune time for a combination with TPG and why TPG is the ideal partner for us. As many people know, we're seeing a steady shift in the dynamics across our industry. Assets LP capital is more competitive today than ever before and many LPs want to build larger, strategic relationships with more established best-in-class managers who offer diverse set of process. There is no doubt today that there is a clear competitive advantage in scale and diversification. As a firm, we've reached an inflection point, where we're now routinely competing with some of the largest alt managers in the world on a daily basis. We have big ambitions as the firm's talented professionals who are focused on delivering for our LP, smart and strategic growth is an absolute imperative. We have the brand, the people, and the solution set to continue to grow and drive performance for our clients. But at the same time, we've always had an eye towards strategic opportunities that would expand our capabilities and product offerings. Importantly, our firm is not for sale. However, given what we want to accomplish and after our meetings with our new partners at TPG, we recognize the opportunity and unique power of this combination. And we've had many decisions we made, we'd remain uncompromising on our deep commitment to a firm culture of collaboration and investment philosophy built on fundamental research and downside protection, and an unwavering focus on our clients. We believe the combination with TPG reflects all of these commitments and also deliver significant opportunities for all of our employees. I'm now going to turn the call to my partner, Adam Schwartz. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, for the non-founding partners, it was very critical in terms of the consideration mix to receive as much equity as they possibly could, for obviously, alignment reasons, but also we all want to contribute and participate alongside the combined growth that we expect to offer the TPG platform. So, equity as part of consideration was absolutely critical to all of us. Sure, I'm happy to grab that. So, the $55 billion of credit that's broken down broadly, I guess we think about as three significant sectors. About $22.5 million is going to be in corporate credit and multi-strategy. The two biggest components of that would be about $13 billion in our Credit Solutions business, about $8 billion in our performing loan or CLO business. And actually that, as you mentioned, in our lending business, Twin Brook about $18.5 billion in terms of AUM. And then lastly from our structured credit business about $14.2 billion. To your second question on the lending Twin Brook and all of its AUM it's a 100% sponsor-backed. So we are serving borrowers in the lower-middle market generally, sub $25 million EBITDA. But all will be sponsor-backed opportunities. I'll start on the credit side and then particularly the last question. From a sourcing perspective, we've taken a very deliberate pivot from our brand over the past couple of years. Traditionally people knew us as a sharp [indiscernible] distressed investor. We since pivoted that more of a partnership approach, but we are doing our best to actively work alongside of the companies private-equity sponsors of asset owners to solve their capital needs and what we've seen in particular over the past two to three years is an explosion in terms of origination as a result. People want to come to us because they know we are trying to work with them across all of our different business lines. And I would say, as Jon mentioned earlier, from an opportunity set perspective, while we're not seeing much in the way the stress in our portfolio. Frankly in markets what we are seeing is a significant increase in terms of origination opportunity that are significantly greater than our capital base today and that's one of the things we're so excited about partnering with TPG is working with them working with their clients to create new solutions for all the opportunity we're seeing. But I would say this partnership approach has yielded massive, massive improvements in terms of our sourcing. Yeah. Sure, just briefly. Yeah. On the retail side or retail and intermediary distribution side, it's been a key area of focus for us. We have significant retail exposure in a number of our open-end fund and more recently, increasing our closed-end fund structures. It's actually one of the areas that I think, from a client side perspective that both ourselves and TPG highlighted a real need to lean in there and get more exposure to that channel. I think when we're working our math together very early on. And just to highlight that, in terms of the responses to that more retail investor base in Twin Brook specifically, we've actually look to diversify our capital structure of that business. So we're actually -- while we might be in the market for our traditional next series fund in the market, we're also raising B, Cs and evergreen pools of capital, specifically because that investor channel is demanding access to ongoing permanent capital vehicles as we've been met there with significant success so far. Sure. I'll start on the credit side. We've actually had really, really solid momentum over the past couple of years. There were about 1,500 new LPs of the firm over the past five years. As it relates to credit specifically, on corporate credit, we successfully raised two vehicles throughout 2022, both of which closed above our target return expectations. We deployed a good amount of capital, but we have significant dry powder there to be prepared to invest in what we think will probably be the next and probably the largest opportunity set in our careers in the credit market going-forward. Twin Brook middle market lending, as I mentioned earlier, we're in the market now for our traditional series of funds. And as announced, also as mentioned, we're changing the capital structure of that business to obviously raising more permanent capital. Permanent capital at Angelo Gordon is $5 billion, $5.5 billion right now. It's something that our investors have been demanding. We expect it to be significantly greater as a proportion of our capital base going forward. But right now we have very solid momentum across our middle-market lending franchise. And then you're going to structured credit, when people talk about private credit. It's interesting, you're talking a lot more about corporate middle-market lending, but structured credit is everything in our world that touches the consumer in all different forms and I would pass it over the next five, 10 years, it will be at least as big as what people refer to as the current private credit market, it's at the most nascent stage right now, we've been in that market for well over a decade. So we expect that we are just scratching the surface and in particular, what happened in March. Banks are exiting this market or changing their cost in this market faster by the day, we expect that to continue and we think we're going to be a significant leader and beneficiary there. So we're just scratching the surface in terms of structured credit and specialty finance. It's a multi-trillion dollar opportunity and again we're one of the few who has been there for well over a decade."

            "content": "Thanks, Josh. Good morning, everyone. So, we believe that this is a transaction that will strongly deliver benefits of scale, diversification and opportunity for both firms. TPG will bring expanded investment capabilities, significant industry and domain expertise and a broad and deep base of LPs, all of which we believe will help accelerate and expand the trajectory of Angelo Gordon. Consistent with Jon's comments, I want to reiterate that we are confident that the combination represents a strong strategic and cultural fit. When the transaction closes, TPG and Angelo Gordon will join to from a leading investment platform with a shared philosophy of firm culture, investment excellence and delivering for clients. And importantly, our firms are entirely aligned on achieving growth through performance. Our investment teams will have the opportunity to leverage TPG's deep industry and sector expertise in areas such as healthcare, technology, Internet and digital media, consumer and business services. And the scale of the combined platform will enhance our access to capital, unlocking new opportunities to expand our deal pipelines and driving performance for our LPs. With the power of our combined platform, we will be able to pursue new solutions for our clients across the risk and return spectrum by leveraging our individual and collective investment capabilities and approaches. Ultimately, this transaction is about growth and capitalizing on our collective momentum in order to do more together. Our priority is focusing on execution to realize the opportunities that we are confident exist, which ultimately will be a positive, as Josh said, for our people and our clients. Josh and I've spent a lot of time with Jon, Jack, Jim, Todd, Anilu and many others at TPG over the last year. It's been a great team effort getting to this result today. We are very excited about this partnership and how our businesses fit together. We couldn't be more enthusiastic about joining together with them to drive growth and create significant long-term value. Jack will now walk through the transaction details and the financial benefits. And I would just add that the majority of the consideration is going to the non-founder partners. So the redeeming founders or a minority interest -- were a minority portion of the consideration. I mean, on that topic, the combined brand between the two firms obviously and our ability to deliver product to our retail channel partners is greatly enhanced by this transaction. I mean we are -- I think as you know we're already distributing our private equity products through the channel consistently. Essentially in every capital raise we do, we have a channel partner that's taking us to the market in that. What we don't have is, we don't have more yield-oriented products currently, we obviously know what's been interesting to the market of our floating-rate interest-rate exposure through the loan business et cetera. So we feel like this will give us -- greater importance for us frankly as a channel partner. And so we're excited to expand that part of the platform. Real estate side I'll echo the sentiment we're seeing very good support from investors or excited about this vintage for the real-estate opportunity as we're all seeing day to day in the news and so without being able to comment specifically on funds that are in the market, because we are actually in the market on all of our real estate products, we are seeing strong response."

            "content": "Thanks, Craig. I think your point that there are a lot of conflicting signs in the economy is certainly very well taken, and we're spending a lot of time sort of looking not only at results, but leading indicators for companies. I would say that so far, we feel quite good about the performance of our portfolio in US, specifically with the private equity side. So I'll focus on that. And if you look across our private platforms of capital, Asia, growth and impact. Our average LTM growth is sort of mid-20% and that's probably on the high side for the fact that most of our companies are scaled companies. But I think it really speaks to the strategy that we have. We're very sector focused. We focus a lot of time just in a forward-looking way to try and figure out how to make sure we're in the right neighborhoods. And then we spend a lot of time trying to develop some of the interesting proprietary opportunities that Jon went through earlier in the call. So we are cautious about the overall environment in which these companies are operating, but we feel like we've been pretty well served by virtue of where we sit at the spaces we're in and the level of condition we build up in most cases, over many years in studying the space and building relationships with the CEO is just relatively back. To your second question, in the large-scale investment areas that we focus on, which is the vast majority of what we do in private equity, we do not think of it as, we certainly view as a portfolio, but we focus on concentrating in companies and areas we really are -- have conviction about. And we really do not focus on the idea of taking long shot that might end up defaulting. We really want all of our companies to succeed. That's not to say that in retrospect that some won't underperform because that's always the case in any portfolio that they will. But we are not looking for two or three home runs to offset some laggards. Our focus is really trying to generate strong risk-adjusted returns across the portfolio in companies and in spaces where we have deep conviction. And so far, as Jon said, we had a nice -- despite the volatile market, tick up in valuation this quarter. And that really reflects the fact that, as I said earlier, we have very strong underlying growth in the portfolio even through bumpy times."

            "name": "Jack Weingart",
            "content": "Thanks, Jon. Good morning, everyone. At the end of the first quarter, we had assets under management of $137 billion, which is up 14% year-over-year. This was driven by $27 billion of capital raised and value creation of $3 billion, partially offset by $13 billion of realizations during the last 12 months. Fee earning AUM increased 23% year-over-year to $79 billion at the end of Q1. AUM subject to fee earning growth totaled $13 billion. Before I walk through our financials, I want to call out a few quarter-specific factors that impacted our first quarter results. First, the step-down of our predecessor Asia Funds, which resulted in a one-time step-down in management fees of approximately $9 million during the quarter. Second, an unusually light quarter in our Capital Markets business resulting from the timing of our investment activity. As a reminder, in Q4 of last year, we highlighted that our transaction fees of $45 million were unusually high. We believe that the average of these two quarters or approximately $20 million to $25 million represents a normalized quarter for our transaction fees. Non-core expenses totaled approximately $11 million, primarily related to diligence, legal and accounting work in connection with our acquisition of Angelo Gordon. This resulted in a one-time reduction in our distributable earnings for the quarter, which is reflected through our realized investment income in other line item. The unusually low capital markets fees plus the one-time M&A expenses caused our distributable earnings to be approximately $30 million lower than they would have otherwise been during the quarter. That being said first quarter management fees of $248 million increased 22% compared to the year-ago quarter and were relatively unchanged from Q4 '22. This is due to the one-time step-down of the prior Capital Asia Fund that I just described. Total fee related revenue was $265 million in Q1, a 10% increase year-over-year. While transaction and monitoring fees were late in the quarter, based on the robust transaction pipeline that Jon referenced, we expect capital markets revenue to pick back up to more normalized levels over the balance of the year as our pace of deployment increases. Fee related earnings totaled $99 million in the first quarter up 8% year-over-year. LTM FRE of $461 million, notably, grew 31% compared to the pro-forma last 12 months ended Q1 '22. Our first quarter FRE margin of 37% was impacted by lower capital markets revenue as well as the Asia step-down. Given the inherent fluctuations in capital markets activity quarter-to-quarter and the one-time nature of the step-down, we believe that our run-rate FRE margin is better represented by our margin over the last 12 months, which was 42%. This is in line with our full-year 2022 results and a 335 basis point improvement from the pro-forma last 12 months ended Q1 '22. We continue to be very disciplined around cost management and are working toward our 45% FRE margin target, which we believe we remain on-track to hit by year end for TPG on a standalone basis. I'll touch more on the impact of the integration of Angelo Gordon to our FRE margin in a few minutes. We ended the first quarter with $709 million in net accrued performance allocations, which is a 10% increase from the fourth quarter of '22. After tax distributable earnings for the first-quarter were $88 million or $0.24 per share of Class A common stock and $589 million over the last 12 months. We announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share of Class A common stock, representing 85% of our after tax distributable earnings. Moving onto an update on fundraising. We raised $2 billion in the first quarter, as Jon mentioned and $27 billion over the last 12 months. Notably, in the first quarter, we completed the final close of our highly successful campaign for TTAD II, our technology adjacency fund. We raised an aggregate of $3.4 billion from TTAD II, more than doubling the size of the Inaugural fund. We believe the strength of TPG's brand, client relationships, investment style and returns continue to stand-out among alternative asset managers. As Jon mentioned, we have strong ongoing engagement with both new and existing LPs. However, we set our original flagship fundraising targets under different market conditions. We still expect each fund to grow compared to its predecessor. But in aggregate, they may not grow as much as we previously expected. We've already been managing the business with this in mind as you can see from our cost discipline in the first quarter. To dimensionalize this for you, I would note the following. Across our flagship funds currently in market, TPG 9, Healthcare Partners 2, Asia 8 and Rise 3, our original targets totaled $27.5 billion. While it's too -- still too early to tell what the outcome of each fundraise will be, we're currently managing the business, assuming we'll raise an aggregate of approximately $23 billion to $24 billion, which would represent greater than 10% growth over the aggregate predecessor funds. This implies we would need to raise approximately an incremental $7 billion across these four funds. Based on our strong pipeline of LP engagement, we have confidence in our ability to achieve this outcome. Finally, we continue to make good progress capitalizing our new strategies including TPG Next, Life Sciences and TRECO, our real estate credit funding, as well as preparing to launch our first climate infrastructure fund. We expect to have a further update on these organic initiatives in the coming quarters. Given the significant fundraising headwinds, I want to acknowledge the strong progress we've made in our campaigns and the considerable growth in our fee earning AUM. We have a near-record level of dry powder available to invest in growing pipelines and increasingly interesting opportunities across our platforms. So there's a lot to look forward to. Now I'll turn the call back over to Jon to talk about the Angelo Gordon transaction in greater detail. Thanks, Adam. As you can tell, we're all looking-forward to working together as partners. I'll close out our prepared remarks by reviewing the financial impact of this transaction. We're acquiring Angelo Gordon in a cash and equity transaction valued at approximately $2.7 billion, based on TPG share price as of Friday. This includes approximately $970 million in cash and up to $62.5 million common units and RSUs of TPG, which represents approximately 16% of the equity of the combined company. We believe the transaction has been well structured to ensure a clear alignment of interests. Angelo Gordon's active partners will generally receive 85% of their consideration in equity while the founders of Angelo Gordon will receive 90% of their consideration in cash and 10% in equity. The unvested common units and RSUs that the Angelo Gordon non-Founder partners are receiving will generally vest ratably over a five-year period, with a full lock-up during the first year post-closing. Importantly, a portion of Angelo Gordon's equity consideration will be distributed to its employees, creating broad-based employee ownership. This is similar to the IPO award given to TPG employees when we went public, ensuring everyone who is a shareholder and directly benefits from the growth of the business. This transaction also includes post-closing contingent consideration, which is valued at up to $400 million. This earn-out is based on Angelo Gordon achieving certain fee-related revenue milestones in 2026, and if earned, will pay it out in 2027. In order to receive 100% of the earn-out, Angelo Gordon will need to grow its annual FRR by 16% per annum through 2026 and TPG will have flexibility to determine the cash and equity mix used to fund any earn-out payment due. Consistent with our business model, the transaction then structures the 20% of performance allocations generated by Angelo Gordon funds will flow-through to TPG operating group with public shareholders receiving their customary proportion. Upon closing, Angelo Gordon will become a new significant investing platform within TPG. In terms of management, Angelo Gordon's Co-CEOs, Josh and Adam will become co-managing partners of the platform, reporting directly to Jon. It's expected that Angelo Gordon's other executives and senior management will continue in their current roles upon the closing of the transaction. Finally, a senior Angelo Gordon partner will also join TPG's Board of Directors. Looking briefly at the pro-forma financial impact, as Jon mentioned, we expect this transaction to be mid-to-high single-digit accretive to TPG's FRE and after-tax DE per share in 2024 and that's before any revenue or couple of cost synergies that we may realize. We'll provide more specific financial disclosure around the time of close. But in the meantime, I wanted to provide the following framework. At the end of 2022, Angelo Gordon's fee earning AUM was $50 billion. This FAUM has more than doubled over the past five years growing at a 17% CAGR. The average fee rate for 2022 was approximately 85 basis points to 90 basis points across all real estate and credit funds. Additionally, I would note that several of their core credit products pay fees on drawn capital only. Due to their strong recent fundraising momentum, Angelo Gordon had AUM not yet earning fees of approximately $11 billion at the end of 2022. As they invest this capital, it will flow into FAUM and begin paying management fees. Next, Angelo Gordon has been pursuing an expansion of their FRE margin much like TPG. Given the firm's recent growth and investment in their business, they're earlier in their execution in the process of realizing operating leverage and margin expansion. We expect Angelo Gordon's FRE margin on a standalone basis in 2023 to be in the mid to-high 20s. Post-closing, we expect our combined FRE margins to blend down to the high 30s, creating an opportunity for us to resume our margin expansion, benefiting from operating leverage across a much larger base of fee-related revenue as we integrate and scale the businesses. Finally on PRE, as I mentioned, we're acquiring 20% of historical and go forward carried interest across Angelo Gordon funds and expect to flow this through to TPG shareholders. At the end of 2022 Angelo Gordon had accrued unrealized carried interest of approximately $760 million. So the 20% allocable to TPG shareholders was approximately $150 million. This will be additive to the current TPG balance of $709 million. In terms of funding the cash portion of the acquisition to close, we expect to use our current cash balance and undrawn revolver. Upon completion of the transaction, our leverage will remain conservative and we'll have ample liquidity and significant financial flexibility. Lastly, the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions including Hart-Scott-Rodino, international regulatory approvals and other clients and third-party consents. The transaction was unanimously approved by TPG's Board of Directors and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year. Before I turn the call back over to the operator so we can take your questions, I'd like to echo Jon, Josh and Adam's enthusiasm for this transaction, and thank everyone at TPG and Angelo Gordon for helping us reach this milestone. We look forward to building a great combined business together in the coming years. Ashely, we're ready to take questions. Yeah, I think, Glenn, the intent in providing the roadmap I did on financial information was to give people enough data to kind of calculate what they believe FRE is for the business. We're not disclosing an acquisition multiple, but hopefully the framework helped. And I would add that we feel like we paid a fair value for the business and we feel good about the buy-in price. I would say, it's Jack, we agree with your comment that there's real significant opportunity in direct lending area. For those of you who know the Twin Brook brand, it's an excellent, excellent business, focused very sharply on the lower-middle market space as Josh mentioned, lending to companies with below $25 million of EBITDA and we see a real opportunity to scale the business into larger company lending. Hey, Finian, thanks. Look, do you want to talk about the retail first? I mean where you are now? Yeah. Well, I would say, since we've been working together for a year now, trying to create this partnership, we've already been talking to each other about new products and new structures to create to be attractive to the channel. So we expect to begin that work relatively quickly. I'd say more broadly on the fundraising side, this has been alluded to, but when you think about the institutional mix, Angelo Gordon's current mix is almost 80% Americas across their businesses and a little over 20% international. As you all know, from the time we spent together, we've built a very significant LTE presence in some of the bigger areas internationally with growing AUM and we think there's real opportunity given the lack of overlap with our LPs to expand faster together on the institutional side as well as the retail side. On your direct lending question, like as I mentioned Twin Brook is very focused on lower-middle market, they've become real differentiated in that area. I think to accomplish a scaling of that business, it's going to be -- it's going to take a little time. We're going to have to raise additional pools of capital focused on other segments of the market, but we strongly believe that Angelo Gordon's got credit infrastructure to support that build-out. And Bill, on your on your balance sheet question, as you know, at IPO, we set ourselves up with significant flexibility to accomplish something like this. We had, as I mentioned at the end-of-the quarter and end the first-quarter about six -- little over $600 million of cash on the balance sheet. This transaction will result in us using about $450 million of that cash to bring us down to a normalized cash level of 100 -- between $150 million and $200 million for flexibility. We'll also be dipping into our revolver, $700 million. So we do believe that this transaction creates a step toward a more efficient balance sheet and creates a really efficient use of the capacity we created at IPO. After this, we'll still have pretty modest leverage. And thinking about the revolver, plus our existing balance sheet leverage, it will be relatively modest, kind of call it 1.5 times leverage. So, we continue, post this transaction to have significant flexibility. There is no intent near-term to buy-back stock to offset the dilution, we want to increase our float, not reduce our float in the near-term. And as we mentioned, we're only issuing about 16% of the pro-forma share base. And over time, we'll think about how to continue to use our balance sheet to create growth. Yeah, Brian, I'd say, more -- it's Jack. More generally, as Jon mentioned, one of the things we really found attractive just structurally about Angelo Gordon is the number of different products they have across those credit real estate. There is lot of monoline credit firms out there that have blown up one category and would come if we had gone that direction with much more concentrated risk under single fundraising cycle. In Angelo Gordon's case, they've got multiple well-positioned strategies across most segments of credit and therefore are less reliant upon one single fundraising cycle. And obviously, on a combined basis, that does a lot to diversify our own exposure to single fundraising cycles. And then on the kind of you referred to the always on kind of more continuous nature of fundraising. As Josh has alluded to, I think, Angelo Gordon is relatively early in the establishment of the structures to enable that kind of constant fundraising, but that's one of the real growth opportunities for us together. Thanks."

We declared a dividend of $0.38 per share of Class A common stock, which will be paid on December 2, 2024, for holders of record as of November 14, 2024. I'll now turn the call over to Jon.\nJon Winkelried: Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone. It's been an incredibly busy quarter across the firm. Looking at our financial results and key business drivers, you can see we have strong broad-based momentum. Our investment approach is continuing to drive robust deployment. Our realizations are accelerating, and our capital raising is benefiting from our increased scale and diversification. Through the first three quarters of this year, we have deployed nearly $23 billion of capital, generated realizations of almost $16 billion and raised more than $21 billion across our strategies. Our strong track record in brand and the integrated business we've built across private equity, credit, and real estate are clearly resonating with our clients. At the same time, the environment in which we are operating has shifted. In the broader market, we are seeing a meaningful pickup in activity fueled by the lower cost and greater availability of capital and easing concerns around the economic outlook. Against this macro backdrop, where valuations are rising and equity markets are reaching new all-time highs. We are maintaining our discipline and selectivity in deploying capital in our core sectors and themes. We continue to pick our spots, where we believe we can drive outperformance and generate alpha. In addition, the strong culture of collaboration we've established across TPG has enabled us to unlock proprietary opportunities and deliver differentiated value for our clients. As you'll recall, we were early to identify and execute on an increasingly attractive deployment environment last year. Our investment pace continues to be robust across each of our platforms. We invested $8.6 billion in the quarter, and year-to-date through Q3, our deployment is up more than 30% compared to the same period last year on a pro forma basis. We've recently announced an interesting series of transactions involving our existing portfolio company, DIRECTV. This is a great example of how we are able to uniquely solve the complex needs of our corporate partners by leveraging our full suite of solutions. To briefly summarize, our capital business agreed to take full control of DIRECTV as our corporate partner AT&T was looking to divest its remaining ownership stake to focus on its core business. Simultaneously, DIRECTV agreed to acquire EchoStar's video distribution business DISH subject to the success of an exchange offer proposed to the DISH bondholders that is currently pending. If completed, it would provide significant value to EchoStar by restructuring its balance sheet and reducing its refinancing needs, allowing for greater strategic and operational flexibility, as it looks to enhance its wireless network. As a critical component to this, our credit solutions platform led a $2.5 billion highly bespoke financing to address the imminent debt maturity at DISH and provide the Company with additional liquidity for growth. And lastly, our capital markets team served as a ranger for the DISH financing and drove the syndication and will also separately lead a dividend recap in connection with our full acquisition of DIRECTV. During the quarter, we announced two separate private equity investments in the private wealth sector, which we which is a space we first began investing in nearly two decades ago. Since that time, as the private wealth landscape has evolved, we have continued to follow the industry closely and refine our thematic work. As a result, we identified the independent wealth advisory channel as a primary beneficiary of secular growth trends within the sector. Over the last 18 months, we studied in diligence the space through a shared cross platform team and evaluated a number of opportunities that culminated in two distinct and very interesting transactions. TPG Capital is investing in creative planning, one of the fastest growing full suite financial planning and independent wealth managers in the U.S., and TPG Growth is investing in Homrich Berg, one of the southeast leading fee-only independent wealth managers. Within our impact platform, Rise Climate announced one of the largest deals in Europe so far this year with the \u20ac6.7 billion acquisition of Techem, a European market leader for home decarbonization through its digital sub metering services. Techem is Rise Climate's largest transaction to date with an aggregate equity commitment of over $4 billion and it will be the first investment in our second Rise Climate fund. Techem is interesting for several reasons. One, it demonstrates the large-scale investment opportunities available in climate, which we are able to source given our leadership position in the space. Two, we co underwrote this this deal with GIC, which underscores our ability to provide interesting partnership opportunities to our strategic clients. And three, Techem builds on our thematic focus of enabling homes in Europe to digitize and decarbonize. It follows our investments in [indiscernible], Europe's largest and fastest growing decarbonization platform for single family homes, and Aareon the leading provider of property management software for the European residential real estate industry. Turning to credit, this week marks the one-year anniversary of our acquisition of Angelo Gordon, and we're operating as one firm with the full force of our combined capabilities. The integration has gone as seamlessly and quickly as I could have imagined, and our teams are operating as one and the combination is delivering clear commercial value. We have invested $11.5 billion year to date through the third quarter across our credit businesses, which has already well surpassed full year 2023 credit deployment on a pro form a basis. We deployed $1.7 billion in credit solutions in the quarter, which is a notable step up from our pace in the first half of the year. This includes five private financing transactions within our credit solutions fund, one of which is part of the initial seed portfolio of our new hybrid solution strategy. This also includes strong deployment within our differentiated essential housing strategy, which continues to grow its origination activity and expand the number of homebuilders in the program. In middle market direct lending, following a record first half of gross originations, Twin Brook had another robust quarter and deployed $1.3 billion of capital. The team anticipates a strong fourth quarter driven by a more active M&A environment. And our structured credit business continues to benefit from the changes taking place within the banking sector and the overall market. Our team is focused on two areas in particular. One, areas where new origination is being impaired by banks pulling back, and two, areas where the securitization markets are still adjusting to changes or new dynamics such as opportunities to unlock embedded home equity value. Lastly, in real estate, we invested a total of $1.4 billion in the third quarter and over $4 billion year to date across our equity and debt strategies. Our global real estate franchise has been very active across asset classes and geographies as we continue to capitalize on opportunities in our thematic areas. In TPG Real Estate, we closed the acquisition of Ireland's largest privately-owned homebuilder, which has a 4,600 unit land bank concentrated in the greater Dublin area. We identified Dublin as one of the most attractive residential housing markets in Europe with compelling supply-demand characteristics and a fast-growing population and economy. In our European TPG AG Real Estate business, we signed the acquisition of a Dutch residential portfolio with nearly 3,000 single and multifamily units across approximately 90 sites. This is TPG AG Real Estate's largest transaction since the platform's inception, which we expect to close in the fourth quarter. And the opportunity set for TRECO, our real estate credit strategy, has remained attractive given the pullback in bank lending. We closed three transactions in the third quarter, all with compelling risk-adjusted returns. On the realization front, there's been a notable acceleration of activity in recent months across our portfolios. Our realizations year-to-date through the third quarter of nearly $16 billion have already surpassed our total for the full year 2023 on a pro forma basis. We have signed additional monetizations, that we expect will drive our performance related earnings over the next couple of quarters, which Jack will provide more details on. Turning to fundraising. We've also been very active across the firm. Our capital raising has increased and become more broad-based as a result of our diversification and scale. We raised $10.4 billion in the quarter, bringing total capital raised this year through the third quarter to over $21 billion, which represents considerable progress against our 2024 fundraising targets. I'll share some highlights, and Jack will provide an updated outlook in his remarks. During the quarter, we held a first close for our Rise Climate private equity strategies, including the Global South initiative. We have raised approximately $6 billion in aggregate commitments for the funds and related vehicles, which includes capital that has been committed but will close at a later date. This strong result represents 60% of the $10 billion target we set. We also held a final close in the quarter for GP Solutions or TGS, our GP-led secondary strategy focused on North America and Europe. We raised $1.86 billion for our inaugural fund, which is 25% greater than our target, and we believe this is the largest first time GP-led secondaries fund ever raised. We've committed approximately 50% of the fund across eight investments so far with each performing ahead of our underwriting case. We expect to be back in the market in the middle of 2025 with our next campaign. We were early to identify a structural shift in the market with respect to how GPs are delivering liquidity and built this strategy specifically to address the growing need for this type of capital. Over time, we believe GP Solutions can scale similarly to our other well-established private equity strategies with attractive operating leverage. In the third quarter, we held an additional close for our sixth growth fund. We have now surpassed the halfway mark for this campaign, raising more than $2.1 billion toward our $4 billion target. We also continue to steadily raise capital in our credit platform. In total, we raised nearly $3 billion in the third quarter and $9.5 billion year-to-date. We raised an incremental $780 million in the quarter for Credit Solutions 3, and the balance of the capital was raised spread across middle market direct lending, structured credit, and CLOs. And finally, we're off to a very strong start with our inaugural Rise Climate Transition Infrastructure fund. Since quarter end, prior to the fund's formal launch, we received aggregate commitments from three significant anchor clients totaling $2 billion of which we have closed on $1.3 billion. In addition to Hassana Investment Company, these anchor clients include an Asian sovereign wealth fund and a large U.S. public pension, which highlights the meaningful global demand for this strategy. We've also made substantial progress on several of the revenue synergies we identified in connection with the Angelo Gordon acquisition. We launched our hybrid solution strategy earlier this year, which we stood up as a collaboration between our private equity and credit solutions team to capture attractive middle of the capital structure opportunities that sit between the two existing strategies. Since quarter end, we held the first close for the fund and the strategy is off to a great start with four investments already signed or closed. And I want to circle back to the DIRECTV DISH transaction I mentioned earlier, which collectively provide the best example to date of the kind of synergies we can achieve given the seamless integration of our core franchise strength in private equity, credit solutions, and capital markets. In many respects, this represents the best of TPG, cross platform collaboration, thematic approach, carve out expertise, and focus on providing highly accretive and customized solutions. These are critical capabilities that allow us to access opportunities others cannot. To wrap up, we've held annual meetings across many of our strategies over the last six weeks, which has driven significant engagement and dialogue with our clients around the world. It's clear our clients share our vision for how we are building our franchise and they value the integration we are continuing to develop between our investment platforms and strategies. Most importantly, investment performance is fundamental to everything we do. Our clients recognize and appreciate the strong returns we continue to deliver and the consistency of this performance across our strategies. Now I'll turn it over to Jack to review our financial results.\nJack Weingart: Thanks, Jon, and thank you all for joining us today. As you heard from Jon, momentum continues to be strong across the firm. Our financial performance reflects our increased breadth and expanded capabilities as we continue to successfully execute our growth strategy. I'll begin with a discussion of our financial results for the quarter before moving into our outlook for next year as well as an update on our fundraising expectations. We ended the third quarter with $239 billion of total assets under management, up 76% year-over-year. This was driven by $75 billion of acquired AUM, $30 billion of capital raised and $18 billion of value creation, partially offset by $19 billion of realizations over the last 12 months. Fee-earning AUM increased 80% year-over-year, and we ended the quarter with more than $58 billion of dry powder, which represents 41% of fee-earning AUM. AUM subject to fee earning growth was $26 billion at the end of the quarter, which included $17 billion of AUM not yet earning fees and represents a revenue opportunity of approximately $144 million on an annualized basis. Our fee-related revenue in the third quarter was $460 million, up 43% year-over-year. As expected, management fees were relatively flat versus last quarter due to a decrease in catch-up fees, while we saw continued strong transaction fees of $43 million. We've discussed previously the revenue synergy opportunity of integrating our broker-dealer capabilities into our credit platform, and we began to see the benefits this quarter. As Jon mentioned, we announced the DIRECTV and DISH transactions in September, which included a highly bespoke financing led by our Credit Solutions team to address the near-term maturity for DISH. This is the first transaction within our credit platform where TPG's broker-dealer served as a ranger, and it demonstrates how our cross-firm collaboration can drive meaningful incremental value. While capital markets revenue will vary quarter-to-quarter, we continue to expect long-term growth in this business as we expand our capabilities across platforms and regions, including in our credit platform. We reported fee-related earnings of $191 million for the quarter, up 22% year-over-year. Our FRE margin of 41% in the quarter benefited from strong transaction fees I just mentioned, and we expect a similar margin in the fourth quarter. This would result in our full year 2024 FRE margin exceeding 40%, consistent with our previous guidance. After-tax distributable earnings for the third quarter totaled $189 million or $0.45 per share of Class A common stock, which included $32 million of realized performance allocations. During the quarter, we selectively drove monetizations across our portfolios, including selling down a portion of our remaining ownership in Viking in a $1.1 billion marketed follow-on offering. After a successful IPO earlier this year and strong share price performance and the full sale of clear results out of our growth in RISE portfolios. As we think about our financial performance this year and our outlook for next year, we feel great about the opportunities ahead of us. This year, we've been working hard to put the building blocks in place for our next phase of growth, including completing the integration of Angelo Gordon, scaling the capital base of our credit platforms, raising our next series of climate and other private equity funds and investing in organic growth in areas such as transition infrastructure, real estate credit and secondaries, among others. Most of these building blocks will begin driving meaningful fee-related revenue next year. With this in mind, and I would note the following: on management fees, in the fourth quarter, we expect the revenue growth from new fee-earning AUM to be offset by a reduction in capital and catch-up fees in addition to fee step-downs for our capital funds and our RISE Climate fund. We then expect to see significant growth flowing through beginning in 2025, driven by the building blocks I just discussed. As we progress through the year, our management fees should benefit from the full year impact of our new climate funds, additional broad-based fundraising and increased credit deployment. As I mentioned earlier, we expect continued strength in capital markets revenue, driven by both healthy transaction volumes and the broadening and deepening of our team. Given the growth drivers I highlighted, we expect a general increase next year in our compensation and benefits expense as we continue to invest in our teams to drive this growth, including our distribution capabilities. We also expect to see a seasonal step-up for the quarter in Q1, driven by expenses associated with our annual RSU vesting. As a result, our FRE margin should expand in the back half of next year, as we realize additional operating leverage, and we expect to exit 2025 with an FRE margin approaching the mid-40s. Moving below FRE to performance-related earnings based only on our current pipeline of signed monetizations that have not yet closed. We expect to generate realized performance revenue of approximately $100 million for public shareholders over the next couple of quarters. And as long as the market environment remains accommodating, we believe we'll continue to see increased monetization activity in 2025. Lastly, I want to point out that we expect to incur additional noncore expenses in connection with two integration-related matters. First, we expect to incur approximately $25 million of spend related to the consolidation and integration of our IT platforms. Once in place, we expect this unified platform to generate technology and process savings that will be accretive to FRE. And second, we recently signed a lease for 300,000 square feet of space in the spiral building in Hudson Yards. It's a strategic priority for us to bring together our New York-based employees into one consolidated office space to drive even further collaboration among our teams. The new space will also provide us with important additional room to grow as we continue to expand our business. This will result in overlapping lease expense during the transition, which we will recognize roughly evenly in 2025 and 2026. We currently expect associated noncore expenses of approximately $40 million to $50 million per year in advance of taking occupancy of the new building in late 2026. Like other noncore items, these will be included in our realized investment income and other line item. Turning to our portfolio. We have continued to drive strong investment performance with positive value creation across all our platforms for the third quarter and over the last 12 months. In private equity, the fundamentals across our portfolios remain strong, and we continue to see robust growth that is outpacing the broader market. The portfolio companies with our capital growth and impact platforms grew revenue by approximately 18% over the last 12 months with expanding EBITDA margins. Our PE portfolio in aggregate appreciated over 2% in the third quarter and 10% over the last 12 months. In credit, our portfolio appreciated over 3% during the quarter and approximately 14% over the last 12 months. In middle market direct lending, all of our funds remain at or above their target return ranges as of quarter end. During the quarter, we closed on more than 35 new platform financings, which brings the portfolio to more than 270 companies. Our portfolio continues to perform well and leverage and loan-to-value metrics remain within target ranges and historical norms. Our credit solutions platform also had a strong quarter. Our Credit Solutions funds generated net returns ranging from 3% to 4.5% during the quarter and from 4.5% to 8% year-to-date through September. We remain very active with continued market demand for creative, flexible and bespoke capital from a range of diversified public, private and sponsor-backed companies. In addition, our second essential housing fund generated a net return of 3.5% during the third quarter and 9.6% year-to-date through September. And lastly, our structured credit strategies continue to perform well. Our first private asset-backed credit fund. Net IRR since inception was above its target range at nearly 14% at the end of the third quarter. TPG's real estate portfolio appreciated approximately 2% in the third quarter and 5% over the last 12 months and TPG AG's real estate portfolio appreciated 1% in the third quarter and 2% over the last 12 months. As a result of the continued strength in our portfolio, our net accrued performance balance stepped up to $975 million at the end of the third quarter, driven by $78 million of value creation offset by the $32 million of realized gains I mentioned earlier. Our performance eligible AUM totaled $205 billion or 86% of our total AUM, of which $161 billion is currently generating performance fees. Turning to fundraising. We raised more than $10 billion during the quarter, driven by strong first closes across our climate private equity strategies, the final close for our inaugural GP Solutions fund and continued broad-based credit fundraising. We've raised $9.5 billion in credit through the third quarter, which is nearing the $10 billion target we had set for the year. Given the additional progress we've made across our campaign so far this quarter, we believe we now have line of sight to raising more than $12 billion across our credit strategies for the full year in 2024. Additionally, we've raised $9.4 billion year-to-date through Q3 across our private equity strategies, and we continue to expect our total private equity and infrastructure fundraising in 2024 to exceed the $12.8 billion we raised in 2023. This will include the $1.3 billion in closed anchor commitments from three strategic clients our inaugural Rise Climate Transition Infrastructure fund that Jon discussed and additional progress in our climate private equity campaigns. Finally, we remain on track to launch our semi-liquid private equity vehicle, which we call TPG private equity opportunities or TPOP, early next year. Private wealth continues to be a strategic priority for us. And as we expand our presence in the channel, we believe it will become a meaningful contributor to our capital raising. Overall, our funding momentum is quite strong despite continuing market headwinds. Next year, we expect to be in the market with approximately 25 different products spanning most of our platforms. We expect aggregate capital raising to increase significantly next year driven by the following. Number one, continued scaling of our credit platforms, where we're seeing increasing engagement from our largest LP relationships. Two, additional closes for our climate, private equity and infrastructure campaigns. Three, the completion of our TPG growth campaign. Four, initial closes for our next flagship buyout funds, TPG Capital and Health care partners. Five, initial closes for our next-generation funds in TGS, our GP-led secondaries platform, TTAD, our tech adjacency strategy and RISE our broad-based impact PE fund. And six, increasing penetration of the high net worth market generally, where we're building new products like TPOP and investing in our distribution team. As you can see, there's broad-based momentum across the firm, driven by our expanded and integrated suite of strategies and the culture of collaboration we've established throughout the firm. The pace of activity across the key drivers of our business fundraising, deployment and realizations continues to accelerate, and we look forward to driving additional value for all of our stakeholders. Now I'll turn the call back over to the operator to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAlex Blostein: So maybe just starting with management fees -- just starting with management fees, I heard your guidance for Q4. Obviously, there's a couple of things that are happening with the catch-ups and the step down in the funds. But as you look out into 2025 and Jack, at the end of there, you kind of mentioned a host of different funds that you guys are going to be launching in fundraising for. How do you think about management fee growth outlook into 2025? No one will you guys know about the business so far?\nJack Weingart: Yes. That's a good question, Alex. I mean I tried to give a little bit of picture for that with my comments that this year was really setting the building blocks in place for next year, and we do expect significant management fee growth next year, driven by those building blocks. We're not providing specific FRR growth guidance, but we do expect significant growth kicking in really in Q1 after we have the step downs that I referred to in Q4.\nOperator: We'll go next to Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nGlenn Schorr: And sorry, if this is kind of the same question in a different way. So, lots of growth drivers in there. So, I wanted to see if you could provide bigger than a [indiscernible] type of guidance on what you think the 2025 over the next two or three years of FRE growth could be in the range up? And with that, I'm just curious on the expenses on, you called out two noncore expenses. They seem kind of regular cost of doing business. So, if you could help us think through the why and the impact on FRE.\nJack Weingart: Yes. I think on the latter question, the noncore expenses, I don't think they're really ordinary course business in terms of kind of recurring expenses every year. This move for us into Hudson Yards is a really important strategic move for us, both to consolidate the office space and neither of our current office spaces, the legacy AG space or legacy TPG space had enough room for us to combine our teams and also to create additional room for growth in the business. So, that we consider that to be a onetime move into this new important space. And then the investment in the unified IT platform is really related to bringing both businesses together onto one platform. Again, we do expect that to generate FRE benefits as it ends up being implemented. And the other question was longer term. FRE growth I think Yes, if you assume a significant pickup in FRR growth next year, which should continue because again, one of those one of those building blocks is, as we mentioned on the last call, the launch of TPG 10 and Healthcare Partners III, our big flagship buyout fund. That will be in the market through '26 as well. So, you'll start to see the benefit of that fund scaling and catch-up fees kicking in as we raise the rest of that. So, you should expect reasonable FRR growth next year and the year after. And if you layer on top of that, the FRE margin guidance I gave approaching mid-40s by the end of next year with more upside beyond that. I think you get a reasonably strong picture of FRE growth.\nOperator: We'll go next to Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nCraig Siegenthaler: So, I have an AUM reconciliation question. So, if I look at the AUM roll for it, I see credit inflows were very strong at $2.9 billion, but in the steering AUM roll forward, they were only $100 million. Now, I know the credit business is very sensitive to deployments, but credit deployments were also very strong at $3.9 billion. So, my question is, why is this fee earning AUM inflow in the quarter so small relative to the AUM inflow and also the actual credit deployments?\nJack Weingart: Yes. So, the FAUM role, Craig, is -- and actually, in credit, it's more like $1 billion increase versus the number you talked about. But it's always complicated to do the FAUM rolling credit. There's lots of puts and takes. The way I would summarize it is we obviously capital raising flows into FAUM as we deploy it. But if you look at invested capital of $3.9 billion during the quarter, which was healthy, minus realizations in credit of $1.9 billion, you get kind of net increase of $2 billion. Now within that $2 billion, about $1 billion was not immediately management fee earnings. About $500 million of it was TPG managed co-investment for LPs. Now that's obviously, very strategically important for us. It's what our LPs want to see. It tends to feed into future fund commitments, and we earned capital markets fees in connection with the placement of some of that co-investment. And then the remainder, call it, $400 million or so was leverage-driven deployment, and we -- in some of our funds, we don't earn fees on leverage, we earned on net asset value. But net-net, we do believe we'll continue to see increased deployment in credit throughout the course of the year next year and continue to drive good FAUM growth in that business.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Jack. So, I guess in the earning rollforward, you focus on both the net change in investment activity and the earning capital raised, although that isn't exactly related to what we're seeing in the AUM roll forward. Is that right?\nJack Weingart: Well, the net change in investment activity captures what I talked about, right. We deployed $3.9 billion. So, most capital raised in credit doesn't immediately flow in to AUM. It flows in as you deploy it. So, we focus more on -- when we think about FAUM rolling credit, we focus more on deployed capital minus realizations. And then, those other points and takes that I talked about.\nJon Winkelried: And just to add, that capital raise, I think, is very important because I think as we've been talking about since we acquired Angelo Gordon. It's been important for us in terms of out originating our capital base. I think it's been important for us to build those pools of capital that give us the dry powder to allow us to engage in the transactions that we are able to source in the market. And as Jack said, that builds on the flow and cadence of the investment activity and then builds on itself in terms of our ability to go out and raise additional capital because of the size of the opportunities that we're seeing. And we're seeing that real time now across the whole credit platform. So, there is a very important relationship between capital raise that may not yet be fee paying and deploying that capital, satisfying co-invest interest from our LPs and then going out and then continuing to raise additional commitments from the market in order to steadily size up the capital base. That answer the question, Craig? When you see the $2.9 billion of capital raised in the AUM role, it just not in the FAUM role because most of it doesn't burn fees right away.\nOperator: We'll go next to Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nKen Worthington: On the DISH transaction, can you talk about the impact of the transaction on fee-related revenue sort of next quarter and coming quarters. And I know this is a clearly unusual, very bespoke transaction. But you have now the capabilities with Angelo Gordon. You've demonstrated the expertise we're an improving sort of market for transactions and deals. What is sort of reasonable to expect in terms of more similar type of deals looking forward? Could you -- would you -- is it reasonable to expect like one type of this type transaction a year? Is that outside the realm of reason? What are your thoughts there?\nJack Weingart: Yes. Let me start on that, and Jon will give you more kind of qualitative outlook of additional transactions. It was obviously highly unusual to bring together all these transactions involving an existing portfolio company of ours, but it's not unusual to see complicated transactions like this requiring bespoke capital, and we see a very large pipeline of that. On the FRR impact, the deal actually closed, the DISH loan closed on September 30. So, what that led to was the only FR impact in Q3 was the capital markets fees associated with us acting as agent on that loan. It also means that, that deployed credit capital drove no management fees from the credit business in Q3, but will drive management fees in Q4 since it was supported in the last day of the quarter. So, we do see a pickup in management fees from the credit business, in part driven by that Credit Solutions deployment late in the quarter in Q3.\nJon Winkelried: On the broader question with respect to kind of flow of these types of opportunities. Currently, these types of deals -- these sort of bespoke financing opportunities represent the bulk of our pipeline in terms of where we're focused. The backdrop, I think, as you're aware, is that from a kind of valuation perspective in the market, we're probably at the tightest spreads that we've seen in high yield and leveraged loans since the GFC. I think high-yield spreads are now at like 3.25 and the gap and the differential between CCC and BB is probably as tight as it's been since the GFC. So, we are very focused on these types of opportunities that we're creating across our credit solutions business and from also our private equity franchise. But just to give you an idea, I mean, we sort of track this based on sort of opportunity flow that we're seeing, which is essentially at an all-time high for us. We signed many NDAs with sponsors and companies in terms of working through sort of bespoke transactions. And just to put some numbers on it, we've deployed about $2.5 billion over the last three months in nine different deals and to put the DIRECTV DISH deal in perspective, that of the -- of that amount of capital, about $750 million of it is what we kept internally in our own pools of capital of the $2.5 billion DISH deal. And the remainder of it, we syndicated out to some combination of LPs that we're interested in joining us in that transaction and a couple of other funds that were also brought into the deal. So, if you look at what's happening, there's a significant pipeline. Sponsors are in a position right now, as you know, where it's harder to monetize. Many capital structures are somewhat over levered as a result of coming through the pre-interest rate increasing period. And I think that we're in an environment where we expect to continue to see these kinds of opportunities. We don't -- I mean maybe the way I should describe it is we don't think this is a six-month or nine-month opportunity. We see this as a three- to four-year opportunity in front of us. That's quite substantial. So, I think this will continue to be a core part of our focus from the on the credit side of the house. And I guess the last thing I would say is that it's translating over into this hybrid opportunity that we are raising capital for right now because some of the opportunities are leading to kind of top of the capital structure, senior secured low LTV types of opportunities and some of the opportunities are more middle of the capital structure.\nTodd Sisitsky: Just one thing I'd add at the highest level, which is that this relative to the most place of encounter is the place to celebrate these type of collaborations more than most, you hear that, as Jon described, the DIRECTV deal. And so, we also spend a lot of time both in credit solutions in the credit platform on the private equity side, really trying to think about based on the theme work that we're doing, the sectors that we spend our time and what are the type of things that should happen, not necessarily what's for sale, but what might be interesting. And a lot of those involve thinking across the capital structure. So, it's very hard to predict how often these things come up because, again, you're trying to pitch and create ideas that are not necessarily action what we think are really interesting. But I think this is a really -- this is an environment, and we -- and it's even more exciting in the context of now the combined TPG and legacy AG businesses in which we're spending a lot of time as invest their teams just thinking about what we can do together.\nOperator: We'll go next to Michael Cyprus with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMichael Cyprys: I was hoping you could elaborate a bit on your initiatives to expand reach in the private wealth channel maybe where does the Twin Brook offering stand today just in terms of placements on the platform? How do you see that evolving over the next 12 months? And then you alluded to the new private equity product coming into the retail private wealth channel. So, if you could elaborate on that as well as other potential products you may have in the pipeline to bring out to the marketplace? And maybe talk about a bit how these products you expect it to differentiate from others that are already in the marketplace?\nJim Coulter: Mike, I'll start that and others may have comments as well. Look, it's -- our efforts to expand in private wealth involved, basically two primary factors, one of which is new product creation and the other is expanding distribution. And on expanding distribution that we probably hired, I don't know, half a dozen or a dozen people in the past few months as we continue to build out that team. So, we're actively investing in building out the feet on the street to enhance distribution, and then equally importantly, creating new products that people want to buy in the channel. The first, obviously, you refer to TCAP and that continues to go well. We have continuing flows into that product. That really feeds, as you know, into Twin Brook in particular. So, the next product we intend to launch is the one I mentioned, which is TPOP, the private equity semi-liquid vehicle. And we continue to get very strong positive feedback from our channel partners about that product, you can see pretty clearly that our private equity returns have been differentiated in the industry. And all the channel partners are already aware of that because we've been placing one fund at a time as a commingled fund with the channel partners and their clients have had good experience with us in that regard. Now what we're doing is taking that differentiated return investing all those strategies and putting them together into the product that they want to buy or much of the channel wants to buy. So, we'll be launching that in Q1. We have been seeding that business over time, and we expect to have a really nicely diversified ceded portfolio in place to launch by Q1. Beyond that, there are several additional products that we are considering as next steps. One would be potentially working with our climate funds to offer a more dedicated climate-driven investment product to the channel. Another would be a more broad-based yield-oriented strategy, tapping into more of our investing platform in credit than just Twin Brook and a few other things beyond that. So basically, investing in distribution and investing in new product development.\nJon Winkelried: Yes, I would just add that this remains a very, very important focus for us. The engagement that we're having with the major channel partners has been very substantial. The good news is that I think there is a high level of demand for products from the TPG franchise in the channel, and we're really participating and being invited to the various events with advisers from the various platforms. Since we last spoke, Michael, we're at a Morgan Stanley event. We were out of a Merrill Lynch event. Todd participated in a broader industry conference of private wealth advisers. So, this is very top of mind for us and continuing to build our brand into the channel where we feel like we have a brand that we have a global brand and it's differentiated with respect to our products and our capabilities. So, this will be a growing -- we're confident that our penetration into the channel will continue to grow. And obviously, products like TPOP that are sort of purpose-built for that channel give us the ability to continue to expand our breadth.\nOperator: We'll go next to Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.\nBrennan Hawken: Just wanted to confirm when we think about the near term, is it right that fourth quarter would be a seasonally larger one for fee-related performance revenues? And then on tactically, could you remind us of the rate sensitivity in those FRPRs base rates?\nJack Weingart: The fourth quarter is always a seasonal increase in FRPR. So that's correct. I don't see a lot of rate sensitivity to that number. Obviously, there's some flowing through the -- primarily the Twin book business, but it is accurate to think of that as being a seasonally high quarter for -- in the fourth quarter.\nBrennan Hawken: Okay. And I mean go ahead. Go ahead.\nJack Weingart: I wouldn't expect a lot of rate sensitivity based upon where we see kind of base rates having settled to as impacting that number. Now if we have more substantial further moves in rates, we'll see. But I think based upon the Twin Brook business and how our loans are priced, I think that I wouldn't expect to see a lot of some -- I wouldn't expect to see that as a big impact in the fourth quarter.\nJim Coulter: So, you should expect some pickup in Q4. And obviously, about half of that goes against FRPR compensation expense, but still an increase in kind of net FRE effectively coming through that line item.\nBrennan Hawken: Yes. Got it. To be clear, I wasn't -- I didn't -- I probably worried it poorly. The fourth quarter question was around the seasonality. The rate sensitivity wasn't really truly around the 50 basis points more or like thinking about next year. And if we continue to see rates coming down, how should we be modeling out the puts and takes there?\nGary Stein: Yes, I wouldn't model much sense to be there.\nOperator: We'll go next to Kyle Boyd with KBW. Please go ahead.\nKyle Boyd: Maybe just a question on your insurance strategy you've been evaluating the best path forward there or and potential for strategic partnerships. Just wondering if you could update on your thoughts on control versus capital-light insurance partnerships. And when you're evaluating potential insurance partners, can you just remind us some of the most important aspects of those potential partnerships to TPG, whether that's a certain size partner or a specific underlying growth characteristics that you're looking for?\nJon Winkelried: Yes, sure. I mean I think, first of all, I think the insurance strategy here is multipronged because it's not only about a strategic transaction. One of the things that we've done very proactively since -- we actually closed the Angelo Gordon transaction as we have a collaboration in the coverage of the insurance industry and trying to continue to expand our relationships more broadly as a result of being able to service the insurance company needs on the asset side more holistically, and we've seen good progress on that. If you look across commitments that we've gotten to both our structured credit business as well as our Twin Book franchise. We continue to expand those partnerships with insurance companies and it would be, as you would expect, which is primarily sort of life and annuity businesses as well as, by the way, more broadly even kind of the P&C part of the world. So those relationships continue to expand, and we're feeling very good about the momentum that we have there, and we're going to continue to build that. On the strategic side, we talked about this a lot. We continue to be interested and focused on how to find the right strategic relationship. And I would say that we're very mindful of a couple of things. One is the quality of the platform that we engage with. The key underlying kind of fundamental thesis is that the quality of the platform, its ability to grow, particularly its ability to grow organically, given how expensive it is, how expensive it's become to do things like kind of block acquisitions in the market, which has gotten a lot more competitive. So organic growth capability, I think, is really important. The strength of the underlying platform, their position in the market how they are positioned with respect to growing their book of business as opposed to just competing on price, and so that the quality of the platform is really important, and that's been very front and center for us as we've looked at a number of opportunities. The other thing I would say too is size the size dynamic and how we go about structuring a transaction is also front and center for us because we're mindful of the fact that we feel like our positioning as a firm in terms of being very FRE-centric and growing our fee-based revenues over time continues to be what we think will be our major source of growth. But on the other hand, I think that having some type of strategic relationship, which will give us long-dated or perpetual capital and also allow us to continue to leverage our credit franchise and give us a capital base on which we can continue to explore add-ons to our product capability on the credit side because we have an important source of capital where parts of the credit spectrum will go is really important to us as well. So, we're thinking about it from that perspective. I think anything we do will be very mindful of how a transaction changes the shape of our company from the perspective of how much of our balance sheet we use. I can't tell you exactly what that will be. It will be dependent on the merits of the transaction. But we're very in tune to, I think, how we believe it's important for us to continue to grow in the future and the characteristic of where that growth is being driven from.\nOperator: We'll go next to Mike Brown with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nMike Brown: The FRE margin, it's expected to exit at the mid-40s and in 2025. So, it sounds like you'll be approaching kind of that 45% margin that you've guided to in the past. So, when you think about 2026 and beyond, I assume that kind of mid-40s is not your end game or certainly not the full potential of the platform. So, when you think about that FRE margin longer term, how should we think about that annual margin expansion for, call it, 2026 and beyond?\nJon Winkelried: Yes, you're definitely right, Mike. 45% was never meant to be a long-term target. It was meant to be a stop along the way as we got scale of the AG credit businesses and got back to the margin expansion, we were accomplishing on a stand-alone basis for TPG. So, what I said on the call is we expect to be approaching the mid-40s by the end of next year. I would expect further scaling in 2026 and '27. And eventually, we should be getting to 50% and above 50%, but I'm not putting a time frame on that at this point.\nOperator: This concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I would now like to turn the call back over to Gary Stein for closing remarks.\nGary Stein: Great. Thank you all for joining us this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. And in the meantime, please reach out to the Investor Relations team if you have any questions.\nJon Winkelried: Thanks, everyone.\nJack Weingart: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's TPG's third quarter 2024 earnings call and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jon Winkelried",
            "content": "Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone. It's been an incredibly busy quarter across the firm. Looking at our financial results and key business drivers, you can see we have strong broad-based momentum. Our investment approach is continuing to drive robust deployment. Our realizations are accelerating, and our capital raising is benefiting from our increased scale and diversification. Through the first three quarters of this year, we have deployed nearly $23 billion of capital, generated realizations of almost $16 billion and raised more than $21 billion across our strategies. Our strong track record in brand and the integrated business we've built across private equity, credit, and real estate are clearly resonating with our clients. At the same time, the environment in which we are operating has shifted. In the broader market, we are seeing a meaningful pickup in activity fueled by the lower cost and greater availability of capital and easing concerns around the economic outlook. Against this macro backdrop, where valuations are rising and equity markets are reaching new all-time highs. We are maintaining our discipline and selectivity in deploying capital in our core sectors and themes. We continue to pick our spots, where we believe we can drive outperformance and generate alpha. In addition, the strong culture of collaboration we've established across TPG has enabled us to unlock proprietary opportunities and deliver differentiated value for our clients. As you'll recall, we were early to identify and execute on an increasingly attractive deployment environment last year. Our investment pace continues to be robust across each of our platforms. We invested $8.6 billion in the quarter, and year-to-date through Q3, our deployment is up more than 30% compared to the same period last year on a pro forma basis. We've recently announced an interesting series of transactions involving our existing portfolio company, DIRECTV. This is a great example of how we are able to uniquely solve the complex needs of our corporate partners by leveraging our full suite of solutions. To briefly summarize, our capital business agreed to take full control of DIRECTV as our corporate partner AT&T was looking to divest its remaining ownership stake to focus on its core business. Simultaneously, DIRECTV agreed to acquire EchoStar's video distribution business DISH subject to the success of an exchange offer proposed to the DISH bondholders that is currently pending. If completed, it would provide significant value to EchoStar by restructuring its balance sheet and reducing its refinancing needs, allowing for greater strategic and operational flexibility, as it looks to enhance its wireless network. As a critical component to this, our credit solutions platform led a $2.5 billion highly bespoke financing to address the imminent debt maturity at DISH and provide the Company with additional liquidity for growth. And lastly, our capital markets team served as a ranger for the DISH financing and drove the syndication and will also separately lead a dividend recap in connection with our full acquisition of DIRECTV. During the quarter, we announced two separate private equity investments in the private wealth sector, which we which is a space we first began investing in nearly two decades ago. Since that time, as the private wealth landscape has evolved, we have continued to follow the industry closely and refine our thematic work. As a result, we identified the independent wealth advisory channel as a primary beneficiary of secular growth trends within the sector. Over the last 18 months, we studied in diligence the space through a shared cross platform team and evaluated a number of opportunities that culminated in two distinct and very interesting transactions. TPG Capital is investing in creative planning, one of the fastest growing full suite financial planning and independent wealth managers in the U.S., and TPG Growth is investing in Homrich Berg, one of the southeast leading fee-only independent wealth managers. Within our impact platform, Rise Climate announced one of the largest deals in Europe so far this year with the \u20ac6.7 billion acquisition of Techem, a European market leader for home decarbonization through its digital sub metering services. Techem is Rise Climate's largest transaction to date with an aggregate equity commitment of over $4 billion and it will be the first investment in our second Rise Climate fund. Techem is interesting for several reasons. One, it demonstrates the large-scale investment opportunities available in climate, which we are able to source given our leadership position in the space. Two, we co underwrote this this deal with GIC, which underscores our ability to provide interesting partnership opportunities to our strategic clients. And three, Techem builds on our thematic focus of enabling homes in Europe to digitize and decarbonize. It follows our investments in [indiscernible], Europe's largest and fastest growing decarbonization platform for single family homes, and Aareon the leading provider of property management software for the European residential real estate industry. Turning to credit, this week marks the one-year anniversary of our acquisition of Angelo Gordon, and we're operating as one firm with the full force of our combined capabilities. The integration has gone as seamlessly and quickly as I could have imagined, and our teams are operating as one and the combination is delivering clear commercial value. We have invested $11.5 billion year to date through the third quarter across our credit businesses, which has already well surpassed full year 2023 credit deployment on a pro form a basis. We deployed $1.7 billion in credit solutions in the quarter, which is a notable step up from our pace in the first half of the year. This includes five private financing transactions within our credit solutions fund, one of which is part of the initial seed portfolio of our new hybrid solution strategy. This also includes strong deployment within our differentiated essential housing strategy, which continues to grow its origination activity and expand the number of homebuilders in the program. In middle market direct lending, following a record first half of gross originations, Twin Brook had another robust quarter and deployed $1.3 billion of capital. The team anticipates a strong fourth quarter driven by a more active M&A environment. And our structured credit business continues to benefit from the changes taking place within the banking sector and the overall market. Our team is focused on two areas in particular. One, areas where new origination is being impaired by banks pulling back, and two, areas where the securitization markets are still adjusting to changes or new dynamics such as opportunities to unlock embedded home equity value. Lastly, in real estate, we invested a total of $1.4 billion in the third quarter and over $4 billion year to date across our equity and debt strategies. Our global real estate franchise has been very active across asset classes and geographies as we continue to capitalize on opportunities in our thematic areas. In TPG Real Estate, we closed the acquisition of Ireland's largest privately-owned homebuilder, which has a 4,600 unit land bank concentrated in the greater Dublin area. We identified Dublin as one of the most attractive residential housing markets in Europe with compelling supply-demand characteristics and a fast-growing population and economy. In our European TPG AG Real Estate business, we signed the acquisition of a Dutch residential portfolio with nearly 3,000 single and multifamily units across approximately 90 sites. This is TPG AG Real Estate's largest transaction since the platform's inception, which we expect to close in the fourth quarter. And the opportunity set for TRECO, our real estate credit strategy, has remained attractive given the pullback in bank lending. We closed three transactions in the third quarter, all with compelling risk-adjusted returns. On the realization front, there's been a notable acceleration of activity in recent months across our portfolios. Our realizations year-to-date through the third quarter of nearly $16 billion have already surpassed our total for the full year 2023 on a pro forma basis. We have signed additional monetizations, that we expect will drive our performance related earnings over the next couple of quarters, which Jack will provide more details on. Turning to fundraising. We've also been very active across the firm. Our capital raising has increased and become more broad-based as a result of our diversification and scale. We raised $10.4 billion in the quarter, bringing total capital raised this year through the third quarter to over $21 billion, which represents considerable progress against our 2024 fundraising targets. I'll share some highlights, and Jack will provide an updated outlook in his remarks. During the quarter, we held a first close for our Rise Climate private equity strategies, including the Global South initiative. We have raised approximately $6 billion in aggregate commitments for the funds and related vehicles, which includes capital that has been committed but will close at a later date. This strong result represents 60% of the $10 billion target we set. We also held a final close in the quarter for GP Solutions or TGS, our GP-led secondary strategy focused on North America and Europe. We raised $1.86 billion for our inaugural fund, which is 25% greater than our target, and we believe this is the largest first time GP-led secondaries fund ever raised. We've committed approximately 50% of the fund across eight investments so far with each performing ahead of our underwriting case. We expect to be back in the market in the middle of 2025 with our next campaign. We were early to identify a structural shift in the market with respect to how GPs are delivering liquidity and built this strategy specifically to address the growing need for this type of capital. Over time, we believe GP Solutions can scale similarly to our other well-established private equity strategies with attractive operating leverage. In the third quarter, we held an additional close for our sixth growth fund. We have now surpassed the halfway mark for this campaign, raising more than $2.1 billion toward our $4 billion target. We also continue to steadily raise capital in our credit platform. In total, we raised nearly $3 billion in the third quarter and $9.5 billion year-to-date. We raised an incremental $780 million in the quarter for Credit Solutions 3, and the balance of the capital was raised spread across middle market direct lending, structured credit, and CLOs. And finally, we're off to a very strong start with our inaugural Rise Climate Transition Infrastructure fund. Since quarter end, prior to the fund's formal launch, we received aggregate commitments from three significant anchor clients totaling $2 billion of which we have closed on $1.3 billion. In addition to Hassana Investment Company, these anchor clients include an Asian sovereign wealth fund and a large U.S. public pension, which highlights the meaningful global demand for this strategy. We've also made substantial progress on several of the revenue synergies we identified in connection with the Angelo Gordon acquisition. We launched our hybrid solution strategy earlier this year, which we stood up as a collaboration between our private equity and credit solutions team to capture attractive middle of the capital structure opportunities that sit between the two existing strategies. Since quarter end, we held the first close for the fund and the strategy is off to a great start with four investments already signed or closed. And I want to circle back to the DIRECTV DISH transaction I mentioned earlier, which collectively provide the best example to date of the kind of synergies we can achieve given the seamless integration of our core franchise strength in private equity, credit solutions, and capital markets. In many respects, this represents the best of TPG, cross platform collaboration, thematic approach, carve out expertise, and focus on providing highly accretive and customized solutions. These are critical capabilities that allow us to access opportunities others cannot. To wrap up, we've held annual meetings across many of our strategies over the last six weeks, which has driven significant engagement and dialogue with our clients around the world. It's clear our clients share our vision for how we are building our franchise and they value the integration we are continuing to develop between our investment platforms and strategies. Most importantly, investment performance is fundamental to everything we do. Our clients recognize and appreciate the strong returns we continue to deliver and the consistency of this performance across our strategies. Now I'll turn it over to Jack to review our financial results. And just to add, that capital raise, I think, is very important because I think as we've been talking about since we acquired Angelo Gordon. It's been important for us in terms of out originating our capital base. I think it's been important for us to build those pools of capital that give us the dry powder to allow us to engage in the transactions that we are able to source in the market. And as Jack said, that builds on the flow and cadence of the investment activity and then builds on itself in terms of our ability to go out and raise additional capital because of the size of the opportunities that we're seeing. And we're seeing that real time now across the whole credit platform. So, there is a very important relationship between capital raise that may not yet be fee paying and deploying that capital, satisfying co-invest interest from our LPs and then going out and then continuing to raise additional commitments from the market in order to steadily size up the capital base. That answer the question, Craig? When you see the $2.9 billion of capital raised in the AUM role, it just not in the FAUM role because most of it doesn't burn fees right away. On the broader question with respect to kind of flow of these types of opportunities. Currently, these types of deals -- these sort of bespoke financing opportunities represent the bulk of our pipeline in terms of where we're focused. The backdrop, I think, as you're aware, is that from a kind of valuation perspective in the market, we're probably at the tightest spreads that we've seen in high yield and leveraged loans since the GFC. I think high-yield spreads are now at like 3.25 and the gap and the differential between CCC and BB is probably as tight as it's been since the GFC. So, we are very focused on these types of opportunities that we're creating across our credit solutions business and from also our private equity franchise. But just to give you an idea, I mean, we sort of track this based on sort of opportunity flow that we're seeing, which is essentially at an all-time high for us. We signed many NDAs with sponsors and companies in terms of working through sort of bespoke transactions. And just to put some numbers on it, we've deployed about $2.5 billion over the last three months in nine different deals and to put the DIRECTV DISH deal in perspective, that of the -- of that amount of capital, about $750 million of it is what we kept internally in our own pools of capital of the $2.5 billion DISH deal. And the remainder of it, we syndicated out to some combination of LPs that we're interested in joining us in that transaction and a couple of other funds that were also brought into the deal. So, if you look at what's happening, there's a significant pipeline. Sponsors are in a position right now, as you know, where it's harder to monetize. Many capital structures are somewhat over levered as a result of coming through the pre-interest rate increasing period. And I think that we're in an environment where we expect to continue to see these kinds of opportunities. We don't -- I mean maybe the way I should describe it is we don't think this is a six-month or nine-month opportunity. We see this as a three- to four-year opportunity in front of us. That's quite substantial. So, I think this will continue to be a core part of our focus from the on the credit side of the house. And I guess the last thing I would say is that it's translating over into this hybrid opportunity that we are raising capital for right now because some of the opportunities are leading to kind of top of the capital structure, senior secured low LTV types of opportunities and some of the opportunities are more middle of the capital structure. Yes, I would just add that this remains a very, very important focus for us. The engagement that we're having with the major channel partners has been very substantial. The good news is that I think there is a high level of demand for products from the TPG franchise in the channel, and we're really participating and being invited to the various events with advisers from the various platforms. Since we last spoke, Michael, we're at a Morgan Stanley event. We were out of a Merrill Lynch event. Todd participated in a broader industry conference of private wealth advisers. So, this is very top of mind for us and continuing to build our brand into the channel where we feel like we have a brand that we have a global brand and it's differentiated with respect to our products and our capabilities. So, this will be a growing -- we're confident that our penetration into the channel will continue to grow. And obviously, products like TPOP that are sort of purpose-built for that channel give us the ability to continue to expand our breadth. Yes, sure. I mean I think, first of all, I think the insurance strategy here is multipronged because it's not only about a strategic transaction. One of the things that we've done very proactively since -- we actually closed the Angelo Gordon transaction as we have a collaboration in the coverage of the insurance industry and trying to continue to expand our relationships more broadly as a result of being able to service the insurance company needs on the asset side more holistically, and we've seen good progress on that. If you look across commitments that we've gotten to both our structured credit business as well as our Twin Book franchise. We continue to expand those partnerships with insurance companies and it would be, as you would expect, which is primarily sort of life and annuity businesses as well as, by the way, more broadly even kind of the P&C part of the world. So those relationships continue to expand, and we're feeling very good about the momentum that we have there, and we're going to continue to build that. On the strategic side, we talked about this a lot. We continue to be interested and focused on how to find the right strategic relationship. And I would say that we're very mindful of a couple of things. One is the quality of the platform that we engage with. The key underlying kind of fundamental thesis is that the quality of the platform, its ability to grow, particularly its ability to grow organically, given how expensive it is, how expensive it's become to do things like kind of block acquisitions in the market, which has gotten a lot more competitive. So organic growth capability, I think, is really important. The strength of the underlying platform, their position in the market how they are positioned with respect to growing their book of business as opposed to just competing on price, and so that the quality of the platform is really important, and that's been very front and center for us as we've looked at a number of opportunities. The other thing I would say too is size the size dynamic and how we go about structuring a transaction is also front and center for us because we're mindful of the fact that we feel like our positioning as a firm in terms of being very FRE-centric and growing our fee-based revenues over time continues to be what we think will be our major source of growth. But on the other hand, I think that having some type of strategic relationship, which will give us long-dated or perpetual capital and also allow us to continue to leverage our credit franchise and give us a capital base on which we can continue to explore add-ons to our product capability on the credit side because we have an important source of capital where parts of the credit spectrum will go is really important to us as well. So, we're thinking about it from that perspective. I think anything we do will be very mindful of how a transaction changes the shape of our company from the perspective of how much of our balance sheet we use. I can't tell you exactly what that will be. It will be dependent on the merits of the transaction. But we're very in tune to, I think, how we believe it's important for us to continue to grow in the future and the characteristic of where that growth is being driven from. Yes, you're definitely right, Mike. 45% was never meant to be a long-term target. It was meant to be a stop along the way as we got scale of the AG credit businesses and got back to the margin expansion, we were accomplishing on a stand-alone basis for TPG. So, what I said on the call is we expect to be approaching the mid-40s by the end of next year. I would expect further scaling in 2026 and '27. And eventually, we should be getting to 50% and above 50%, but I'm not putting a time frame on that at this point. Thanks, everyone."

            "content": "Just one thing I'd add at the highest level, which is that this relative to the most place of encounter is the place to celebrate these type of collaborations more than most, you hear that, as Jon described, the DIRECTV deal. And so, we also spend a lot of time both in credit solutions in the credit platform on the private equity side, really trying to think about based on the theme work that we're doing, the sectors that we spend our time and what are the type of things that should happen, not necessarily what's for sale, but what might be interesting. And a lot of those involve thinking across the capital structure. So, it's very hard to predict how often these things come up because, again, you're trying to pitch and create ideas that are not necessarily action what we think are really interesting. But I think this is a really -- this is an environment, and we -- and it's even more exciting in the context of now the combined TPG and legacy AG businesses in which we're spending a lot of time as invest their teams just thinking about what we can do together."

            "name": "Jim Coulter",
            "content": "Mike, I'll start that and others may have comments as well. Look, it's -- our efforts to expand in private wealth involved, basically two primary factors, one of which is new product creation and the other is expanding distribution. And on expanding distribution that we probably hired, I don't know, half a dozen or a dozen people in the past few months as we continue to build out that team. So, we're actively investing in building out the feet on the street to enhance distribution, and then equally importantly, creating new products that people want to buy in the channel. The first, obviously, you refer to TCAP and that continues to go well. We have continuing flows into that product. That really feeds, as you know, into Twin Brook in particular. So, the next product we intend to launch is the one I mentioned, which is TPOP, the private equity semi-liquid vehicle. And we continue to get very strong positive feedback from our channel partners about that product, you can see pretty clearly that our private equity returns have been differentiated in the industry. And all the channel partners are already aware of that because we've been placing one fund at a time as a commingled fund with the channel partners and their clients have had good experience with us in that regard. Now what we're doing is taking that differentiated return investing all those strategies and putting them together into the product that they want to buy or much of the channel wants to buy. So, we'll be launching that in Q1. We have been seeding that business over time, and we expect to have a really nicely diversified ceded portfolio in place to launch by Q1. Beyond that, there are several additional products that we are considering as next steps. One would be potentially working with our climate funds to offer a more dedicated climate-driven investment product to the channel. Another would be a more broad-based yield-oriented strategy, tapping into more of our investing platform in credit than just Twin Brook and a few other things beyond that. So basically, investing in distribution and investing in new product development. So, you should expect some pickup in Q4. And obviously, about half of that goes against FRPR compensation expense, but still an increase in kind of net FRE effectively coming through that line item."
        },
        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Jack Weingart",
            "content": "Thanks, Jon, and thank you all for joining us today. As you heard from Jon, momentum continues to be strong across the firm. Our financial performance reflects our increased breadth and expanded capabilities as we continue to successfully execute our growth strategy. I'll begin with a discussion of our financial results for the quarter before moving into our outlook for next year as well as an update on our fundraising expectations. We ended the third quarter with $239 billion of total assets under management, up 76% year-over-year. This was driven by $75 billion of acquired AUM, $30 billion of capital raised and $18 billion of value creation, partially offset by $19 billion of realizations over the last 12 months. Fee-earning AUM increased 80% year-over-year, and we ended the quarter with more than $58 billion of dry powder, which represents 41% of fee-earning AUM. AUM subject to fee earning growth was $26 billion at the end of the quarter, which included $17 billion of AUM not yet earning fees and represents a revenue opportunity of approximately $144 million on an annualized basis. Our fee-related revenue in the third quarter was $460 million, up 43% year-over-year. As expected, management fees were relatively flat versus last quarter due to a decrease in catch-up fees, while we saw continued strong transaction fees of $43 million. We've discussed previously the revenue synergy opportunity of integrating our broker-dealer capabilities into our credit platform, and we began to see the benefits this quarter. As Jon mentioned, we announced the DIRECTV and DISH transactions in September, which included a highly bespoke financing led by our Credit Solutions team to address the near-term maturity for DISH. This is the first transaction within our credit platform where TPG's broker-dealer served as a ranger, and it demonstrates how our cross-firm collaboration can drive meaningful incremental value. While capital markets revenue will vary quarter-to-quarter, we continue to expect long-term growth in this business as we expand our capabilities across platforms and regions, including in our credit platform. We reported fee-related earnings of $191 million for the quarter, up 22% year-over-year. Our FRE margin of 41% in the quarter benefited from strong transaction fees I just mentioned, and we expect a similar margin in the fourth quarter. This would result in our full year 2024 FRE margin exceeding 40%, consistent with our previous guidance. After-tax distributable earnings for the third quarter totaled $189 million or $0.45 per share of Class A common stock, which included $32 million of realized performance allocations. During the quarter, we selectively drove monetizations across our portfolios, including selling down a portion of our remaining ownership in Viking in a $1.1 billion marketed follow-on offering. After a successful IPO earlier this year and strong share price performance and the full sale of clear results out of our growth in RISE portfolios. As we think about our financial performance this year and our outlook for next year, we feel great about the opportunities ahead of us. This year, we've been working hard to put the building blocks in place for our next phase of growth, including completing the integration of Angelo Gordon, scaling the capital base of our credit platforms, raising our next series of climate and other private equity funds and investing in organic growth in areas such as transition infrastructure, real estate credit and secondaries, among others. Most of these building blocks will begin driving meaningful fee-related revenue next year. With this in mind, and I would note the following: on management fees, in the fourth quarter, we expect the revenue growth from new fee-earning AUM to be offset by a reduction in capital and catch-up fees in addition to fee step-downs for our capital funds and our RISE Climate fund. We then expect to see significant growth flowing through beginning in 2025, driven by the building blocks I just discussed. As we progress through the year, our management fees should benefit from the full year impact of our new climate funds, additional broad-based fundraising and increased credit deployment. As I mentioned earlier, we expect continued strength in capital markets revenue, driven by both healthy transaction volumes and the broadening and deepening of our team. Given the growth drivers I highlighted, we expect a general increase next year in our compensation and benefits expense as we continue to invest in our teams to drive this growth, including our distribution capabilities. We also expect to see a seasonal step-up for the quarter in Q1, driven by expenses associated with our annual RSU vesting. As a result, our FRE margin should expand in the back half of next year, as we realize additional operating leverage, and we expect to exit 2025 with an FRE margin approaching the mid-40s. Moving below FRE to performance-related earnings based only on our current pipeline of signed monetizations that have not yet closed. We expect to generate realized performance revenue of approximately $100 million for public shareholders over the next couple of quarters. And as long as the market environment remains accommodating, we believe we'll continue to see increased monetization activity in 2025. Lastly, I want to point out that we expect to incur additional noncore expenses in connection with two integration-related matters. First, we expect to incur approximately $25 million of spend related to the consolidation and integration of our IT platforms. Once in place, we expect this unified platform to generate technology and process savings that will be accretive to FRE. And second, we recently signed a lease for 300,000 square feet of space in the spiral building in Hudson Yards. It's a strategic priority for us to bring together our New York-based employees into one consolidated office space to drive even further collaboration among our teams. The new space will also provide us with important additional room to grow as we continue to expand our business. This will result in overlapping lease expense during the transition, which we will recognize roughly evenly in 2025 and 2026. We currently expect associated noncore expenses of approximately $40 million to $50 million per year in advance of taking occupancy of the new building in late 2026. Like other noncore items, these will be included in our realized investment income and other line item. Turning to our portfolio. We have continued to drive strong investment performance with positive value creation across all our platforms for the third quarter and over the last 12 months. In private equity, the fundamentals across our portfolios remain strong, and we continue to see robust growth that is outpacing the broader market. The portfolio companies with our capital growth and impact platforms grew revenue by approximately 18% over the last 12 months with expanding EBITDA margins. Our PE portfolio in aggregate appreciated over 2% in the third quarter and 10% over the last 12 months. In credit, our portfolio appreciated over 3% during the quarter and approximately 14% over the last 12 months. In middle market direct lending, all of our funds remain at or above their target return ranges as of quarter end. During the quarter, we closed on more than 35 new platform financings, which brings the portfolio to more than 270 companies. Our portfolio continues to perform well and leverage and loan-to-value metrics remain within target ranges and historical norms. Our credit solutions platform also had a strong quarter. Our Credit Solutions funds generated net returns ranging from 3% to 4.5% during the quarter and from 4.5% to 8% year-to-date through September. We remain very active with continued market demand for creative, flexible and bespoke capital from a range of diversified public, private and sponsor-backed companies. In addition, our second essential housing fund generated a net return of 3.5% during the third quarter and 9.6% year-to-date through September. And lastly, our structured credit strategies continue to perform well. Our first private asset-backed credit fund. Net IRR since inception was above its target range at nearly 14% at the end of the third quarter. TPG's real estate portfolio appreciated approximately 2% in the third quarter and 5% over the last 12 months and TPG AG's real estate portfolio appreciated 1% in the third quarter and 2% over the last 12 months. As a result of the continued strength in our portfolio, our net accrued performance balance stepped up to $975 million at the end of the third quarter, driven by $78 million of value creation offset by the $32 million of realized gains I mentioned earlier. Our performance eligible AUM totaled $205 billion or 86% of our total AUM, of which $161 billion is currently generating performance fees. Turning to fundraising. We raised more than $10 billion during the quarter, driven by strong first closes across our climate private equity strategies, the final close for our inaugural GP Solutions fund and continued broad-based credit fundraising. We've raised $9.5 billion in credit through the third quarter, which is nearing the $10 billion target we had set for the year. Given the additional progress we've made across our campaign so far this quarter, we believe we now have line of sight to raising more than $12 billion across our credit strategies for the full year in 2024. Additionally, we've raised $9.4 billion year-to-date through Q3 across our private equity strategies, and we continue to expect our total private equity and infrastructure fundraising in 2024 to exceed the $12.8 billion we raised in 2023. This will include the $1.3 billion in closed anchor commitments from three strategic clients our inaugural Rise Climate Transition Infrastructure fund that Jon discussed and additional progress in our climate private equity campaigns. Finally, we remain on track to launch our semi-liquid private equity vehicle, which we call TPG private equity opportunities or TPOP, early next year. Private wealth continues to be a strategic priority for us. And as we expand our presence in the channel, we believe it will become a meaningful contributor to our capital raising. Overall, our funding momentum is quite strong despite continuing market headwinds. Next year, we expect to be in the market with approximately 25 different products spanning most of our platforms. We expect aggregate capital raising to increase significantly next year driven by the following. Number one, continued scaling of our credit platforms, where we're seeing increasing engagement from our largest LP relationships. Two, additional closes for our climate, private equity and infrastructure campaigns. Three, the completion of our TPG growth campaign. Four, initial closes for our next flagship buyout funds, TPG Capital and Health care partners. Five, initial closes for our next-generation funds in TGS, our GP-led secondaries platform, TTAD, our tech adjacency strategy and RISE our broad-based impact PE fund. And six, increasing penetration of the high net worth market generally, where we're building new products like TPOP and investing in our distribution team. As you can see, there's broad-based momentum across the firm, driven by our expanded and integrated suite of strategies and the culture of collaboration we've established throughout the firm. The pace of activity across the key drivers of our business fundraising, deployment and realizations continues to accelerate, and we look forward to driving additional value for all of our stakeholders. Now I'll turn the call back over to the operator to take your questions. Yes. That's a good question, Alex. I mean I tried to give a little bit of picture for that with my comments that this year was really setting the building blocks in place for next year, and we do expect significant management fee growth next year, driven by those building blocks. We're not providing specific FRR growth guidance, but we do expect significant growth kicking in really in Q1 after we have the step downs that I referred to in Q4. Yes. I think on the latter question, the noncore expenses, I don't think they're really ordinary course business in terms of kind of recurring expenses every year. This move for us into Hudson Yards is a really important strategic move for us, both to consolidate the office space and neither of our current office spaces, the legacy AG space or legacy TPG space had enough room for us to combine our teams and also to create additional room for growth in the business. So, that we consider that to be a onetime move into this new important space. And then the investment in the unified IT platform is really related to bringing both businesses together onto one platform. Again, we do expect that to generate FRE benefits as it ends up being implemented. And the other question was longer term. FRE growth I think Yes, if you assume a significant pickup in FRR growth next year, which should continue because again, one of those one of those building blocks is, as we mentioned on the last call, the launch of TPG 10 and Healthcare Partners III, our big flagship buyout fund. That will be in the market through '26 as well. So, you'll start to see the benefit of that fund scaling and catch-up fees kicking in as we raise the rest of that. So, you should expect reasonable FRR growth next year and the year after. And if you layer on top of that, the FRE margin guidance I gave approaching mid-40s by the end of next year with more upside beyond that. I think you get a reasonably strong picture of FRE growth. Yes. So, the FAUM role, Craig, is -- and actually, in credit, it's more like $1 billion increase versus the number you talked about. But it's always complicated to do the FAUM rolling credit. There's lots of puts and takes. The way I would summarize it is we obviously capital raising flows into FAUM as we deploy it. But if you look at invested capital of $3.9 billion during the quarter, which was healthy, minus realizations in credit of $1.9 billion, you get kind of net increase of $2 billion. Now within that $2 billion, about $1 billion was not immediately management fee earnings. About $500 million of it was TPG managed co-investment for LPs. Now that's obviously, very strategically important for us. It's what our LPs want to see. It tends to feed into future fund commitments, and we earned capital markets fees in connection with the placement of some of that co-investment. And then the remainder, call it, $400 million or so was leverage-driven deployment, and we -- in some of our funds, we don't earn fees on leverage, we earned on net asset value. But net-net, we do believe we'll continue to see increased deployment in credit throughout the course of the year next year and continue to drive good FAUM growth in that business. Well, the net change in investment activity captures what I talked about, right. We deployed $3.9 billion. So, most capital raised in credit doesn't immediately flow in to AUM. It flows in as you deploy it. So, we focus more on -- when we think about FAUM rolling credit, we focus more on deployed capital minus realizations. And then, those other points and takes that I talked about. Yes. Let me start on that, and Jon will give you more kind of qualitative outlook of additional transactions. It was obviously highly unusual to bring together all these transactions involving an existing portfolio company of ours, but it's not unusual to see complicated transactions like this requiring bespoke capital, and we see a very large pipeline of that. On the FRR impact, the deal actually closed, the DISH loan closed on September 30. So, what that led to was the only FR impact in Q3 was the capital markets fees associated with us acting as agent on that loan. It also means that, that deployed credit capital drove no management fees from the credit business in Q3, but will drive management fees in Q4 since it was supported in the last day of the quarter. So, we do see a pickup in management fees from the credit business, in part driven by that Credit Solutions deployment late in the quarter in Q3. The fourth quarter is always a seasonal increase in FRPR. So that's correct. I don't see a lot of rate sensitivity to that number. Obviously, there's some flowing through the -- primarily the Twin book business, but it is accurate to think of that as being a seasonally high quarter for -- in the fourth quarter. I wouldn't expect a lot of rate sensitivity based upon where we see kind of base rates having settled to as impacting that number. Now if we have more substantial further moves in rates, we'll see. But I think based upon the Twin Brook business and how our loans are priced, I think that I wouldn't expect to see a lot of some -- I wouldn't expect to see that as a big impact in the fourth quarter. Thank you."

Looking briefly at our results for the second quarter we produced a GAAP net loss attributable to TPG, Inc. of $14 million and after-tax distributable earnings of $207 million or $0.49 per share of Class A common stock. We declared a dividend of $0.42 per share of Class A common stock which will be paid on August 30, 2024, to holders of record as of August 16, 2024. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jon.\nJon Winkelried: Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone. Our strong second quarter results highlight the significant momentum across our business as we continue to successfully scale and diversify. We finished the quarter with $229 billion and $137 billion of fee-earning AUM across more than 30 strategies in private equity, credit and real estate. Over the course of last year, we drove a step function change in our growth profile and earnings power as a result of both organic and inorganic activity. Our firm is capitalizing on our expanded breadth. And in my comments today, I\u2019ll focus on two areas in particular. First, the strong momentum in our capital raises across our diversified product base; and second, our active pace of deployment and the differentiated deal types we are sourcing across our platforms. In addition to these two topics before I hand the call over to Jack, I\u2019ll also touch on the significant market volatility that\u2019s been taking place over the last few trading days. Beginning with fund phone raising, we raised $6.3 billion in the second quarter. Importantly, over 70% of this capital or $4.5 billion was raised across our credit strategies. During the quarter, we held the final close for Twin Brooks\u2019 fifth drawdown fund. In total, we raised $3.9 billion, which exceeded our original fund target and is 13% larger than its predecessor. This successful outcome was driven by Twin Brooks\u2019 strong investment track record and differentiated focus on sponsor-backed lower middle market companies as investors seek to complement and diversify their exposure to the U.S. direct lending market. In addition to receiving strong support from existing clients, Twin Brook meaningfully expanded its investor base globally, particularly in Asia, and increased diversification towards sovereign wealth funds as well as multinational insurance companies in Europe and Japan. This campaign is a strong indicator of the power of our platform and the cross-selling opportunity in front of us. We are also raising capital through other vehicles to accommodate investors across the broader Twin Brook platform as we continue to out-originate our capital base. This includes standing up of new SMAs and strategic partnerships with our as well as through evergreen structures and our non-traded BDC, TCAP. TCAP continues to raise capital at a steady pace and ended the quarter with $2.5 billion of total AUM. Currently, TCAP is being distributed by two of the largest warehouses in the U.S., and we expect the third to be added by the end of this quarter. Turning briefly to our Credit Solutions platform. During the quarter, we raised approximately $2 billion including $1.1 billion for the first closing of Credit Solutions 3. We also held additional closes for Essential Housing 3, bringing the total capital raised for the fund to $1.3 billion at the end of the second quarter. Looking to the rest of the year, we expect our robust fundraising momentum to continue, led by our Rise climate franchise. Last quarter, we stated that we expect our impact platform to achieve $35 billion of AUM within 2 years and we believe that we\u2019re tracking ahead of plan on that objective. In our Climate private equity strategy, we are seeing strong support from both existing and new clients. We are holding our first close for Rise Climate 2 this quarter and expect to announce a strong start to that campaign on our next call. We continue to target an aggregate of $10 billion across this fund and the Global South initiative and we expect the majority of the capital to be raised in 2024. Additionally, we expect to hold a close before year-end for our first RISE climate transition infrastructure fund. In May, we announced a $1.5 billion strategic partnership with Hassana Investment Company, a substantial portion of which will anchor our infrastructure fund, and we are in active dialogue with other LPs to provide additional anchor capital. Our leadership position in climate investing is a powerful differentiator that enables us to organically expand into adjacent asset classes with significant growth potential, such as infrastructure. As you can see, our fundraising momentum continues to ramp and is well diversified across our business. Similarly, our deployment pace remains robust. We invested $7.6 billion of capital in the second quarter and more than $35 billion over the last 12 months on a pro forma basis, including TPG AG. I\u2019ll spend a moment on TPG Capital to illustrate the interesting ways we are deploying capital through our proprietary and distinctive sourcing approach. Over the last 12 months, TPG Capital has announced or completed 9 investments with an aggregate equity commitment of nearly $7 billion that resulted from long-standing C-level relationships within our core thematic areas. More than half of this capital was invested into deals that were either a complex corporate carve-out or create a partnership. TPG has a long and successful history of unlocking value and driving growth through these types of differentiated deals. I also want to highlight our activity in Europe, which is a high priority region for us. Our President, Todd Sisitsky just returned after spending 6 weeks there working closely with our teams to further build on our strong investment momentum, client relationships and franchise in the region. Over the last few months, we have announced or closed several interesting transactions in Europe and our pipeline remains strong. For example, in the second quarter, TPG Capital announced the \u20ac3.9 billion carve-out of Aareon, a leading provider of SaaS solutions for the European property industry from Aareal Bank in Germany. This investment represents an attractive opportunity to accelerate Aareon\u2019s growth as a stand-alone company and a resilient but fragmented market. Turning to TPG growth. In the quarter, we closed the proprietary acquisition of Untitled Entertainment, a leading Hollywood talent management firm. Untitled will be part of a newly formed platform that will leverage our deep experience investing in media and entertainment to acquire and build a diversified global business focused on talent management and representation. Our Rise and Rise Climate funds continue to deploy capital at a steady pace given our differentiated position as the partner-of-choice in the impact space. Since quarter end, we have already signed or closed 4 additional transactions with an aggregate equity commitment of approximately $800 million. Rise recently led an investment of over $200 million into Food Smart, a leading U.S. telenutrition provider and food benefits management platform. Additionally, Rise Climate agreed to acquire Olympus Terminals a large-scale renewable fuels logistics provider in California. Olympus plays a critical role in the decarbonization value chain and represents our focus on investing in companies enabling the energy transition. Turning to our real estate strategies, over the last few years, we have been anticipating substantial stress in the system to drive attractive investment opportunities, so we were purposely patient in our approach to capital deployment. Since mid-2023, we have seen a significant increase in investment activity, acquiring a number of distinctive high-quality assets from sellers in need of liquidity, with combined dry powder of $14 billion across our real estate businesses, we expect to lean into the growing number of interesting opportunities we are sourcing in our core areas of focus. We invested $1.2 billion in the quarter, and I\u2019ll share some brief highlights. Within TPG Real Estate, during the quarter, we completed investments in 2 office-to-residential conversions in New York City. In aggregate, we acquired the properties at a significant discount to their prior basis, and we\u2019re working with best-in-class partners to execute these conversions. TPG AG\u2019s European real estate business has also been capitalizing on this environment, including investing in a mixed-use property in Berlin, several Swedish logistics assets and a homebuilding platform in the U.K. Each transaction was off market and bilaterally negotiated with highly-motivated sellers. Our TPG AG real estate sourcing model, which leverages hundreds of operating partner relationships across local markets, continues to demonstrate its unique value proposition. Finally, within credit, we deployed $4.5 billion across our strategies in the second quarter. Twin Brook, our direct lending business continued its strong investment pace in the quarter, bringing total gross originations in the first half of the year to a record $4.8 billion. This exceeds Twin Brook\u2019s prior first half gross origination record by more than $1 billion. Twin Brook is a leader in lending to lower middle market private equity-backed companies, and 100% of Twin Brook\u2019s loans are senior secured first lien with financial covenants. Twin Brook has generated attractive net returns of 11% since inception with an annualized loss rate of only 1 basis point. During the second quarter, our Credit Solutions platform deployed approximately $900 million of capital primarily through our proprietary essential housing business. Notably, essential housing, which provides land financing to leading homebuilders has seen substantial origination volume. We closed on $1.8 billion of project value across 67 projects with 9 homebuilders during the first 2.5 months of the current funds investment period. Within our Credit Solutions funds, given our flexible mandate, we continue to monetize our public positions and are currently evaluating the largest pipeline of private investment opportunities since the strategy was launched. We are actively working to partner with a range of public and private companies with various needs for bespoke private capital solutions. Finally, we continue to see growing client demand from specialty private credit, given the desire to diversify exposure away from corporate credit into more non-correlated risk. During the quarter, our structured credit platform deployed $1.9 billion across a diverse array of consumer, specialty and mortgage finance transactions. Most notably, our asset-based credit fund completed its first investment in Australia demonstrating the global reach of this business. Overall, given the breadth of capabilities within our credit business, we are well positioned to continue to accelerate growth as evidenced by our fundraising momentum, deployment pace and investment pipelines. Each of these strategies is currently out originating its capital base. So we see a significant opportunity to scale them through a combination of raising additional capital and driving further product innovation. Continuing with this theme, innovation is the cornerstone of our ability to grow the firm. Looking at a 5-year period from the beginning of 2021 to the end of 2025, we expect we will have raised approximately $40 billion during this time frame across new strategies, pro forma for TPG AG. This includes growing our Rise Climate franchise and expanding into infrastructure, leveraging our real estate footprint across asset classes and geographies, including Japan, scaling our GP-led secondaries business and broadening our credit platform. Our proven ability to innovate is even more powerful across our well-diversified platform, which provides many new avenues for organic growth. Before I turn the call over to Jack, I\u2019d like to comment briefly on the current market backdrop. Based on the market correction we\u2019ve all witnessed over the last few days, it seems likely we have entered a new period of increased volatility, marked by more imminent interest rate cuts and heightened geopolitical risks. Although the markets have clearly become far more volatile since late last week, it\u2019s not yet clear how this may impact the underlying economy. We are fundamental investors and from our perspective, the fundamentals we look at every day remain reasonably strong. We have experienced many market cycles during our careers, and we know periods of market dislocation create compelling investment opportunities. We\u2019ve been preparing for an environment like this and we are well positioned with $53 billion of long-dated capital available to invest across our private equity, credit and real estate platforms. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Jack to review our financial results.\nJack Weingart: Thank you, John, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We ended the second quarter with $229 billion of total assets under management, up 65% year-over-year. This was driven by $75 billion of acquired AUM from Angelo Gordon, $23 billion of capital raised and $11 billion of value creation, partially offset by $17 billion of realizations over the last 12 months. Fee-earning AUM increased 74% year-over-year to $137 billion, and we ended the quarter with more than $53 billion of dry powder, representing 39% of fee-earning AUM. We also had AUM subject to fee-earning growth of $25 billion at the end of the quarter. This includes $16 billion of AUM not yet earning fees, which increased 17% sequentially and as a result of the strong fundraising progress we made across our credit businesses this quarter. Our fee-related revenue in the second quarter was $459 million, up 61% year-over-year, primarily driven by the acquisition of Angelo Gordon. In addition to the contribution from TPG AG on a stand-alone basis, TPG grew fee-related revenue 13% organically year-over-year. Our Q2 FRR included management fees of $413 million and continued strong transaction fees of $34 million. Following a strong first half of the year, we expect capital markets revenue to be more muted in the third quarter due to deal-specific factors. As we look to the end of the year, we expect capital markets activity to accelerate into 2025 and as our new investment pipeline remains strong, and we begin to see the benefits of integrating our broker-dealer capabilities into our credit platform. We reported fee-related earnings of $201 million for the second quarter, up 60% year-over-year. Our FRE margin of 44% in the quarter was above trend as we benefited from incremental catch-up fees, strong transaction fees and lower-than-expected cash compensation due in part to the timing of hiring. As we\u2019ve indicated previously, we continue to expect our full year FRE margin to exceed 40% in 2024 and expand in 2025 as we benefit from increased credit deployment and the activation of several new funds, most notably our second rise climate fund. After-tax distributable earnings for the second quarter totaled $207 million or $0.49 per share of Class A common stock. This included $26 million of realized performance allocations, which was largely driven by credit and real estate. Although exit activity remains muted for the industry and for TPG and has been slower to recover compared to deployment, we\u2019re actively evaluating monetization opportunities across all of our portfolios. Our realized investment income and other line item in the second quarter included $5 million of non-core expenses related to Angelo Gordon, which declined from $8 million last quarter as we continue to make progress on our integration work streams. We expect our integration expenses to remain at around this reduced level through the balance of the year. Turning to our non-GAAP balance sheet, TPG remains well capitalized with moderate leverage and ample liquidity. We ended the second quarter with $330 million of cash and cash equivalents and $1.2 billion of undrawn capacity on our revolver, providing us with significant flexibility to continue investing in growth. Our net accrued performance balance stepped up to $929 million at the end of the second quarter. Our performance eligible AUM totaled $198 billion or 86% of our total AUM, of which $158 billion is currently generating performance fees. Our investment portfolio has continued to perform well with positive value creation across all of our platforms for the second quarter and over the last 12 months. Our private equity portfolio, which includes our capital growth and impact platforms, grew revenue by 18% over the last 12 months, and margins have remained stable as inflationary pressures have moderated. Our private equity strategy is characterized by deeply thematic growth-oriented investing, where we believe we can inflect growth in our portfolio of companies that will outpace any potential multiple compression. This disciplined approach has resulted in significant strength and durability against a volatile macro backdrop over the last 24 to 36 months. And our PE portfolio appreciated approximately 2% in the second quarter and 7% over the last 12 months. Turning to credit, our portfolio appreciated approximately 3% in the quarter and 14% over the last 12 months. In Middle Market Direct Lending, all of our funds were at or above their target return ranges as of quarter-end. Overall, our portfolio of more than 260 companies continues to perform well with strong revenue growth and cash flow generation and no realized losses in the quarter. At the end of the quarter, our weighted average loan-to-value at close was 41%, which is consistent with historical levels. In Credit Solutions, as spreads have tightened, the team has continued to aggressively monetize public positions across the portfolios and crystallize gains. We\u2019re now pivoting into private transactions where we believe there is a more attractive return profile, particularly on a risk-adjusted basis, given significant downside protection in these customized financings. This purposeful approach has resulted in accelerated realizations relative to deployment as private deals have a longer execution time line. As John mentioned, we\u2019re currently evaluating the largest pipeline of private transactions ever for the strategy, and expect deployment to increase in the back half of the year. TPG\u2019s real estate portfolio appreciated approximately 1% in the second quarter and 2% over the last 12 months. And TPG AG\u2019s real estate portfolio appreciated 20 basis points in the second quarter and 70 basis points over the last 12 months. Focusing on TPG real estate for a moment, the positive value creation in the quarter is attributable to the quality of our portfolio construction in highly attractive sectors. This includes light industrial, student housing and data centers, which continue to see strong secular demand, supply limitations and rental rate growth. Capitalization rates and discount rates remained flat to slightly down in our core thematic areas as availability of debt and equity capital has increased this year, driving more transaction volume. As a result, we\u2019ve been opportunistically monetizing high-quality assets across our light industrial build-to-rent and student housing portfolios. Turning to fundraising, we raised $6.3 billion during the second quarter, as John mentioned, with $4.5 billion of this capital raised in credit. Looking forward, consistent with our prior guidance on fundraising, we continue to expect credit fundraising to exceed $10 billion for the year, more than doubling the capital raised in 2023. We\u2019ve raised $6.6 billion for our credit strategies through June, so we\u2019re pacing ahead of this objective. In addition, we expect our total private equity and infrastructure fundraising in 2024 to grow compared to $12.8 billion we raised in 2023, driven by the ongoing campaigns for growth and Rise climate as well as the launch of our climate transition infrastructure strategy. We\u2019ve raised $3 billion in the first half of this year, which is consistent with our expectation that these campaigns will be weighted to the back half of the year. As John mentioned, we have significant momentum toward a strong first close for our new Rise Climate Fund and expect to have more to report on our next call. We held a final close in July for our Life Sciences Innovations Fund, bringing total capital raised to $580 million for the overall strategy, which includes a portion of commitments from the Ris fund. We\u2019ll also hold a final close for our inaugural GP solutions fund in the third quarter. And we expect to hold a first close for our Rise Climate Transition Infrastructure Fund before year-end. Wrapping up, we\u2019re very pleased with our strong second quarter results and the progress we continue to make driving growth and diversification across our business. Our investment portfolios are performing well, and we\u2019ve been selectively pursuing monetization opportunities. At the same time, we\u2019ve been deploying capital at a steady pace and with $53 billion of dry powder, we\u2019re well positioned with a robust pipeline of opportunities across our diverse platforms. We\u2019re continuing to experience strong momentum across our active fundraising campaigns in our private equity and the credit businesses, and we\u2019re leveraging our culture of innovation to drive a variety of exciting growth initiatives that have the potential to build significant scale and long-term value. Now I\u2019ll turn the call back to the operator to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAlex Blostein: Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for the question. I want to start with credit. So at a high level, trend sound pretty good on both deployment and the fundraising side, but obviously, banking line was flat sequentially. Could help bridge sort of what were some of the offsets in the quarter? And then more importantly, talk a little bit about your growth outlook in credit with respect to management fees and fee-paying AUM over the next 12 months. Thanks.\nJack Weingart: Sure. Alex, it\u2019s Jack. I\u2019ll start on that. On the quarter, the reason the fee paying AUM was relatively flat quarter-over-quarter is because, as you\u2019d expect, the $4.5 billion of credit capital we raised during the quarter really, none of that was upon being raised. It turns into fee-paying AUM as we deploy it. So that\u2019s why you saw AUM growth quarter-over-quarter, but really no FAUM growth. And that\u2019s why, to my comments, the AUM subject to fee step-up increased so much quarter-over-quarter. So that\u2019s how you \u2013 that\u2019s how I would think through kind of that bridge. Now we do expect accelerated FAUM growth in credit as we work through the year next year and deploy the capital that we just raised in the first and second quarter, and we expect to continue raising in the back half of the year.\nJon Winkelried: And Alex, I guess the only thing I would add to that on the deployment outlook going forward is, I think you heard in our comments, what we have going on at Twin Brook and our direct lending platform. We\u2019re on a record pace by a meaningful margin in terms of the uptick in activity in the lower middle market sponsor space. And when you look at the originations there, one interesting dynamic to it is somewhere in the vicinity of around 40% of the origination volume there is essentially add-ons to the existing portfolio. So the base portfolio that Jack had referred to in his comments, continues to just generate with add-on acquisitions, tuck-ins, etcetera, continues to just generate a substantial amount of inherent growth in the portfolio beyond the 60% of the growth that\u2019s basically new buyouts. On the Credit Solutions side, which we\u2019ve talked about a number of times, I mentioned in my comments, obviously, that our essential housing business is very active. Jack mentioned in his comments that we \u2013 our team has actively been liquidating and selling most of our public book that we accumulated over the course of 2023 and maybe early \u201824 and given spread tightening and the contraction and essentially the compression in spreads. You can see what the value creation looks like in that book. But essentially, we spent a lot of time monetizing the \u2013 we pivoted, as you would expect, given the nature of what\u2019s happening in terms of the refinancing challenges in the market for some of the highly levered companies, we pivot to private opportunities. And just to give you an idea of the flow of that, we kind of look at \u2013 we\u2019re engaged with many sponsors around the market we sort of measure that flow and backlog by sort of the number of NDAs that we have actually signed. And we have actually so far this year have signed 160 NDAs. Just to give you an idea, that\u2019s like double our prior flow based. So we would \u2013 and naturally, those transactions are more bespoke, more structured, take longer to get done. So \u2013 but we would expect that we\u2019ll have an uptick in deployment around those opportunities. And by the way, particularly with the increase in volatility in the market. And then lastly, on the structured credit side, I think we\u2019re seeing now finally with the potential for interest rates to come down. We are seeing a number of transactions with risk transfer going on in the market among a variety of different banks who have been kind of waiting and pausing as it relates to sort of the value within those portfolios and how they feel about interest rates. We are seeing a pickup in partnerships with a number of financial institutions. I mentioned the Australia opportunity that we were able to do. So we\u2019re \u2013 but based upon capital formation versus the opportunity set to deploy we\u2019re actually trying to pace ourselves a little bit as we hopefully will accelerate our capital formation process in the second part of the year for our structured credit business.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Good morning, John, Jack. I hope everyone is doing well. We have a modeling question on the fee-earning AUM quarterly roll for it. In credit, you raised $4.5 billion and you also invested $4.5 billion, but fee-earning AUM only grew by $200 million and the fee earning AUM inflow is just $300 million. So I know I just threw a lot of numbers out there, but my question is why didn\u2019t fee-earning AUM in credit growth faster in the quarter, just given how big the fundraising and deployment numbers were? What am I missing?\nJack Weingart: Craig, the $4.5 billion of capital we raised during the quarter, really none of that shows up as fee-earning AUM as of the end of the quarter. It was raised, it\u2019s dry powder ready to invest, but it doesn\u2019t flow into fee-earning AUM until deployed, which will happen in subsequent quarters.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Got it. But you also invested $4.5 billion of prior capital. So wouldn\u2019t that have triggered fee increases.\nJack Weingart: Right. I\u2019m just looking for the number. That should \u2013 I think it was definitely offset by realizations during the quarter.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Got it.\nJack Weingart: We can follow up with you and...\nCraig Siegenthaler: Yes, we can follow up there. I was just \u2013 I was really curious because the fundraising number was so big and the investing number was also so big. And between the two, I figured that would have drove a larger increase in fee-earning AUM.\nJack Weingart: It was \u2013 basically, all the capital we raised during the quarter was not fee earning and our deployed capital was roughly offset by monetizations. We can follow-up and share those numbers with you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMichael Cyprys: Hey, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Maybe just sticking with credit and the AG deal. You mentioned some overseas investors coming into the Twin Brook fund sounds like some maybe distribution synergies happening there. Maybe you could just elaborate a bit on some of the synergies you\u2019ve realized so far from bringing Angelo Gordon into the franchise. And as you look out over the next 12, 24 months, maybe you could just update us on your latest thoughts around synergies that you\u2019d expect to drive across the business as you look out from here. And I know one of the things you\u2019re looking to do is to help the Ag credit business move up market a little bit. So maybe you could just update us on kind of where that initiative stands. Thank you.\nJon Winkelried: Yes. Thanks, Mike. The \u2013 on the fundraising side, I think that we have experienced a \u2013 what I think of as a fair amount of crossover between our LP bases. And as we talked about, as part of sort of the underlying thesis and growth drivers for the AG acquisition, we felt like that was a major opportunity for us in terms of being able to cross-sell into both historical pools of capital that haven\u2019t participated with AG and also just the size and scale of some of those pools of capital. So that really is beginning to take shape. And as an example, if you look at the Twin Brook fund raise, there are a number of cases where we have been able to successfully by partnering together between our two fundraising groups, that\u2019s an area where there were a number of examples where both some combination of sovereign wealth funds, large pensions and particularly international penetration. If you look at the footprint of TPG\u2019s LP base and the existing footprint of AGs at the time of the acquisition, the global scale of TPG\u2019s footprint was quite a bit larger. And so when you look at what we have been able to do and are continuing to do with in the Asia region, in the Middle East, in Europe, I think we\u2019ve been very happy with the progress that we\u2019re making in terms of both mandates that we\u2019ve gotten as well as engagement that we continue to have across the credit platform. Same thing is true, by the way, and really across the entire platform from Twin Brook to Credit Solutions to structured credit. And so I expect what you\u2019ll be hearing from us as we continue to form capital is you\u2019ll be hearing similar things with respect to the continuing fundraising effort with respect to bringing in those traditional relationships on the TPG side, and bringing those to bear in the AG credit business. So we\u2019re pretty optimistic with respect to that based on tangible evidence that we have so far as well as well as what we\u2019re \u2013 where we\u2019re currently engaged in terms of relationship dialogue. In a number of cases, as you would expect, given how credit is \u2013 how capital is formed on the credit side, in a number of cases, we\u2019re working on multi-strategy SMAs with some large pools of capital. And then the other area where I think we\u2019re pretty encouraged as well is extending the reach of our relationships in the channel with respect to the private wealth part of the market. I mentioned, for instance, Twin Brook, about to go up on its third major wirehouse platform for TCAP. And we have a number of launches that we\u2019re expecting to do with the channel with our Credit Solutions business. as well as our structured credit business. So we feel pretty good about it. And I think you\u2019ll continue to hear from us as we report out the progress that we expect to make \u2013 the other areas of synergies that get to your question that are quite tangible \u2013 for example, I mentioned our credit solutions business and the private opportunities that we\u2019re prosecuting there, the level of engagement between the private equity side of the house and the credit solutions side of the house, after signing NDAs and working with sponsors is also quite significant and quite tangible. And the ability to use both credit expertise that we have on the Credit Solutions side. And our underlying understanding of many of these companies on the PE side because many of these companies, as you would expect, we\u2019ve seen and the ability to both understand how to structure deals, but also ultimately what you\u2019re lending against fundamentally in terms of loan to value is valuation of companies. So that \u2013 those skill sets coming together is quite tangible. One of the things that we are in the process of doing is we are actually launching a new strategy we called hybrid solutions, which essentially, think of that as a middle of the capital structure, more structured return type of opportunity \u2013 we\u2019ve already established an anchor LP for the strategy. We\u2019ve already done our first deal in the strategy. And just to give you an idea, that strategy is led by Ryan Mallet Credit Solutions, David Trio and Hall Raj from the private equity side. So that\u2019s an example of forming a new opportunity basically through the combination of the two businesses.\nJack Weingart: Hey, Mike, it\u2019s Jack. Just a little more data for you on the Twin Brook fundraising migration, if you look at the last fund, Fund IV versus Fund V, which we just completed raising. The U.S. represented about 61% of Fund IV LP base, and this went down to 36% in Fund V replaced by significant growth in the Asia Pac as John said, as well as Europe and the Middle East. And by type of investor, insurance companies represented only 6% and of the LP base in Fund IV and 29% in Fund V. And sovereign wealth went from 1% to 17%. So I think those numbers give you a real sense for the kind of the synergy we\u2019re seeing on distribution. And by the way, obviously, the closed-end fund MDL5 is not the end of fundraising for Twin Brook. We have a number \u2013 not just TCAP in the high net worth channel, but we have a number of large SMAs. We\u2019re in the process of raising that will sit alongside MD as additional sources of capital, as you can imagine, those SMAs are oriented toward our large historical client base as well.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thank you so much for all the color. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.\nKen Worthington: [indiscernible] late hiring and catch up fees boosting margin this quarter. Were there any unusual other unusual items impacting compensation? And is the delayed hiring expected to be resolved later this year. And then on margin as well, as we think about Angelo Gordon, I know the focus has been top line growth and things look great so far. Are there also efficiencies that you\u2019re bringing to the AG platform that has contributed to sort of the improving margins you\u2019re seeing at sort of TPT proper?\nJack Weingart: Sure. I think, Ken, you broke up a little bit at the beginning of your question, but I think I got the gist of it. On the margin profile, in particular, I think you were asking about the comp expense in Q2. I think last quarter, we mentioned that our comp expense in Q1 was unusually high because of the elevated RSU-related expenses, and that will be flowing through as a seasonal factor in Q1 each year. So stepping down off of that number was not unexpected. The other piece of it that I referred to is we are, as we\u2019ve talked about in the process of hiring to expand the business in all the ways that we\u2019ve talked about. And much of that hiring did not kick in \u2013 to answer your question, we do expect that to kick in, in Q3 and Q4. So I would expect that comp expense line to normalize in Q3 and Q4. On the cost synergy side, as we\u2019ve always talked about, this is not \u2013 this was never a transaction premised on cost synergies. We\u2019re much more focused on what we just answered on revenue synergies, and we\u2019re very optimistic about that. That being said, of course, we\u2019re looking to operate a cost-efficient business. And I\u2019d say at this point, we believe we\u2019ve realized at least $30 million of cost synergies, and we intend to invest most of that back into things like expanding our product development and expanding our distribution capabilities.\nJon Winkelried: The only thing I just want to add to that is that just in terms of integration and the functioning of the organization, we have executed a full integration of all of our services functions, all of our operational functions, etcetera. So that is basically completely done and working very smoothly. So just in terms of the ability to benefit from scale as we grow. We feel like the full integration and the capabilities of the two firms combined will support that as well.\nKen Worthington: Great. Thank you very much.\nJon Winkelried: Thanks, Ken.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi, thanks very much. Hello. So I was hoping for a little color on Twin Brook. Your track record is great. You mentioned all senior secured first lien, good covenants, almost no loss as ever. So I don\u2019t feel bad asking a question of some people think of a middle-market player that plays in a $24 million average EBITDA more at risk in a client base that\u2019s more at risk in a decelerating economic backdrop. Maybe you could talk about the control aspect and why that hasn\u2019t actually been the case in the past.\nJon Winkelried: Yes. That\u2019s a good question, Glenn. Thank you for that. Well, first of all, I think that it\u2019s a timely question because I just got back a week ago from spending a few days in Chicago with our Twin Brook team and digging into sort of all aspects of what we\u2019re doing there. And it was a great opportunity to kind of just get deep in the portfolio. I think that \u2013 I think you\u2019re right to say that if you had a general statement that smaller companies are riskier than larger companies, I think it\u2019s generally correct. However, when you look at the way the business works at Twin Brook, a couple of comments. One is that the relationship that we have with the middle market sponsors that we are working with our deep and long history relationships. And so we have a very good understanding for how they look at value, how they manage their portfolios. And I think that, that familiarity and that partnership orientation in terms of how we work with them, is very much partnership like. And I would say that, obviously, being TPG and being on the other side of the lending equation, as it relates to financing our own buyouts. I would say, generally, I would describe it as less transactional, if you will, because of the nature of how loans are structured, the covenant structures surrounding them and the engagement process, particularly for \u2013 particularly as a result of what I had mentioned before in terms of the add-ons to portfolios over time. We are serially engaged with these sponsors and serially engaged with the portfolio. Each time we go through that process, by the way, there is an interesting dynamic that goes on, which is, it allows for some level of re-underwriting of the portfolio, which we do. It allows for adjustments and tweaking of covenants, which we do, because we do have financial covenants. And as you know, in the lending world, essentially, when you think about risk management, there is only really two ways to risk manage alone. One is either you sell it, or the other way is basically you get back to the table with your borrowers and you get back to the table with your sponsors. And as a result of covenant protections and the fact that we are usually almost always the admin agents and the sole lender, and that\u2019s changing a little bit as our companies are getting slightly larger. But we are in a position where we are seeing \u2013 there is all kinds of early warning systems. So, for instance, like when companies are drawing on the revolver. So, if you look at a time series, of how company has drawn the revolvers over time, it\u2019s correlated sometimes with stress or it\u2019s correlated with sometimes dips in margin. So, we have an early warning system. We have a watch list. The team is very focused on the watch list. We have weekly meetings where we are reviewing the watch list. We are reaching out to our sponsors, and basically working on, in some cases, covenant modifications and in some cases, restructuring loans. We are not \u2013 one of the things that \u2013 the other important thing to your point about risk relative levels of risk is that our companies are starting at lower levels of leverage. Our companies are starting generally in levels that are somewhere in the vicinity of around 4.5x leverage, whereas 5x leverage, whereas larger buyouts are starting at higher levels of leverage. And we are also starting at what I would call higher coverage ratio levels as well. We are starting generally at around sort of 3.25x, 3.5x. And when you look at what\u2019s happened to our portfolio, over the course of rising interest rates, we have gone from \u2013 in some cases, as rates have gone up and coverages have been compressed, which has happened across the entire market, lower-middle market and upper-middle market, our coverage ratios have compressed in some cases to like 1.9x or 2x whereas for larger upper middle market or upper market sponsored deals, coverage ratios, many coverage ratios compressed more like to 1.1x, 1x, in some cases, slightly below that. So, we are managing the business fundamentally in a somewhat different way. The metrics are different, the risk tolerances are different. The loan to values are inherently different and as a result of that, that\u2019s what\u2019s really produced a lower loss ratio. So, we have a lot of confidence in the business. We believe the business continues to grow and expand. If you look at the opportunity set for us there, I think that one of the clear opportunities that we have talked about is what we sort of finally referred to as kind of graduating company opportunity where companies are going from $20 million or $25 million or $30 million of EBITDA, the $40 million, $45 million, $50 million, $55 million of EBITDA, but we know these companies intimately well. We have banked them essentially for 3 years, 4 years, 5 years. In some cases, we have watched them grow. We have been part of that process. And so we are working with some clients to form some capital around that opportunity to grow with some of our borrowers. And likely, as we grow with some of our borrowers, those loans, which would be done outside the context of what is our traditional Twin Brook funds. Those companies may come with single covenant deals, in some cases, maybe even a cov-light deal as we get slightly higher. But that won\u2019t be at the expense of the focus that we have at Twin Brook and what we are doing there because we believe that business has \u2013 continues to have a lot of growth inherent in it and a lot of upside, and we feel like we are certainly one of the category killers in that part of the market.\nGlenn Schorr: That\u2019s great color. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Beatty with UBS. Please go ahead.\nAdam Beatty: Thank you and good morning. I want to ask about real estate. It looks like pretty balanced deployment in the quarter. And from the tone of Jon\u2019s comments, it seems like maybe you are leaning in a little bit, my words, but I appreciate your take on kind of the opportunity set there, how you are managing risk given some lingering uncertainty? And also, if you could, maybe a few words on the complementarity of the TPG AG real estate capability with the legacy TPG capability. Thanks.\nJon Winkelried: Yes, that\u2019s a good question. I think \u2013 let me start with the back end of the question, which is the complementarity. Our businesses \u2013 both businesses have been around for quite a long time now, and they have created sort of distinct approaches to what they do on the real estate side. And just very quickly, just to remind people, the TPG Real Estate franchise, what we call TREF is essentially an opportunistic high-return strategy. We are investing right now at a Fund IV, which is about a $7 billion fund. And we are targeting deploying capital in chunks that are sort of in the range of $100 million to $400 million. So, we are targeting pretty large set sizes. We have talked about our strategy there as kind of a private equity style real estate investing strategy, where we are essentially deploying and acquiring platforms and most often, doing it where essentially the operating capability is embedded in the platform itself as opposed to investing with a third-party operating partner, not exclusively, but in most cases, we are doing that. The TPG AG real estate franchise \u2013 and by the way, we are investing out of a single fund, and we are investing in the U.S. and Europe in that on the TPG side. The TPG AG funds, our regional funds, we have a U.S.-based fund, a European fund and an Asia fund and now have also a fund dedicated Japan value fund. And the AG franchise \u2013 the TBG AG Real Estate franchise has been built over the course of a long history, 25 years to 30 years in the business of working with operating partners. So, a very deep broad base of operating partner relationships where we are partnering on deals. And as you would expect, in many cases, serially doing that over time where we have worked with them on multiple deals. Our equity check, the equity deployment on the AG Real Estate side is more in the range of sort of $25 million to $75 million. And we think of it as a kind of a value-add real estate strategy where we are buying assets where we believe we can add value with the partnership with our operating partners and ultimately create value in the portfolio that way. So, that\u2019s \u2013 those are two quite distinctive strategies in terms of how we are doing it. And naturally, obviously, there is benefits of being \u2013 having a lot of feet on the street being \u2013 participating in various regions of the country, regions of the world, understanding the markets, which is very important, some level of local knowledge is very important when you look at this from a sector-by-sector basis. And so that\u2019s essentially what these two franchises look like, and there is some benefit from the \u2013 just the overall market knowledge that we glean as a result of being as broad and deep as we are. And as I have said before, having $14 billion of dry powder, puts us in a position of being offensive in this market. As far as what we are doing in terms of deployment and what we are doing on the deal front, I think you are right to say that basically, we were probably more measured at the beginning of the sort of the upper interest \u2013 the upward interest rate cycle. We are certainly more measured with the dislocation that was happening in real estate more broadly. And we would \u2013 we expected that over time as a result of some stress in the system, we would see interesting assets be available for sale. And that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happened. And so, I would say in the back half \u201823 when some of that was actually beginning to happen, we started to accelerate our capital deployment across the business on the back half of \u201823. And when we look back at that vintage and what we did in the back half of \u201823, we like those deals a lot. Based upon cap rates, we are able to acquire various assets on assets that were basically hard to get a hold of. We like that a lot. We have continued to deploy into \u201824. I would say, naturally as a result of the expectation that rates are coming down and people naturally being naturally more sort of bullish on what may happen in real estate as a result of that. I think that we have seen more of an acceleration of capital more broadly in the market into some of the real estate sectors that perhaps are a bit more defensive. And we are certainly still participating in that, but we are also trying to be very thematic and very careful about where we are deploying. And so the areas like, for instance, in certain aspects of the industrial market we continue to like and feel very \u2013 and continue to feel that they are quite defensive. Student housing, we continue to like and are deploying actively in student housing, where we feel we have real expertise, certain markets on multifamily are in areas where we are continuing to deploy, although it varies quite a bit regionally depending upon new supply coming into the market. So, we are quite cognizant of that. Specialized deals like, for instance, carve-outs like we just announced this carve-out is manufacturing housing business in Canada, a residential opportunity in the UK. Certain aspects of the market like that, we continue to lean into. Other areas of the market, we are more cautious on. Obviously, we continue to be cautious on office. We still continue to see stress in that market. We continue \u2013 we are cautious and we are becoming more cautious on the hospitality side, where we see slowing there in terms of demand and in terms of the ability to price, so that\u2019s \u2013 we are leaning in where we would like those sectors where we feel like we have got unique opportunities. And so that\u2019s how we are feeling about the market right now.\nAdam Beatty: Excellent. Appreciate both parts of the answer. Thank you, Jon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian McKenna with Citizens JMP. Please go ahead.\nBrian McKenna: Okay. Great. Thanks. So, you have deployed a good amount of the capital that you raised for your latest flagship capital strategies and performance for all those vintages has been really strong out of the gates with net returns of at least 20%. So, given the strong performance and then that nearly 50% of the capital raised for these funds has been deployed, how should we think about the timing and the potential demand for the next round of capital funds?\nTodd Sisitsky: Great. Well, Brian, thank you for the question. It\u2019s Todd. As you pointed out, we have in the flagship, the TPG Capital fund, which focuses on the U.S. and Europe, we have signed or completed 10 investments. It is a really interesting portfolio to your point, actually, I think the majority, two-thirds are some combination corporate carve-out or structured partnerships with strategic which have some \u2013 several of them have some very interesting risk-reward characteristics and protective downside. So, we are really excited about the portfolio and have been excited about the pace. I would say our pipeline continues to be robust as well. So, to your very specific question, we are on track for deploying this fund in the 3-year or 4-year time period that we have been targeting internally and advertising to our LPs, and that would probably put us in the market to start our next fund raise. And again, this reflects \u2013 this relates to both TPG 9 and TPG Healthcare Partners II, so the successor funds of TPG 10and Healthcare Partners III in the first half of 2025.\nBrian McKenna: Okay. Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDan Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. Jack, one more for you on margin, I understand the comments for this year. But as you think about the scaling of some of the funds you mentioned as well as the transaction fees, what is a reasonable expectation as you balance also investing for margin expansion as we think about next year versus where you have guided us to this year?\nJack Weingart: Yes. Thanks for the question, Dan. We haven\u2019t put out specific guidance other than to say that this year we expect to be kind of a baseline off of which we will grow. And if you think about the levers of margin expansion in our business, it\u2019s really driven by operating leverage and revenue growth. And if you think about all the capital we are raising this year, much of which is not flowing into FAUM yet, particularly on the credit side. As we deploy that naturally, and obviously, we disclosed that in the earnings release as AUM not yet earning fees, which grew a lot quarter-over-quarter. That you can see in our disclosure, represents a significant amount of kind of shadow FRR, if you will. On top of that, we have the large climate-related funds. We are in the process of raising which will pay fees on committed capital. But not really activate until closer to the end of the year this year. So, you will see a full annualization of that fee income next year. So, those are the primary drivers of our, what I would say, our resumption of FRE margin expansion next year. And we certainly believe that as we continue to scale-up all of our businesses, we will get back to the original TPG target of 45%. And beyond that, we just haven\u2019t put a time on that yet.\nDan Fannon: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bill Katz with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nBill Katz: Hey. Thank you very much for squeezing me in. Just coming back to fee paying or fee earning AUM just in general, if I look at the last couple of quarters, it\u2019s been relatively flat, about $137 billion. So, I appreciate you have a couple of vectors of growth as we look out over the next 12 months to \u2013 6 months to 18 months. If you think that realization is going to pick up, can you walk me through the path of how fee-paying AUM grow from here? And then I think, Jon, you had mentioned in your prepared comments that you plan on raising $40 billion of gross flows through the year-end \u201825. I was wondering if you could give me the pro forma number that you are comparing that up through June of this year. Thank you.\nJack Weingart: Hey Bill. Let me take the first part of that. On the FAUM role going forward, the way I would think about that is the significant pickup that we expect in credit deployment will obviously flow from AUM into FAUM. The minute we activate these big new pools of capital on the climate side, that will then create a significant step-up in FAUM. And that will be partially offset by realizations, but we certainly expect that be positive drivers will more than offset the realizations. And the reason we expect FRR growth next year is the net of all that will, in our minds, be expected to drive FAUM growth throughout the course of the year, next year.\nJon Winkelried: On the latter part of your question, Bill, which we can follow-up with you on just in terms of making sure that you understood the comment. But what I said in my prepared remarks is that looking at the 5-year period beginning 2021 to the end of 2025, we expect we will have raised approximately $40 billion during this timeframe across new strategies, pro forma for TPG AG, including our Rise Climate franchise expanding into infrastructure, leveraging our real estate footprint across asset classes and geographies, including Japan, scaling our GP-led secondaries business and broadening our credit platform. So, we can follow-up with you just in terms of understanding the components of that.\nJack Weingart: The other thing to keep in mind, Bill, is on realizations. If we sell a position that we have created value around, it\u2019s earning fees based on actively invested capital in those cases. And if we are selling it at, call it at, call, 3x our money, the dropout from FAUM is a lot less than the nominal amount sold.\nBill Katz: Thank you.\nOperator: And our final question will come from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks very much for squeezing me in. Also maybe just to go back \u2013 tip back to the right climate and climate infrastructure franchise. Obviously, developed a fantastic brand here over a long period of time. Can you talk about how you might be thinking about retail product development, whether there is an opportunity in this space, given it\u2019s not really well penetrated in this area on a retail basis across other alts. I think you mentioned, Jack, that some of the cost savings that you will be reinvesting in product development, maybe if you can talk about to what extent that might be in this \u2013 on this platform? And also, I think you mentioned an infrastructure debt, capability that you are looking into developing as well, if you can comment on that?\nJon Winkelried: I just \u2013 I will make one quick comment and then maybe Jim, if he can connect in, can comment on it as well. But one comment is that we are actively working on the launch of our first semiliquid private equity vehicle, which we are expecting to launch in the beginning of 2025. And that is going to \u2013 as you probably know, the semiliquid private equity vehicles that exist in the market. Obviously, our \u2013 each of them are a bit bespoke, depending on the franchise and the composition of business at each firm that has the capability and the breadth of launching that. As we put together our semiliquid private equity vehicle, one of the distinct features, obviously, that we have as a firm is the climate franchise, the impact and climate franchise that we have built over a number of years now, and that will be a piece of the offering and the componentry of the deals that we ultimately have within the semiliquid private equity vehicle. It will essentially be a broad compilation of opportunities and deals across our private equity franchises, but including climate. So, we feel like that will continue to give us additional distinctiveness with respect to what the channel has an opportunity to participate in, Jim?\nJim Coulter: Yes. Hi. First of all, we do expect there to be retail demand for this product. And in fact, we are just launching the channel part of the regular way fundraising for TPG Rise climate. In fact, looking at my calendar, I will be doing a series of one-on-one meetings across Texas, which is always interesting in climate, but the fact that we are seeing demand there gives you a sense of the overall demand in the marketplace. So, I think there are substantial opportunities to expand the distribution of our climate-related platform products. But to Jon\u2019s point, I think as a differentiator to our semiliquid product, it will be very powerful.\nBrian Bedell: Great. That\u2019s great color. Thank you so much.\nOperator: And this will conclude the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call. And I would now like to turn the call back to Gary Stein for closing remarks.\nGary Stein: Great. Thanks operator and thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please feel free to follow up with the IR team.\nOperator: And this concludes today\u2019s TPG second quarter 2024 earnings call and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jon Winkelried",
            "content": "Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone. Our strong second quarter results highlight the significant momentum across our business as we continue to successfully scale and diversify. We finished the quarter with $229 billion and $137 billion of fee-earning AUM across more than 30 strategies in private equity, credit and real estate. Over the course of last year, we drove a step function change in our growth profile and earnings power as a result of both organic and inorganic activity. Our firm is capitalizing on our expanded breadth. And in my comments today, I'll focus on two areas in particular. First, the strong momentum in our capital raises across our diversified product base; and second, our active pace of deployment and the differentiated deal types we are sourcing across our platforms. In addition to these two topics before I hand the call over to Jack, I'll also touch on the significant market volatility that's been taking place over the last few trading days. Beginning with fund phone raising, we raised $6.3 billion in the second quarter. Importantly, over 70% of this capital or $4.5 billion was raised across our credit strategies. During the quarter, we held the final close for Twin Brooks' fifth drawdown fund. In total, we raised $3.9 billion, which exceeded our original fund target and is 13% larger than its predecessor. This successful outcome was driven by Twin Brooks' strong investment track record and differentiated focus on sponsor-backed lower middle market companies as investors seek to complement and diversify their exposure to the U.S. direct lending market. In addition to receiving strong support from existing clients, Twin Brook meaningfully expanded its investor base globally, particularly in Asia, and increased diversification towards sovereign wealth funds as well as multinational insurance companies in Europe and Japan. This campaign is a strong indicator of the power of our platform and the cross-selling opportunity in front of us. We are also raising capital through other vehicles to accommodate investors across the broader Twin Brook platform as we continue to out-originate our capital base. This includes standing up of new SMAs and strategic partnerships with our as well as through evergreen structures and our non-traded BDC, TCAP. TCAP continues to raise capital at a steady pace and ended the quarter with $2.5 billion of total AUM. Currently, TCAP is being distributed by two of the largest warehouses in the U.S., and we expect the third to be added by the end of this quarter. Turning briefly to our Credit Solutions platform. During the quarter, we raised approximately $2 billion including $1.1 billion for the first closing of Credit Solutions 3. We also held additional closes for Essential Housing 3, bringing the total capital raised for the fund to $1.3 billion at the end of the second quarter. Looking to the rest of the year, we expect our robust fundraising momentum to continue, led by our Rise climate franchise. Last quarter, we stated that we expect our impact platform to achieve $35 billion of AUM within 2 years and we believe that we're tracking ahead of plan on that objective. In our Climate private equity strategy, we are seeing strong support from both existing and new clients. We are holding our first close for Rise Climate 2 this quarter and expect to announce a strong start to that campaign on our next call. We continue to target an aggregate of $10 billion across this fund and the Global South initiative and we expect the majority of the capital to be raised in 2024. Additionally, we expect to hold a close before year-end for our first RISE climate transition infrastructure fund. In May, we announced a $1.5 billion strategic partnership with Hassana Investment Company, a substantial portion of which will anchor our infrastructure fund, and we are in active dialogue with other LPs to provide additional anchor capital. Our leadership position in climate investing is a powerful differentiator that enables us to organically expand into adjacent asset classes with significant growth potential, such as infrastructure. As you can see, our fundraising momentum continues to ramp and is well diversified across our business. Similarly, our deployment pace remains robust. We invested $7.6 billion of capital in the second quarter and more than $35 billion over the last 12 months on a pro forma basis, including TPG AG. I'll spend a moment on TPG Capital to illustrate the interesting ways we are deploying capital through our proprietary and distinctive sourcing approach. Over the last 12 months, TPG Capital has announced or completed 9 investments with an aggregate equity commitment of nearly $7 billion that resulted from long-standing C-level relationships within our core thematic areas. More than half of this capital was invested into deals that were either a complex corporate carve-out or create a partnership. TPG has a long and successful history of unlocking value and driving growth through these types of differentiated deals. I also want to highlight our activity in Europe, which is a high priority region for us. Our President, Todd Sisitsky just returned after spending 6 weeks there working closely with our teams to further build on our strong investment momentum, client relationships and franchise in the region. Over the last few months, we have announced or closed several interesting transactions in Europe and our pipeline remains strong. For example, in the second quarter, TPG Capital announced the \u20ac3.9 billion carve-out of Aareon, a leading provider of SaaS solutions for the European property industry from Aareal Bank in Germany. This investment represents an attractive opportunity to accelerate Aareon's growth as a stand-alone company and a resilient but fragmented market. Turning to TPG growth. In the quarter, we closed the proprietary acquisition of Untitled Entertainment, a leading Hollywood talent management firm. Untitled will be part of a newly formed platform that will leverage our deep experience investing in media and entertainment to acquire and build a diversified global business focused on talent management and representation. Our Rise and Rise Climate funds continue to deploy capital at a steady pace given our differentiated position as the partner-of-choice in the impact space. Since quarter end, we have already signed or closed 4 additional transactions with an aggregate equity commitment of approximately $800 million. Rise recently led an investment of over $200 million into Food Smart, a leading U.S. telenutrition provider and food benefits management platform. Additionally, Rise Climate agreed to acquire Olympus Terminals a large-scale renewable fuels logistics provider in California. Olympus plays a critical role in the decarbonization value chain and represents our focus on investing in companies enabling the energy transition. Turning to our real estate strategies, over the last few years, we have been anticipating substantial stress in the system to drive attractive investment opportunities, so we were purposely patient in our approach to capital deployment. Since mid-2023, we have seen a significant increase in investment activity, acquiring a number of distinctive high-quality assets from sellers in need of liquidity, with combined dry powder of $14 billion across our real estate businesses, we expect to lean into the growing number of interesting opportunities we are sourcing in our core areas of focus. We invested $1.2 billion in the quarter, and I'll share some brief highlights. Within TPG Real Estate, during the quarter, we completed investments in 2 office-to-residential conversions in New York City. In aggregate, we acquired the properties at a significant discount to their prior basis, and we're working with best-in-class partners to execute these conversions. TPG AG's European real estate business has also been capitalizing on this environment, including investing in a mixed-use property in Berlin, several Swedish logistics assets and a homebuilding platform in the U.K. Each transaction was off market and bilaterally negotiated with highly-motivated sellers. Our TPG AG real estate sourcing model, which leverages hundreds of operating partner relationships across local markets, continues to demonstrate its unique value proposition. Finally, within credit, we deployed $4.5 billion across our strategies in the second quarter. Twin Brook, our direct lending business continued its strong investment pace in the quarter, bringing total gross originations in the first half of the year to a record $4.8 billion. This exceeds Twin Brook's prior first half gross origination record by more than $1 billion. Twin Brook is a leader in lending to lower middle market private equity-backed companies, and 100% of Twin Brook's loans are senior secured first lien with financial covenants. Twin Brook has generated attractive net returns of 11% since inception with an annualized loss rate of only 1 basis point. During the second quarter, our Credit Solutions platform deployed approximately $900 million of capital primarily through our proprietary essential housing business. Notably, essential housing, which provides land financing to leading homebuilders has seen substantial origination volume. We closed on $1.8 billion of project value across 67 projects with 9 homebuilders during the first 2.5 months of the current funds investment period. Within our Credit Solutions funds, given our flexible mandate, we continue to monetize our public positions and are currently evaluating the largest pipeline of private investment opportunities since the strategy was launched. We are actively working to partner with a range of public and private companies with various needs for bespoke private capital solutions. Finally, we continue to see growing client demand from specialty private credit, given the desire to diversify exposure away from corporate credit into more non-correlated risk. During the quarter, our structured credit platform deployed $1.9 billion across a diverse array of consumer, specialty and mortgage finance transactions. Most notably, our asset-based credit fund completed its first investment in Australia demonstrating the global reach of this business. Overall, given the breadth of capabilities within our credit business, we are well positioned to continue to accelerate growth as evidenced by our fundraising momentum, deployment pace and investment pipelines. Each of these strategies is currently out originating its capital base. So we see a significant opportunity to scale them through a combination of raising additional capital and driving further product innovation. Continuing with this theme, innovation is the cornerstone of our ability to grow the firm. Looking at a 5-year period from the beginning of 2021 to the end of 2025, we expect we will have raised approximately $40 billion during this time frame across new strategies, pro forma for TPG AG. This includes growing our Rise Climate franchise and expanding into infrastructure, leveraging our real estate footprint across asset classes and geographies, including Japan, scaling our GP-led secondaries business and broadening our credit platform. Our proven ability to innovate is even more powerful across our well-diversified platform, which provides many new avenues for organic growth. Before I turn the call over to Jack, I'd like to comment briefly on the current market backdrop. Based on the market correction we've all witnessed over the last few days, it seems likely we have entered a new period of increased volatility, marked by more imminent interest rate cuts and heightened geopolitical risks. Although the markets have clearly become far more volatile since late last week, it's not yet clear how this may impact the underlying economy. We are fundamental investors and from our perspective, the fundamentals we look at every day remain reasonably strong. We have experienced many market cycles during our careers, and we know periods of market dislocation create compelling investment opportunities. We've been preparing for an environment like this and we are well positioned with $53 billion of long-dated capital available to invest across our private equity, credit and real estate platforms. Now I'll turn it over to Jack to review our financial results. And Alex, I guess the only thing I would add to that on the deployment outlook going forward is, I think you heard in our comments, what we have going on at Twin Brook and our direct lending platform. We're on a record pace by a meaningful margin in terms of the uptick in activity in the lower middle market sponsor space. And when you look at the originations there, one interesting dynamic to it is somewhere in the vicinity of around 40% of the origination volume there is essentially add-ons to the existing portfolio. So the base portfolio that Jack had referred to in his comments, continues to just generate with add-on acquisitions, tuck-ins, etcetera, continues to just generate a substantial amount of inherent growth in the portfolio beyond the 60% of the growth that's basically new buyouts. On the Credit Solutions side, which we've talked about a number of times, I mentioned in my comments, obviously, that our essential housing business is very active. Jack mentioned in his comments that we \u2013 our team has actively been liquidating and selling most of our public book that we accumulated over the course of 2023 and maybe early \u201824 and given spread tightening and the contraction and essentially the compression in spreads. You can see what the value creation looks like in that book. But essentially, we spent a lot of time monetizing the \u2013 we pivoted, as you would expect, given the nature of what's happening in terms of the refinancing challenges in the market for some of the highly levered companies, we pivot to private opportunities. And just to give you an idea of the flow of that, we kind of look at \u2013 we're engaged with many sponsors around the market we sort of measure that flow and backlog by sort of the number of NDAs that we have actually signed. And we have actually so far this year have signed 160 NDAs. Just to give you an idea, that's like double our prior flow based. So we would \u2013 and naturally, those transactions are more bespoke, more structured, take longer to get done. So \u2013 but we would expect that we'll have an uptick in deployment around those opportunities. And by the way, particularly with the increase in volatility in the market. And then lastly, on the structured credit side, I think we're seeing now finally with the potential for interest rates to come down. We are seeing a number of transactions with risk transfer going on in the market among a variety of different banks who have been kind of waiting and pausing as it relates to sort of the value within those portfolios and how they feel about interest rates. We are seeing a pickup in partnerships with a number of financial institutions. I mentioned the Australia opportunity that we were able to do. So we're \u2013 but based upon capital formation versus the opportunity set to deploy we're actually trying to pace ourselves a little bit as we hopefully will accelerate our capital formation process in the second part of the year for our structured credit business. Yes. Thanks, Mike. The \u2013 on the fundraising side, I think that we have experienced a \u2013 what I think of as a fair amount of crossover between our LP bases. And as we talked about, as part of sort of the underlying thesis and growth drivers for the AG acquisition, we felt like that was a major opportunity for us in terms of being able to cross-sell into both historical pools of capital that haven't participated with AG and also just the size and scale of some of those pools of capital. So that really is beginning to take shape. And as an example, if you look at the Twin Brook fund raise, there are a number of cases where we have been able to successfully by partnering together between our two fundraising groups, that's an area where there were a number of examples where both some combination of sovereign wealth funds, large pensions and particularly international penetration. If you look at the footprint of TPG's LP base and the existing footprint of AGs at the time of the acquisition, the global scale of TPG's footprint was quite a bit larger. And so when you look at what we have been able to do and are continuing to do with in the Asia region, in the Middle East, in Europe, I think we've been very happy with the progress that we're making in terms of both mandates that we've gotten as well as engagement that we continue to have across the credit platform. Same thing is true, by the way, and really across the entire platform from Twin Brook to Credit Solutions to structured credit. And so I expect what you'll be hearing from us as we continue to form capital is you'll be hearing similar things with respect to the continuing fundraising effort with respect to bringing in those traditional relationships on the TPG side, and bringing those to bear in the AG credit business. So we're pretty optimistic with respect to that based on tangible evidence that we have so far as well as well as what we're \u2013 where we're currently engaged in terms of relationship dialogue. In a number of cases, as you would expect, given how credit is \u2013 how capital is formed on the credit side, in a number of cases, we're working on multi-strategy SMAs with some large pools of capital. And then the other area where I think we're pretty encouraged as well is extending the reach of our relationships in the channel with respect to the private wealth part of the market. I mentioned, for instance, Twin Brook, about to go up on its third major wirehouse platform for TCAP. And we have a number of launches that we're expecting to do with the channel with our Credit Solutions business. as well as our structured credit business. So we feel pretty good about it. And I think you'll continue to hear from us as we report out the progress that we expect to make \u2013 the other areas of synergies that get to your question that are quite tangible \u2013 for example, I mentioned our credit solutions business and the private opportunities that we're prosecuting there, the level of engagement between the private equity side of the house and the credit solutions side of the house, after signing NDAs and working with sponsors is also quite significant and quite tangible. And the ability to use both credit expertise that we have on the Credit Solutions side. And our underlying understanding of many of these companies on the PE side because many of these companies, as you would expect, we've seen and the ability to both understand how to structure deals, but also ultimately what you're lending against fundamentally in terms of loan to value is valuation of companies. So that \u2013 those skill sets coming together is quite tangible. One of the things that we are in the process of doing is we are actually launching a new strategy we called hybrid solutions, which essentially, think of that as a middle of the capital structure, more structured return type of opportunity \u2013 we've already established an anchor LP for the strategy. We've already done our first deal in the strategy. And just to give you an idea, that strategy is led by Ryan Mallet Credit Solutions, David Trio and Hall Raj from the private equity side. So that's an example of forming a new opportunity basically through the combination of the two businesses. The only thing I just want to add to that is that just in terms of integration and the functioning of the organization, we have executed a full integration of all of our services functions, all of our operational functions, etcetera. So that is basically completely done and working very smoothly. So just in terms of the ability to benefit from scale as we grow. We feel like the full integration and the capabilities of the two firms combined will support that as well. Thanks, Ken. Yes. That's a good question, Glenn. Thank you for that. Well, first of all, I think that it's a timely question because I just got back a week ago from spending a few days in Chicago with our Twin Brook team and digging into sort of all aspects of what we're doing there. And it was a great opportunity to kind of just get deep in the portfolio. I think that \u2013 I think you're right to say that if you had a general statement that smaller companies are riskier than larger companies, I think it's generally correct. However, when you look at the way the business works at Twin Brook, a couple of comments. One is that the relationship that we have with the middle market sponsors that we are working with our deep and long history relationships. And so we have a very good understanding for how they look at value, how they manage their portfolios. And I think that, that familiarity and that partnership orientation in terms of how we work with them, is very much partnership like. And I would say that, obviously, being TPG and being on the other side of the lending equation, as it relates to financing our own buyouts. I would say, generally, I would describe it as less transactional, if you will, because of the nature of how loans are structured, the covenant structures surrounding them and the engagement process, particularly for \u2013 particularly as a result of what I had mentioned before in terms of the add-ons to portfolios over time. We are serially engaged with these sponsors and serially engaged with the portfolio. Each time we go through that process, by the way, there is an interesting dynamic that goes on, which is, it allows for some level of re-underwriting of the portfolio, which we do. It allows for adjustments and tweaking of covenants, which we do, because we do have financial covenants. And as you know, in the lending world, essentially, when you think about risk management, there is only really two ways to risk manage alone. One is either you sell it, or the other way is basically you get back to the table with your borrowers and you get back to the table with your sponsors. And as a result of covenant protections and the fact that we are usually almost always the admin agents and the sole lender, and that's changing a little bit as our companies are getting slightly larger. But we are in a position where we are seeing \u2013 there is all kinds of early warning systems. So, for instance, like when companies are drawing on the revolver. So, if you look at a time series, of how company has drawn the revolvers over time, it's correlated sometimes with stress or it's correlated with sometimes dips in margin. So, we have an early warning system. We have a watch list. The team is very focused on the watch list. We have weekly meetings where we are reviewing the watch list. We are reaching out to our sponsors, and basically working on, in some cases, covenant modifications and in some cases, restructuring loans. We are not \u2013 one of the things that \u2013 the other important thing to your point about risk relative levels of risk is that our companies are starting at lower levels of leverage. Our companies are starting generally in levels that are somewhere in the vicinity of around 4.5x leverage, whereas 5x leverage, whereas larger buyouts are starting at higher levels of leverage. And we are also starting at what I would call higher coverage ratio levels as well. We are starting generally at around sort of 3.25x, 3.5x. And when you look at what's happened to our portfolio, over the course of rising interest rates, we have gone from \u2013 in some cases, as rates have gone up and coverages have been compressed, which has happened across the entire market, lower-middle market and upper-middle market, our coverage ratios have compressed in some cases to like 1.9x or 2x whereas for larger upper middle market or upper market sponsored deals, coverage ratios, many coverage ratios compressed more like to 1.1x, 1x, in some cases, slightly below that. So, we are managing the business fundamentally in a somewhat different way. The metrics are different, the risk tolerances are different. The loan to values are inherently different and as a result of that, that's what's really produced a lower loss ratio. So, we have a lot of confidence in the business. We believe the business continues to grow and expand. If you look at the opportunity set for us there, I think that one of the clear opportunities that we have talked about is what we sort of finally referred to as kind of graduating company opportunity where companies are going from $20 million or $25 million or $30 million of EBITDA, the $40 million, $45 million, $50 million, $55 million of EBITDA, but we know these companies intimately well. We have banked them essentially for 3 years, 4 years, 5 years. In some cases, we have watched them grow. We have been part of that process. And so we are working with some clients to form some capital around that opportunity to grow with some of our borrowers. And likely, as we grow with some of our borrowers, those loans, which would be done outside the context of what is our traditional Twin Brook funds. Those companies may come with single covenant deals, in some cases, maybe even a cov-light deal as we get slightly higher. But that won't be at the expense of the focus that we have at Twin Brook and what we are doing there because we believe that business has \u2013 continues to have a lot of growth inherent in it and a lot of upside, and we feel like we are certainly one of the category killers in that part of the market. Yes, that's a good question. I think \u2013 let me start with the back end of the question, which is the complementarity. Our businesses \u2013 both businesses have been around for quite a long time now, and they have created sort of distinct approaches to what they do on the real estate side. And just very quickly, just to remind people, the TPG Real Estate franchise, what we call TREF is essentially an opportunistic high-return strategy. We are investing right now at a Fund IV, which is about a $7 billion fund. And we are targeting deploying capital in chunks that are sort of in the range of $100 million to $400 million. So, we are targeting pretty large set sizes. We have talked about our strategy there as kind of a private equity style real estate investing strategy, where we are essentially deploying and acquiring platforms and most often, doing it where essentially the operating capability is embedded in the platform itself as opposed to investing with a third-party operating partner, not exclusively, but in most cases, we are doing that. The TPG AG real estate franchise \u2013 and by the way, we are investing out of a single fund, and we are investing in the U.S. and Europe in that on the TPG side. The TPG AG funds, our regional funds, we have a U.S.-based fund, a European fund and an Asia fund and now have also a fund dedicated Japan value fund. And the AG franchise \u2013 the TBG AG Real Estate franchise has been built over the course of a long history, 25 years to 30 years in the business of working with operating partners. So, a very deep broad base of operating partner relationships where we are partnering on deals. And as you would expect, in many cases, serially doing that over time where we have worked with them on multiple deals. Our equity check, the equity deployment on the AG Real Estate side is more in the range of sort of $25 million to $75 million. And we think of it as a kind of a value-add real estate strategy where we are buying assets where we believe we can add value with the partnership with our operating partners and ultimately create value in the portfolio that way. So, that's \u2013 those are two quite distinctive strategies in terms of how we are doing it. And naturally, obviously, there is benefits of being \u2013 having a lot of feet on the street being \u2013 participating in various regions of the country, regions of the world, understanding the markets, which is very important, some level of local knowledge is very important when you look at this from a sector-by-sector basis. And so that's essentially what these two franchises look like, and there is some benefit from the \u2013 just the overall market knowledge that we glean as a result of being as broad and deep as we are. And as I have said before, having $14 billion of dry powder, puts us in a position of being offensive in this market. As far as what we are doing in terms of deployment and what we are doing on the deal front, I think you are right to say that basically, we were probably more measured at the beginning of the sort of the upper interest \u2013 the upward interest rate cycle. We are certainly more measured with the dislocation that was happening in real estate more broadly. And we would \u2013 we expected that over time as a result of some stress in the system, we would see interesting assets be available for sale. And that's exactly what's happened. And so, I would say in the back half \u201823 when some of that was actually beginning to happen, we started to accelerate our capital deployment across the business on the back half of \u201823. And when we look back at that vintage and what we did in the back half of \u201823, we like those deals a lot. Based upon cap rates, we are able to acquire various assets on assets that were basically hard to get a hold of. We like that a lot. We have continued to deploy into \u201824. I would say, naturally as a result of the expectation that rates are coming down and people naturally being naturally more sort of bullish on what may happen in real estate as a result of that. I think that we have seen more of an acceleration of capital more broadly in the market into some of the real estate sectors that perhaps are a bit more defensive. And we are certainly still participating in that, but we are also trying to be very thematic and very careful about where we are deploying. And so the areas like, for instance, in certain aspects of the industrial market we continue to like and feel very \u2013 and continue to feel that they are quite defensive. Student housing, we continue to like and are deploying actively in student housing, where we feel we have real expertise, certain markets on multifamily are in areas where we are continuing to deploy, although it varies quite a bit regionally depending upon new supply coming into the market. So, we are quite cognizant of that. Specialized deals like, for instance, carve-outs like we just announced this carve-out is manufacturing housing business in Canada, a residential opportunity in the UK. Certain aspects of the market like that, we continue to lean into. Other areas of the market, we are more cautious on. Obviously, we continue to be cautious on office. We still continue to see stress in that market. We continue \u2013 we are cautious and we are becoming more cautious on the hospitality side, where we see slowing there in terms of demand and in terms of the ability to price, so that's \u2013 we are leaning in where we would like those sectors where we feel like we have got unique opportunities. And so that's how we are feeling about the market right now. On the latter part of your question, Bill, which we can follow-up with you on just in terms of making sure that you understood the comment. But what I said in my prepared remarks is that looking at the 5-year period beginning 2021 to the end of 2025, we expect we will have raised approximately $40 billion during this timeframe across new strategies, pro forma for TPG AG, including our Rise Climate franchise expanding into infrastructure, leveraging our real estate footprint across asset classes and geographies, including Japan, scaling our GP-led secondaries business and broadening our credit platform. So, we can follow-up with you just in terms of understanding the components of that. I just \u2013 I will make one quick comment and then maybe Jim, if he can connect in, can comment on it as well. But one comment is that we are actively working on the launch of our first semiliquid private equity vehicle, which we are expecting to launch in the beginning of 2025. And that is going to \u2013 as you probably know, the semiliquid private equity vehicles that exist in the market. Obviously, our \u2013 each of them are a bit bespoke, depending on the franchise and the composition of business at each firm that has the capability and the breadth of launching that. As we put together our semiliquid private equity vehicle, one of the distinct features, obviously, that we have as a firm is the climate franchise, the impact and climate franchise that we have built over a number of years now, and that will be a piece of the offering and the componentry of the deals that we ultimately have within the semiliquid private equity vehicle. It will essentially be a broad compilation of opportunities and deals across our private equity franchises, but including climate. So, we feel like that will continue to give us additional distinctiveness with respect to what the channel has an opportunity to participate in, Jim?"

As you pointed out, we have in the flagship, the TPG Capital fund, which focuses on the U.S. and Europe, we have signed or completed 10 investments. It is a really interesting portfolio to your point, actually, I think the majority, two-thirds are some combination corporate carve-out or structured partnerships with strategic which have some \u2013 several of them have some very interesting risk-reward characteristics and protective downside. So, we are really excited about the portfolio and have been excited about the pace. I would say our pipeline continues to be robust as well. So, to your very specific question, we are on track for deploying this fund in the 3-year or 4-year time period that we have been targeting internally and advertising to our LPs, and that would probably put us in the market to start our next fund raise. And again, this reflects \u2013 this relates to both TPG 9 and TPG Healthcare Partners II, so the successor funds of TPG 10and Healthcare Partners III in the first half of 2025."

In fact, looking at my calendar, I will be doing a series of one-on-one meetings across Texas, which is always interesting in climate, but the fact that we are seeing demand there gives you a sense of the overall demand in the marketplace.

            "name": "Jack Weingart",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We ended the second quarter with $229 billion of total assets under management, up 65% year-over-year. This was driven by $75 billion of acquired AUM from Angelo Gordon, $23 billion of capital raised and $11 billion of value creation, partially offset by $17 billion of realizations over the last 12 months. Fee-earning AUM increased 74% year-over-year to $137 billion, and we ended the quarter with more than $53 billion of dry powder, representing 39% of fee-earning AUM. We also had AUM subject to fee-earning growth of $25 billion at the end of the quarter. This includes $16 billion of AUM not yet earning fees, which increased 17% sequentially and as a result of the strong fundraising progress we made across our credit businesses this quarter. Our fee-related revenue in the second quarter was $459 million, up 61% year-over-year, primarily driven by the acquisition of Angelo Gordon. In addition to the contribution from TPG AG on a stand-alone basis, TPG grew fee-related revenue 13% organically year-over-year. Our Q2 FRR included management fees of $413 million and continued strong transaction fees of $34 million. Following a strong first half of the year, we expect capital markets revenue to be more muted in the third quarter due to deal-specific factors. As we look to the end of the year, we expect capital markets activity to accelerate into 2025 and as our new investment pipeline remains strong, and we begin to see the benefits of integrating our broker-dealer capabilities into our credit platform. We reported fee-related earnings of $201 million for the second quarter, up 60% year-over-year. Our FRE margin of 44% in the quarter was above trend as we benefited from incremental catch-up fees, strong transaction fees and lower-than-expected cash compensation due in part to the timing of hiring. As we've indicated previously, we continue to expect our full year FRE margin to exceed 40% in 2024 and expand in 2025 as we benefit from increased credit deployment and the activation of several new funds, most notably our second rise climate fund. After-tax distributable earnings for the second quarter totaled $207 million or $0.49 per share of Class A common stock. This included $26 million of realized performance allocations, which was largely driven by credit and real estate. Although exit activity remains muted for the industry and for TPG and has been slower to recover compared to deployment, we're actively evaluating monetization opportunities across all of our portfolios. Our realized investment income and other line item in the second quarter included $5 million of non-core expenses related to Angelo Gordon, which declined from $8 million last quarter as we continue to make progress on our integration work streams. We expect our integration expenses to remain at around this reduced level through the balance of the year. Turning to our non-GAAP balance sheet, TPG remains well capitalized with moderate leverage and ample liquidity. We ended the second quarter with $330 million of cash and cash equivalents and $1.2 billion of undrawn capacity on our revolver, providing us with significant flexibility to continue investing in growth. Our net accrued performance balance stepped up to $929 million at the end of the second quarter. Our performance eligible AUM totaled $198 billion or 86% of our total AUM, of which $158 billion is currently generating performance fees. Our investment portfolio has continued to perform well with positive value creation across all of our platforms for the second quarter and over the last 12 months. Our private equity portfolio, which includes our capital growth and impact platforms, grew revenue by 18% over the last 12 months, and margins have remained stable as inflationary pressures have moderated. Our private equity strategy is characterized by deeply thematic growth-oriented investing, where we believe we can inflect growth in our portfolio of companies that will outpace any potential multiple compression. This disciplined approach has resulted in significant strength and durability against a volatile macro backdrop over the last 24 to 36 months. And our PE portfolio appreciated approximately 2% in the second quarter and 7% over the last 12 months. Turning to credit, our portfolio appreciated approximately 3% in the quarter and 14% over the last 12 months. In Middle Market Direct Lending, all of our funds were at or above their target return ranges as of quarter-end. Overall, our portfolio of more than 260 companies continues to perform well with strong revenue growth and cash flow generation and no realized losses in the quarter. At the end of the quarter, our weighted average loan-to-value at close was 41%, which is consistent with historical levels. In Credit Solutions, as spreads have tightened, the team has continued to aggressively monetize public positions across the portfolios and crystallize gains. We're now pivoting into private transactions where we believe there is a more attractive return profile, particularly on a risk-adjusted basis, given significant downside protection in these customized financings. This purposeful approach has resulted in accelerated realizations relative to deployment as private deals have a longer execution time line. As John mentioned, we're currently evaluating the largest pipeline of private transactions ever for the strategy, and expect deployment to increase in the back half of the year. TPG's real estate portfolio appreciated approximately 1% in the second quarter and 2% over the last 12 months. And TPG AG's real estate portfolio appreciated 20 basis points in the second quarter and 70 basis points over the last 12 months. Focusing on TPG real estate for a moment, the positive value creation in the quarter is attributable to the quality of our portfolio construction in highly attractive sectors. This includes light industrial, student housing and data centers, which continue to see strong secular demand, supply limitations and rental rate growth. Capitalization rates and discount rates remained flat to slightly down in our core thematic areas as availability of debt and equity capital has increased this year, driving more transaction volume. As a result, we've been opportunistically monetizing high-quality assets across our light industrial build-to-rent and student housing portfolios. Turning to fundraising, we raised $6.3 billion during the second quarter, as John mentioned, with $4.5 billion of this capital raised in credit. Looking forward, consistent with our prior guidance on fundraising, we continue to expect credit fundraising to exceed $10 billion for the year, more than doubling the capital raised in 2023. We've raised $6.6 billion for our credit strategies through June, so we're pacing ahead of this objective. In addition, we expect our total private equity and infrastructure fundraising in 2024 to grow compared to $12.8 billion we raised in 2023, driven by the ongoing campaigns for growth and Rise climate as well as the launch of our climate transition infrastructure strategy. We've raised $3 billion in the first half of this year, which is consistent with our expectation that these campaigns will be weighted to the back half of the year. As John mentioned, we have significant momentum toward a strong first close for our new Rise Climate Fund and expect to have more to report on our next call. We held a final close in July for our Life Sciences Innovations Fund, bringing total capital raised to $580 million for the overall strategy, which includes a portion of commitments from the Ris fund. We'll also hold a final close for our inaugural GP solutions fund in the third quarter. And we expect to hold a first close for our Rise Climate Transition Infrastructure Fund before year-end. Wrapping up, we're very pleased with our strong second quarter results and the progress we continue to make driving growth and diversification across our business. Our investment portfolios are performing well, and we've been selectively pursuing monetization opportunities. At the same time, we've been deploying capital at a steady pace and with $53 billion of dry powder, we're well positioned with a robust pipeline of opportunities across our diverse platforms. We're continuing to experience strong momentum across our active fundraising campaigns in our private equity and the credit businesses, and we're leveraging our culture of innovation to drive a variety of exciting growth initiatives that have the potential to build significant scale and long-term value. Now I'll turn the call back to the operator to take your questions. Sure. Alex, it's Jack. I'll start on that. On the quarter, the reason the fee paying AUM was relatively flat quarter-over-quarter is because, as you'd expect, the $4.5 billion of credit capital we raised during the quarter really, none of that was upon being raised. It turns into fee-paying AUM as we deploy it. So that's why you saw AUM growth quarter-over-quarter, but really no FAUM growth. And that's why, to my comments, the AUM subject to fee step-up increased so much quarter-over-quarter. So that's how you \u2013 that's how I would think through kind of that bridge. Now we do expect accelerated FAUM growth in credit as we work through the year next year and deploy the capital that we just raised in the first and second quarter, and we expect to continue raising in the back half of the year. Craig, the $4.5 billion of capital we raised during the quarter, really none of that shows up as fee-earning AUM as of the end of the quarter. It was raised, it's dry powder ready to invest, but it doesn't flow into fee-earning AUM until deployed, which will happen in subsequent quarters. Right. I'm just looking for the number. That should \u2013 I think it was definitely offset by realizations during the quarter. We can follow up with you and... It was \u2013 basically, all the capital we raised during the quarter was not fee earning and our deployed capital was roughly offset by monetizations. We can follow-up and share those numbers with you. Hey, Mike, it's Jack. Just a little more data for you on the Twin Brook fundraising migration, if you look at the last fund, Fund IV versus Fund V, which we just completed raising. The U.S. represented about 61% of Fund IV LP base, and this went down to 36% in Fund V replaced by significant growth in the Asia Pac as John said, as well as Europe and the Middle East. And by type of investor, insurance companies represented only 6% and of the LP base in Fund IV and 29% in Fund V. And sovereign wealth went from 1% to 17%. So I think those numbers give you a real sense for the kind of the synergy we're seeing on distribution. And by the way, obviously, the closed-end fund MDL5 is not the end of fundraising for Twin Brook. We have a number \u2013 not just TCAP in the high net worth channel, but we have a number of large SMAs. We're in the process of raising that will sit alongside MD as additional sources of capital, as you can imagine, those SMAs are oriented toward our large historical client base as well. Sure. I think, Ken, you broke up a little bit at the beginning of your question, but I think I got the gist of it. On the margin profile, in particular, I think you were asking about the comp expense in Q2. I think last quarter, we mentioned that our comp expense in Q1 was unusually high because of the elevated RSU-related expenses, and that will be flowing through as a seasonal factor in Q1 each year. So stepping down off of that number was not unexpected. The other piece of it that I referred to is we are, as we've talked about in the process of hiring to expand the business in all the ways that we've talked about. And much of that hiring did not kick in \u2013 to answer your question, we do expect that to kick in, in Q3 and Q4. So I would expect that comp expense line to normalize in Q3 and Q4. On the cost synergy side, as we've always talked about, this is not \u2013 this was never a transaction premised on cost synergies. We're much more focused on what we just answered on revenue synergies, and we're very optimistic about that. That being said, of course, we're looking to operate a cost-efficient business. And I'd say at this point, we believe we've realized at least $30 million of cost synergies, and we intend to invest most of that back into things like expanding our product development and expanding our distribution capabilities. Yes. Thanks for the question, Dan. We haven't put out specific guidance other than to say that this year we expect to be kind of a baseline off of which we will grow. And if you think about the levers of margin expansion in our business, it's really driven by operating leverage and revenue growth. And if you think about all the capital we are raising this year, much of which is not flowing into FAUM yet, particularly on the credit side. As we deploy that naturally, and obviously, we disclosed that in the earnings release as AUM not yet earning fees, which grew a lot quarter-over-quarter. That you can see in our disclosure, represents a significant amount of kind of shadow FRR, if you will. On top of that, we have the large climate-related funds. We are in the process of raising which will pay fees on committed capital. But not really activate until closer to the end of the year this year. So, you will see a full annualization of that fee income next year. So, those are the primary drivers of our, what I would say, our resumption of FRE margin expansion next year. And we certainly believe that as we continue to scale-up all of our businesses, we will get back to the original TPG target of 45%. And beyond that, we just haven't put a time on that yet. Hey Bill. Let me take the first part of that. On the FAUM role going forward, the way I would think about that is the significant pickup that we expect in credit deployment will obviously flow from AUM into FAUM. The minute we activate these big new pools of capital on the climate side, that will then create a significant step-up in FAUM. And that will be partially offset by realizations, but we certainly expect that be positive drivers will more than offset the realizations. And the reason we expect FRR growth next year is the net of all that will, in our minds, be expected to drive FAUM growth throughout the course of the year, next year. The other thing to keep in mind, Bill, is on realizations. If we sell a position that we have created value around, it's earning fees based on actively invested capital in those cases. And if we are selling it at, call it at, call, 3x our money, the dropout from FAUM is a lot less than the nominal amount sold."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the TPG's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's call is being recorded. Please go to TPG's IR website to obtain the earnings materials.\n I'll now turn the call over to Gary Stein, Head of Investor Relations at TPG. Thank you. You may begin. \nGary Stein: Great. Thanks, operator, and welcome, everyone. Joining me this morning are Jon Winkelried, Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Weingart, Chief Financial Officer. In addition, our President, Todd Sisitsky, is also here and will be available for the Q&A portion of this morning's call.\n I'd like to remind you this call may include forward-looking statements that do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to TPG's earnings release and SEC filings for factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. TPG undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements except as required by law.\n Within our discussion and earnings release, we're presenting GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We believe certain non-GAAP measures that we discuss on this call are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to the nearest GAAP figures in TPG's earnings release, which is available on our website. Please note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any TPG fund.\n Looking briefly at our results for the first quarter, we reported GAAP net income attributable to TPG, Inc., of $16 million and after-tax distributable earnings of $181 million or $0.49 per share of Class A common stock. We declared a dividend of $0.41 per share of Class A common stock, which will be paid on June 3 to holders of record as of May 20.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to Jon. \nJon Winkelried: Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone. TPG entered 2024 with significant momentum as a result of the step function change in scale, diversification and earnings power we experienced last year. This was driven by 3 primary factors: One, our successful fundraises for existing TPG strategies with vintage over vintage growth for our funds in TPG Capital, healthcare partners, Asia and Rise. Since going public, we have completed 6 successor fund raises in our private equity and real estate strategies and increased fund sizes by 27% on average.\n I'm pleased with the strong results our teams achieved, particularly in the face of a difficult fundraising environment. Two, our continued ability to innovate and grow organically into new areas, such as GP-led secondaries and real estate credit. And three, most notably, our acquisition of Angelo Gordon where we expanded into credit investing at scale and doubled the size of our real estate platform. To frame the breadth of our transformation at the end of the first quarter compared to a year ago, we grew our team over 60% to approximately 1,800 professionals. Our number of strategies increased from 18 to 30. Our fee-paying AUM grew 74% from $79 billion to $137 billion, and importantly, we are now more diversified with scaled platforms across private equity, credit and real estate. The latter 2 asset classes currently represent 44% of our total AUM.\n I'd like to take a moment to highlight our business in Asia, where we are celebrating our 30th anniversary. Since we first started investing in Asia in 1994, we've built a multi-strategy franchise with dedicated buyout, secondaries and real estate funds. We also actively invest in the region through our global growth and impact funds, and we've been particularly focused on markets such as India, which is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. Over the last 5 years, more than 40% of the capital we've deployed in Asia has been in India, and we've taken 8 portfolio companies public there since late 2021.\n In the Asia region broadly, we currently have over 250 colleagues working across 9 cities, and we recently completed several important fundraising campaigns that reflect our momentum and scale. Within our private equity platform, we held a final close for TPG Asia VIII last month. We raised approximately $600 million in the first quarter and over $345 million in early April, bringing the total fund size to approximately $5.3 billion 14% larger than its predecessor. In addition to the strong result in private equity, we also held final closes for 2 TPG AG real estate funds, Asia Realty V and our first Japan Realty Value Fund. We raised more than $2.5 billion of capital in aggregate, and both funds exceeded their respective fundraising targets. Looking ahead, we plan to extend our leadership position in Asia with near-term plans for further organic growth.\n Our credit platform is also experiencing strong momentum. In 2024, we're raising capital across credit solutions, middle market direct lending and structured credit. Since closing the Angelo Gordon acquisition in November, we've made meaningful progress introducing our respective TPG and AG clients to one another and delivering the combined platform with a particular focus on credit. We raised more than $2 billion in credit in the first quarter and over $800 million since quarter end, driven by closes in middle market direct lending and credit solutions.\n Notably, through April, we've closed on approximately $1 billion for our third essential housing fund within Credit Solutions. Essential housing was built to address the growing demand from residential homebuilders for bespoke land financing solutions. It's a great example of a scalable origination platform we created organically to provide our clients with a differentiated strategy and risk return profile.\n We've also been making good progress on organic growth initiatives and scaling new businesses. We expect our climate franchise to drive meaningful growth throughout 2024 and 2025 as we build on our market leadership position and impact investing. We are currently in the market with 3 climate strategies. The first is Rise Climate, our dedicated climate private equity strategy, which we launched in early 2021. The enormous capital needs for energy transition, combined with our focused investment strategy and distinctive sourcing capabilities, have generated robust pipelines and highly attractive investment opportunities over the last 3 years.\n Our inaugural fund, which is approximately 85% invested in reserve had value creation of 21% over the last 12 months. We are currently in the market with our second Rise Climate Fund and are seeing strong interest from both existing and new clients ahead of an expected first close in the third quarter. Secondly, we continue to innovate our climate private equity strategy through our recently launched Global South initiative. This is a new frontier for us focused on driving much needed capital to tackle the decarbonization challenge across the Global South.\n We announced an anchor commitment from ALT\u00c9RRA at the end of last year and expect to raise additional capital this year. And our third strategy is climate infrastructure, which we are building organically within our Rise platform. The energy transition will require a complete reconfiguration of global infrastructure and we are well positioned to become a leading provider of climate-related infrastructure capital. We continue to anticipate a successful first close for this strategy later this year.\n Our largest and most important clients are highly supportive of our efforts in Climate. And in the near term, we expect to announce additional strategic initiatives with partners that will continue to help us scale these strategies. We managed $19 billion of AUM across our market-leading impact platform today and expect to grow to more than $35 billion of AUM within 2 years. TPG GP solutions, our normal European and North American GP-led secondaries fund has completed 5 investments to date and in every transaction, we're engaging in meaningful bilateral dialogue between TGS and the sponsor to directly negotiate the transaction ahead of a broader syndication.\n Over the last several months, I've met with dozens of our largest clients around the world and the topic of secondaries, especially GP-led secondaries has been consistently top of mind given the liquidity pressures across private equity today. We expect to scale this strategy meaningfully over time.\n Finally, I'd like to highlight our focus on private wealth, where we are expanding our global distribution capabilities and developing products specifically tailored for this channel. We have historically raised $1 billion to $2 billion of capital annually from the wealth channel, and we're focused on growing that figure by several multiples over the coming years. During 2024, we plan to raise capital for 9 products in the wealth channel, including climate, growth, credit solutions, direct lending and structured credit.\n Looking forward, we plan to further expand our product set through the launch of semi-liquid funds beginning with private equity. We believe we are well positioned to offer retail investors differentiated products given our strong track record, distinct investment style, well-established global brand and existing relationships with key distribution partners. The addition of TPG AG credit, especially TCAP, our nontraded BDC managed by Twin Brook has accelerated our growing presence in the channel.\n Turning to deployment. You might recall from our last several earnings calls that we have been accelerating the pace of deployment across our platform, particularly in private equity and real estate for much of the past year. That trend has continued. In 2023, our deployment pace more than doubled in the second half of the year compared to the first half and has remained strong through the first quarter of 2024. We believe our robust investment activity relative to the broader alternative space has been driven by our distinctive sector-based sourcing approach and patient targeted strategy of developing our own proprietary opportunities including corporate carve-outs and structured partnerships.\n With over $51 billion of dry powder in an increasingly active market, we are well positioned to capitalize on the differentiated opportunities that our global investment teams are sourcing. We invested over $6 billion of capital in the first quarter, and I'll highlight some notable recent activity.\n Starting with our private equity strategies, our funds are on track for a 3- to 4-year deployment cycle. We continue to expect structured partnerships and carve-outs to be an important source of proprietary deal flow and are also beginning to see more sponsor to sponsor activity. Highlighted an interesting example of a corporate partnership after quarter end, our Rise and Rise Climate Funds invested in Syre, a company founded to decarbonized and de-waste the textile industry through recycling at hyperscale, starting with polyester. We are making this investment together with several key partners, including H&M, which entered into a multiyear offtake agreement for a significant share of their recycled polyester demand in connection with this transaction.\n Next, our real estate platforms ended the quarter with nearly $15 billion of dry powder on a combined basis. Our diversified capabilities with dedicated pools of both equity and debt capital enable us to provide solutions across capital structures globally. Within our equity strategies, a higher for longer rate environment is continuing to create a wide range of investment opportunities that we are pursuing on a very selective basis. Last month, TPG Real Estate completed the acquisition of a large office building in downtown Manhattan that will be converted into an approximately 800 unit multifamily rental property.\n This was a result of our broader thesis on secular headwinds within the office market and the opportunity to pursue office to residential conversions as multifamily fundamentals in New York City have been historically resilient. Within TPG AG real estate, our net lease business is seeing a significant increase in activity from corporate owner occupiers looking for sale leaseback transactions. Given the cost and challenges within the traditional financing markets, many companies are seeking alternative forms of balance sheet financing. As a result, we are seeing entry cap rates at their 15-year highs.\n During the first quarter, we entered into 3 separate sale leaseback transaction in highly attractive sectors, which are insulated from typical economic cycles. Our real estate credit strategy, TRECO, is purpose built to leverage our leading real estate platform and capitalize on what we see as the most attractive investing environment in the last 2 decades to provide capital solutions across the real estate credit market. We activated our inaugural fund in the first quarter and have already closed 3 investments, which underwrite mid-teens returns. The first investments are concentrated in the multifamily housing sector and are representative of the opportunities we are seeing as a result of elevated borrowing costs and a reduced lending appetite from banks.\n Finally, within credit, we deployed over $3 billion across our strategies in the first quarter. During what is normally a seasonally slower quarter, Twin Brook, our lower middle market direct lending business had its busiest first quarter ever with approximately $1.7 billion of net originations. Most of this volume was driven by M&A activity from sponsors seeking liquidity within their portfolios given the improved valuation environment. The pace of deployment with our asset-based lending and specialty finance strategy remains very strong as clients continue to diversify a portion of their fixed income allocations to private structured credit opportunities.\n During the quarter, TPG AG's first asset-based private credit fund, ABC, together with Barclays Bank announced a new lending partnership with Funding Circle to provide up to GBP 300 million of small loans for businesses in the U.K. ABC is already more than 75% deployed, and we are in the market with our new evergreen vehicle and our second ABC fund with anticipated closes in the second half of the year. \n Our corporate credit strategy, Credit Solutions continue to rotate its portfolio in response to changing market conditions. In 2022, we took advantage of higher yields and lower dollar prices to deploy capital opportunistically into the public debt markets. As spreads have tightened over the last year, recently touching near 5-year lows, we've shifted our focus to private opportunities where we control the economic, legal and structuring terms.\n Across our Credit Solutions funds, we generated more than $2.5 billion of gross sales over the past 12 months, achieving strong returns and recycling the proceeds into bespoke private financing transactions on what we believe are highly attractive terms. TPG AG Credit Solutions is well positioned as one of the few letters of scale and our pipeline for deployment is robust as corporate borrowers and sponsors seek sizable creative privately structured financing transactions.\n Moving to realizations. As we've mentioned before, we aggressively monetized our portfolio during the period of peak valuations a few years ago. Since mid-2022, we have been net buyers given the investment opportunities arising from the market dislocation. But now as we enter a relatively more stable environment with improving valuations, we are beginning to see selective monetization opportunities. We are cautiously optimistic regarding the outlook for potential realizations as our pipeline gradually builds. In the first quarter, we sold approximately half of Rise Climate's remaining position in Nextracker following its successful IPO just over a year ago.\n And last month, TPG Growth exited its investment in Onfido, a global leader in identity verification through a sale to Entrust. Capital Asia closed the sale of Singlife to Sumitomo Life during the quarter, bringing to conclusion a distinctive deal for our Asia franchise representing the first ever private equity insurance transaction of scale in Southeast Asia. And just last week, we successfully took Viking Cruises public and a $1.8 billion offering, the largest U.S. IPO so far this year. We priced near the top end of the initial range, and we're able to upsize the offering by over 45% from launch due to strong investor demand. The book was multiple times oversubscribed from high-quality blue-chip accounts. We originally invested in Viking in 2016, providing the company with its first institutional equity capital investment. \n We subsequently leaned in during the height of COVID in 2020 with a significant follow-on preferred investment. This was driven by our confidence in the company's long-term differentiated positioning and post-pandemic, Viking continues to achieve record booking levels. We're incredibly proud of the partnership we have built together.\n Taking a step back, we've successfully executed across a number of growth opportunities and our platform is substantially more scaled and diversified today. Since our last earnings call, we posted advisory committee meetings for 6 of our strategies, attended by nearly 150 of our LPs, and I've met with some of our largest clients around the world, including a visit to the Middle East a couple of weeks ago. Given the depth of our relationships, the focus of our conversations has evolved from single strategies to engaging on cross-platform solutions and meaningful strategic partnerships. Our largest clients want to do more with us, and we believe we are well positioned as the partner of choice, given our track record of delivering strong investment performance and differentiated deal flow. This is one of many clear levers we see to drive continued growth, and we look forward to executing on these opportunities over time.\n Now I'll turn it over to Jack to review our financial results. \nJack Weingart: Thanks, Jon, and thank you all for joining us today. We ended the first quarter with $224 billion of total assets under management, up 63% year-over-year. This was driven by $75 billion of acquired AUM from Angelo Gordon, $18 billion of capital raised and $7 billion of value creation, partially offset by $13 billion of realizations over the last 12 months.\n Fee earning AUM increased 74% year-over-year to $137 billion, and we ended the quarter with more than $51 billion of dry powder, representing 37% of fee earning AUM. We also had AUM subject to fee earning growth of $25 billion at the end of the quarter, of which $14 billion was not yet earning fees. Our fee-related revenue in the first quarter was $451 million, up 70% year-over-year, primarily driven by the acquisition of Angelo Gordon. It's important to point out, though, that in addition to the growth attributed to AG, TPG on a stand-alone basis grew fee-related revenue 20% organically year-over-year. Our Q1 FRR included management fees of $403 million and transaction fees of $34 million. The first quarter is typically seasonally light for new deal closings, but our transaction fees were strong due in part to a number of opportunistic refinancings for our existing portfolio companies, taking advantage of improving credit market conditions.\n Looking forward, we expect to drive further growth in transaction fees as we expand our capital markets team and integrate our broker-dealer capabilities into the TPG AG platform. We reported fee-related earnings of $182 million for the first quarter, up 84% year-over-year. And our FRE margin was 40%. As we noted on our last call, our normalized margin has blended down through the inclusion of TPG AG, and we now have an opportunity to drive profitable growth through margin expansion. Although our FRE margin will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter due to items such as catch-up fees and transaction fees, we expect our margin to exceed 40% for the full year in 2024 as we realize operating leverage from the integration and scaling of our businesses, while also investing in growth initiatives.\n Moving below FRE, we had $32 million of realized performance allocations in the quarter. While we've been net buyers over the last couple of years, we are gradually building our realization pipeline as the exit environment improves. As Jon mentioned, just last week, our portfolio company Viking Cruises, executed a highly successful IPO, the largest U.S. IPO so far this year. This is the largest remaining position in TPG VII, a 2015 vintage fund and we sold approximately $675 million of equity in the offer. We continue to differentiate ourselves with our fund investors through our consistent return of capital. While TPG VII is a strong promote paying fund, this particular monetization will not generate promote due to the fund waterfall mechanics. We currently expect PRE to begin picking up in the back half of this year.\n Our realized investment income and other line item in the first quarter included $8 million of noncore expenses related to the acquisition and ongoing integration of Angelo Gordon, a step down from $18 million last quarter. We expect to incur a similar level of quarterly noncore expenses through the end of this year, primarily focused on IT investments to integrate our operating platforms.\n After-tax distributable earnings for the first quarter totaled $181 million or $0.49 per share of Class A common stock. Our effective corporate tax rate was lower than usual in the quarter due to the tax benefits of the first annual vesting in January of our IPO and ordinary service RSUs. We expect this will be a recurring seasonal factor in the first quarter of each year going forward.\n Turning to our GAAP balance sheet. During the quarter, we issued long-term bonds for the first time, benefiting from the strong investment-grade credit ratings we obtained in connection with our IPO. We raised $1 billion through the highly successful issuance of 10-year senior notes and 40-year subordinated notes. We used the proceeds to fully repay our revolver which we had drawn in the fourth quarter in connection with the AG transaction to fully repay our term loan and to replenish additional cash on our balance sheet. Following these transactions, our balance sheet remains conservatively capitalized with moderate leverage and ample liquidity. We ended the first quarter with more than $290 million of cash and cash equivalents and $1.2 billion of undrawn capacity on our revolver, providing us with significant flexibility to continue investing in growth.\n Our net accrued performance balance at the end of the first quarter was $915 million compared to $891 million in the fourth quarter. This 3% increase was driven by $56 million of value creation in our investments, partially offset by the $32 million in realized gains. At the end of the first quarter, our performance-eligible AUM totaled $193 billion or 86% of our total AUM and of which $153 billion is currently generating performance fees.\n Our investment portfolio has continued to perform well. We generated positive value creation across all of our platforms for the first quarter and last 12 months. Our private equity portfolio, which includes capital, growth and impact platforms, appreciated approximately 2% in the first quarter and 7% over the last 12 months. In aggregate, our portfolio grew revenue by 19% over the last 12 months and margins have remained stable. Our credit portfolio appreciated 3% in the quarter and 15% over the last 12 months. This performance was consistent across our credit strategies and was driven by continued strong credit selection and low annualized loss ratios.\n TPG's real estate portfolio appreciated approximately 4% in the first quarter and 1% over the last 12 months, and TPG AG's real estate portfolio appreciated 40 basis points in the first quarter and 1% over the last 12 months. This positive value creation in a challenging commercial real estate market is attributable to the quality of our portfolio construction in our core thematic areas. These defensive sectors such as light industrial and student housing continue to see strong secular demand growth limited supply and rental rate improvements.\n Turning to fundraising. We raised $4.7 billion during the quarter. Approximately $2.1 billion of this capital was raised across TPG AG credit with nearly $1 billion in Credit Solutions and approximately $600 million in middle market direct lending. In addition, our private equity strategies raised $1.8 billion with incremental closings across Asia VIII and Growth VI.\n Looking forward, consistent with our prior guidance on fundraising, we continue to expect total private equity and infrastructure capital raised in 2024 to grow compared to 2023. Driven by the fundraises for growth and Rise Climate as well as the launch of our climate infrastructure strategy. More than 200 LPs in our growth, Rise and Rise Climate Funds are actually here with us in San Francisco today and tomorrow, for their respective annual meetings, providing us with a great opportunity to connect in person and discuss our strategies in depth. Notably, fundraising for our second Rise Climate Fund, which is our largest active campaign is off to a very strong start with high levels of investor interest and engagement. We expect a substantial re-upgrade among our current clients as well as new strategic partnerships, driving us toward a sizable first close in the third quarter.\n Additionally, in 2024, we expect fundraising for TPG AG credit to exceed $10 billion, more than doubling the capital raised by the platform last year. As Jon mentioned, we're seeing strong interest from some of our largest LPs in engaging with us about our credit strategies, and we're excited to share more with you in the coming quarters.\n To wrap up, we have significant growth opportunity ahead of us across all of our businesses. Our existing portfolio continues to deliver strong performance, and we're well positioned with substantial dry powder to deploy into an increasingly active market. We've been successfully scaling our existing businesses and investing into a number of growth initiatives that will contribute meaningfully to our business and build shareholder value over time. Now I'll turn the call back to the operator to take your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. \nCraig Siegenthaler: So our question is a big picture one on the investing side of the businesses. And we're focusing on the 3 large legacy TPG businesses, capital impacting growth. So if you strip out Angelo Gordon, the contribution was 55% of deployments, investing activity was somewhat muted in the capital business. So how are your investment pipelines tracking in the legacy TPG businesses? Are you expecting a significant ramp in capital and growth deployments later this year? And we track a lot of the activity. I think Classic Collisions and Olympus Terminals were the only recent announcements that could close in 2Q. I think Olympus was an impact investment too. \nJon Winkelried: Thanks, Craig. I'm going to let Todd start on that. \nTodd Sisitsky: Yes. I'll start that. Craig, thanks for the question. I don't want to repeat too much of what Jon said, but just from a framing standpoint relative to the legacy businesses, we actually felt very good about the deployment pace and probably as a forward indicator, the pipeline over the past almost a year now. I think we were earlier than some in terms of saying that we're seeing a significant pickup. And as Jon has mentioned, our legacy TPG deployment pace sort of more than doubled in the second half of '23 versus the first half of '23. When I look at the pipelines across our businesses, particularly on the legacy side, I continue to feel like the deployment pace is going to be strong going forward.\n From a qualitative standpoint, I think there are 2 reasons for that. There are sort of 2 drivers. One is more the macro where in private equity, you see bid-ask spreads narrowing, There's, I think, more of a knee for creative capital solutions that apply certainly to PE Credit Solutions and TTAD and other businesses need for liquidity and recapitalizations in real estate and elsewhere. I also feel like the stuff -- the second driver is more related to our particular approach to private equity, which is that our pipeline and our portfolios have a large number of often proprietary carve-outs structured relationships with strategics. It's really across growth capital Asia real estate and that side of the business has been -- is a little less cyclical, I think, than maybe the first side of the business is why I think we saw the pace increase as much as we did.\n On your specific comment about TPG Capital, that's our largest pool of capital as a firm. And we just finished fundraising for TPG IX and TPG Healthcare partners, too. And in TPG IX, we're about 50% invested and signed. And so very much on pace for the 3- to 4-year investment period that we think is prudent and the one that we have articulated to our LPs. You mentioned Classic Collision, which was announced, we did close G&A partners. So at a steady pace on that side on GP Solutions, which the business Jon highlighted, that's been -- we just had a pricing call -- investment committee call earlier this morning before I got on this call. \n We closed Yellow Hive in April so subsequent to the end of the quarter. TPG growth. We had 2 deals that closed in the quarter, one in March, one in January, Compass Surgical Partners, Sayari Labs, a deal on TTAD at ezCater. So I think that the overall picture for us on the legacy businesses has been a strong pace in the sense of not only a strong pipeline, but a differentiated pipeline. So we've been excited about the investments we've been able to execute on. And I think the broader market is coming back as well, but we felt at a steady pace through the first part of the year. \nJon Winkelried: Craig, the only thing I would add, and then we can move on is that just having come back from 2 days down at Milken and seeing a lot of our LPs, a lot of clients. The -- to Todd's point, we feel like our pipeline just deal flow around our firm is generally really strong. I think that one of the interesting, I think, questions going on in the market right now is the importance of -- and I think we're very focused on this is the importance of selectivity. \n And we definitely see an uptick in terms of overall kind of deal flow. I think the questions also relate to pricing in a number of cases as well because with financing having gotten much more fluid and available. And we're -- relative to last year, I think we see an increase in sponsor-to-sponsor level activity given the pressures on sponsors to try to return capital. And I think also again, as Todd said, we felt we were a little earlier in terms of some deal activity in the third and fourth quarters of last year. We liked the prices a lot, and we like our deal flow a lot I think that we're now seeing signs of, in some cases, what look like people sort of jumping over one another a little bit in terms of pricing and valuation. So I think there's some -- I think just continuing to keep our eyes on being selective and being focused on performance is something that's front and center for us. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. \nKenneth Worthington: I was hoping to get more color on your prepared remarks on the integration of Angelo Gordon. You mentioned cross marketing is well underway. What sort of reception are you getting given you have a number of Angelo Gordon funds in market this year. And as you think bigger picture about Angelo Gordon and next steps for growth, what are the priorities, say, over the next 12 months and then over the next 3 years as you build out the business? \nJon Winkelried: Good question. I mean, I think that if you were a fly on the wall inside of this organization, you wouldn't be able to miss the level of focus and intensity around the engagement between kind of TPG AG. And as I say that, too, I just think that the other sort of -- the other dynamic that I guess I would point to is that the integration of our 2 firms has gone extremely well. And again, every day, I think we don't think of ourselves as 2 firms. We think ourselves as 1 firm. And we've spent a lot of time using resources across both organizations to systematically deploy into our LP bases.\n And so all of us that do this very routinely in terms of meeting with our most significant relationships around the world are organizing and deploying together to make sure that it's clear that we are on firm now and that the strategies that are represented under the -- what was the AG umbrella are core parts of our strategy here as a firm. So if you were with me on my trip to the Middle East 2 weeks ago, you wouldn't be able to differentiate between me talking about our private equity strategies or our real estate strategies or our credit strategies.\n In other words, it's a core part of what we're talking about. And I think that as we do that, we're also having many, many meetings and discussions like down at Milken over the last 2 days. Most of our meetings were some combination of our private equity team and our credit teams together because one of the things that we feel is a differentiated part of our business now and our model is that we have the ability just like we've always collaborated between our strategies here at the firm, we have the ability to collaborate now between our PE and our credit businesses in terms of sourcing opportunities, valuing opportunities, and creating sort of value-add solutions that create really interesting investing opportunities.\n The thing that you're hearing around the world right now when you talk to LPs is this concept of solutions capital is becoming more and more prominent because of interest rates being higher for longer because of valuation dislocation, because of the pressure on sponsors to return capital, there's more and more focus on how to large institutional LPs use their capital to partner with us to create really interesting investment opportunities and return opportunities. And we just feel like we're incredibly well positioned with our clients to do that because if you look at the orientation that we've always gone to market with, we have our core strategies across the various asset classes.\n We have horizontal step-out strategies that provide solutions-based capital like our TGS business that Todd was talking about or tech adjacencies fund. And now within our credit strategy, things like credit solutions, given the leverage, the number of levered capital structures that need to be worked through or essential housing as an example, which is a kind of a purpose-built creative approach to financing the major homebuilders that are all ramping their production. And so we honestly feel great about it so far in terms of how we're delivering the firm holistically to our clients. So more to come on that. We'll keep you apprised, but we feel like we're really well positioned. \nJack Weingart: Ken, it's Jack. I would just add, you asked kind of what we're focused on going forward. As I think about it, it's scaling the existing TPG AG credit businesses, which we've talked about. It's innovating new products together and penetrating new channels together, including insurance. It opens up the -- obviously, the addition of the TPG AG credit businesses opens up the insurance channel like we've never had access to before, we're very focused on that.\n On scaling their existing businesses, as I mentioned in my comments, we are making very good progress with TPG's historically larger LPs in introducing the credit platforms to them. Jon talked about the ship to Middle East, the meetings at book and the fact is that we just launched most of those campaigns this year. And creating a new LP relationship in a new asset class is a multi-meeting cycle. So we're halfway through those meetings with some of our largest LPs. As I mentioned in my remarks, we will be sharing more about that in the coming quarters as we complete that multi-meeting cycle and bring in new clients to that platform. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. \nAlexander Blostein: So one of the key elements of growth strategy for the firm has been expansion into wealth. You highlighted a couple of things on this as well. But can you speak a little more to the sort of product development you expect to have over the next kind of 12 to 18 months when it comes to the wealth channel, both in terms of maybe the semi-liquid products and any other sources of capital raising you see there? \nJack Weingart: Sure. Thanks, Alex. I'll start on that, it's Jack.  Look, we're very focused, as we've been saying, on expanding our presence in the wealth platform, and that's got multiple dimensions to it. Where internally, we're significantly building our own resources in that area, building out our distribution team focused on wealth. On the new product side, we definitely see significant movement of client demand into permanent capital open-ended structures. We've obviously got TCAP, the direct lending vehicle in the market. We've got a couple of other vehicles already focused on that. We don't yet have a private equity semi-liquid product, but we're actively working on that. and expect to launch it early next year at the latest.\n And we expect that to be -- as you know, our performance across our private equity products around the world has been differentiated. And I would just say that all of our conversations with our partners on the bank channel side, they are very eager to have a differentiated TPG semiliquid private equity product in their channel. So we intend to keep pursuing that and other ways to access, which obviously is where client demand is slowing. It's also beneficial to us to have more stable and growing sources of capital that don't rely upon starting from scratch each fundraising cycle. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. \nMichael Cyprys: Just hoping to circle back to credit for a moment. I understand you have all -- I believe all your credit strategies and the market capital raising this year. I think you reiterated your expectations to raise over $10 billion in credit. But question, how should we think about the growth profile of the credit business on a multiyear basis? Would you anticipate any sort of slowdown in '25 or '26 as some of those strategies won't be in the market raising or do you think you can maintain or even grow that $10 billion pace on a multiyear basis? Just curious how you're thinking about that and what some of the biggest contributors might be within credit? \nJon Winkelried: Mike. Well, I think with respect to sort of the long-term growth profile, I think that -- and this is something that we talked about just after having completed the acquisition. If you look at the platforms within the credit business, all of them continue to outsource and out-originate the underlying capital base. So we have a factory and a team and a capability that's been built that I think I would describe as undercapitalized and that's obviously a clear opportunity for us.\n So the focus on raising over $10 billion of capital this year is the beginning of rightsizing the capital base associated with that business. I think that we have many opportunities as we digging into the business, if you look across our platform, and we have -- and you look at, for instance, our direct lending business, our Credit Solutions business and our structured credit business, I think we're in the right neighborhood in all 3 of those businesses in terms of what's coming and what's happening just in terms of the flows. If you look at our direct lending business, where we're currently focused on the lower middle market.\n We had our largest sourcing and origination quarter in the history of the business. And so the ability to continue to scale that business within the lower middle market and our differentiated position there is, I think, provides continued upside in growth within that platform. I mean just to give you an idea, right, we had new loan deployment in the first quarter of $1.7 billion. Just to give you a relative framework, the previous high quarter -- the previous high watermark for another quarter was the first quarter of 2021, where we originated $1 billion.\n So with the level of activity stepping up add-ons to the portfolio, this continues to represent a growth opportunity in the core part of our business there. And as we've talked about before, as companies grow and move out of the lower middle market into their next stage of life and the next -- and to their next owner, we have the ability to move with them in terms of what we think of as kind of companies that are graduating out of our portfolio. So I think that business has a lot of scale in front of it, both sourcing from institutional sources as well as from sourcing on the channel.\n The other piece of our business is on the structure -- flipping to the structured credit side. When you go around and you talk to sources of capital in credit right now, there is a lot of focus on how to continue to diversify exposures away from EBITDA-based credit. How do we think about our fixed income allocations and our private credit allocations moving from exposure to EBITDA-based credit, we're naturally, at some point, there will be some kind of a credit cycle to non-EBITDA-based credit, particularly given the constraints that we're seeing in the regional banking system and the lack of liquidity there. So I mentioned that in my prepared remarks in terms of some of the flow arrangements and the joint venture arrangements that we're creating.\n If you look at what's happening in the regional banking system, what we're seeing right now is we're at the part -- we're at the stage in the market development where people are trying to sell their highest priced assets and better assets to continue to work on capital levels within their businesses. We expect that to continue systemically. And so the opportunity to finance, do asset-based financing to finance nonbank lenders and having the factory that we built over time positions us to, I think, really continue to scale that business. \n So -- and again, we're out originating our capability there in terms of our embedded capital base. So we expect that we'll continue to grow both through asset base through co-mingled funds, SMAs and structured arrangements with clients as well as the opportunity potentially to take that to the wealth channel as well. And we're seeing people obviously think now evolve semi-liquid structures and permanent capital structures around non-EBITDA based credit opportunities. And then in Credit Solutions, looking at the opportunity in front of us there in terms of private market solutions. \n Just to give you an idea of the flow that we're seeing in that business. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're shifting toward private market solutions and the -- from kind of public opportunities just because of the compression in spreads. If you look at the number of levered capital structures and the compression in things like interest coverages, the significant backlog of companies trying to be sold or refinanced. This is going to be a really interesting source of bespoke return opportunities. And to give you an idea, in the first quarter, I think we signed something like between 60 to 70 NDAs with sponsors and companies to work on bespoke capital structures.\n And what we're doing is we're basically where appropriate, we're bringing together our private equity expertise where we've seen these companies before or we have industry expertise or sector knowledge with the tactical knowledge that we have on the credit solutions side and working on essentially these bespoke capital structure solutions. And there -- as you would imagine, given the size of some of the companies that are sponsor-controlled now, these opportunities are very large. So we're looking basically to raise more capital in the wake of those opportunities, partner with LPs in terms of co-invest opportunities. And we think that, that will continue to require more capital, and it's a big opportunity to grow into.\n And then we also have the essential housing business, where we originated that business and started that business with Lennar, first is our first partner, and we've now added 11 other homebuilders to the strategy. So that has the ability to continue to scale in a pretty major way. So that all -- you should put all of that in the context of at some point, will probably flow into a credit cycle managing through that credit cycle and being smart about deployment and how we deploy capital will be important not only to us but everyone in the market. So -- but anyway, that's the frame of reference that we have on the growth of the business going forward. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. \nDaniel Fannon: Jack, I wanted to follow up on your comments around transaction fees and maybe separate the near-term based upon activity levels and then the longer-term opportunity as you get the benefit fully from Angelo Gordon. And then also maybe if there was a split between the revenue contribution of the 2 businesses in this quarter to maybe get a sense of how that's tracking? \nJack Weingart: Sure. Let me start with the last question because it kind of frames the rest of it. The transaction fees in Q1 were almost entirely associated with legacy TPG businesses. Think about almost nothing coming from AG because that requires a little bit of work. We're in the process of integrating the broker-dealer into their businesses, requires a little bit of new hires. It requires a little bit of work on their fund documents to allow for more capital markets business. So that will be a growth driver going forward. The baseline in Q1 was a little higher than we indicated on our last call, we thought it would be because we didn't see a big enough new deal closing pipeline to get to the kind of levels we got to. \n As I mentioned in my remarks, that ended up being amplified by some opportunistic refinancing as credit spreads tightened, and we're able to improve the capital structures of many of our private equity portfolio companies. As I think about it, the current quarter represents a decent kind of average run rate for TPG's existing business in capital markets. We've -- we're expanding our -- and then from there, the growth will come from a couple of things. Number one, expanding that capability across more of TPG's business, as we grow in climate, as we grow in climate infrastructure. There are a lot of ancillary capital markets needs around those businesses and we intend to build a capital markets business to service those needs more broadly than just our private equity focus today.\n And then secondly, the AG opportunity, which I think you should expect to kick in really late this year and into next year as we keep doing the work that I outlined. So that -- those 2 elements on top of the current quarter, of course, you're going to see fluctuations quarter-to-quarter. But as you think about kind of the baseline for that business, over the coming couple of years, those 2 opportunities will create kind of 2 steps up in the average opportunity in that business. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian McKenna with Citizens JMP. \nBrian Mckenna: So a follow-up on AG Credit. How should we think about the change to fundraising and how that flows through into fee earning AUM? I'm assuming this will be more driven by deployment activity, but is there a way to think about the ramp of fee earning AUM inflows throughout 2024 for the segment, specifically? And then I know there can be some noise quarter-to-quarter on fee rates, but are the first quarter fee rates for AG Credit and AG real estate, good starting points for 2Q and beyond? \nJack Weingart: I'll start on that, I guess. I think the way I think about kind of the credit business flowing into FAUM is, first and foremost, deployment because almost all of the capital in that business pays fees on deployed capital only. I think all the fundraising you see us talking about in doing this year, the more than $10 billion is really setting us up for the second leg of growth next year. Most of the funds we're raising this year, some will be deployed this year, but it's hard to -- in your modeling, it's hard to draw a direct connection between this year's fundraising and 2024 FAUM and FRR, that's more driven by deployment pace in the near term.\n And I think on the average fee rate question, there's nothing abnormal in the first quarter there. As we talked about at the analysts, I guess the only thing I'd say is that there are obviously 3 or 4 different -- very different businesses within AG Credit, and the average fee rate will be driven more by the deployment mix across those businesses than it will be by some kind of macro factor. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Beatty with UBS. \nAdam Beatty: I want to follow up on the wealth management channel, focusing on your existing product set and your existing distribution relationships. I know there's a lot more to come on both those dimensions. But just trying to get a sense of among your distribution partners in wealth right now, how many of the products, Jon mentioned several products, out there targeting wealth. How many of those are on a given platform, what's kind of the average or what have you. What I'm trying to get at is maybe the near term, maybe next 12 months opportunity where you have a distribution relationship in wealth, you already have 1 or 2 products on there, but maybe not all of them. So how you could maybe roll more of those into those relationships in the near term. \nJon Winkelried: I think, as I mentioned in my comments, I think that what we have progressively over the last several years, it's not -- this is not a new phenomenon this year continue to be disciplined about establishing distribution arrangements and wealth arrangements for essentially every strategy we bring to market through various partners of ours. And of course, as you would imagine, we have multiple relationships and multiple partners, which we highly value. And that those products, in some cases, are being distributed through, in some cases, one partner.\n And in some cases, a particular strategy is being distributed actually through multiple partners depending on the sequencing of when we're launching and then frankly, the calendar schedule that our partners have as well in terms of kind of queuing up various strategies. And those are for sort of the traditional fund structures that we've historically brought to market. And we're continuing to do that, and we've ramped that over last year and now into this year.\n So to the extent that you see products of ours that are in the market that we're fundraising for, there will be a private well strategy around essentially all of them. We are, as we said before, and obviously, all of the important partners in the market are partners of ours as a result of our brand and our performance and the relationship that we've established with those partners over time through multiple interactions at different levels of these organizations.\n And I spend time, Jack spends time, Todd's spends time, Jim spends time with meeting with these partners, both in terms of the strategic relationship at the top of the house as well as on the key people that are driving those distribution relationships into private wealth and marketing our brand, marketing our strategies, meeting with advisers, et cetera. So we're well into that process in terms of how we're approaching it. So you should expect, I think, that we'll continue to kind of up-ramp the overall level of distribution and the amount of capital we're raising and that over time, the pie chart of distribution for our capital will continue to inflect more and more towards wealth as we do that.\n We're obviously now focused on the next stage of that, which is these continuously offered products, which are very important. Jack mentioned that and emphasized that in the channel now, the ability for advisers to recommend to their clients to allocate into various strategies is requiring alternative products to be available on a continuous basis. So just like mutual funds are or other products are in the market. And so we're actively working on structuring and preparing our semi-liquid private wealth product that Jack already talked about, and we will be launching that into the channel. We have our BDC from our Twin Brook business that's actively being marketed in the channel. \n Over time, I think you -- what you should probably expect to see from us is other continuously offered product maybe in the form of nontraded REITs for parts of our business as well. So I think that's what you should expect. And we know that it is a significant source of capital on a go-forward basis and the relative allocation in that channel is certainly less than what we see on the institutional side. So the ability to kind of have a multiplier effect in terms of growth is clearly present. \nOperator: Our final question comes from Bill Katz with TD Cowen. \nWilliam Katz: So maybe a question on your longer-term FRE margins sort of heard the affirmation of sort of getting to that 40% plus margin for this year. But as you think about the step function of the scaling of the credit platform, the scaling of your capital solutions footprint. I was just sort of wondering, as we look beyond '24 into '25, maybe '26, how do you sort of see the profile of the company? Can you realign with some of the bigger peers? Or is there a different sort of glide path from here? \nJack Weingart: Yes. Good question, Bill. We have not provided any longer-term FRE margin guidance other than to say that we do believe we'll be expanding back to 45% and eventually higher, which was our initial TPG target margin. As you think about our margin profile and the reason we reiterated 40% for this year, think about a lot of the FRR contributors and the fundraising activity we have this year, our current assumption is that the biggest fundraises we're in the market with right now that have fees on committed capital, that being across all the climate strategies, we're assuming those probably turn on in the third and fourth quarter of this year, that means that FRR from those businesses doesn't really pick up meaningfully until I call it the fourth quarter. We could be wrong about that. \n We could accelerate the activation earlier, but that's our assumption. But during the course of the year, the investment we're making in raising those funds, which will become more and more visible in the coming quarters, will set us up for more meaningful FRR growth next year as you get the annualized benefit of that plus accelerated credit deployment. So as we're thinking about the FRE margin trajectory, we do believe that the guidance toward exceeding 40% this year is the right guidance. And then we'll begin to see an acceleration of FRE margin expansion next year as some of those FRR drivers kick in next year. And there's no reason we shouldn't get back to 45% and eventually higher than that as we keep scaling our business. \nOperator: This concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I would now like to turn the call back over to Gary Stein for closing remarks. \nGary Stein: Great. Thank you. Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking to you again next quarter. And in the meantime, if you have any questions, feel free to follow up with the IR team. \nJon Winkelried: Thanks, everyone. \nOperator: This concludes today's TPG's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jon Winkelried",
            "content": "Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone. TPG entered 2024 with significant momentum as a result of the step function change in scale, diversification and earnings power we experienced last year. This was driven by 3 primary factors: One, our successful fundraises for existing TPG strategies with vintage over vintage growth for our funds in TPG Capital, healthcare partners, Asia and Rise. Since going public, we have completed 6 successor fund raises in our private equity and real estate strategies and increased fund sizes by 27% on average.\n I'm pleased with the strong results our teams achieved, particularly in the face of a difficult fundraising environment. Two, our continued ability to innovate and grow organically into new areas, such as GP-led secondaries and real estate credit. And three, most notably, our acquisition of Angelo Gordon where we expanded into credit investing at scale and doubled the size of our real estate platform. To frame the breadth of our transformation at the end of the first quarter compared to a year ago, we grew our team over 60% to approximately 1,800 professionals. Our number of strategies increased from 18 to 30. Our fee-paying AUM grew 74% from $79 billion to $137 billion, and importantly, we are now more diversified with scaled platforms across private equity, credit and real estate. The latter 2 asset classes currently represent 44% of our total AUM.\n I'd like to take a moment to highlight our business in Asia, where we are celebrating our 30th anniversary. Since we first started investing in Asia in 1994, we've built a multi-strategy franchise with dedicated buyout, secondaries and real estate funds. We also actively invest in the region through our global growth and impact funds, and we've been particularly focused on markets such as India, which is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. Over the last 5 years, more than 40% of the capital we've deployed in Asia has been in India, and we've taken 8 portfolio companies public there since late 2021.\n In the Asia region broadly, we currently have over 250 colleagues working across 9 cities, and we recently completed several important fundraising campaigns that reflect our momentum and scale. Within our private equity platform, we held a final close for TPG Asia VIII last month. We raised approximately $600 million in the first quarter and over $345 million in early April, bringing the total fund size to approximately $5.3 billion 14% larger than its predecessor. In addition to the strong result in private equity, we also held final closes for 2 TPG AG real estate funds, Asia Realty V and our first Japan Realty Value Fund. We raised more than $2.5 billion of capital in aggregate, and both funds exceeded their respective fundraising targets. Looking ahead, we plan to extend our leadership position in Asia with near-term plans for further organic growth.\n Our credit platform is also experiencing strong momentum. In 2024, we're raising capital across credit solutions, middle market direct lending and structured credit. Since closing the Angelo Gordon acquisition in November, we've made meaningful progress introducing our respective TPG and AG clients to one another and delivering the combined platform with a particular focus on credit. We raised more than $2 billion in credit in the first quarter and over $800 million since quarter end, driven by closes in middle market direct lending and credit solutions.\n Notably, through April, we've closed on approximately $1 billion for our third essential housing fund within Credit Solutions. Essential housing was built to address the growing demand from residential homebuilders for bespoke land financing solutions. It's a great example of a scalable origination platform we created organically to provide our clients with a differentiated strategy and risk return profile.\n We've also been making good progress on organic growth initiatives and scaling new businesses. We expect our climate franchise to drive meaningful growth throughout 2024 and 2025 as we build on our market leadership position and impact investing. We are currently in the market with 3 climate strategies. The first is Rise Climate, our dedicated climate private equity strategy, which we launched in early 2021. The enormous capital needs for energy transition, combined with our focused investment strategy and distinctive sourcing capabilities, have generated robust pipelines and highly attractive investment opportunities over the last 3 years.\n Our inaugural fund, which is approximately 85% invested in reserve had value creation of 21% over the last 12 months. We are currently in the market with our second Rise Climate Fund and are seeing strong interest from both existing and new clients ahead of an expected first close in the third quarter. Secondly, we continue to innovate our climate private equity strategy through our recently launched Global South initiative. This is a new frontier for us focused on driving much needed capital to tackle the decarbonization challenge across the Global South.\n We announced an anchor commitment from ALTE\u0301RRA at the end of last year and expect to raise additional capital this year. And our third strategy is climate infrastructure, which we are building organically within our Rise platform. The energy transition will require a complete reconfiguration of global infrastructure and we are well positioned to become a leading provider of climate-related infrastructure capital. We continue to anticipate a successful first close for this strategy later this year.\n Our largest and most important clients are highly supportive of our efforts in Climate. And in the near term, we expect to announce additional strategic initiatives with partners that will continue to help us scale these strategies. We managed $19 billion of AUM across our market-leading impact platform today and expect to grow to more than $35 billion of AUM within 2 years. TPG GP solutions, our normal European and North American GP-led secondaries fund has completed 5 investments to date and in every transaction, we're engaging in meaningful bilateral dialogue between TGS and the sponsor to directly negotiate the transaction ahead of a broader syndication.\n Over the last several months, I've met with dozens of our largest clients around the world and the topic of secondaries, especially GP-led secondaries has been consistently top of mind given the liquidity pressures across private equity today. We expect to scale this strategy meaningfully over time.\n Finally, I'd like to highlight our focus on private wealth, where we are expanding our global distribution capabilities and developing products specifically tailored for this channel. We have historically raised $1 billion to $2 billion of capital annually from the wealth channel, and we're focused on growing that figure by several multiples over the coming years. During 2024, we plan to raise capital for 9 products in the wealth channel, including climate, growth, credit solutions, direct lending and structured credit.\n Looking forward, we plan to further expand our product set through the launch of semi-liquid funds beginning with private equity. We believe we are well positioned to offer retail investors differentiated products given our strong track record, distinct investment style, well-established global brand and existing relationships with key distribution partners. The addition of TPG AG credit, especially TCAP, our nontraded BDC managed by Twin Brook has accelerated our growing presence in the channel.\n Turning to deployment. You might recall from our last several earnings calls that we have been accelerating the pace of deployment across our platform, particularly in private equity and real estate for much of the past year. That trend has continued. In 2023, our deployment pace more than doubled in the second half of the year compared to the first half and has remained strong through the first quarter of 2024. We believe our robust investment activity relative to the broader alternative space has been driven by our distinctive sector-based sourcing approach and patient targeted strategy of developing our own proprietary opportunities including corporate carve-outs and structured partnerships.\n With over $51 billion of dry powder in an increasingly active market, we are well positioned to capitalize on the differentiated opportunities that our global investment teams are sourcing. We invested over $6 billion of capital in the first quarter, and I'll highlight some notable recent activity.\n Starting with our private equity strategies, our funds are on track for a 3- to 4-year deployment cycle. We continue to expect structured partnerships and carve-outs to be an important source of proprietary deal flow and are also beginning to see more sponsor to sponsor activity. Highlighted an interesting example of a corporate partnership after quarter end, our Rise and Rise Climate Funds invested in Syre, a company founded to decarbonized and de-waste the textile industry through recycling at hyperscale, starting with polyester. We are making this investment together with several key partners, including H&M, which entered into a multiyear offtake agreement for a significant share of their recycled polyester demand in connection with this transaction.\n Next, our real estate platforms ended the quarter with nearly $15 billion of dry powder on a combined basis. Our diversified capabilities with dedicated pools of both equity and debt capital enable us to provide solutions across capital structures globally. Within our equity strategies, a higher for longer rate environment is continuing to create a wide range of investment opportunities that we are pursuing on a very selective basis. Last month, TPG Real Estate completed the acquisition of a large office building in downtown Manhattan that will be converted into an approximately 800 unit multifamily rental property.\n This was a result of our broader thesis on secular headwinds within the office market and the opportunity to pursue office to residential conversions as multifamily fundamentals in New York City have been historically resilient. Within TPG AG real estate, our net lease business is seeing a significant increase in activity from corporate owner occupiers looking for sale leaseback transactions. Given the cost and challenges within the traditional financing markets, many companies are seeking alternative forms of balance sheet financing. As a result, we are seeing entry cap rates at their 15-year highs.\n During the first quarter, we entered into 3 separate sale leaseback transaction in highly attractive sectors, which are insulated from typical economic cycles. Our real estate credit strategy, TRECO, is purpose built to leverage our leading real estate platform and capitalize on what we see as the most attractive investing environment in the last 2 decades to provide capital solutions across the real estate credit market. We activated our inaugural fund in the first quarter and have already closed 3 investments, which underwrite mid-teens returns. The first investments are concentrated in the multifamily housing sector and are representative of the opportunities we are seeing as a result of elevated borrowing costs and a reduced lending appetite from banks.\n Finally, within credit, we deployed over $3 billion across our strategies in the first quarter. During what is normally a seasonally slower quarter, Twin Brook, our lower middle market direct lending business had its busiest first quarter ever with approximately $1.7 billion of net originations. Most of this volume was driven by M&A activity from sponsors seeking liquidity within their portfolios given the improved valuation environment. The pace of deployment with our asset-based lending and specialty finance strategy remains very strong as clients continue to diversify a portion of their fixed income allocations to private structured credit opportunities.\n During the quarter, TPG AG's first asset-based private credit fund, ABC, together with Barclays Bank announced a new lending partnership with Funding Circle to provide up to GBP 300 million of small loans for businesses in the U.K. ABC is already more than 75% deployed, and we are in the market with our new evergreen vehicle and our second ABC fund with anticipated closes in the second half of the year. \n Our corporate credit strategy, Credit Solutions continue to rotate its portfolio in response to changing market conditions. In 2022, we took advantage of higher yields and lower dollar prices to deploy capital opportunistically into the public debt markets. As spreads have tightened over the last year, recently touching near 5-year lows, we've shifted our focus to private opportunities where we control the economic, legal and structuring terms.\n Across our Credit Solutions funds, we generated more than $2.5 billion of gross sales over the past 12 months, achieving strong returns and recycling the proceeds into bespoke private financing transactions on what we believe are highly attractive terms. TPG AG Credit Solutions is well positioned as one of the few letters of scale and our pipeline for deployment is robust as corporate borrowers and sponsors seek sizable creative privately structured financing transactions.\n Moving to realizations. As we've mentioned before, we aggressively monetized our portfolio during the period of peak valuations a few years ago. Since mid-2022, we have been net buyers given the investment opportunities arising from the market dislocation. But now as we enter a relatively more stable environment with improving valuations, we are beginning to see selective monetization opportunities. We are cautiously optimistic regarding the outlook for potential realizations as our pipeline gradually builds. In the first quarter, we sold approximately half of Rise Climate's remaining position in Nextracker following its successful IPO just over a year ago.\n And last month, TPG Growth exited its investment in Onfido, a global leader in identity verification through a sale to Entrust. Capital Asia closed the sale of Singlife to Sumitomo Life during the quarter, bringing to conclusion a distinctive deal for our Asia franchise representing the first ever private equity insurance transaction of scale in Southeast Asia. And just last week, we successfully took Viking Cruises public and a $1.8 billion offering, the largest U.S. IPO so far this year. We priced near the top end of the initial range, and we're able to upsize the offering by over 45% from launch due to strong investor demand. The book was multiple times oversubscribed from high-quality blue-chip accounts. We originally invested in Viking in 2016, providing the company with its first institutional equity capital investment. \n We subsequently leaned in during the height of COVID in 2020 with a significant follow-on preferred investment. This was driven by our confidence in the company's long-term differentiated positioning and post-pandemic, Viking continues to achieve record booking levels. We're incredibly proud of the partnership we have built together.\n Taking a step back, we've successfully executed across a number of growth opportunities and our platform is substantially more scaled and diversified today. Since our last earnings call, we posted advisory committee meetings for 6 of our strategies, attended by nearly 150 of our LPs, and I've met with some of our largest clients around the world, including a visit to the Middle East a couple of weeks ago. Given the depth of our relationships, the focus of our conversations has evolved from single strategies to engaging on cross-platform solutions and meaningful strategic partnerships. Our largest clients want to do more with us, and we believe we are well positioned as the partner of choice, given our track record of delivering strong investment performance and differentiated deal flow. This is one of many clear levers we see to drive continued growth, and we look forward to executing on these opportunities over time.\n Now I'll turn it over to Jack to review our financial results. Thanks, Craig. I'm going to let Todd start on that. Craig, the only thing I would add, and then we can move on is that just having come back from 2 days down at Milken and seeing a lot of our LPs, a lot of clients. The -- to Todd's point, we feel like our pipeline just deal flow around our firm is generally really strong. I think that one of the interesting, I think, questions going on in the market right now is the importance of -- and I think we're very focused on this is the importance of selectivity. \n And we definitely see an uptick in terms of overall kind of deal flow. I think the questions also relate to pricing in a number of cases as well because with financing having gotten much more fluid and available. And we're -- relative to last year, I think we see an increase in sponsor-to-sponsor level activity given the pressures on sponsors to try to return capital. And I think also again, as Todd said, we felt we were a little earlier in terms of some deal activity in the third and fourth quarters of last year. We liked the prices a lot, and we like our deal flow a lot I think that we're now seeing signs of, in some cases, what look like people sort of jumping over one another a little bit in terms of pricing and valuation. So I think there's some -- I think just continuing to keep our eyes on being selective and being focused on performance is something that's front and center for us. Good question. I mean, I think that if you were a fly on the wall inside of this organization, you wouldn't be able to miss the level of focus and intensity around the engagement between kind of TPG AG. And as I say that, too, I just think that the other sort of -- the other dynamic that I guess I would point to is that the integration of our 2 firms has gone extremely well. And again, every day, I think we don't think of ourselves as 2 firms. We think ourselves as 1 firm. And we've spent a lot of time using resources across both organizations to systematically deploy into our LP bases.\n And so all of us that do this very routinely in terms of meeting with our most significant relationships around the world are organizing and deploying together to make sure that it's clear that we are on firm now and that the strategies that are represented under the -- what was the AG umbrella are core parts of our strategy here as a firm. So if you were with me on my trip to the Middle East 2 weeks ago, you wouldn't be able to differentiate between me talking about our private equity strategies or our real estate strategies or our credit strategies.\n In other words, it's a core part of what we're talking about. And I think that as we do that, we're also having many, many meetings and discussions like down at Milken over the last 2 days. Most of our meetings were some combination of our private equity team and our credit teams together because one of the things that we feel is a differentiated part of our business now and our model is that we have the ability just like we've always collaborated between our strategies here at the firm, we have the ability to collaborate now between our PE and our credit businesses in terms of sourcing opportunities, valuing opportunities, and creating sort of value-add solutions that create really interesting investing opportunities.\n The thing that you're hearing around the world right now when you talk to LPs is this concept of solutions capital is becoming more and more prominent because of interest rates being higher for longer because of valuation dislocation, because of the pressure on sponsors to return capital, there's more and more focus on how to large institutional LPs use their capital to partner with us to create really interesting investment opportunities and return opportunities. And we just feel like we're incredibly well positioned with our clients to do that because if you look at the orientation that we've always gone to market with, we have our core strategies across the various asset classes.\n We have horizontal step-out strategies that provide solutions-based capital like our TGS business that Todd was talking about or tech adjacencies fund. And now within our credit strategy, things like credit solutions, given the leverage, the number of levered capital structures that need to be worked through or essential housing as an example, which is a kind of a purpose-built creative approach to financing the major homebuilders that are all ramping their production. And so we honestly feel great about it so far in terms of how we're delivering the firm holistically to our clients. So more to come on that. We'll keep you apprised, but we feel like we're really well positioned. Mike. Well, I think with respect to sort of the long-term growth profile, I think that -- and this is something that we talked about just after having completed the acquisition. If you look at the platforms within the credit business, all of them continue to outsource and out-originate the underlying capital base. So we have a factory and a team and a capability that's been built that I think I would describe as undercapitalized and that's obviously a clear opportunity for us.\n So the focus on raising over $10 billion of capital this year is the beginning of rightsizing the capital base associated with that business. I think that we have many opportunities as we digging into the business, if you look across our platform, and we have -- and you look at, for instance, our direct lending business, our Credit Solutions business and our structured credit business, I think we're in the right neighborhood in all 3 of those businesses in terms of what's coming and what's happening just in terms of the flows. If you look at our direct lending business, where we're currently focused on the lower middle market.\n We had our largest sourcing and origination quarter in the history of the business. And so the ability to continue to scale that business within the lower middle market and our differentiated position there is, I think, provides continued upside in growth within that platform. I mean just to give you an idea, right, we had new loan deployment in the first quarter of $1.7 billion. Just to give you a relative framework, the previous high quarter -- the previous high watermark for another quarter was the first quarter of 2021, where we originated $1 billion.\n So with the level of activity stepping up add-ons to the portfolio, this continues to represent a growth opportunity in the core part of our business there. And as we've talked about before, as companies grow and move out of the lower middle market into their next stage of life and the next -- and to their next owner, we have the ability to move with them in terms of what we think of as kind of companies that are graduating out of our portfolio. So I think that business has a lot of scale in front of it, both sourcing from institutional sources as well as from sourcing on the channel.\n The other piece of our business is on the structure -- flipping to the structured credit side. When you go around and you talk to sources of capital in credit right now, there is a lot of focus on how to continue to diversify exposures away from EBITDA-based credit. How do we think about our fixed income allocations and our private credit allocations moving from exposure to EBITDA-based credit, we're naturally, at some point, there will be some kind of a credit cycle to non-EBITDA-based credit, particularly given the constraints that we're seeing in the regional banking system and the lack of liquidity there. So I mentioned that in my prepared remarks in terms of some of the flow arrangements and the joint venture arrangements that we're creating.\n If you look at what's happening in the regional banking system, what we're seeing right now is we're at the part -- we're at the stage in the market development where people are trying to sell their highest priced assets and better assets to continue to work on capital levels within their businesses. We expect that to continue systemically. And so the opportunity to finance, do asset-based financing to finance nonbank lenders and having the factory that we built over time positions us to, I think, really continue to scale that business. \n So -- and again, we're out originating our capability there in terms of our embedded capital base. So we expect that we'll continue to grow both through asset base through co-mingled funds, SMAs and structured arrangements with clients as well as the opportunity potentially to take that to the wealth channel as well. And we're seeing people obviously think now evolve semi-liquid structures and permanent capital structures around non-EBITDA based credit opportunities. And then in Credit Solutions, looking at the opportunity in front of us there in terms of private market solutions. \n Just to give you an idea of the flow that we're seeing in that business. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're shifting toward private market solutions and the -- from kind of public opportunities just because of the compression in spreads. If you look at the number of levered capital structures and the compression in things like interest coverages, the significant backlog of companies trying to be sold or refinanced. This is going to be a really interesting source of bespoke return opportunities. And to give you an idea, in the first quarter, I think we signed something like between 60 to 70 NDAs with sponsors and companies to work on bespoke capital structures.\n And what we're doing is we're basically where appropriate, we're bringing together our private equity expertise where we've seen these companies before or we have industry expertise or sector knowledge with the tactical knowledge that we have on the credit solutions side and working on essentially these bespoke capital structure solutions. And there -- as you would imagine, given the size of some of the companies that are sponsor-controlled now, these opportunities are very large. So we're looking basically to raise more capital in the wake of those opportunities, partner with LPs in terms of co-invest opportunities. And we think that, that will continue to require more capital, and it's a big opportunity to grow into.\n And then we also have the essential housing business, where we originated that business and started that business with Lennar, first is our first partner, and we've now added 11 other homebuilders to the strategy. So that has the ability to continue to scale in a pretty major way. So that all -- you should put all of that in the context of at some point, will probably flow into a credit cycle managing through that credit cycle and being smart about deployment and how we deploy capital will be important not only to us but everyone in the market. So -- but anyway, that's the frame of reference that we have on the growth of the business going forward. I think, as I mentioned in my comments, I think that what we have progressively over the last several years, it's not -- this is not a new phenomenon this year continue to be disciplined about establishing distribution arrangements and wealth arrangements for essentially every strategy we bring to market through various partners of ours. And of course, as you would imagine, we have multiple relationships and multiple partners, which we highly value. And that those products, in some cases, are being distributed through, in some cases, one partner.\n And in some cases, a particular strategy is being distributed actually through multiple partners depending on the sequencing of when we're launching and then frankly, the calendar schedule that our partners have as well in terms of kind of queuing up various strategies. And those are for sort of the traditional fund structures that we've historically brought to market. And we're continuing to do that, and we've ramped that over last year and now into this year.\n So to the extent that you see products of ours that are in the market that we're fundraising for, there will be a private well strategy around essentially all of them. We are, as we said before, and obviously, all of the important partners in the market are partners of ours as a result of our brand and our performance and the relationship that we've established with those partners over time through multiple interactions at different levels of these organizations.\n And I spend time, Jack spends time, Todd's spends time, Jim spends time with meeting with these partners, both in terms of the strategic relationship at the top of the house as well as on the key people that are driving those distribution relationships into private wealth and marketing our brand, marketing our strategies, meeting with advisers, et cetera. So we're well into that process in terms of how we're approaching it. So you should expect, I think, that we'll continue to kind of up-ramp the overall level of distribution and the amount of capital we're raising and that over time, the pie chart of distribution for our capital will continue to inflect more and more towards wealth as we do that.\n We're obviously now focused on the next stage of that, which is these continuously offered products, which are very important. Jack mentioned that and emphasized that in the channel now, the ability for advisers to recommend to their clients to allocate into various strategies is requiring alternative products to be available on a continuous basis. So just like mutual funds are or other products are in the market. And so we're actively working on structuring and preparing our semi-liquid private wealth product that Jack already talked about, and we will be launching that into the channel. We have our BDC from our Twin Brook business that's actively being marketed in the channel. \n Over time, I think you -- what you should probably expect to see from us is other continuously offered product maybe in the form of nontraded REITs for parts of our business as well. So I think that's what you should expect. And we know that it is a significant source of capital on a go-forward basis and the relative allocation in that channel is certainly less than what we see on the institutional side. So the ability to kind of have a multiplier effect in terms of growth is clearly present. Thanks, everyone."

            "name": "Todd Sisitsky",
            "content": "Yes. I'll start that. Craig, thanks for the question. I don't want to repeat too much of what Jon said, but just from a framing standpoint relative to the legacy businesses, we actually felt very good about the deployment pace and probably as a forward indicator, the pipeline over the past almost a year now. I think we were earlier than some in terms of saying that we're seeing a significant pickup. And as Jon has mentioned, our legacy TPG deployment pace sort of more than doubled in the second half of '23 versus the first half of '23. When I look at the pipelines across our businesses, particularly on the legacy side, I continue to feel like the deployment pace is going to be strong going forward.\n From a qualitative standpoint, I think there are 2 reasons for that. There are sort of 2 drivers. One is more the macro where in private equity, you see bid-ask spreads narrowing, There's, I think, more of a knee for creative capital solutions that apply certainly to PE Credit Solutions and TTAD and other businesses need for liquidity and recapitalizations in real estate and elsewhere. I also feel like the stuff -- the second driver is more related to our particular approach to private equity, which is that our pipeline and our portfolios have a large number of often proprietary carve-outs structured relationships with strategics. It's really across growth capital Asia real estate and that side of the business has been -- is a little less cyclical, I think, than maybe the first side of the business is why I think we saw the pace increase as much as we did.\n On your specific comment about TPG Capital, that's our largest pool of capital as a firm. And we just finished fundraising for TPG IX and TPG Healthcare partners, too. And in TPG IX, we're about 50% invested and signed. And so very much on pace for the 3- to 4-year investment period that we think is prudent and the one that we have articulated to our LPs. You mentioned Classic Collision, which was announced, we did close G&A partners. So at a steady pace on that side on GP Solutions, which the business Jon highlighted, that's been -- we just had a pricing call -- investment committee call earlier this morning before I got on this call. \n We closed Yellow Hive in April so subsequent to the end of the quarter. TPG growth. We had 2 deals that closed in the quarter, one in March, one in January, Compass Surgical Partners, Sayari Labs, a deal on TTAD at ezCater. So I think that the overall picture for us on the legacy businesses has been a strong pace in the sense of not only a strong pipeline, but a differentiated pipeline. So we've been excited about the investments we've been able to execute on. And I think the broader market is coming back as well, but we felt at a steady pace through the first part of the year."

            "name": "Jack Weingart",
            "content": "Thanks, Jon, and thank you all for joining us today. We ended the first quarter with $224 billion of total assets under management, up 63% year-over-year. This was driven by $75 billion of acquired AUM from Angelo Gordon, $18 billion of capital raised and $7 billion of value creation, partially offset by $13 billion of realizations over the last 12 months.\n Fee earning AUM increased 74% year-over-year to $137 billion, and we ended the quarter with more than $51 billion of dry powder, representing 37% of fee earning AUM. We also had AUM subject to fee earning growth of $25 billion at the end of the quarter, of which $14 billion was not yet earning fees. Our fee-related revenue in the first quarter was $451 million, up 70% year-over-year, primarily driven by the acquisition of Angelo Gordon. It's important to point out, though, that in addition to the growth attributed to AG, TPG on a stand-alone basis grew fee-related revenue 20% organically year-over-year. Our Q1 FRR included management fees of $403 million and transaction fees of $34 million. The first quarter is typically seasonally light for new deal closings, but our transaction fees were strong due in part to a number of opportunistic refinancings for our existing portfolio companies, taking advantage of improving credit market conditions.\n Looking forward, we expect to drive further growth in transaction fees as we expand our capital markets team and integrate our broker-dealer capabilities into the TPG AG platform. We reported fee-related earnings of $182 million for the first quarter, up 84% year-over-year. And our FRE margin was 40%. As we noted on our last call, our normalized margin has blended down through the inclusion of TPG AG, and we now have an opportunity to drive profitable growth through margin expansion. Although our FRE margin will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter due to items such as catch-up fees and transaction fees, we expect our margin to exceed 40% for the full year in 2024 as we realize operating leverage from the integration and scaling of our businesses, while also investing in growth initiatives.\n Moving below FRE, we had $32 million of realized performance allocations in the quarter. While we've been net buyers over the last couple of years, we are gradually building our realization pipeline as the exit environment improves. As Jon mentioned, just last week, our portfolio company Viking Cruises, executed a highly successful IPO, the largest U.S. IPO so far this year. This is the largest remaining position in TPG VII, a 2015 vintage fund and we sold approximately $675 million of equity in the offer. We continue to differentiate ourselves with our fund investors through our consistent return of capital. While TPG VII is a strong promote paying fund, this particular monetization will not generate promote due to the fund waterfall mechanics. We currently expect PRE to begin picking up in the back half of this year.\n Our realized investment income and other line item in the first quarter included $8 million of noncore expenses related to the acquisition and ongoing integration of Angelo Gordon, a step down from $18 million last quarter. We expect to incur a similar level of quarterly noncore expenses through the end of this year, primarily focused on IT investments to integrate our operating platforms.\n After-tax distributable earnings for the first quarter totaled $181 million or $0.49 per share of Class A common stock. Our effective corporate tax rate was lower than usual in the quarter due to the tax benefits of the first annual vesting in January of our IPO and ordinary service RSUs. We expect this will be a recurring seasonal factor in the first quarter of each year going forward.\n Turning to our GAAP balance sheet. During the quarter, we issued long-term bonds for the first time, benefiting from the strong investment-grade credit ratings we obtained in connection with our IPO. We raised $1 billion through the highly successful issuance of 10-year senior notes and 40-year subordinated notes. We used the proceeds to fully repay our revolver which we had drawn in the fourth quarter in connection with the AG transaction to fully repay our term loan and to replenish additional cash on our balance sheet. Following these transactions, our balance sheet remains conservatively capitalized with moderate leverage and ample liquidity. We ended the first quarter with more than $290 million of cash and cash equivalents and $1.2 billion of undrawn capacity on our revolver, providing us with significant flexibility to continue investing in growth.\n Our net accrued performance balance at the end of the first quarter was $915 million compared to $891 million in the fourth quarter. This 3% increase was driven by $56 million of value creation in our investments, partially offset by the $32 million in realized gains. At the end of the first quarter, our performance-eligible AUM totaled $193 billion or 86% of our total AUM and of which $153 billion is currently generating performance fees.\n Our investment portfolio has continued to perform well. We generated positive value creation across all of our platforms for the first quarter and last 12 months. Our private equity portfolio, which includes capital, growth and impact platforms, appreciated approximately 2% in the first quarter and 7% over the last 12 months. In aggregate, our portfolio grew revenue by 19% over the last 12 months and margins have remained stable. Our credit portfolio appreciated 3% in the quarter and 15% over the last 12 months. This performance was consistent across our credit strategies and was driven by continued strong credit selection and low annualized loss ratios.\n TPG's real estate portfolio appreciated approximately 4% in the first quarter and 1% over the last 12 months, and TPG AG's real estate portfolio appreciated 40 basis points in the first quarter and 1% over the last 12 months. This positive value creation in a challenging commercial real estate market is attributable to the quality of our portfolio construction in our core thematic areas. These defensive sectors such as light industrial and student housing continue to see strong secular demand growth limited supply and rental rate improvements.\n Turning to fundraising. We raised $4.7 billion during the quarter. Approximately $2.1 billion of this capital was raised across TPG AG credit with nearly $1 billion in Credit Solutions and approximately $600 million in middle market direct lending. In addition, our private equity strategies raised $1.8 billion with incremental closings across Asia VIII and Growth VI.\n Looking forward, consistent with our prior guidance on fundraising, we continue to expect total private equity and infrastructure capital raised in 2024 to grow compared to 2023. Driven by the fundraises for growth and Rise Climate as well as the launch of our climate infrastructure strategy. More than 200 LPs in our growth, Rise and Rise Climate Funds are actually here with us in San Francisco today and tomorrow, for their respective annual meetings, providing us with a great opportunity to connect in person and discuss our strategies in depth. Notably, fundraising for our second Rise Climate Fund, which is our largest active campaign is off to a very strong start with high levels of investor interest and engagement. We expect a substantial re-upgrade among our current clients as well as new strategic partnerships, driving us toward a sizable first close in the third quarter.\n Additionally, in 2024, we expect fundraising for TPG AG credit to exceed $10 billion, more than doubling the capital raised by the platform last year. As Jon mentioned, we're seeing strong interest from some of our largest LPs in engaging with us about our credit strategies, and we're excited to share more with you in the coming quarters.\n To wrap up, we have significant growth opportunity ahead of us across all of our businesses. Our existing portfolio continues to deliver strong performance, and we're well positioned with substantial dry powder to deploy into an increasingly active market. We've been successfully scaling our existing businesses and investing into a number of growth initiatives that will contribute meaningfully to our business and build shareholder value over time. Now I'll turn the call back to the operator to take your questions. Ken, it's Jack. I would just add, you asked kind of what we're focused on going forward. As I think about it, it's scaling the existing TPG AG credit businesses, which we've talked about. It's innovating new products together and penetrating new channels together, including insurance. It opens up the -- obviously, the addition of the TPG AG credit businesses opens up the insurance channel like we've never had access to before, we're very focused on that.\n On scaling their existing businesses, as I mentioned in my comments, we are making very good progress with TPG's historically larger LPs in introducing the credit platforms to them. Jon talked about the ship to Middle East, the meetings at book and the fact is that we just launched most of those campaigns this year. And creating a new LP relationship in a new asset class is a multi-meeting cycle. So we're halfway through those meetings with some of our largest LPs. As I mentioned in my remarks, we will be sharing more about that in the coming quarters as we complete that multi-meeting cycle and bring in new clients to that platform. Sure. Thanks, Alex. I'll start on that, it's Jack.  Look, we're very focused, as we've been saying, on expanding our presence in the wealth platform, and that's got multiple dimensions to it. Where internally, we're significantly building our own resources in that area, building out our distribution team focused on wealth. On the new product side, we definitely see significant movement of client demand into permanent capital open-ended structures. We've obviously got TCAP, the direct lending vehicle in the market. We've got a couple of other vehicles already focused on that. We don't yet have a private equity semi-liquid product, but we're actively working on that. and expect to launch it early next year at the latest.\n And we expect that to be -- as you know, our performance across our private equity products around the world has been differentiated. And I would just say that all of our conversations with our partners on the bank channel side, they are very eager to have a differentiated TPG semiliquid private equity product in their channel. So we intend to keep pursuing that and other ways to access, which obviously is where client demand is slowing. It's also beneficial to us to have more stable and growing sources of capital that don't rely upon starting from scratch each fundraising cycle. Sure. Let me start with the last question because it kind of frames the rest of it. The transaction fees in Q1 were almost entirely associated with legacy TPG businesses. Think about almost nothing coming from AG because that requires a little bit of work. We're in the process of integrating the broker-dealer into their businesses, requires a little bit of new hires. It requires a little bit of work on their fund documents to allow for more capital markets business. So that will be a growth driver going forward. The baseline in Q1 was a little higher than we indicated on our last call, we thought it would be because we didn't see a big enough new deal closing pipeline to get to the kind of levels we got to. \n As I mentioned in my remarks, that ended up being amplified by some opportunistic refinancing as credit spreads tightened, and we're able to improve the capital structures of many of our private equity portfolio companies. As I think about it, the current quarter represents a decent kind of average run rate for TPG's existing business in capital markets. We've -- we're expanding our -- and then from there, the growth will come from a couple of things. Number one, expanding that capability across more of TPG's business, as we grow in climate, as we grow in climate infrastructure. There are a lot of ancillary capital markets needs around those businesses and we intend to build a capital markets business to service those needs more broadly than just our private equity focus today.\n And then secondly, the AG opportunity, which I think you should expect to kick in really late this year and into next year as we keep doing the work that I outlined. So that -- those 2 elements on top of the current quarter, of course, you're going to see fluctuations quarter-to-quarter. But as you think about kind of the baseline for that business, over the coming couple of years, those 2 opportunities will create kind of 2 steps up in the average opportunity in that business. I'll start on that, I guess. I think the way I think about kind of the credit business flowing into FAUM is, first and foremost, deployment because almost all of the capital in that business pays fees on deployed capital only. I think all the fundraising you see us talking about in doing this year, the more than $10 billion is really setting us up for the second leg of growth next year. Most of the funds we're raising this year, some will be deployed this year, but it's hard to -- in your modeling, it's hard to draw a direct connection between this year's fundraising and 2024 FAUM and FRR, that's more driven by deployment pace in the near term.\n And I think on the average fee rate question, there's nothing abnormal in the first quarter there. As we talked about at the analysts, I guess the only thing I'd say is that there are obviously 3 or 4 different -- very different businesses within AG Credit, and the average fee rate will be driven more by the deployment mix across those businesses than it will be by some kind of macro factor. Yes. Good question, Bill. We have not provided any longer-term FRE margin guidance other than to say that we do believe we'll be expanding back to 45% and eventually higher, which was our initial TPG target margin. As you think about our margin profile and the reason we reiterated 40% for this year, think about a lot of the FRR contributors and the fundraising activity we have this year, our current assumption is that the biggest fundraises we're in the market with right now that have fees on committed capital, that being across all the climate strategies, we're assuming those probably turn on in the third and fourth quarter of this year, that means that FRR from those businesses doesn't really pick up meaningfully until I call it the fourth quarter. We could be wrong about that. \n We could accelerate the activation earlier, but that's our assumption. But during the course of the year, the investment we're making in raising those funds, which will become more and more visible in the coming quarters, will set us up for more meaningful FRR growth next year as you get the annualized benefit of that plus accelerated credit deployment. So as we're thinking about the FRE margin trajectory, we do believe that the guidance toward exceeding 40% this year is the right guidance. And then we'll begin to see an acceleration of FRE margin expansion next year as some of those FRR drivers kick in next year. And there's no reason we shouldn't get back to 45% and eventually higher than that as we keep scaling our business."
