Today's conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]  I would now like to introduce Mike Watts, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications to begin the call.\nMike Watts: Thank you, Christy. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us for Hologic\u2019s fourth quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call. With me today is Steve MacMillan, the Company\u2019s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer, had an accident last week that required surgery, so she\u2019s not joining us today. She\u2019s resting at home and doing well, but I\u2019ll be covering for her in our call today. Please join me in wishing Karleen a speedy recovery.  Our fourth quarter press release is available now on the investors section of our website. We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. Finally, a replay of this call will be archived through November 27. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor statement included in our earnings release, and in our filings with the SEC. Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. One of these non-GAAP measures is organic revenue. We define organic revenue as constant currency revenue less the divested Blood Screening and Cynosure businesses, as well as the acquired SuperSonic Imagine and Acessa businesses. Finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be expressed in constant currency, unless otherwise noted. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic\u2019s CEO.\nSteve MacMillan: Thank you Mike, and good afternoon everyone. We\u2019re pleased to discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. We capped off a truly unprecedented fiscal year -- a year in which we made an enormous impact on public health with remarkable performance on both the top and bottom lines. Since we\u2019re marking the end of fiscal 2020, we\u2019ll reflect on the full year today. We also want to remind everyone of the steps we took in previous years that enabled us to post such terrific performance, and discuss how our current successes will make us an even stronger company going forward.  Before we do that, let\u2019s provide a quick overview of our financial results for the fourth quarter. Total revenue was $1.347 billion, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.07. Revenue grew 70.9% organically, and EPS more than tripled, as higher production volumes in Diagnostics enabled us to leverage our fixed cost base. Both revenue and EPS came in well ahead of our expectations at the beginning of the quarter, as well as the updated guidance we provided in September. The outperformance was driven by unprecedented global demand for our COVID tests on the Panther system, and the continued recovery of our other product lines. How did we achieve these results? Five strategies that we pursued before 2020 put us in a position to seize the opportunities that COVID presented, as well as mitigate the risks. While we certainly did not predict the COVID pandemic, we did put in place people, processes and capabilities that enabled us to adapt quickly, make a massive contribution to human health, and drive value for customers, employees and shareholders.  First, over the last few years, we spent a significant amount of time defining our Purpose, Passion and Promise. As a reminder, our Purpose is to enable healthier lives everywhere, every day. Our Passion is to become global champions of women\u2019s health. And our Promise is the Science of Sure, which is all about providing clinically differentiated, high-performance products that customers and patients can rely on. These principles have inspired our team\u2019s incredible efforts over the last several months, especially our many front-line employees who have shown up to work every day since the pandemic began. When the world needs us most, our team rises to the occasion. Second, in diagnostics, we fueled our razor/razor-blade business model by placing hundreds of Panthers and strengthening our assay development capabilities to add more tests to our menu. At the end of 2014, we had about 600 Panthers installed worldwide. Over the next five years, we tripled that installed base to more than 1,700 at the end of 2019. Similarly, in 2014 we had a grand total of four assays approved on the Panther in the United States. But by the end of 2019, we had quadrupled that with 16 tests cleared. As a result, our molecular diagnostics business was thriving even before COVID, with growth of 11% globally last year. Clearly we were well-poised to make a difference when COVID emerged.  Third, in Breast Health, we diversified our business under the leadership of Pete Valenti. We recently announced that Pete will be retiring in December, and we want to thank him for more than six great years of service. Pete was the first division President I hired at Hologic, and he was the mastermind behind our Genius 3D mammography strategy. Pete leveraged our leadership position into a more diverse, consistent business that tracks the clinical continuum for breast health care. We acquired Faxitron, Focal and SuperSonic Imagine, grew our service business to be even bigger than our capital franchise, and developed innovative new products such as Brevera and artificial intelligence tools. As a result, our Breast Health division has been more insulated during the pandemic than many other businesses that are highly dependent on capital. Fourth, in Surgical, we brought in a new leadership team that quickly transformed the commercial organization with their focus on talent and engagement. This began with Sean Daugherty, who was recently promoted to Group President overseeing Surgical as well as Breast Health. Sean\u2019s team also revitalized the division\u2019s R&D pipeline, bringing to market new products including Fluent and the Omni hysteroscope.  As a result, Surgical was growing strongly pre-COVID, and is recovering faster than expected now. Fifth, in International, we hired experienced senior leaders who pursued an ambitious goal to double revenue over five years. In Europe especially, we moved away from distributors and strengthened our direct commercial capabilities under the leadership of Jan Verstreken, who was recently promoted to Group President for all our international franchises. Our International business grew 11% on average from 2016 to 2019, and when the pandemic hit, we were in an excellent position to contribute with our testing solutions. Now let\u2019s spend a few minutes on the highlights of fiscal 2020. What a year it was, with organic revenue growth of 22% for the year and highly leveraged non-GAAP EPS growth of 64%. In COVID time, when days feel like weeks and weeks feel like months, it\u2019s hard to believe that we sold our Cynosure medical aesthetics business early in fiscal 2020. The divestiture removed a drag on our growth and profitability, as well as an overhang on our stock. And behind the scenes, it helped us re-focus on our core businesses, especially overseas, which was critical when the pandemic hit. With the divestiture complete, we started 2020 in good shape. For the first time, all our major divisions and geographies were performing well. Organic growth had been steadily increasing, from a trough of about 2% in early 2018 to a solid mid-single-digit rate in early 2020.  Then COVID-19 changed everything. In the early days of the pandemic, we moved quickly to preserve cash and brace ourselves against the global macroeconomic shock. And at the same time, our diagnostics R&D team triggered what has become an incredible, division-wide response, one that exemplifies our purpose, passion and promise. Working around the clock, they developed our first COVID test for the Panther Fusion system in about two months. And as soon as our Fusion assay received its Emergency Use Authorization, we began working on a second test, an Aptima assay for our base Panther system that could run on more instruments and be produced in much larger quantities. Early on, in response to the massive public health need, we set a goal to double our overall molecular diagnostics production capacity, from about 20 to 40 million tests a quarter. A capacity expansion of this magnitude would normally happen over eight to 10 years, but we set out to make it happen in six months. As you can probably tell from our financial results this quarter, we have already exceeded this goal in terms of both size and speed. In the fourth quarter alone, we produced more than 50 million total molecular diagnostic tests. This included about 25 million COVID tests that we provided to customers, an average of roughly 2 million per week. This means we sold more COVID tests this quarter than we had ever produced of all our molecular tests in a quarter. While our efforts to increase production volumes have gotten a lot of attention, and deservedly so, we also want to highlight two areas that may be somewhat underappreciated. First is the impact we\u2019re making internationally, and second is the long-term durability of the COVID revenue opportunity. We\u2019re particularly proud of the role we\u2019re playing globally, especially in Europe. If COVID would have hit five years ago, our ability to make an impact would have been minimal, as we just didn\u2019t have the installed base, relationships or commercial capabilities. But now, under Jan\u2019s leadership, we are on track to generate more than $1 billion in total European revenue this year. As a major driver of this, the $500 million in committed COVID revenue that started in the fourth quarter is now expected to be over $600 million, and extend throughout fiscal 2021. The extension of these contracts reinforces that demand for highly accurate molecular COVID testing is going to remain robust for a while. Infection rates are on the rise not just in the United States but globally, and it will take time to manufacture and roll-out vaccines broadly, even if they are proven highly protective. Effective vaccines will eventually slow testing demand, but even then, we believe that COVID testing will remain a large market, probably bigger than any other molecular category, for years to come. Molecular tests have been the gold standard for infectious disease detection for decades, and for good reason. They are more accurate than other testing modalities, and this is especially important when lives and livelihood are at stake. And with our combination of robust chemistry, innovative engineering on Panther, and differentiated labeling from the FDA, we believe we are the gold standard among molecular tests. The data the FDA recently published, which compared the analytical sensitivity of more than 50 EUA assays, speaks to this point, and underpins the asymptomatic screening claims that we received for our COVID assays this quarter. Sensitivity is especially important when testing people without symptoms, when false negative results could provide a false sense of security and contribute to super-spreader events. So as we look forward, what will these accomplishments mean for our future? 2020 was a year in which we significantly strengthened the Company for the years ahead. Let me give you some examples. First, we shipped 511 new Panther systems this year, well more than double our run-rate over the last five years. This increased our global installed base to about 2,250, up almost 30% in just 12 months. We helped our manufacturing partner more than double production, and refurbished scores of instruments from our own and other labs. And we still have a waiting list for Panthers. We expect to have another very good year of placements in 2021, which reflects the longevity of COVID testing that our customers anticipate.  The combination of our huge Panther installed base at facilities close to the patient, plus our assay sensitivity have us uniquely positioned to pursue opportunities that will be around for the long-term, such as testing before hospital admissions and asymptomatic screening. This is one reason we\u2019re moving ahead with further capacity expansion that will include our main plant in San Diego, our facility in Manchester, England, and several of our key suppliers of related consumables.  Our goal is to produce at least 75 million total molecular diagnostic tests a quarter starting roughly a year from now, which would represent more than 3.5 times our total capacity pre-COVID. These efforts will be reimbursed in part by the $119 million US government contract that we announced last week, which supports increased COVID production capacity for the domestic market. Clearly the government also believes that COVID testing is going to persist, and that we are making a meaningful difference against the pandemic.  Second, the benefits of the new Panther placements will extend far beyond COVID. As we said in our last call, we are targeting Panther placements to customers who want to run our other tests when the pandemic is over. As a result, we are signing up record levels of new business, what we call TORs, or tests of record. To be more specific, in fiscal 2020 we signed up non-COVID TORs worth $35 million annually in the United States. This is almost 50% more new business than we had ever done in a single year, and helps explain why our non-COVID molecular sales increased slightly in the fourth quarter. In addition, we have another $35 million of non-COVID TORs waiting to go live as soon as we have product available and capacity on Panthers. The biggest contributor to these TORs has been the new Aptima vaginosis tests, which reinforces our long-term enthusiasm for these products. Overall, there is no question that additional Panther placements will make our molecular business markedly stronger over the next several years. Third, our contributions to fight the pandemic internationally have significantly elevated our market positioning, especially in major European countries including the United Kingdom, Germany and France. We are already seeing the benefits in terms of market access for other products and as we compete for tenders. Finally, the strong cash flow that our COVID tests generate is enabling us to strengthen our balance sheet and accelerate certain growth investments, as Mike will discuss. In addition, we are going on offense in two ways. First, we are stepping up our business development activities. In August, for example, we spent approximately $80 million plus future contingent earn-outs \u2013 to buy Acessa Health. Acessa markets a laparoscopic RF product that is used to treat fibroids that MyoSure can\u2019t reach, so it\u2019s very complementary to our surgical business and a nice fit for our sales force. Across our divisions, we have a full funnel of other acquisition targets today, and would be surprised if we didn\u2019t complete at least another deal or two in fiscal 2021.Second, we resumed our share repurchase program, buying back about 1.7 million shares of stock for roughly $100 million in the fourth quarter.  For the full year, we repurchased 13 million shares for $654 million, reflecting our confidence in the future. Before turning the call over to Mike, let me conclude by reiterating how proud we are of the Hologic employees who stared adversity in the face during 2020 and made remarkable contributions to the battle against COVID-19. Not only did our team make a huge difference on public health, we positioned Hologic for greater success in the future. Now we\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Watts: Thank you Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I\u2019m going to provide an overview of our divisional sales results, walk through our income statement, briefly touch on a few other key financial metrics, and finish with our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. As Steve said, we are thrilled with our fourth quarter results, as revenue and EPS significantly exceeded our guidance. Reported revenue of $1.347 billion increased 54% if you include the divested Cynosure business in the base. Organically, revenue grew 71%, driven by strong sales of our two COVID tests. Below revenue, the tireless efforts of our operations and supply chain teams to ramp up production of COVID assays boosted our margins, profitability and cash flow, as we leveraged unprecedented molecular diagnostic production volumes against our fixed cost base. As a result, EPS of $2.07 in the fourth quarter increased 218%, well ahead of our expectations. And cash flow was extremely strong as well, which I\u2019ll discuss in a moment. Before I do that, let me provide some detail on our divisional revenue results. Diagnostics, our largest division, more than tripled in the fourth quarter driven by molecular, where sales increased 371%. As Steve mentioned, in response to the unprecedented need for COVID testing, we shipped about 25 million COVID tests to customers, generating revenue of $601 million. It\u2019s important to note that even if you exclude COVID-19 testing, as well as COVID-related ancillaries and equipment, our base molecular business increased in the mid-single-digit range. This speaks to the clinical importance of our assays as well as the bright future we have in molecular, as new products contribute more and more. Rounding out our diagnostics division, the cytology and perinatal businesses declined, but trends improved compared to the third quarter. In Breast Health, divisional performance improved a little faster than we expected. Global sales of $289.2 million decreased 16.2%. Excluding $6.2 million of sales from SuperSonic Imagine, sales decreased 18.0% organically. Demand for many of our capital products was obviously depressed by COVID-19, but as Steve discussed, the increasing diversity of our business cushioned the overall decline, as consumables and service essentially returned to their pre-COVID levels. For example, our interventional business was basically flat, helped by the relaunch of our Brevera biopsy system late in the quarter. And service revenue which was larger than capital sales grew slightly. In Surgical, sales of $100.2 million decreased 12.9%, also better than our internal forecast. Demand for semi-elective procedures continues to be negatively impacted by COVID-19, but trends definitely improved compared to the third quarter, and our customers are reporting a steady increase of new patients, which bodes well for continued recovery. Overall, in terms of geography, domestic sales of $994.9 million increased 52% on a reported basis, as strong sales of COVID tests more than offset the impact of the Cynosure divestiture and reductions across our other product lines. On an organic basis, U.S. revenue was up 64%. Outside the United States, sales of $352.1 million roughly doubled on a reported basis and grew 95% organically, driven by excellent performance in Europe. Now let\u2019s move on to the rest of the P&L for the fourth quarter. Gross margin of 74.2% increased 1,250 basis points, driven by sales of high-margin COVID tests and the divestiture of the lower-margin Cynosure business. As a further benefit of the Cynosure sale, total operating expenses of $276.6 million decreased 1.0% in the fourth quarter, despite growth in core Hologic R&D, the addition of SSI expenses, and opportunistic investments we made to bolster future growth. Some examples include marketing campaigns to improve healthcare equality for underserved communities, and to emphasize the importance of preventive screening during the pandemic. We also outsourced some diagnostics R&D work to third parties and accelerated product registration efforts and clinical trials in some of our international regions. Finally, we had higher compensation expense, as accruals for incentive compensation \u2013 especially in Diagnostics increased in line with our financial results. Putting all this together, operating margin increased 2,430 basis points to 53.7%, and net margin increased 2,020 basis points to 40.4%, both record highs. As a result, non-GAAP net income finished at $543.7 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.07, well ahead of plan.  Before we cover our 2021 first quarter guidance, I\u2019ll quickly touch on a few other financial metrics. Driven by demand for our COVID tests, cash flow from operations was $442 million in the fourth quarter, a very strong result. For the full year, cash flow from ops was almost $900 million. And even with significant capital spending in Diagnostics to support increased COVID production, free cash flow was $740 million in fiscal 2020.This strong cash flow gives us tremendous financial and strategic flexibility, and enabled us to further strengthen our balance sheet in two ways. First, we repaid $250 million that we had borrowed on our revolver as a precautionary measure early in the third quarter. Second, we refinanced $950 million of senior, unsecured notes, lowering our interest rate from 4.375% to 3.250%, which we believe is the lowest ever for a high-yield healthcare bond. And we also pushed out the maturity four years, to 2029. Overall, we had $701 million of cash at the end of the fourth quarter. And with more than $1.5 billion of EBITDA over the last 12 months, our leverage ratio fell to 1.5. We do expect both EBITDA and free cash flow to grow significantly in fiscal 2021, but as Steve said, we are actively pursuing a number of acquisitions across our divisions to accelerate growth, and hope to use our cash flow to complete a couple of deals this year. Finally, ROIC was 18.5% on a trailing 12-month basis, a significant increase of 550 basis points. Before we open the call for questions, let me discuss our expectations for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. We anticipate that fiscal 2021 will be an excellent year for Hologic overall, but our business environment remains very fluid due to the pandemic. Therefore, we are only providing a single quarter of guidance today. In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we expect excellent financial results again, even a little better than last quarter despite the slow-down we usually see around the holidays. We forecast total revenue in the range of $1.35 billion to $1.425 billion. This represents organic revenue growth of roughly 71% to 81%. Including Cynosure in the prior year period, our guidance corresponds to reported growth of 59% to 68%, and constant currency growth of 57% to 65%. On the bottom line, we expect EPS of $2.10 to $2.25 in the first quarter. This implies unprecedented growth rates of between 244% and 269%, significantly outpacing revenue. This first quarter guidance is based on a tax rate of 22.75%, and diluted shares outstanding of approximately 263 million for the quarter. Now let\u2019s turn to our divisional expectations. We forecast that Diagnostics revenue in the first quarter could triple or more compared to the prior year period. Underpinning this, we expect that demand for our two COVID assays will continue to exceed supply this quarter. As Steve said, we are further expanding production capacity for our molecular tests, but most of this capacity will come on-line later in 2021. Based on this timing, we forecast COVID assay sales to increase slightly in the first quarter compared to the fourth, commensurate with a small sequential increase in production. We also expect that our combination test for COVID and flu, which we submitted for a EUA last week, will be available later this quarter. We anticipate sales in both Breast and Skeletal Health and Surgical to be down again in the first quarter, although with slightly better percentage declines than in the fourth quarter. In Breast and Skeletal Health, let me remind you that first quarter sales often decline sequentially in absolute dollars compared to the fourth quarter due to seasonality around the holidays.  And in Surgical, we believe our customers are much better-prepared than they were in the spring to manage through local increases in COVID prevalence. So while we do expect trends to continue improving, we will keep a close eye on whether increasing COVID cases have a negative effect on elective procedures. As you update your forecasts, let me remind you that macro uncertainty remains higher than normal due to the pandemic. While our visibility has improved compared to several months ago, we would still encourage you to model at the middle of our ranges, which incorporate both potential upsides and downsides.  Before we open the call for questions, let me wrap up by saying that Hologic\u2019s financial performance in the fourth quarter was tremendous. I have no doubt that our efforts this year have significantly strengthened the company for the long term. We continue to make a huge impact on human health globally, and have positioned ourselves to deliver an exceptional fiscal 2021 as we continue to battle a virus that isn\u2019t going away anytime soon.  With that, I will ask the operator to open the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up, and then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] First, we'll go to Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI.\nVijayKumar: Hi, Steve. Congrats on the solid year. Good to be back on the call here. I guess -- maybe I guess the comments you made on M&A, Steve, if I just step back, there's a $1 billion of COVID revenues we weren't expecting a year ago, it's likely to be in at least one and a half plus of incremental revenues coming in over the next 12 months. And these are; revenues are dropping down at pretty high margins, 65% -70%? That's a lot of free cash. When you think of following those -- the proceeds? I think you mentioned one or two deals in the near term. Could you maybe talk about perhaps the focus? What areas are you looking at? Are these going to be both focused in acquisitions, perhaps on the size of the transaction deal?\nSteveMacMillan: Sure, Vijay. I think what's great as we've really gotten back to our division led business development strategy. So we've got each division out there, that way they know the adjacencies, the ability to bridge out, I would say if you go forward, we're clearly looking at some ways to broaden our diagnostics platform, both product wise as well as geographically. So that team has been very active on the business development front. In addition, obviously, to all the production capability and everything else, but we're looking across the board, surgicals continues to look at some additional things. And breast health is looking at some things as well. But I think diagnostics is probably more likely to be where we see it. I do think we've kind of set up the rough principle of staying within the constraints of our annual cash flow. And I think that continues to be exactly what we're thinking about, we're looking at some things that might be a little bit bigger than we were looking at pre COVID but nothing beyond certainly beyond the annual cash flow or anything like that.\nVijayKumar: Understood. And then, Mike, maybe one on, I guess, the label extensions here to asymptomatic. Is this now indications perhaps given asymptomatic label that we could see in testing strategies, and beyond the next six months, as you look back half of next fiscal perhaps once we have the vaccine. Could you maybe just address what happens to testing post vaccines and perhaps the durability of testing in the context of your asymptomatic labeling?\nSteveMacMillan: Vijay, glad you picked up on that, which is we believe this asymptomatic approval is an enormous win for us over the long haul. And let's face it with what the world has gone through here, even post vaccine, there is going to be probably some pretty strong ongoing needs by governments around the world, who want to monitor their health -- their populations, and just track on an ongoing basis, just to see relative incidence or any kind of recurrences. And frankly, it's the asymptomatic people who are the key there. And that's the on label indication; it's hard for us to probably fully underscore how strong we think the demand will be for that for years to come. Yes, and you still play out the timing of vaccines, by the way, let alone mutations and other things. We believe and we've been in close contact with most of the major governments around the world, all of the key labs, the health experts, we believe an ongoing screening program, where you're going to want to use the most sensitive tools out there, including, frankly, hospitals are going to want to continue to test patients coming in, what is the best way everybody is going to go in for a hip and knee, cardiac any other procedure, we think, at least for the next couple of years, is probably going to be tested. And again, with our global installed base now in excess of 2200 and continuing to grow on Panthers. We think this is going to be a big, big, enduring market for us, is it going to be exactly what it is today? Yes, likely not. But there's going to we believe, and we've made the bet that there's a longer tail. if you look, by the way, just one other data point, the contract we got from the US government last week, if you look at it, they're asking for us to be providing 13 million tests per quarter, by per month, really six quarters from now by the first quarter of 2022. So again, governments are increasingly planning to want to have major capacity well beyond even just this coming, cold and flu season.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan.\nTychoPeterson: Hey, good afternoon. I'll start with one for Mike and Mike, nice job wearing CFO hat, hope all is well with Karleen, but I want to ask about operating margins, that 2,430 basis points of margin expansion. The real question is how sustainable is that, and if we do the run rate on the EPS guide for the year that gets you to kind of $9 at the high end? Is that the right way to think about it? Or is there some reinvestment? That we need to think about over the course of the year?\nMikeWatts: Yes, sure Tycho. So operating margins, obviously, were very strong in the quarter, based on the COVID revenue and just higher revenue overall, we did guide for revenue to be a little bit higher sequentially in Q1 versus Q4, margins gross and operating should be about the same maybe a little bit better, based on the higher revenue. So we should be looking at another, strong quarter of EPS in Q1, I think that corresponds to the guidance we gave at the bottom line, which was a little bit ahead. I think we guided to $2.10 to $2.25, for EPS, so that should all be pretty consistent.  Certainly I would be cautious about kind of taking that level and just analyzing it. I think that, as Steve said, we feel very strongly that we're going to get very healthy demand, at least through the March quarter, right? As flu kind of hopefully goes away around that time. I think from that point forward, you're likely to see overall COVID revenue start to decline on a sequential basis, but I think it's going to be pretty gradual. Steve talked about some of the drivers of long term demand. So I think that maybe we peak in our March quarter, maybe we peak in the June quarter, but things will likely decline on a sequential basis from there, and that will have an effect on EPS as well.\nTychoPeterson: Okay, that's helpful. And then for Steve, a couple quick hits on the testing side. You've been pretty negative on the pooling front. I'm just curious if you think as we head into next year pooling starts to pick up and then on the government contract, are that a one off in your view, or could there be other kind of chunky government contracts like that to support scale up. And then lastly, I'm just wondering if you could comment on the non COVID testing volumes up in single digit, which is certainly better than we've been expecting. So I'm curious about the sustainability of that. Thanks.\nSteveMacMillan: I think Tycho just set a world record for the one follow up, that was three or four. So let me make sure I try to get all of those Tycho. On the pooling, we think eventually that will start to kick in. And again, if you look at the way we're poised and because of the extreme sensitivity of our task, we feel like we're poised no matter where this goes. And by being able to offer to customers if it ends up going into a pooling world, we are there for them. And certainly, years in the future, we wouldn't be at all surprised if there's still some level of ongoing testing that probably would use pooling, certainly more I don't -- we don't see much interest, frankly, and given the still that the very high incidences don't see that, being as much right now. What were the other parts of the --\nTychoPeterson: Government contract? Is that a one off? Could there be other?\nSteveMacMillan: Yes, thank you. On the government contract side, I think this largely covers the bulk of the expansion that we had both planned and then did encourage us to even go that much higher on, where we're going, we are getting to that $75 million a quarter number.\nMikeWatts: And I think Tycho the last question was related to diagnostics volumes, non COVID. And I think they're, we were encouraged in the quarter, by growth in the base, HPV had a good quarter, trichomonas had a good quarter, continue to get good traction with our HIV viral load product, particularly in Africa, doing a good job there, I think we called out in our script, a lot of good interest around our vaginosis panel, which is CV/TV, which has contributed to the growth as well. So it was nice to see even if you back out all the COVID stuff, which obviously was huge. The underlying business grows as well in the quarter. \nOperator: And next, we'll go to Patrick Donnelly from Citi.\nPatrickDonnelly: Great, thanks, guys. Steve may be one for you -- may be just one on the capacity side. Certainly appreciate it's going to take some time to expand that. Can you just talk through I guess the key hurdles you need to get through for that and any potential for a larger increase even this quarter? I mean, similar last quarter, I know you said you had some things to break through to get the capacity going in fiscal 4Q, you did that. Maybe just talk through how this trends over the next couple of quarters and any potential again to pull that capacity expansion forward on the COVID side?\nSteveMacMillan: Yes, I think the way to probably think about capacity is it's not a steady linear. It comes as pieces of equipment, and suppliers can come in. So I, we were able to get a few that we had a bunch of stuff ordered early in the year, a number that came through now it's sort of making the investments for the future, Patrick, that for example, this quarter, next quarter, not much additional capacity coming online, including things like multi tube units and pipette tips and all the ancillary consumables, where we are giving additional investment to our suppliers to put in new machines, but they've got to now order those machines. So we're sort of in the next wave of placing the orders where they won't be coming online for another six or nine months-ish. And, therefore, it's much more incremental here in the immediate quarter. But we are continuing to position ourselves for further out. Hopefully, that helps. But it kind of goes up in sort of straight lines, it's more of a stair step, I guess, than a linear progression.\nPatrickDonnelly: Yes, makes sense. And then there'd be one on breast health, certain held up better than anticipated on our end. Can you just talk through the key pieces of performance there? And then the outlook, you're heading into even calendar 2021. You always seem to have a pretty good handle on hospital CapEx and spending outlook. Maybe just your two cents there that would be great.\nSteveMacMillan: Yes, I think the great part when you think about our breast health business today is we probably think about it as three chunks, you got the capital of the core mammography, we've got the service piece, which has become so much bigger, and then a much bigger disposable business, that Pete and the team really have built out so it's instead of a one legged pony of gantries, and then it's also much more international. So if I play it out overall service is holding up pretty well. The disposable businesses including the Provera launch now looking good. Frankly, a lot of the European countries didn't dip down quite as much initially, we don't have as much service business over there, but we've got those businesses. So then you come back to the core capital piece. And I think our teams, particularly the US are feeling fairly encouraged. And even frankly, around the world, we're getting, even into some new countries, we've had reached out to us recently, I mean there, so I'll go there, and then come back, the fascinating part is, the more we're having discussions about COVID revenue with a lot of countries around the world, they're becoming much more aware of Hologic overall. And so we've actually been selling some gantries into some countries. So it's going to help the breast health business over time, this and that, back to the piece in the US, I think our teams are cautiously optimistic that they feel like they're back having good discussions, our order patterns are getting a little healthier. And so I think we're still suggesting we'll be down a bit this quarter, but probably down less this quarter than we were just in that they called 16 percentage down this past quarter. So I think overall, and as we look to 2021, we're probably anticipating each quarter just gets gradually better. As hospitals and particularly the focus on women's health, it's not lost to us by the way, and we're kind of encouraged that the new senate and house will have more women than they've ever had. And what's been fascinating through the course of this year too, we've got to know a lot more of the governors, Kevin Thornal, on a first name basis; we're probably half the governors in this country, and everybody else. So we've got relationships that will continue to, I think, help us even on women's health issues and wanting to make sure people are getting back to mammography screenings and cervical cancer screenings.\nOperator: And next, we'll go to Dan Leonard from Wells Fargo, your line is open.\nDanLeonard: Thank you. So on molecular, given their capacity now seems pretty static at that 15 million test level, how are you managing the trade offs between serving COVID demand in your core molecular demand now that that's coming back? And what are you assuming in your Q4 guide? Or Q1 guide, I am sorry, December quarter?\nSteveMacMillan: Yes, I know, our fiscal year always kind of gets a little scary there, Dan, we are doing everything we can to make sure that we do produce all of our women's health as all of our core assay, there were, a couple of weeks here or there were just components, because it's a shared supply chain that we ran into a couple of back orders on certain products. But overall, right now, our guiding philosophy through all of this is we take care of our core business, and then we add COVID on top.  So I think we feel pretty good with the 50-ish million that we're at right now that we can deliver. Certainly, if you figure we were in the 20 million to 21 million, a quarter of non COVID stuff back two or three quarters ago, we can handle some growth on that core, and then still have that 25-ish million of COVID volume to do. So I think we're assuming this quarter is just marginally above what we did this last quarter on molecular.\nDanLeonard: Okay, and then just secondly on the share repo, seems like you were pretty opportunistic on the repo in the fourth quarter. How were you thinking about it in the first quarter and beyond? I mean, if you expect there could be continued market volatility? Would you take a more opportunistic approach towards repurchasing shares or more methodical? Thank you.\nSteveMacMillan: Sure. Great point, Dan. We have the ongoing debate about being more methodical versus opportunistic. And we probably end up a little bit in between, I think, with the cash we're going to be generating our first priority is still going to be judicious acquisitions. But I think with the cash we're generating, and as we continue to look at our own stock, having confidence that acquiring a company that we know a lot about i.e. ourselves is also not a bad deal. So it'll probably be a bit of both methodical and opportunistic going forward.\nOperator: And next we'll go to Chris Lin from Cowen.\nChrisLin: Hey, thanks for taking my questions. And I hope Karleen is doing well. \nSteveMacMillan: She's listening and she's going to be sending us a grade probably telling us not to mess it up.\nChrisLin: Well, I think Mike is filling in pretty well. Anyway, can you just -- can you talk about how many Panthers you expect to ship in 2021? Is it possible for you to ship another 500 or so? Or should we think about a figure that's south of this level, but north of a typical 200 to 250 run rate?\nSteveMacMillan: Chris, you have just answered your own question, I think, probably somewhere between the typical 250 and the 500. I don't know that we'd get full 500 just given, that was a massive influx of orders, but I think it will be well north of the 250. So not totally sure. But I'd probably feel comfortable splitting the difference. At this point, probably in that north of a 350-ish number, probably call it a 350 to 400 is probably a reasonable place to be. And I would say if demand continues to persist. Then it might be able to go a little bit north of that. But, even with where we are, if we do another 350 to 400 this year that will have been almost a 50% increase in two years of our entire global install base. And I do think that's the big part that is not fully appreciated.\nChrisLin: Understood. And for a somewhat well, unrelated follow up, can I just go back to a prior question on M&A. So diagnostics is clearly your, one of your strongest franchises, and you have extensive foothold in many laboratories with Panther systems. So I was hoping you could elaborate a bit more on why there isn't too much M&A focus in this segment. Thank you.\nSteveMacMillan: Well, I think as we see, we've got a great commercial presence certainly in the labs and in the in the hospitals around the world. So I think obviously continue to add menu and continue to add Panthers is great. But ultimately I think what we're starting to look at is, hey, look, we can build a stronger diagnostics platform that may have some other technologies. And I don't want to get much more specific, because that could lead to speculation or specifics. But I think with Kevin Thornal, who has a nice business development background from his Stryker days, now leading the diagnostics division, and it's been amazing what he has done, obviously, just from an operational standpoint, what you wouldn't see is he's also been very busy on the business development front as well. And we've actually walked away from some deals based on valuation even over the last few months, since he's been here, so he's completely changed the flow of ideas that's coming forth to us. And therefore, I think we'll probably make some things happen. But if we're going to remain disciplined, we're not going to get silly just because we have more money flowing in.\nOperator: And next we'll go Jack Meehan from Nephron Research.\nJackMeehan: Thank you. Good afternoon. Steve, it would be great maybe just to start to get your thoughts on combo COVID and flu testing, do you think the market could shift meaningfully as we hadn't been preparing the flu season from COVID Only? And what would be the implications for Hologic from a financial perspective? \nSteveMacMillan: Sure, we're continuing to be in very close touch with our customers and everything else. And obviously, we expect to be launching in this quarter of the combo test. I think that the much bigger concern right now continues to be COVID itself. And when you look certainly at the southern hemisphere, where there's been very little flu season, if you think about all the mitigation measures in the US of social distancing, and mask wearing and everything else, I think there are a lot of experts that will think we may have a very mild flu season. And the most important thing, frankly, right now that the bigger concern continues to be flu, I'm sorry, I continued to be COVID. But I think we'll see bits of both and we're basically preparing in our supply chain to be able to toggle as to whichever our customers will want. But there's, it's funny, as we've just been out caucusing them. There's still been a relentless focus really on just the COVID assay at this point in time.\nJackMeehan: Great. And can you just talk a little bit more around how pricing is trending? It seems like from the stats you threw out about revenue and volume. It was pretty stable in the quarter but do you view that as durable and would pricing change if you -- with the COVID combo test?\nSteveMacMillan: Sure, I think we're seeing relatively very stable pricing actually globally, right now on COVID. And certainly the combo would be likely priced higher. And I don't want to get into specifics depending on reimbursement or everything else. But at this point in time, pricing has remained very steady. I think that we'll continue to track a little bit whatever happens to reimbursement in the future. And this and that, I think over the long run, we will be wise, we certainly plan that there will be some degradation in pricing over time, but feel very good about the nearer term of how it's holding up. We also and you were on top of it, but the reimbursement change that came down in the US recently of lowering, that the base price from $100, down to $75. But providing the $25 up charge, if the patient can get the results returned within 48 hours is very beneficial to us, given our footprint of around the country. So I think again our ability to help labs and help hospitals, return the results quickly plays to our strengths as well.\nMikeWatts: That also contributes to the continued demand for more Panthers more boxes as well.\nSteveMacMillan: Yes.\nMikeWatts: Operator, I think we have time for maybe one or two more questions.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Brian Weinstein from William Blair.\nBrianWeinstein: Hey, guys, thanks for taking the question. So to ask a political question, I guess. I mean, we've seen a lot of funding for testing under the Trump administration. So we know what that looks like. But if we do see a Biden administration take over in January, what do you think that means for testing in general, for funding for reimbursement or even anything with the FDA? I'm just curious if you have thoughts on kind of his broader COVID-19 strategy that he's outlined?\nSteveMacMillan: Yes, I think it's hard to believe that it wouldn't be neutral to positive and more likely, potentially more testing. So I think the bigger, the bigger risk would have been Republicans maybe wanting to cut back. So I think, but I also think there's such an inexorable force of the consumer. And, frankly, state and local governments and companies and everybody that will also continue to drive this, but I would consider Biden to be a net positive for us.\nBrianWeinstein: Got it. And then in today's weekly afternoon, Town Hall, there was some discussion from one of your employees about giving some language chose for testing to kind of expand beyond just saying the PCR to molecular to kind of cover your technology, as well as that's something that is causing any kind of a headwind in the market? FDA clearly seem to be amenable to changing anytime they're like on the call, but is that anything that you guys have seen as being problematic in any way?\nMikeWatts: Yes, Brian, it's Mike. I mean, I think if you look at our sales performance, the answer would be no. Clearly, PCR is a little bit like to become a little bit of a term like Kleenex or something to be synonymous with paper tissues and such. And that's fine. Obviously, we use a different technology that's been competing against PCR for decades it's called TMA. And it really hasn't had an effect. I mean, look at the uptake of the products and TMA has been used, has been leading the Chlamydia gonorrhea market for decades, HPV, et cetera. I think the specific issue that came up was related to travel between the states and what would qualify for a test or whatever, but I think that's fairly inconsequential. I think we'll get that stuff resolved.\nMikeWatts: Operator, maybe one more quick one.\nOperator: We'll go next to Raj Denhoy from Jefferies.\nRajDenhoy: Hi, good evening. Hi, Steve and Mike and -- Karleen as well. Mike, maybe actually, Steve, I should ask you this question. So prior to COVID, your average Panther was doing something on the order of $240,000 to $250,000. It's now well over $1 million maybe close to $1.5 million, when we start to think about the sustainability of this business, right. I think what people are trying to figure out is where that goes. You've given us some detail on your thoughts there but maybe to put a finer point on it, a year from now, what do you think your average Panther is going to be generating in terms of revenue?\nSteveMacMillan: Yes, I think, Raj, as you well know it was kind of increasing in a high single digit, almost double digit rate per Panther. Exactly what where it will be, will be so dependent a year from now as to how much COVID testing, what's the COVID pricing? But, clearly, it just continues to go up. And with our broader menu, 16 approved tests, and actually now with the two additional COVID ones, were at 18, just more and more to be able to put through, I probably don't want to, it'd be premature to spec -- to try to give you an absolute number as to where that will be. But I think we just feel great that there'll be more volumes of more tests and more Panthers. And so collectively just driving higher.\nMikeWatts: Yes, maybe to add to that, Raj, just for a second, I mean, to put a fine point on. We mentioned in the script, this concept of TORs, which is one thing that we look at a lot internally, we signed in this past year, TORs representing more than $35 million of year one revenue. To give you a sense, I mean, that's more than 50%, more than we've ever done in a year before. And in addition to that, there's another 35 million of TORs kind of waiting in the wings, for when we have capacity on the Panthers as well as, product availability. So a lot of good excitement around some of our new tests in particular, and I think that's going to contribute to continued steady growth in that pull through.\nRajDenhoy: Helpful. And maybe just lastly, Steve, one quick one just your updated thoughts, maybe on rapid or point of care tests, any deputy thoughts in your desire to get into that business or your views on that? That segment of diagnostics?\nSteveMacMillan:  Yes, great question, Raj. We are really, we've got an incredible group of scientists in this company that and from the very outset, myself, Kevin, you kind of challenge different ways of thinking and looking at all of these different things. And we are staying very close to our core of really having the best products. When you think about what we do in 3D mammography, what we have with NovaSure, MyoSure, what we've always had in our molecular portfolio, really wanting to make sure that we have the best products with the best of labels. And, candidly, there's a lot of point of care stuff right now that I would say is being used off label, particularly being used for screening when it's not supposed to be and over time I think right now, there's a little bit of a wild west component where people are just, making money selling tests, getting them out there and saying, hey, run a bunch, whether they're accurate or not, if you test enough, it'll work. I think over time, the cream always rises to the top. And there will like in any market, things will settle out. And I think as things settle out, the superior products with the best labels, testing the right people in the right way at the right time will prevail. And I think we feel really good about that. We've looked at, we've had you can imagine through distribution agreements, we've had a lot of opportunities to frankly even drive more short term revenue by offering other products through our incredible sales channels. And really, you're staying away from it, because we want to make sure that we don't do anything to dilute our long term brand equity and want to stay really close to the science. So thank you for asking that.\nOperator: And thank you that is all the time we have for questions today. This now concludes Hologic's fourth quarter fiscal 2020 earnings conference call. Have a good evening.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Steve MacMillan",
            "content": "Thank you Mike, and good afternoon everyone. We're pleased to discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. We capped off a truly unprecedented fiscal year -- a year in which we made an enormous impact on public health with remarkable performance on both the top and bottom lines. Since we're marking the end of fiscal 2020, we'll reflect on the full year today. We also want to remind everyone of the steps we took in previous years that enabled us to post such terrific performance, and discuss how our current successes will make us an even stronger company going forward.  Before we do that, let's provide a quick overview of our financial results for the fourth quarter. Total revenue was $1.347 billion, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.07. Revenue grew 70.9% organically, and EPS more than tripled, as higher production volumes in Diagnostics enabled us to leverage our fixed cost base. Both revenue and EPS came in well ahead of our expectations at the beginning of the quarter, as well as the updated guidance we provided in September. The outperformance was driven by unprecedented global demand for our COVID tests on the Panther system, and the continued recovery of our other product lines. How did we achieve these results? Five strategies that we pursued before 2020 put us in a position to seize the opportunities that COVID presented, as well as mitigate the risks. While we certainly did not predict the COVID pandemic, we did put in place people, processes and capabilities that enabled us to adapt quickly, make a massive contribution to human health, and drive value for customers, employees and shareholders.  First, over the last few years, we spent a significant amount of time defining our Purpose, Passion and Promise. As a reminder, our Purpose is to enable healthier lives everywhere, every day. Our Passion is to become global champions of women's health. And our Promise is the Science of Sure, which is all about providing clinically differentiated, high-performance products that customers and patients can rely on. These principles have inspired our team's incredible efforts over the last several months, especially our many front-line employees who have shown up to work every day since the pandemic began. When the world needs us most, our team rises to the occasion. Second, in diagnostics, we fueled our razor/razor-blade business model by placing hundreds of Panthers and strengthening our assay development capabilities to add more tests to our menu. At the end of 2014, we had about 600 Panthers installed worldwide. Over the next five years, we tripled that installed base to more than 1,700 at the end of 2019. Similarly, in 2014 we had a grand total of four assays approved on the Panther in the United States. But by the end of 2019, we had quadrupled that with 16 tests cleared. As a result, our molecular diagnostics business was thriving even before COVID, with growth of 11% globally last year. Clearly we were well-poised to make a difference when COVID emerged.  Third, in Breast Health, we diversified our business under the leadership of Pete Valenti. We recently announced that Pete will be retiring in December, and we want to thank him for more than six great years of service. Pete was the first division President I hired at Hologic, and he was the mastermind behind our Genius 3D mammography strategy. Pete leveraged our leadership position into a more diverse, consistent business that tracks the clinical continuum for breast health care. We acquired Faxitron, Focal and SuperSonic Imagine, grew our service business to be even bigger than our capital franchise, and developed innovative new products such as Brevera and artificial intelligence tools. As a result, our Breast Health division has been more insulated during the pandemic than many other businesses that are highly dependent on capital. Fourth, in Surgical, we brought in a new leadership team that quickly transformed the commercial organization with their focus on talent and engagement. This began with Sean Daugherty, who was recently promoted to Group President overseeing Surgical as well as Breast Health. Sean's team also revitalized the division's R&D pipeline, bringing to market new products including Fluent and the Omni hysteroscope.  As a result, Surgical was growing strongly pre-COVID, and is recovering faster than expected now. Fifth, in International, we hired experienced senior leaders who pursued an ambitious goal to double revenue over five years. In Europe especially, we moved away from distributors and strengthened our direct commercial capabilities under the leadership of Jan Verstreken, who was recently promoted to Group President for all our international franchises. Our International business grew 11% on average from 2016 to 2019, and when the pandemic hit, we were in an excellent position to contribute with our testing solutions. Now let's spend a few minutes on the highlights of fiscal 2020. What a year it was, with organic revenue growth of 22% for the year and highly leveraged non-GAAP EPS growth of 64%. In COVID time, when days feel like weeks and weeks feel like months, it's hard to believe that we sold our Cynosure medical aesthetics business early in fiscal 2020. The divestiture removed a drag on our growth and profitability, as well as an overhang on our stock. And behind the scenes, it helped us re-focus on our core businesses, especially overseas, which was critical when the pandemic hit. With the divestiture complete, we started 2020 in good shape. For the first time, all our major divisions and geographies were performing well. Organic growth had been steadily increasing, from a trough of about 2% in early 2018 to a solid mid-single-digit rate in early 2020.  Then COVID-19 changed everything. In the early days of the pandemic, we moved quickly to preserve cash and brace ourselves against the global macroeconomic shock. And at the same time, our diagnostics R&D team triggered what has become an incredible, division-wide response, one that exemplifies our purpose, passion and promise. Working around the clock, they developed our first COVID test for the Panther Fusion system in about two months. And as soon as our Fusion assay received its Emergency Use Authorization, we began working on a second test, an Aptima assay for our base Panther system that could run on more instruments and be produced in much larger quantities. Early on, in response to the massive public health need, we set a goal to double our overall molecular diagnostics production capacity, from about 20 to 40 million tests a quarter. A capacity expansion of this magnitude would normally happen over eight to 10 years, but we set out to make it happen in six months. As you can probably tell from our financial results this quarter, we have already exceeded this goal in terms of both size and speed. In the fourth quarter alone, we produced more than 50 million total molecular diagnostic tests. This included about 25 million COVID tests that we provided to customers, an average of roughly 2 million per week. This means we sold more COVID tests this quarter than we had ever produced of all our molecular tests in a quarter. While our efforts to increase production volumes have gotten a lot of attention, and deservedly so, we also want to highlight two areas that may be somewhat underappreciated. First is the impact we're making internationally, and second is the long-term durability of the COVID revenue opportunity. We're particularly proud of the role we're playing globally, especially in Europe. If COVID would have hit five years ago, our ability to make an impact would have been minimal, as we just didn't have the installed base, relationships or commercial capabilities. But now, under Jan's leadership, we are on track to generate more than $1 billion in total European revenue this year. As a major driver of this, the $500 million in committed COVID revenue that started in the fourth quarter is now expected to be over $600 million, and extend throughout fiscal 2021. The extension of these contracts reinforces that demand for highly accurate molecular COVID testing is going to remain robust for a while. Infection rates are on the rise not just in the United States but globally, and it will take time to manufacture and roll-out vaccines broadly, even if they are proven highly protective. Effective vaccines will eventually slow testing demand, but even then, we believe that COVID testing will remain a large market, probably bigger than any other molecular category, for years to come. Molecular tests have been the gold standard for infectious disease detection for decades, and for good reason. They are more accurate than other testing modalities, and this is especially important when lives and livelihood are at stake. And with our combination of robust chemistry, innovative engineering on Panther, and differentiated labeling from the FDA, we believe we are the gold standard among molecular tests. The data the FDA recently published, which compared the analytical sensitivity of more than 50 EUA assays, speaks to this point, and underpins the asymptomatic screening claims that we received for our COVID assays this quarter. Sensitivity is especially important when testing people without symptoms, when false negative results could provide a false sense of security and contribute to super-spreader events. So as we look forward, what will these accomplishments mean for our future? 2020 was a year in which we significantly strengthened the Company for the years ahead. Let me give you some examples. First, we shipped 511 new Panther systems this year, well more than double our run-rate over the last five years. This increased our global installed base to about 2,250, up almost 30% in just 12 months. We helped our manufacturing partner more than double production, and refurbished scores of instruments from our own and other labs. And we still have a waiting list for Panthers. We expect to have another very good year of placements in 2021, which reflects the longevity of COVID testing that our customers anticipate.  The combination of our huge Panther installed base at facilities close to the patient, plus our assay sensitivity have us uniquely positioned to pursue opportunities that will be around for the long-term, such as testing before hospital admissions and asymptomatic screening. This is one reason we're moving ahead with further capacity expansion that will include our main plant in San Diego, our facility in Manchester, England, and several of our key suppliers of related consumables.  Our goal is to produce at least 75 million total molecular diagnostic tests a quarter starting roughly a year from now, which would represent more than 3.5 times our total capacity pre-COVID. These efforts will be reimbursed in part by the $119 million US government contract that we announced last week, which supports increased COVID production capacity for the domestic market. Clearly the government also believes that COVID testing is going to persist, and that we are making a meaningful difference against the pandemic.  Second, the benefits of the new Panther placements will extend far beyond COVID. As we said in our last call, we are targeting Panther placements to customers who want to run our other tests when the pandemic is over. As a result, we are signing up record levels of new business, what we call TORs, or tests of record. To be more specific, in fiscal 2020 we signed up non-COVID TORs worth $35 million annually in the United States. This is almost 50% more new business than we had ever done in a single year, and helps explain why our non-COVID molecular sales increased slightly in the fourth quarter. In addition, we have another $35 million of non-COVID TORs waiting to go live as soon as we have product available and capacity on Panthers. The biggest contributor to these TORs has been the new Aptima vaginosis tests, which reinforces our long-term enthusiasm for these products. Overall, there is no question that additional Panther placements will make our molecular business markedly stronger over the next several years. Third, our contributions to fight the pandemic internationally have significantly elevated our market positioning, especially in major European countries including the United Kingdom, Germany and France. We are already seeing the benefits in terms of market access for other products and as we compete for tenders. Finally, the strong cash flow that our COVID tests generate is enabling us to strengthen our balance sheet and accelerate certain growth investments, as Mike will discuss. In addition, we are going on offense in two ways. First, we are stepping up our business development activities. In August, for example, we spent approximately $80 million plus future contingent earn-outs \u2013 to buy Acessa Health. Acessa markets a laparoscopic RF product that is used to treat fibroids that MyoSure can't reach, so it's very complementary to our surgical business and a nice fit for our sales force. Across our divisions, we have a full funnel of other acquisition targets today, and would be surprised if we didn't complete at least another deal or two in fiscal 2021.Second, we resumed our share repurchase program, buying back about 1.7 million shares of stock for roughly $100 million in the fourth quarter.  For the full year, we repurchased 13 million shares for $654 million, reflecting our confidence in the future. Before turning the call over to Mike, let me conclude by reiterating how proud we are of the Hologic employees who stared adversity in the face during 2020 and made remarkable contributions to the battle against COVID-19. Not only did our team make a huge difference on public health, we positioned Hologic for greater success in the future. Now we'll turn the call over to Mike. Sure, Vijay. I think what's great as we've really gotten back to our division led business development strategy. So we've got each division out there, that way they know the adjacencies, the ability to bridge out, I would say if you go forward, we're clearly looking at some ways to broaden our diagnostics platform, both product wise as well as geographically. So that team has been very active on the business development front. In addition, obviously, to all the production capability and everything else, but we're looking across the board, surgicals continues to look at some additional things. And breast health is looking at some things as well. But I think diagnostics is probably more likely to be where we see it. I do think we've kind of set up the rough principle of staying within the constraints of our annual cash flow. And I think that continues to be exactly what we're thinking about, we're looking at some things that might be a little bit bigger than we were looking at pre COVID but nothing beyond certainly beyond the annual cash flow or anything like that. Vijay, glad you picked up on that, which is we believe this asymptomatic approval is an enormous win for us over the long haul. And let's face it with what the world has gone through here, even post vaccine, there is going to be probably some pretty strong ongoing needs by governments around the world, who want to monitor their health -- their populations, and just track on an ongoing basis, just to see relative incidence or any kind of recurrences. And frankly, it's the asymptomatic people who are the key there. And that's the on label indication; it's hard for us to probably fully underscore how strong we think the demand will be for that for years to come. Yes, and you still play out the timing of vaccines, by the way, let alone mutations and other things. We believe and we've been in close contact with most of the major governments around the world, all of the key labs, the health experts, we believe an ongoing screening program, where you're going to want to use the most sensitive tools out there, including, frankly, hospitals are going to want to continue to test patients coming in, what is the best way everybody is going to go in for a hip and knee, cardiac any other procedure, we think, at least for the next couple of years, is probably going to be tested. And again, with our global installed base now in excess of 2200 and continuing to grow on Panthers. We think this is going to be a big, big, enduring market for us, is it going to be exactly what it is today? Yes, likely not. But there's going to we believe, and we've made the bet that there's a longer tail. if you look, by the way, just one other data point, the contract we got from the US government last week, if you look at it, they're asking for us to be providing 13 million tests per quarter, by per month, really six quarters from now by the first quarter of 2022. So again, governments are increasingly planning to want to have major capacity well beyond even just this coming, cold and flu season. I think Tycho just set a world record for the one follow up, that was three or four. So let me make sure I try to get all of those Tycho. On the pooling, we think eventually that will start to kick in. And again, if you look at the way we're poised and because of the extreme sensitivity of our task, we feel like we're poised no matter where this goes. And by being able to offer to customers if it ends up going into a pooling world, we are there for them. And certainly, years in the future, we wouldn't be at all surprised if there's still some level of ongoing testing that probably would use pooling, certainly more I don't -- we don't see much interest, frankly, and given the still that the very high incidences don't see that, being as much right now. What were the other parts of the -- Yes, thank you. On the government contract side, I think this largely covers the bulk of the expansion that we had both planned and then did encourage us to even go that much higher on, where we're going, we are getting to that $75 million a quarter number. Yes, I think the way to probably think about capacity is it's not a steady linear. It comes as pieces of equipment, and suppliers can come in. So I, we were able to get a few that we had a bunch of stuff ordered early in the year, a number that came through now it's sort of making the investments for the future, Patrick, that for example, this quarter, next quarter, not much additional capacity coming online, including things like multi tube units and pipette tips and all the ancillary consumables, where we are giving additional investment to our suppliers to put in new machines, but they've got to now order those machines. So we're sort of in the next wave of placing the orders where they won't be coming online for another six or nine months-ish. And, therefore, it's much more incremental here in the immediate quarter. But we are continuing to position ourselves for further out. Hopefully, that helps. But it kind of goes up in sort of straight lines, it's more of a stair step, I guess, than a linear progression. Yes, I think the great part when you think about our breast health business today is we probably think about it as three chunks, you got the capital of the core mammography, we've got the service piece, which has become so much bigger, and then a much bigger disposable business, that Pete and the team really have built out so it's instead of a one legged pony of gantries, and then it's also much more international. So if I play it out overall service is holding up pretty well. The disposable businesses including the Provera launch now looking good. Frankly, a lot of the European countries didn't dip down quite as much initially, we don't have as much service business over there, but we've got those businesses. So then you come back to the core capital piece. And I think our teams, particularly the US are feeling fairly encouraged. And even frankly, around the world, we're getting, even into some new countries, we've had reached out to us recently, I mean there, so I'll go there, and then come back, the fascinating part is, the more we're having discussions about COVID revenue with a lot of countries around the world, they're becoming much more aware of Hologic overall. And so we've actually been selling some gantries into some countries. So it's going to help the breast health business over time, this and that, back to the piece in the US, I think our teams are cautiously optimistic that they feel like they're back having good discussions, our order patterns are getting a little healthier. And so I think we're still suggesting we'll be down a bit this quarter, but probably down less this quarter than we were just in that they called 16 percentage down this past quarter. So I think overall, and as we look to 2021, we're probably anticipating each quarter just gets gradually better. As hospitals and particularly the focus on women's health, it's not lost to us by the way, and we're kind of encouraged that the new senate and house will have more women than they've ever had. And what's been fascinating through the course of this year too, we've got to know a lot more of the governors, Kevin Thornal, on a first name basis; we're probably half the governors in this country, and everybody else. So we've got relationships that will continue to, I think, help us even on women's health issues and wanting to make sure people are getting back to mammography screenings and cervical cancer screenings. Yes, I know, our fiscal year always kind of gets a little scary there, Dan, we are doing everything we can to make sure that we do produce all of our women's health as all of our core assay, there were, a couple of weeks here or there were just components, because it's a shared supply chain that we ran into a couple of back orders on certain products. But overall, right now, our guiding philosophy through all of this is we take care of our core business, and then we add COVID on top.  So I think we feel pretty good with the 50-ish million that we're at right now that we can deliver. Certainly, if you figure we were in the 20 million to 21 million, a quarter of non COVID stuff back two or three quarters ago, we can handle some growth on that core, and then still have that 25-ish million of COVID volume to do. So I think we're assuming this quarter is just marginally above what we did this last quarter on molecular. Sure. Great point, Dan. We have the ongoing debate about being more methodical versus opportunistic. And we probably end up a little bit in between, I think, with the cash we're going to be generating our first priority is still going to be judicious acquisitions. But I think with the cash we're generating, and as we continue to look at our own stock, having confidence that acquiring a company that we know a lot about i.e. ourselves is also not a bad deal. So it'll probably be a bit of both methodical and opportunistic going forward. She's listening and she's going to be sending us a grade probably telling us not to mess it up. Chris, you have just answered your own question, I think, probably somewhere between the typical 250 and the 500. I don't know that we'd get full 500 just given, that was a massive influx of orders, but I think it will be well north of the 250. So not totally sure. But I'd probably feel comfortable splitting the difference. At this point, probably in that north of a 350-ish number, probably call it a 350 to 400 is probably a reasonable place to be. And I would say if demand continues to persist. Then it might be able to go a little bit north of that. But, even with where we are, if we do another 350 to 400 this year that will have been almost a 50% increase in two years of our entire global install base. And I do think that's the big part that is not fully appreciated. Well, I think as we see, we've got a great commercial presence certainly in the labs and in the in the hospitals around the world. So I think obviously continue to add menu and continue to add Panthers is great. But ultimately I think what we're starting to look at is, hey, look, we can build a stronger diagnostics platform that may have some other technologies. And I don't want to get much more specific, because that could lead to speculation or specifics. But I think with Kevin Thornal, who has a nice business development background from his Stryker days, now leading the diagnostics division, and it's been amazing what he has done, obviously, just from an operational standpoint, what you wouldn't see is he's also been very busy on the business development front as well. And we've actually walked away from some deals based on valuation even over the last few months, since he's been here, so he's completely changed the flow of ideas that's coming forth to us. And therefore, I think we'll probably make some things happen. But if we're going to remain disciplined, we're not going to get silly just because we have more money flowing in. Sure, we're continuing to be in very close touch with our customers and everything else. And obviously, we expect to be launching in this quarter of the combo test. I think that the much bigger concern right now continues to be COVID itself. And when you look certainly at the southern hemisphere, where there's been very little flu season, if you think about all the mitigation measures in the US of social distancing, and mask wearing and everything else, I think there are a lot of experts that will think we may have a very mild flu season. And the most important thing, frankly, right now that the bigger concern continues to be flu, I'm sorry, I continued to be COVID. But I think we'll see bits of both and we're basically preparing in our supply chain to be able to toggle as to whichever our customers will want. But there's, it's funny, as we've just been out caucusing them. There's still been a relentless focus really on just the COVID assay at this point in time. Sure, I think we're seeing relatively very stable pricing actually globally, right now on COVID. And certainly the combo would be likely priced higher. And I don't want to get into specifics depending on reimbursement or everything else. But at this point in time, pricing has remained very steady. I think that we'll continue to track a little bit whatever happens to reimbursement in the future. And this and that, I think over the long run, we will be wise, we certainly plan that there will be some degradation in pricing over time, but feel very good about the nearer term of how it's holding up. We also and you were on top of it, but the reimbursement change that came down in the US recently of lowering, that the base price from $100, down to $75. But providing the $25 up charge, if the patient can get the results returned within 48 hours is very beneficial to us, given our footprint of around the country. So I think again our ability to help labs and help hospitals, return the results quickly plays to our strengths as well. Yes. Yes, I think it's hard to believe that it wouldn't be neutral to positive and more likely, potentially more testing. So I think the bigger, the bigger risk would have been Republicans maybe wanting to cut back. So I think, but I also think there's such an inexorable force of the consumer. And, frankly, state and local governments and companies and everybody that will also continue to drive this, but I would consider Biden to be a net positive for us. Yes, I think, Raj, as you well know it was kind of increasing in a high single digit, almost double digit rate per Panther. Exactly what where it will be, will be so dependent a year from now as to how much COVID testing, what's the COVID pricing? But, clearly, it just continues to go up. And with our broader menu, 16 approved tests, and actually now with the two additional COVID ones, were at 18, just more and more to be able to put through, I probably don't want to, it'd be premature to spec -- to try to give you an absolute number as to where that will be. But I think we just feel great that there'll be more volumes of more tests and more Panthers. And so collectively just driving higher. Yes, great question, Raj. We are really, we've got an incredible group of scientists in this company that and from the very outset, myself, Kevin, you kind of challenge different ways of thinking and looking at all of these different things. And we are staying very close to our core of really having the best products. When you think about what we do in 3D mammography, what we have with NovaSure, MyoSure, what we've always had in our molecular portfolio, really wanting to make sure that we have the best products with the best of labels. And, candidly, there's a lot of point of care stuff right now that I would say is being used off label, particularly being used for screening when it's not supposed to be and over time I think right now, there's a little bit of a wild west component where people are just, making money selling tests, getting them out there and saying, hey, run a bunch, whether they're accurate or not, if you test enough, it'll work. I think over time, the cream always rises to the top. And there will like in any market, things will settle out. And I think as things settle out, the superior products with the best labels, testing the right people in the right way at the right time will prevail. And I think we feel really good about that. We've looked at, we've had you can imagine through distribution agreements, we've had a lot of opportunities to frankly even drive more short term revenue by offering other products through our incredible sales channels. And really, you're staying away from it, because we want to make sure that we don't do anything to dilute our long term brand equity and want to stay really close to the science. So thank you for asking that."

Today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute. I would now like to introduce Mike Watts, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications to begin the call. Please go ahead, sir.\nMike Watts: Thank you, Cody. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us for Hologic\u2019s third quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the Company\u2019s Chairman, President and CEO, and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer. Steve and Karleen both have some prepared remarks, then we\u2019ll have a question-and-answer session. Our third quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. Finally, a replay of this call will be archived through August 21st. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor statement included in our earnings release, and in our filings with the SEC. Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. One of these non-GAAP measures is organic revenue. As a reminder, we are defining organic revenue as constant currency revenue less the divested Blood Screening and Cynosure businesses, as well as the acquired SuperSonic Imagine business. Finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be expressed in constant currency, unless otherwise noted. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic\u2019s CEO.\nSteve MacMillan: Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We\u2019re pleased to discuss our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Our results were very strong, and reflect the value of our unique set of businesses in a time of great economic uncertainty. To begin, these last several months have been the most challenging, tumultuous, and unpredictable time of my career, but also the most exhilarating and ultimately gratifying. There\u2019s still a lot of history to be written regarding this pandemic, and things can change very quickly in COVID time. But, we\u2019re very pleased with the significant contributions Hologic has made to human health thus far, and excited about our ability to do even more. I am just so proud of our team, who are working day and night with customers, regulators, suppliers, elected officials and others to address the most pressing problem facing the world today. In the last couple of years, we\u2019ve talked a lot about social responsibility and Hologic\u2019s corporate purpose, to enable healthier lives everywhere, every day. It is this purpose that inspired our people to do more than seemed possible in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Never before have we lived into our mission more completely or touched more human lives than during the COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, our results flow from the positive impact we\u2019re making on human health. Karleen will cover the details, but let\u2019s start by saying that while the quarter began with great uncertainty and painful decisions to preserve cash flow, it ended with results that were better than we ever envisioned. We posted total revenue of $822.9 million and earnings per share of $0.75. Revenue grew 8.1% organically, and EPS increased 19%. These growth rates, our best organic performance in a very long time, significantly beat our expectations at the start of the quarter. Outperformance was driven by unprecedented demand for our COVID tests on the Panther system, as well as the quicker-than-expected strengthening of our surgical division. In addition, COVID testing surged late in the quarter, so our results also far exceeded the update we provided via the 8-K in June. We\u2019ll now highlight three primary points related to COVID, then Karleen will cover the rest of the business. First, our manufacturing and supply chain team did an amazing job in the quarter to ramp up production of our COVID assays, helping more labs and doctors deliver diagnostic insights when and where they are needed. Second, we believe our diagnostic response to COVID will have short, medium and long-term benefits for the Company as a whole. And third, the strengthening of our international franchises over the years is enabling us to make a big difference in the COVID fight today, which in turn will further accelerate our international business going forward. Let\u2019s start with manufacturing and supply chain, an area that doesn\u2019t get a lot of attention on the typical earnings call. That\u2019s unfortunate, because delivering high-quality, highly precise products that doctors rely on to make critical decisions is at the core of our business. In the case of COVID, we are producing millions of tests that weren\u2019t even invented a few short months ago, and each test has to meet exactingly high performance and quality standards. In this unique time when demand for COVID tests is exceeding supply, high-quality, high-volume manufacturing is critical. Although you\u2019d never know it from the media stories, the diagnostics industry as a whole has done an unbelievable job of ramping up COVID production capacity. As a nation, we are on pace to conduct about 23 million tests in July. This is more than double the level of testing as recently as May, and more than 20 times the number of tests performed in March. In total, more than 52 million COVID tests have been performed in the United States. For perspective, this is about 50% more than in the other G7 countries combined. Never before has a molecular diagnostic test been scaled up to these volumes, this fast. In fact, the amount of COVID testing being done today is about seven times greater than the next most common molecular diagnostic test. Our industry and its employees have a lot to be proud of, and we are striving to do more. In Hologic\u2019s case, as soon as we launched our first COVID assay in March, a PCR test that runs on Panther Fusion, we were overwhelmed with calls from customers everywhere. So, we immediately activated three key projects, working closely with our suppliers and partners around the world. First, we began developing a second COVID assay to leverage our proprietary Aptima technologies and manufacturing capacity, and to run on our large installed base of Panther instruments. Pre-COVID, we produced about 20 million molecular diagnostic tests a quarter, with the vast majority of this comprising TMA assays for infectious diseases like chlamydia, HPV and HIV. Since the pandemic reduced demand for these tests, we were able to redirect human and technological capacity to produce our Aptima COVID assay. In essence, we merged the supply chains for our COVID tests and our legacy products to increase COVID production capacity. Second, we set out to double our molecular diagnostics manufacturing capacity by the fall, to 40 million tests or more per quarter as we move into fiscal \u201821. We essentially established a goal to achieve our 10-year expansion plan in about six months. And third, we began working with our partner Stratec to roughly double production of our Panther instruments. Based on these actions, in our earnings call three months ago we shared our goal to produce at least 1 million COVID tests a week, on average, starting in late May. This would have enabled us to realize revenue of $150 million or more in the second quarter. Thanks to Herculean efforts by our operations team, we\u2019re proud to report that we significantly exceeded this goal, and were able to increase our total molecular diagnostics test production by about 50% in the third quarter, to roughly 30 million tests. This enabled us to ship almost 13 million COVID tests to customers, including an extra production lot, leading to sales of $324 million. Based on data from the COVID Tracking Project, we estimate that we provided one-fourth to one-third of the test results delivered in the United States during the quarter. How did we get there? Through a combination of ingenuity, investment and brute force. In terms of ingenuity, we validated the use of one of our specimen transfer tubes, one that is typically used with our ThinPrep Pap tests, for COVID testing. This helped total kit capacity catch up to our underlying production of reagents, and enabled us to ship millions of additional tests. And we validated a new sample collection and loading method that reduces the use of penetrable caps, a short-term constraint that we discussed last quarter. In terms of investment, we currently expect to spend over $50 million in capital to expand COVID production, with about $14 million of that spent through the third quarter. Some of this is being used to install new high-speed filling lines, and we are also investing in new, custom machinery to produce more penetrable caps. As announced this week, this effort is also being supported by HHS and DoD. In terms of brute force, we are producing 24/7 at our facility in San Diego. Employees from areas like IS and finance were trained to work on the packaging lines, while we hire over 150 new operations employees here, more than a 50% increase. We also expanded capabilities at our diagnostics plant in Manchester, United Kingdom, which began producing COVID tests at the end of June. Overall, these actions have provided the capacity to produce at least 1.5 million COVID tests per week, on average, and should enable COVID sales to increase sequentially in the fourth quarter, over and above our very strong Q3 even while accommodating higher volumes of our women\u2019s health tests. And there is the potential to do more if we are able to work through some remaining supply chain constraints on certain instrument components. The second point is that our diagnostic response to COVID will have short, medium and long-term benefits for Hologic as a whole. In the short-term, the benefits are obvious. Over the next several quarters, COVID testing will help drive strong overall corporate growth even before the base business fully recovers. In the medium-term, we expect that the record number of Panther and Panther Fusion instruments that we are placing now will turbo-charge our razor-razor blade business model, and dramatically increase pull-through of other assays. These include our new women\u2019s health tests, our quantitative virology products, and our respiratory mini-panels. To illustrate this, over the last several years, we have placed an average of 228 new Panther systems globally per year. In the third quarter alone, we placed 208 systems, 208. This was made possible by a significant expansion of production capacity at Stratec, and even by refurbishing more than 50 Panthers from our own research labs. At the end of June, our installed base stood at more than 2,000 systems, with almost 45% of these outside the United States. And over this fiscal year, we expect to place about 500 Panthers, more than doubling our recent, annual run-rate. Of the 152 systems shipped this quarter in the United States, we estimate that more than 60% will replace one of our older, workhorse TIGRIS systems over time. This will enable those customers to access our full menu of 16 FDA-authorized tests on Panther, rather than the 4 that are cleared on TIGRIS. The other 40% of systems either displaced a competitor, or enabled a new customer to begin testing. And some of these new customers are specifically targeting nascent growth opportunities such as home sample collection. One way we measure new customer adoption internally, as well as incentivize our sales force, is by tracking what we call TORs, or Tests of Record, and the contracted year-one revenue associated with them. A TOR is achieved when a customer goes live with a new assay on our system. In 2020, even as COVID is driving tremendous interest in Panther, our sales team has been focused on securing downstream revenue from other tests. Based on their excellent work and motivated by double the payout on non-COVID TORs, we have already set a record for TOR revenue. And we have even more signed and waiting to go live over the next couple of quarters. Since Panther was cleared in 2012, we have seen over and over again that as customers come to know and love the system, they adopt additional tests that drive even more pull-through, and we would expect the same dynamic to play out here. This will drive growth in the long term, even as multiple COVID vaccines are hopefully commercialized. While everyone at Hologic is rooting for successful vaccine development, it\u2019s important to note that the strength and duration of immunity still have to be established. And consumer surveys indicate that many people may choose not to be vaccinated. For these reasons, we also forecast there will be a long-term market for COVID testing on a global basis, just as testing co-exists with vaccines today for pathogens such as HPV, hepatitis B and influenza. The third point we want to make is that the strengthening of our international franchises over the years is enabling us to make a big difference in the fight against COVID today, which in turn will reshape our international businesses going forward. Let us give you a little more color on that. Over the last three years, international sales have been a major growth driver for the Company, with our base businesses growing at a low-double-digit CAGR organically. Within this, molecular diagnostics has been leading the charge, with growth rates often exceeding 20%. Underpinning this growth, we have invested methodically in our leadership and commercial infrastructure. We also divested Cynosure, which enabled our leaders to focus on the businesses they know best. For example, in our European region specifically, we had an installed base of about 220 Panthers in 2016, just before our regional president Jan Verstreken joined the Company. By the end of the third quarter, however, that number had doubled. By leveraging this installed base, our team has signed contracts in about a dozen countries that secure about $500 million of COVID testing revenue over the next four quarters, with opportunities to grow this further. The largest contract is with the UK Department of Health, which is worth nearly $190 million. While the vast majority of our COVID revenues in the third quarter came from the United States, expanding production capacity will enable us to serve more global customers going forward. In the third quarter alone, we shipped almost 60 Panther instruments to lab customers outside the United States. And like in the U.S., our commercial teams are capitalizing on the intense demand for COVID tests to drive pull-through of our other assays, which is a robust opportunity given our lower market shares globally. Before turning the call over to Karleen, let me conclude by saying that the COVID-19 pandemic has really highlighted the importance of diagnostics within the healthcare system. In the future, we hope that this will lead to a strengthening of the public health infrastructure, more favorable reimbursement for diagnostic testing, and hopefully even more appreciation for the value of early detection, which is our core focus. At the same time, our response to the pandemic is also making Hologic a much more successful and influential player within the diagnostics industry, both domestically and overseas. This is based on the power of our technology and automation, and the ability of our people to quickly and effectively respond to public health needs. There is absolutely no doubt that our diagnostics division, and therefore our company as a whole, is becoming a stronger organization through this challenging time. Now, we\u2019ll turn the call over to Karleen.\nKarleen Oberton: Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I\u2019m going to provide an overview of our divisional sales results, walk through our income statement, briefly touch on a few other key financial metrics, and finish by reinstating our financial guidance for the fourth quarter. Let me start by summarizing our third quarter results. Revenue of $822.9 million declined 3.1% due to the divestiture of Cynosure. Organically, we grew 8.1%, as strong sales of our COVID-19 diagnostic assays offset weakness in the rest of the business as a result of the pandemic. Profitability improved, with EPS of $0.75 increasing 19%, well ahead of our expectations. We entered the third quarter facing unprecedented uncertainty, and we acted prudently and decisively to reduce expenses and preserve cash. However, the hard work and ingenuity of our teams helped maximize the value of our two COVID assays, and the rest of our business is recovering better than expected. As a result, we generated strong cash flow in the quarter, which enabled us to repay $250 million that we had borrowed on our revolver as a precautionary measure. Our balance sheet and liquidity are stronger than ever. For all these reasons, we are optimistic that we are in position for a very successful fourth quarter. With that introduction, I will now provide some more detail on our divisional revenue results. Diagnostics, our largest division, grew an outstanding 74.9% in the third quarter driven by molecular, where sales increased 170.3%. As Steve mentioned, in response to the unprecedented need for COVID testing, we increased our production capacity substantially in the third quarter. This enabled us to ship about 13 million COVID tests to customers, generating revenue of $324 million. Outside of COVID-19 testing, our base molecular and cytology businesses declined, but trends improved as the quarter went on. Breast health revenue was negatively affected by the pandemic, but the division performed in line with our expectations. Global breast health sales of $224 million decreased 30.9%. Excluding $3.9 million of sales from SuperSonic Imagine, sales decreased 32.1% organically. Demand for many of our products was negatively impacted by COVID-19, especially in the United States, as our customers focused on responding to the pandemic, delayed or reduced purchases of capital equipment, and rescheduled routine screening appointments. However, service revenue and international sales declined much less, cushioning the overall decline. In surgical, sales of $51.5 million decreased 53.9%, better than our internal forecast as the business has begun to recover more rapidly than anticipated. Weekly demand declined close to 90% early in the quarter as elective procedures were postponed. However, we saw steady, substantial improvement in May and more so in June. Overall, in terms of geography, domestic sales of $660.8 million increased 2.9% on a reported basis, as strong sales of COVID tests more than offset the impact of the Cynosure divestiture and reductions across our other product lines. But on an organic basis, U.S. revenue was up 11.2%. Outside the United States, reported sales of $162.1 million decreased 21.2% on a reported basis and 2.8% organically. As you know, many countries began to emerge from the COVID pandemic earlier than the U.S. did, which helped our results. In addition, we began shipping our COVID-19 assays to our international customers in June, and expect these to be significant contributors to future growth. Moving on to the rest of the P&L for the third quarter. Gross margin of 64.7% increased 310 basis points, driven primarily by sales of COVID tests and the divestiture of the lower-margin Cynosure business. These benefits were partially offset by lower sales in our other divisions as a result of the pandemic. Total operating expenses of $261.1 million decreased 5.5% in the third quarter, driven mainly by the divestiture of Cynosure. However, expenses were significantly higher than our expectations entering the quarter, when we were planning for worst-case scenarios that thankfully never materialized. This was driven mainly by higher compensation expense, as accruals for incentive compensation increased in line with our financial results. In addition, we experienced higher than normal bad debt expense in the quarter, most notably a write-off associated with a change in a breast health distributor in Latin America. Lastly, we made a $10 million charitable contribution to the Company\u2019s donor-advised fund, and accelerated spending on some R&D and marketing programs to bolster future growth. Putting all this together, operating margin increased 380 basis points to 33%, and net margin increased 360 basis points to 23.7%, both recent highs. As a result, this led to non-GAAP net income of $194.7 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.75, well ahead of our expectations. Before we cover our 2020 fourth quarter guidance, I\u2019ll quickly touch on a few other financial metrics. At the end of the third quarter, our leverage ratio stood at 2.4 times, and we had $744 million of cash. Cash flow from operations was $223 million in the third quarter, a very strong result. Based on this cash flow, we repaid $250 million of debt under our revolving credit facility. We also believe we are well-positioned to take advantage of still-uncertain market conditions to pursue tuck-in acquisitions in each of our divisions. Our business development goals have not changed, we continue to look for deals that accelerate growth and deliver attractive economic returns, either by leveraging an existing commercial channel or helping us expand into near adjacencies. Finally, ROIC was 12.8% on a trailing 12-month basis, an increase of 30 basis points. And adjusted EBITDA of $299 million increased 8.2%. Before we open the call for questions, I would like to discuss our expectations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. While our business environment remains uncertain due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are pleased that visibility has increased compared to last quarter. This is enabling us to provide quarterly guidance again, albeit in much wider ranges than usual. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect total revenue in the range of $925 million to $1,025 million. This represents organic revenue growth of 17.4% to 30.3% for the quarter. Due to the divestiture of Cynosure, revenue compared to the prior year period equates to an increase of 6.7% to 18.3% on a constant currency basis. On the bottom line, we expect EPS of $0.95 to $1.15 in the fourth quarter. This implies growth rates of between 46.2% and 76.9%, significantly outpacing revenue. I\u2019d also like to point out that we expect other expenses net to increase to about $30 million in the fourth quarter, as we don\u2019t forecast gains related to certain investments that resulted from equity markets rebounding in the third quarter. This fourth quarter guidance is based on a full-year tax rate of 22.75%, and diluted shares outstanding of approximately 265 million for the full year. Now, let\u2019s turn briefly to our divisional expectations. In diagnostics, we expect that demand for our two COVID assays will continue to exceed supply in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. As Steve said, our efforts to increase manufacturing capacity should enable us to increase COVID sales compared to the third quarter level. And overall, we forecast that diagnostics revenue could double or more compared to the prior year period. In breast and skeletal health, recurring revenue such as service should continue to partially cushion a steeper decline in capital sales, reflecting the diversification strategy that we\u2019ve been pursuing for several years. Revenue should perform better outside the United States than domestically. We continue to believe that Breast Health will recover from COVID pressures more slowly than our other divisions. So, while fourth quarter results should be better than the third quarter, we still forecast that Breast and Skeletal Health revenue will decline in the range of 20% or more. In surgical, we believe revenue will continue to improve, based on both the clinical need for our products and the desire of our hospital customers to shore up their finances by addressing pent-up demand. However, there remains some uncertainty around the pace of this recovery, especially if COVID cases continue to spike in specific geographic regions and customers are forced to suspend elective procedures again. Overall, we expect surgical sales in the fourth quarter to be down around 20% compared to the prior year period. As you update your forecasts, let me remind you that macro uncertainty remains much higher than normal due to the virus we\u2019re all dealing with. That\u2019s why we\u2019re providing wide guidance ranges, and we would encourage you to model at the middle of these ranges, which incorporate both potential upsides and downsides. Before we open the call for questions, let me conclude by saying that Hologic\u2019s financial performance in the third quarter was excellent, and our financial condition remains rock-solid. As I look back, it\u2019s hard to describe how much our financial situation improved over the course of the quarter. For this we can thank an R&D team that quickly developed new COVID tests, and an operations and supply chain team that found a way to knock down just about every barrier to increased production. As Steve said, it\u2019s especially gratifying that we did well by doing good in the third quarter. What\u2019s more, we expect this performance to get even better in our fourth quarter. With that, I will ask the operator to open the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up, then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Donnelly: Great. Thanks, guys. Steve, I\u2019m not sure where to start. You got through a ton of impressive numbers. So, congratulations on that.\nSteve MacMillan: Thanks. It\u2019s team effort.\nPatrick Donnelly: Yes, absolutely. I know, you kind of called out things can change quickly in these times. I certainly appreciate that. But, maybe looking ahead, can you talk through your views on the durability of testing into 2021? I mean, it certainly sounds like you\u2019re pretty bullish on the opportunity, but maybe we focus on the U.S. International, you kind of gave some good color there. But, you guys have obviously ran capacity nicely. How are you thinking about the setup into fiscal \u201821? I mean, it seems like demand is only increasing recently. You gave those numbers on June. Any reason to think, things don\u2019t continue to accelerate as we head into 1Q and 2Q next year? As you guys have talked about, 4Q certainly looks better than 3Q. Maybe just talk though the setup there from the testing side with the visibility we have today?\nSteve MacMillan: Sure. And again, Patrick, as you well know, hard to put long range forecasting, but here\u2019s the way we think about it. And it was really around the decision we made in March to double our capacity by the fall which when people first looked at it, it was not. Now, here\u2019s the simple reality. We\u2019re going to be going into a cold and flu season. I think every single person that sneezes or coughs from September through the next season is going to end up getting tested for COVID. And it\u2019s not just U.S., it\u2019s globally. And even all the talk of the vaccines, let\u2019s say a vaccine comes, there\u2019s still so many unknowns. There\u2019s also the fundamental reality that it\u2019s going to take months to get everybody vaccinated. Even after that people are going to be still getting this thing. And particularly on a global basis, we\u2019re not going to vaccinate the world. And there\u2019s only so long we can shut the world down and have people stay at home and not traveling and everything else. So, I think we really see this. Again, can\u2019t exactly quantify the magnitude. But you know what, I mean, look at all the universities, right, everybody needs to get back to work. Testing is the key area to help get people comfortable. So, I think, we see this at least going well through the next season. And beyond that, this thing is so voracious that we really believe there\u2019s going to probably at a bare minimum be an ongoing trail of testing just for prevalence or something else and population screening for at least another year or two. I mean, I think even Pfizer announced as it relates to a vaccine, they see a vaccine market continuing for years. So, we really see there a lot more durability there. Having said that, if it\u2019s not, we got our base businesses as well. But, fundamentally, we think this thing is going to be far more persistent than I think where a lot of people necessarily thought at the beginning.\nPatrick Donnelly: That\u2019s helpful. And maybe on the marketing side, can you just talk through expectations there? Obviously, you guys are investing a lot for areas like capacity expansion. And are you plugging money into other growth initiatives, just capitalizing again on these near-term tailwinds and big cash flow numbers et cetera? And then, quickly on the margin as well. Anything to call out on the profile of the international COVID testing, is that a bit lower just given how massive those orders are?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. So, this is Karleen. So, a couple of things. So, yes, certainly, we are investing in capacity but also in our R&D, for sure, to accelerate future products. And on your point on ASPs outside of the U.S., yes, those will be a little lower than what we\u2019ve seen at this point in the U.S.\nOperator: We\u2019ll now take our next question from Chris Lin with Cowen. Go ahead.\nChris Lin: Steve, in your prepared remarks, you stated that Hologic has increased manufacturing even more, if you can work through some of the supply chain constraints? Could you just help us understand what these constraints are? And if you are able to overcome them, how much would your manufacturing capacity increase over 1.5 million per week?\nSteve MacMillan: Sure, Chris. The constraints themselves go really through the supply chain. A lot of it\u2019s even things that get used on Panther itself. So, our ability to produce the test kits and everything else is good, but they\u2019re -- you\u2019ve seen some acknowledgment out there about pipette tip shortages and other things like that. Things that we don\u2019t control that we don\u2019t even supply to the vendors, they buy them directly. So, we\u2019re even working with manufacturers of some of the ancillary ingredients. And it\u2019s probably a little too early to sell. We think there\u2019s clearly a little bit of upside beyond the high end of our guidance, if we can crack these things. But, feel really good about the guidance we have.\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. And I would just add that if we think about increasing capacity, we\u2019re seeing our base business and diagnostics come back as well. So, it\u2019s going to be a challenge balancing on the two products.\nChris Lin: Got it. And then, for my follow-up, I believe your Panther shipment forecast of 500 total placements in fiscal 2020 implies that placements declined sequentially in Q4 from the eight systems that you placed in Q3. If this is right, could you just provide a bit more detail on this decline? Is it a function of Stratec manufacturing constraints and depleting your refurbished research lab systems? And just looking ahead, can you give us a sense of the Panther instrument backlog? Thank you.\nSteve MacMillan: Sure. Chris, they will be a little bit lower. To your point, we said about 50 of those that we shipped were refurbished ones. So, they\u2019re all gone. We\u2019ve literally taken every one out of our buildings that we didn\u2019t have. We\u2019d also had a little bit of inventory coming into the quarter. So, we\u2019ve shipped -- as you can imagine, we shipped every last one. As I joked every time, there was a White House press conference and various customers or whatever were down there promising more volume, they came back in the next day, it\u2019s 1-800 Hologic, what else can you do for us? So, we drained everything that we had in inventory. We\u2019re building now certainly at about a double the rate, but it will be a bit of a sequential decline. But we got -- we made so much progress this quarter that that already sets us up well.\nOperator: We\u2019ll hear next from Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan.\nTycho Peterson: Hey, thanks. Steve, there\u2019s been a lot of talk about pooling samples. Can you just talk a little bit about what you think pooling will do to Panther utilization? And then, any thoughts on flu test for legacy cancer to have a syndromic panel on the larger installed base?\nSteve MacMillan: Sure. Tycho, as you well know, as a leader in this space, we\u2019re so close to the FDA, to our customers and trying to help come up with solutions. I think, as it relates to pooling, we are working closely with FDA and with our customers to look at some claims and think that we\u2019ll be certainly a player in that space. And it may help increase the overall capacity, particularly in an environment right now where there frankly a lot more people that would still like to be tested. We think that may help. More on a testing where it\u2019s less diagnostic and more screening, I think there\u2019s going to be a ton of that come the fall with universities and everybody else trying to get back. So, we think there will become a place for pooling and it\u2019s something we\u2019re very familiar with really going back to our blood screening days. So, as it relates to a combo again, you can imagine, given our presence in this space, we\u2019re looking at combo products for the fall as well. We continue to hear from customers government -- COVID is going to be the primary need. I hate to say it, but we think this year that frankly when somebody gets flu, they\u2019re going to be relieved versus COVID is still going to be a bigger concern. But, we\u2019ll be there in all fronts.\nTycho Peterson: And then, for the follow-up, just can you talk a little bit more about the women\u2019s health recovery? How you think about that beyond the fiscal fourth quarter? Mammography may start to come back. Is that more of a 2021 event, or could you see some uptick in the year-end?\nSteve MacMillan: Yes. I think, part of what we\u2019re not totally sure about yet, we\u2019ve seen a significant strengthening, certainly June, Julyish of both our surgical and women\u2019s health businesses and diagnostics. We think a chunk of that was catch up, people that delayed and kind of got rescheduled. So we\u2019re not yet sure exactly what the trajectory will be, particularly as you have any additional hotspots and this and that. But, I think overall, we feel pretty good about the progress there. And really, our Breast Health business, the diversification that we have in that business, so much more disposable and recurring service revenue and everything else. That is probably still going to be the slower climb out. But, we\u2019re seeing some real positive signs in that business as well. But, having said that, we\u2019re obviously forecasting, as Karleen said, still to be down somewhat in the current quarter and continuing probably to strengthen here over time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Leonard with Wells Fargo.\nDan Leonard: A couple of questions on COVID, surprise, surprise. So, first off, Steve, you talked about the opportunity to use your COVID test to capture other test volume longer term. Can you elaborate on the mechanics of that? Is that contractual, and how confident are you that customers aren\u2019t acquiring Panthers with the intent to mothball in 12 months?\nSteve MacMillan: I think a couple of things. We\u2019re very confident and that many of them are contractually there, both U.S. and internationally. Internationally, we really link it very clearly into -- hate to say it, but we\u2019re providing you COVID tests, and there\u2019s a clear linkage to as the COVID volume goes away, we will fill the Panthers with our women\u2019s health assays. So, there\u2019s a lot of new customers that are going to be coming on board. The other fundamental reality that we see everywhere, and it\u2019s why as you see Hologic, we haven\u2019t been showing up at the press conferences, but we\u2019re clearly showing up in the marketplace. Everybody loves Panther. And the more that people use Panther, the more they want to use it. And by definition, the lab techs are constantly out screaming -- we\u2019ve got a number of governors call Kevin Thornal and say, you know what, I was just touring a couple of the labs in our state, all I keep hearing about is how great your Panther is. And so, that even experience there, I think we\u2019re seeing more and more people just getting experienced on it, and they love it.\nDan Leonard: Okay. And then, for my follow-up, you talked about where the Panthers are going between TIGRIS competitive wins and some new customers, new to automated molecular diagnostics. That latter group, could you elaborate on what these customers look like? I think, you hinted at some nascent opportunities. But, really what does the demographic in this new to automated molecular diagnostic customer look like?\nSteve MacMillan: There\u2019s one that we had referenced, which is a company called LetsGetChecked, and they\u2019re doing a lot of direct to patient where they use our sample, they send it out, people send it back in and they\u2019re running it on our Panther. And while it certainly -- they were actually a nascent customer in with our base products, then as COVID came in, it\u2019s a real opportunity. We\u2019ve known several people, just locally have even used them. So, I think, those are examples of one that we\u2019ll be breaking out.\nOperator: We\u2019ll next take our next question from Brian Weinstein with William Blair.\nBrian Weinstein: Steve, that was quite a door slam that you guys just did. So, congrats on that.\nSteve MacMillan: Thank you. Our Panthers were born to run.\nBrian Weinstein: Yes, they were. I appreciate that. But, not bad on your part, nice job. As we think about that 1.5 million per week here and all the demand that\u2019s there. You mentioned U.S., you mentioned OUS, and gave some details on those OUS supply agreements that you guys have signed? Do you need to increase the capacity in order to be able to -- to meet those U.S. supply agreements? And how are you sort of allocating this between the U.S. and the OUS at this point?\nSteve MacMillan: Yes. We do -- we\u2019ve only committed to what we know we can make. So, that 500 million number that we referenced over the next four quarters internationally is included in our production plans. If we can expand beyond that, we know there continues to be more business, both domestically and abroad. What\u2019s great is this is where, frankly, having our manufacturing facility in Manchester, UK, also, because that\u2019s our diagnostics facility for Europe. Again, just not -- it\u2019s not just San Diego but it\u2019s them cranking full out now and we really got them up and running in late June on the COVID test.\nBrian Weinstein: Okay. And then, if I could just kind of press on the previous question a little bit here, from the idea of the combo test. I wasn\u2019t sure if you were committing to being in the market before the proceeding and that that would be sort of a true combo test that would be COVID flu, or if you\u2019re going to get a flu test sort of approved on to Panther, then have kind of a way of doing flu and COVID by running two separate tests or just how you\u2019re thinking about kind of pursuing that and just to confirm, if you would be on the market you thought by the flu season or not?\nMike Watts: Hey, Brian, it\u2019s Mike. I\u2019m going to take that one without the Springsteen reference, I think, sorry. So, just as -- a couple of things. One, just as a reminder, we have the ability to do multiple flu plus COVID on our fusion instrument today, as you know. So, that\u2019ll be an important part of the armamentarium. And we are developing a second test; it\u2019ll run on the Panther side that will combine flu with COVID. I\u2019m not going to speculate on when that\u2019s going to be available. Obviously that\u2019s impossible to predict. But certainly, the goal is to have it available for the fall flu season.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research.\nJack Meehan: Thank you. Good afternoon. I\u2019ll continue on the diagnostic theme. I was curious if you could just comment on how you expect customers to use their Panther systems as the routine volumes start to improve, but the COVID testing sustains. Sorry, can you hear me?\nSteve MacMillan: Yes.\nJack Meehan: Sorry. I thought I could hear something in the background. Yes. Just how you expect customers use the Panther systems? As the COVID testing sustains, do the routine volumes come back? And is there any cannibalization of the existing testing that you expect?\nSteve MacMillan: It\u2019s part of the magic, by the way, as you know, with the random access Panther. It\u2019s so easy to be able to run the women\u2019s health test, the COVID test simultaneously, not having to bash, not having to do all the other stuff that can slow stuff down. So, we really are seeing our key customers using it for both. And obviously, we are not going to short change our core business that we\u2019ve built this Company on, which is women\u2019s health. So, all of the numbers we\u2019re providing are continuing to do well within our women\u2019s health business, plus adding on that additional COVID volume. But, I think we see the customers being able to use both and it\u2019s part of the -- again it\u2019s part of the big magic in our system, as you well know.\nKarleen Oberton: And Jack, I would just add that, I think we had talked about prior to COVID that on average, a Panther was only 35% utilized. So, there was capacity already within that installed base to add additional testing.\nJack Meehan: Great. And then, Steve, I was wondering if everything going on with COVID-19, if it changes your philosophy around M&A in the diagnostic space at all. Historically, I don\u2019t think you guys have looked at point-of-care as closely given your positioning in the hospital and regional labs. But, do you think it makes sense with the focus on early detection to push further that way?\nSteve MacMillan: Jack, great question. I would think you\u2019ll see us continuing or probably accelerating a little bit of our bolt-on strategy, probably with both, surgical as well as diagnostics, some things that we\u2019re looking and teeing up. And we think this is going to put us in a good position to acquire. Having said that, we also think there\u2019s -- there are clearly some lofty valuations that have been created within some of the space of diagnostics right now. So, we\u2019re also willing to be patient and certainly don\u2019t need to do anything, but I think it does give us more flexibility. And frankly, having Kevin Thornal out here running this business, as many of you know, Kevin work for several years in business development in his Stryker days, having him now running this diagnostics business and doing an amazing job of that. He also brings a deeper business development bolt-on mindset. And I can tell you, there\u2019s a lot more activity going on in the division with his leadership here.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Anthony Petrone with Jefferies.\nAnthony Petrone: I had just a couple of math questions on some of the numbers you threw out here Steve and Karleen. And so, first thing would be, is the 500 million you referenced over the next four quarters for Europe, I guess, how much of that is baked into fiscal 4Q? Should we just expect that evenly loaded until a quarter of that goes into next Q? And then, how much is baked in there I guess for the fourth quarter for back to school? And you referenced it earlier, Steve, but that just strikes us as being a big driver next quarter. And then, last, just to get it in there, if we do it another way for looking at your production capacity, at a minimum, we\u2019re coming up with 400 million for just 4Q. Is that a good starting point when we think about the next 90 days?\nSteve MacMillan: Certainly, starting on the 500 million, which is an international number, that\u2019s called Asia Pac as well as Europe, it\u2019s primarily Europe, but just let me set the record straight there. I think, a good way to think about that is fairly level loaded over the next four quarters is kind of the way that the contracts are laying out. As it relates to back to school, we\u2019re clearly -- we\u2019ve been building and trying to ramp to get more and more production for this September-October period. So, I think that we\u2019re clearly seeing and expecting continued growth in this September timeframe. And that\u2019s what\u2019s baked into our guidance.\nOperator: We\u2019ll here next from Dan Brennan with UBS.\nDan Brennan: So, Steve, I guess, could you help us think through maybe how you\u2019re thinking about where the market for testing goes? I think, you mentioned we\u2019re somewhere in the low-20s in the U.S. right now. Where do you think that goes by the fall? Any sense, and how you\u2019re kind of planning your business? And I\u2019d be interested to know if you could provide what your split is as well between U.S. I know U.S. COVID testing, because it\u2019s hard to get a sense of what the OUS COVID testing number is.\nSteve MacMillan: Yes. Well, obviously, we\u2019ve effectively given you a number in terms of, if you take that 500 million outside and divide it by 4 over the next four quarters, hopefully, it keeps you in the range of what the international component will be. Obviously, there\u2019ll still be more of it going to the U.S. as well. So, it\u2019s hard to exactly know where this market\u2019s going. But, I think when we were -- I remember being part of an AdvaMed call in -- geez, it was late April, early May, and they were saying that the country has the capacity to maybe do 400,000 tests a day maximum. We\u2019re now in that -- I love your report every day, 750,000 to 800,000 and we\u2019ve hit 900,000 a day. I\u2019d be surprised probably, if we\u2019re not at 1 million a day in that September timeframe. But again, we\u2019re -- obviously we\u2019ve gone -- the way I think about it as we went 5 million in April, 10 million in May, 15 in June. July is going to be over 20 million. It probably puts us on that pace to a 30ish million number of tests in the United States in that September timeframe, and I think, being very persistent as it goes through the whole cold and flu season.\nDan Brennan: Great. Thank you for that. And then, maybe just one more on vaccine. You kind of gave your -- some color upfront on some consumer survey stuff and kind of how you think about the persistence of testing, even when we have a vaccine in the market and we\u2019ll have to wait and see what the efficacy of it does look like. But, is the sense that -- I think you talked about a real persistent strength in \u201821. So, you talked about HPV and influenza. But, we were thinking too that there could certainly be a much higher vaccination rate, given the economic climate that this has caused. So, I think some investors worry that if we get an effective vaccine that the testing market could dry up rather quickly if there\u2019s like dramatically higher adherence towards getting it. So, anyway, it\u2019s hard to put the cart before the horse. But, how should we think about you think that persistence in the \u201821, which you talked about, when we begin to get some of this vaccine data out and what are some of the signposts for watching you think to see how strong and steady testing could be?\nSteve MacMillan: Yes. I think, think about it, particularly for the first half of \u201821, while the vaccine is rolling out, there\u2019s still going to be a bunch of people getting sick. And in the United States, by the way, you got what 350ish million people. And the big part that I keep coming back to because of all of our discussions and as a global enterprise, I think there has been so much focus on COVID in the U.S. We\u2019re not going to eradicate -- we\u2019re not going to vaccinate 7 billion people in the world. And given how persistent this is, just Vietnam, if you heard today, right, Vietnam had gone I think 90 days without any cases, and suddenly three popped up in Vietnam. So, I think there is going to be -- this is going to be circulating around the world. And again, exactly what that means -- none of us have the crystal ball. The CDC doesn\u2019t have it, the WHO doesn\u2019t have it. God forbid, I certainly and our team don\u2019t have it. But, I think just trying to use some common sense, thinking about the real realities, by the way, I mean if I\u2019m honest with you, who\u2019s going to likely get vaccinated first in the United States is probably going to be people who have a little more money, who are in the suburbs, and are we going to be getting the migrant worker population and a lot of the other folks that we really need to get where the persistence is bigger? Not sure we\u2019re going to get all of those people right away. So, I think there\u2019s going to be all kinds of reasons why this thing\u2019s still going to be out there. The other reality is, even though with the next five, six months before a vaccine comes, I think we\u2019re going to start to get better at realizing. And it\u2019d be helpful if some of the public officials would say, what we have to do is realize we\u2019ve got to live with this and learn how to cope and learn how to manage. And diagnostics is such a great tool to help people better understand where is it breaking out, what should we not do? And I think we\u2019re getting smarter and smarter, so that we don\u2019t go into complete lockdowns again and everything else. So, I think there is going to be all kinds of ways. If you\u2019re a university president right now, so many folks that need information that we\u2019re going to be helpful too to provide.\nMike Watts: Operator, I think we can squeeze in -- we can squeeze in two more questions. Maybe we\u2019ll just limit these last two to one question each, please.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take the next question from Ivy Ma with Bank of America.\nIvy Ma: So, I\u2019ll be quick on the question. So, I appreciate the color on the 40 million tests per quarter in terms of COVID capacity. So, I\u2019m curious, would you expect that one-four to one-third market share to persist in the next several quarters? And related to that, I mean, do you expect point-of-care to take share from what\u2019s currently being going on? And what percentage are you selling to hospitals or other facilities that might have some POC installed during this time?\nSteve MacMillan: That was good job, getting about 14 questions in there, Ivy. So, very impressive. Let me try to get as much of those answers as I can. First off, to clarify, the 40 million that we\u2019re building for production capacity is our total molecular volumes, of which clearly well more than half of that will be going pretty much towards our base business. So, I just want to make sure we didn\u2019t confuse and suggest that was a COVID production volume. In terms of market share, we\u2019re really not that focused on market share right now because I don\u2019t think any of us can provide. The real battle -- while we normally battle our competitors, the battle here is all of us battling this pandemic and battling coronavirus. So, I think there\u2019s going to be plenty of business for us going here. I think, as it relates to point-of-care, the point-of-care certainly has a role. But at the end of the day, super high volume, it\u2019s hard to test 1,000 people using point-of-care just from a manual -- the time that it takes. While it\u2019s quick to get one test back for one person, or you get four people tested, it\u2019s hard to do hundreds of people in a point-of-care world. And when you\u2019re as a country right now conducting the level of tests, 700,000, 800,000, 900,000 tests a day, you\u2019ve got to have high throughput, high volume systems to do that. So, I think, we\u2019re in one of those unique situations where point-of-care is probably going to continue to grow and we\u2019re going to continue to grow.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our final question from Richard Newitter from SVB Leerink. Please go ahead.\nRichard Newitter: Thanks for squeezing me in here, and congrats on the quarter. Steve, if I could just maybe, on the non-COVID part of the business, specifically in your surgical business. Could you just elaborate a little bit on the trend, as you\u2019re exiting June and into July? I appreciate, you had mentioned some backlog work down or deferred procedures getting back on the schedule. But, is there -- what was the trend in the most recent two weeks? Was it improved from the exit rate coming out of June? And if you can talk a little bit on the actual new visits, de novo kind of visits, if you will, and what you\u2019re seeing anecdotally, in terms of patients seeking out care from that standpoint? Thank you.\nSteve MacMillan: Yes. Rich, we\u2019re not going to get into how the last two weeks were relative to other two weeks and this and that. I think it\u2019s baked into our guidance. We see our surgical business being down roughly 20ish percent this quarter. That\u2019s a dramatic improvement from the down 50% plus last quarter. I think, we like seeing a comeback. And then, we have some really good days and then you have Texas or Florida goes into a slight little lockdown again or whatever, and you see a little bit of things back. So, we don\u2019t have perfect visibility to the trend going forward, but we feel really good about the trajectory. We do -- to the second part of your question on new visits versus backlog, we\u2019re trying to track that and we\u2019ve got combinations of both a little more new. We don\u2019t have exact numbers. But clearly, MyoSure with its -- people have fibroid cases. That\u2019s going to be -- that\u2019s a lot of new and existing. And NovaSure, there was a little more catch-up initially. But, I think we\u2019re starting to see new patients coming back in as well.\nOperator: That is all the time we have for questions today. This now concludes Hologic\u2019s second (sic) [third] quarter fiscal 2020 earnings conference call. Have a good evening.",

            "name": "Karleen Oberton",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'm going to provide an overview of our divisional sales results, walk through our income statement, briefly touch on a few other key financial metrics, and finish by reinstating our financial guidance for the fourth quarter. Let me start by summarizing our third quarter results. Revenue of $822.9 million declined 3.1% due to the divestiture of Cynosure. Organically, we grew 8.1%, as strong sales of our COVID-19 diagnostic assays offset weakness in the rest of the business as a result of the pandemic. Profitability improved, with EPS of $0.75 increasing 19%, well ahead of our expectations. We entered the third quarter facing unprecedented uncertainty, and we acted prudently and decisively to reduce expenses and preserve cash. However, the hard work and ingenuity of our teams helped maximize the value of our two COVID assays, and the rest of our business is recovering better than expected. As a result, we generated strong cash flow in the quarter, which enabled us to repay $250 million that we had borrowed on our revolver as a precautionary measure. Our balance sheet and liquidity are stronger than ever. For all these reasons, we are optimistic that we are in position for a very successful fourth quarter. With that introduction, I will now provide some more detail on our divisional revenue results. Diagnostics, our largest division, grew an outstanding 74.9% in the third quarter driven by molecular, where sales increased 170.3%. As Steve mentioned, in response to the unprecedented need for COVID testing, we increased our production capacity substantially in the third quarter. This enabled us to ship about 13 million COVID tests to customers, generating revenue of $324 million. Outside of COVID-19 testing, our base molecular and cytology businesses declined, but trends improved as the quarter went on. Breast health revenue was negatively affected by the pandemic, but the division performed in line with our expectations. Global breast health sales of $224 million decreased 30.9%. Excluding $3.9 million of sales from SuperSonic Imagine, sales decreased 32.1% organically. Demand for many of our products was negatively impacted by COVID-19, especially in the United States, as our customers focused on responding to the pandemic, delayed or reduced purchases of capital equipment, and rescheduled routine screening appointments. However, service revenue and international sales declined much less, cushioning the overall decline. In surgical, sales of $51.5 million decreased 53.9%, better than our internal forecast as the business has begun to recover more rapidly than anticipated. Weekly demand declined close to 90% early in the quarter as elective procedures were postponed. However, we saw steady, substantial improvement in May and more so in June. Overall, in terms of geography, domestic sales of $660.8 million increased 2.9% on a reported basis, as strong sales of COVID tests more than offset the impact of the Cynosure divestiture and reductions across our other product lines. But on an organic basis, U.S. revenue was up 11.2%. Outside the United States, reported sales of $162.1 million decreased 21.2% on a reported basis and 2.8% organically. As you know, many countries began to emerge from the COVID pandemic earlier than the U.S. did, which helped our results. In addition, we began shipping our COVID-19 assays to our international customers in June, and expect these to be significant contributors to future growth. Moving on to the rest of the P&L for the third quarter. Gross margin of 64.7% increased 310 basis points, driven primarily by sales of COVID tests and the divestiture of the lower-margin Cynosure business. These benefits were partially offset by lower sales in our other divisions as a result of the pandemic. Total operating expenses of $261.1 million decreased 5.5% in the third quarter, driven mainly by the divestiture of Cynosure. However, expenses were significantly higher than our expectations entering the quarter, when we were planning for worst-case scenarios that thankfully never materialized. This was driven mainly by higher compensation expense, as accruals for incentive compensation increased in line with our financial results. In addition, we experienced higher than normal bad debt expense in the quarter, most notably a write-off associated with a change in a breast health distributor in Latin America. Lastly, we made a $10 million charitable contribution to the Company's donor-advised fund, and accelerated spending on some R&D and marketing programs to bolster future growth. Putting all this together, operating margin increased 380 basis points to 33%, and net margin increased 360 basis points to 23.7%, both recent highs. As a result, this led to non-GAAP net income of $194.7 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.75, well ahead of our expectations. Before we cover our 2020 fourth quarter guidance, I'll quickly touch on a few other financial metrics. At the end of the third quarter, our leverage ratio stood at 2.4 times, and we had $744 million of cash. Cash flow from operations was $223 million in the third quarter, a very strong result. Based on this cash flow, we repaid $250 million of debt under our revolving credit facility. We also believe we are well-positioned to take advantage of still-uncertain market conditions to pursue tuck-in acquisitions in each of our divisions. Our business development goals have not changed, we continue to look for deals that accelerate growth and deliver attractive economic returns, either by leveraging an existing commercial channel or helping us expand into near adjacencies. Finally, ROIC was 12.8% on a trailing 12-month basis, an increase of 30 basis points. And adjusted EBITDA of $299 million increased 8.2%. Before we open the call for questions, I would like to discuss our expectations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. While our business environment remains uncertain due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are pleased that visibility has increased compared to last quarter. This is enabling us to provide quarterly guidance again, albeit in much wider ranges than usual. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect total revenue in the range of $925 million to $1,025 million. This represents organic revenue growth of 17.4% to 30.3% for the quarter. Due to the divestiture of Cynosure, revenue compared to the prior year period equates to an increase of 6.7% to 18.3% on a constant currency basis. On the bottom line, we expect EPS of $0.95 to $1.15 in the fourth quarter. This implies growth rates of between 46.2% and 76.9%, significantly outpacing revenue. I'd also like to point out that we expect other expenses net to increase to about $30 million in the fourth quarter, as we don't forecast gains related to certain investments that resulted from equity markets rebounding in the third quarter. This fourth quarter guidance is based on a full-year tax rate of 22.75%, and diluted shares outstanding of approximately 265 million for the full year. Now, let's turn briefly to our divisional expectations. In diagnostics, we expect that demand for our two COVID assays will continue to exceed supply in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. As Steve said, our efforts to increase manufacturing capacity should enable us to increase COVID sales compared to the third quarter level. And overall, we forecast that diagnostics revenue could double or more compared to the prior year period. In breast and skeletal health, recurring revenue such as service should continue to partially cushion a steeper decline in capital sales, reflecting the diversification strategy that we've been pursuing for several years. Revenue should perform better outside the United States than domestically. We continue to believe that Breast Health will recover from COVID pressures more slowly than our other divisions. So, while fourth quarter results should be better than the third quarter, we still forecast that Breast and Skeletal Health revenue will decline in the range of 20% or more. In surgical, we believe revenue will continue to improve, based on both the clinical need for our products and the desire of our hospital customers to shore up their finances by addressing pent-up demand. However, there remains some uncertainty around the pace of this recovery, especially if COVID cases continue to spike in specific geographic regions and customers are forced to suspend elective procedures again. Overall, we expect surgical sales in the fourth quarter to be down around 20% compared to the prior year period. As you update your forecasts, let me remind you that macro uncertainty remains much higher than normal due to the virus we're all dealing with. That's why we're providing wide guidance ranges, and we would encourage you to model at the middle of these ranges, which incorporate both potential upsides and downsides. Before we open the call for questions, let me conclude by saying that Hologic's financial performance in the third quarter was excellent, and our financial condition remains rock-solid. As I look back, it's hard to describe how much our financial situation improved over the course of the quarter. For this we can thank an R&D team that quickly developed new COVID tests, and an operations and supply chain team that found a way to knock down just about every barrier to increased production. As Steve said, it's especially gratifying that we did well by doing good in the third quarter. What's more, we expect this performance to get even better in our fourth quarter. With that, I will ask the operator to open the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up, then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question. Yes. So, this is Karleen. So, a couple of things. So, yes, certainly, we are investing in capacity but also in our R&D, for sure, to accelerate future products. And on your point on ASPs outside of the U.S., yes, those will be a little lower than what we've seen at this point in the U.S. Yes. And I would just add that if we think about increasing capacity, we're seeing our base business and diagnostics come back as well. So, it's going to be a challenge balancing on the two products. And Jack, I would just add that, I think we had talked about prior to COVID that on average, a Panther was only 35% utilized. So, there was capacity already within that installed base to add additional testing."

            "name": "Steve MacMillan",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to discuss our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Our results were very strong, and reflect the value of our unique set of businesses in a time of great economic uncertainty. To begin, these last several months have been the most challenging, tumultuous, and unpredictable time of my career, but also the most exhilarating and ultimately gratifying. There's still a lot of history to be written regarding this pandemic, and things can change very quickly in COVID time. But, we're very pleased with the significant contributions Hologic has made to human health thus far, and excited about our ability to do even more. I am just so proud of our team, who are working day and night with customers, regulators, suppliers, elected officials and others to address the most pressing problem facing the world today. In the last couple of years, we've talked a lot about social responsibility and Hologic's corporate purpose, to enable healthier lives everywhere, every day. It is this purpose that inspired our people to do more than seemed possible in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Never before have we lived into our mission more completely or touched more human lives than during the COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, our results flow from the positive impact we're making on human health. Karleen will cover the details, but let's start by saying that while the quarter began with great uncertainty and painful decisions to preserve cash flow, it ended with results that were better than we ever envisioned. We posted total revenue of $822.9 million and earnings per share of $0.75. Revenue grew 8.1% organically, and EPS increased 19%. These growth rates, our best organic performance in a very long time, significantly beat our expectations at the start of the quarter. Outperformance was driven by unprecedented demand for our COVID tests on the Panther system, as well as the quicker-than-expected strengthening of our surgical division. In addition, COVID testing surged late in the quarter, so our results also far exceeded the update we provided via the 8-K in June. We'll now highlight three primary points related to COVID, then Karleen will cover the rest of the business. First, our manufacturing and supply chain team did an amazing job in the quarter to ramp up production of our COVID assays, helping more labs and doctors deliver diagnostic insights when and where they are needed. Second, we believe our diagnostic response to COVID will have short, medium and long-term benefits for the Company as a whole. And third, the strengthening of our international franchises over the years is enabling us to make a big difference in the COVID fight today, which in turn will further accelerate our international business going forward. Let's start with manufacturing and supply chain, an area that doesn't get a lot of attention on the typical earnings call. That's unfortunate, because delivering high-quality, highly precise products that doctors rely on to make critical decisions is at the core of our business. In the case of COVID, we are producing millions of tests that weren't even invented a few short months ago, and each test has to meet exactingly high performance and quality standards. In this unique time when demand for COVID tests is exceeding supply, high-quality, high-volume manufacturing is critical. Although you'd never know it from the media stories, the diagnostics industry as a whole has done an unbelievable job of ramping up COVID production capacity. As a nation, we are on pace to conduct about 23 million tests in July. This is more than double the level of testing as recently as May, and more than 20 times the number of tests performed in March. In total, more than 52 million COVID tests have been performed in the United States. For perspective, this is about 50% more than in the other G7 countries combined. Never before has a molecular diagnostic test been scaled up to these volumes, this fast. In fact, the amount of COVID testing being done today is about seven times greater than the next most common molecular diagnostic test. Our industry and its employees have a lot to be proud of, and we are striving to do more. In Hologic's case, as soon as we launched our first COVID assay in March, a PCR test that runs on Panther Fusion, we were overwhelmed with calls from customers everywhere. So, we immediately activated three key projects, working closely with our suppliers and partners around the world. First, we began developing a second COVID assay to leverage our proprietary Aptima technologies and manufacturing capacity, and to run on our large installed base of Panther instruments. Pre-COVID, we produced about 20 million molecular diagnostic tests a quarter, with the vast majority of this comprising TMA assays for infectious diseases like chlamydia, HPV and HIV. Since the pandemic reduced demand for these tests, we were able to redirect human and technological capacity to produce our Aptima COVID assay. In essence, we merged the supply chains for our COVID tests and our legacy products to increase COVID production capacity. Second, we set out to double our molecular diagnostics manufacturing capacity by the fall, to 40 million tests or more per quarter as we move into fiscal \u201821. We essentially established a goal to achieve our 10-year expansion plan in about six months. And third, we began working with our partner Stratec to roughly double production of our Panther instruments. Based on these actions, in our earnings call three months ago we shared our goal to produce at least 1 million COVID tests a week, on average, starting in late May. This would have enabled us to realize revenue of $150 million or more in the second quarter. Thanks to Herculean efforts by our operations team, we're proud to report that we significantly exceeded this goal, and were able to increase our total molecular diagnostics test production by about 50% in the third quarter, to roughly 30 million tests. This enabled us to ship almost 13 million COVID tests to customers, including an extra production lot, leading to sales of $324 million. Based on data from the COVID Tracking Project, we estimate that we provided one-fourth to one-third of the test results delivered in the United States during the quarter. How did we get there? Through a combination of ingenuity, investment and brute force. In terms of ingenuity, we validated the use of one of our specimen transfer tubes, one that is typically used with our ThinPrep Pap tests, for COVID testing. This helped total kit capacity catch up to our underlying production of reagents, and enabled us to ship millions of additional tests. And we validated a new sample collection and loading method that reduces the use of penetrable caps, a short-term constraint that we discussed last quarter. In terms of investment, we currently expect to spend over $50 million in capital to expand COVID production, with about $14 million of that spent through the third quarter. Some of this is being used to install new high-speed filling lines, and we are also investing in new, custom machinery to produce more penetrable caps. As announced this week, this effort is also being supported by HHS and DoD. In terms of brute force, we are producing 24/7 at our facility in San Diego. Employees from areas like IS and finance were trained to work on the packaging lines, while we hire over 150 new operations employees here, more than a 50% increase. We also expanded capabilities at our diagnostics plant in Manchester, United Kingdom, which began producing COVID tests at the end of June. Overall, these actions have provided the capacity to produce at least 1.5 million COVID tests per week, on average, and should enable COVID sales to increase sequentially in the fourth quarter, over and above our very strong Q3 even while accommodating higher volumes of our women's health tests. And there is the potential to do more if we are able to work through some remaining supply chain constraints on certain instrument components. The second point is that our diagnostic response to COVID will have short, medium and long-term benefits for Hologic as a whole. In the short-term, the benefits are obvious. Over the next several quarters, COVID testing will help drive strong overall corporate growth even before the base business fully recovers. In the medium-term, we expect that the record number of Panther and Panther Fusion instruments that we are placing now will turbo-charge our razor-razor blade business model, and dramatically increase pull-through of other assays. These include our new women's health tests, our quantitative virology products, and our respiratory mini-panels. To illustrate this, over the last several years, we have placed an average of 228 new Panther systems globally per year. In the third quarter alone, we placed 208 systems, 208. This was made possible by a significant expansion of production capacity at Stratec, and even by refurbishing more than 50 Panthers from our own research labs. At the end of June, our installed base stood at more than 2,000 systems, with almost 45% of these outside the United States. And over this fiscal year, we expect to place about 500 Panthers, more than doubling our recent, annual run-rate. Of the 152 systems shipped this quarter in the United States, we estimate that more than 60% will replace one of our older, workhorse TIGRIS systems over time. This will enable those customers to access our full menu of 16 FDA-authorized tests on Panther, rather than the 4 that are cleared on TIGRIS. The other 40% of systems either displaced a competitor, or enabled a new customer to begin testing. And some of these new customers are specifically targeting nascent growth opportunities such as home sample collection. One way we measure new customer adoption internally, as well as incentivize our sales force, is by tracking what we call TORs, or Tests of Record, and the contracted year-one revenue associated with them. A TOR is achieved when a customer goes live with a new assay on our system. In 2020, even as COVID is driving tremendous interest in Panther, our sales team has been focused on securing downstream revenue from other tests. Based on their excellent work and motivated by double the payout on non-COVID TORs, we have already set a record for TOR revenue. And we have even more signed and waiting to go live over the next couple of quarters. Since Panther was cleared in 2012, we have seen over and over again that as customers come to know and love the system, they adopt additional tests that drive even more pull-through, and we would expect the same dynamic to play out here. This will drive growth in the long term, even as multiple COVID vaccines are hopefully commercialized. While everyone at Hologic is rooting for successful vaccine development, it's important to note that the strength and duration of immunity still have to be established. And consumer surveys indicate that many people may choose not to be vaccinated. For these reasons, we also forecast there will be a long-term market for COVID testing on a global basis, just as testing co-exists with vaccines today for pathogens such as HPV, hepatitis B and influenza. The third point we want to make is that the strengthening of our international franchises over the years is enabling us to make a big difference in the fight against COVID today, which in turn will reshape our international businesses going forward. Let us give you a little more color on that. Over the last three years, international sales have been a major growth driver for the Company, with our base businesses growing at a low-double-digit CAGR organically. Within this, molecular diagnostics has been leading the charge, with growth rates often exceeding 20%. Underpinning this growth, we have invested methodically in our leadership and commercial infrastructure. We also divested Cynosure, which enabled our leaders to focus on the businesses they know best. For example, in our European region specifically, we had an installed base of about 220 Panthers in 2016, just before our regional president Jan Verstreken joined the Company. By the end of the third quarter, however, that number had doubled. By leveraging this installed base, our team has signed contracts in about a dozen countries that secure about $500 million of COVID testing revenue over the next four quarters, with opportunities to grow this further. The largest contract is with the UK Department of Health, which is worth nearly $190 million. While the vast majority of our COVID revenues in the third quarter came from the United States, expanding production capacity will enable us to serve more global customers going forward. In the third quarter alone, we shipped almost 60 Panther instruments to lab customers outside the United States. And like in the U.S., our commercial teams are capitalizing on the intense demand for COVID tests to drive pull-through of our other assays, which is a robust opportunity given our lower market shares globally. Before turning the call over to Karleen, let me conclude by saying that the COVID-19 pandemic has really highlighted the importance of diagnostics within the healthcare system. In the future, we hope that this will lead to a strengthening of the public health infrastructure, more favorable reimbursement for diagnostic testing, and hopefully even more appreciation for the value of early detection, which is our core focus. At the same time, our response to the pandemic is also making Hologic a much more successful and influential player within the diagnostics industry, both domestically and overseas. This is based on the power of our technology and automation, and the ability of our people to quickly and effectively respond to public health needs. There is absolutely no doubt that our diagnostics division, and therefore our company as a whole, is becoming a stronger organization through this challenging time. Now, we'll turn the call over to Karleen. Thanks. It's team effort. Sure. And again, Patrick, as you well know, hard to put long range forecasting, but here's the way we think about it. And it was really around the decision we made in March to double our capacity by the fall which when people first looked at it, it was not. Now, here's the simple reality. We're going to be going into a cold and flu season. I think every single person that sneezes or coughs from September through the next season is going to end up getting tested for COVID. And it's not just U.S., it's globally. And even all the talk of the vaccines, let's say a vaccine comes, there's still so many unknowns. There's also the fundamental reality that it's going to take months to get everybody vaccinated. Even after that people are going to be still getting this thing. And particularly on a global basis, we're not going to vaccinate the world. And there's only so long we can shut the world down and have people stay at home and not traveling and everything else. So, I think we really see this. Again, can't exactly quantify the magnitude. But you know what, I mean, look at all the universities, right, everybody needs to get back to work. Testing is the key area to help get people comfortable. So, I think, we see this at least going well through the next season. And beyond that, this thing is so voracious that we really believe there's going to probably at a bare minimum be an ongoing trail of testing just for prevalence or something else and population screening for at least another year or two. I mean, I think even Pfizer announced as it relates to a vaccine, they see a vaccine market continuing for years. So, we really see there a lot more durability there. Having said that, if it's not, we got our base businesses as well. But, fundamentally, we think this thing is going to be far more persistent than I think where a lot of people necessarily thought at the beginning. Sure, Chris. The constraints themselves go really through the supply chain. A lot of it's even things that get used on Panther itself. So, our ability to produce the test kits and everything else is good, but they're -- you've seen some acknowledgment out there about pipette tip shortages and other things like that. Things that we don't control that we don't even supply to the vendors, they buy them directly. So, we're even working with manufacturers of some of the ancillary ingredients. And it's probably a little too early to sell. We think there's clearly a little bit of upside beyond the high end of our guidance, if we can crack these things. But, feel really good about the guidance we have. Sure. Chris, they will be a little bit lower. To your point, we said about 50 of those that we shipped were refurbished ones. So, they're all gone. We've literally taken every one out of our buildings that we didn't have. We'd also had a little bit of inventory coming into the quarter. So, we've shipped -- as you can imagine, we shipped every last one. As I joked every time, there was a White House press conference and various customers or whatever were down there promising more volume, they came back in the next day, it's 1-800 Hologic, what else can you do for us? So, we drained everything that we had in inventory. We're building now certainly at about a double the rate, but it will be a bit of a sequential decline. But we got -- we made so much progress this quarter that that already sets us up well. Sure. Tycho, as you well know, as a leader in this space, we're so close to the FDA, to our customers and trying to help come up with solutions. I think, as it relates to pooling, we are working closely with FDA and with our customers to look at some claims and think that we'll be certainly a player in that space. And it may help increase the overall capacity, particularly in an environment right now where there frankly a lot more people that would still like to be tested. We think that may help. More on a testing where it's less diagnostic and more screening, I think there's going to be a ton of that come the fall with universities and everybody else trying to get back. So, we think there will become a place for pooling and it's something we're very familiar with really going back to our blood screening days. So, as it relates to a combo again, you can imagine, given our presence in this space, we're looking at combo products for the fall as well. We continue to hear from customers government -- COVID is going to be the primary need. I hate to say it, but we think this year that frankly when somebody gets flu, they're going to be relieved versus COVID is still going to be a bigger concern. But, we'll be there in all fronts. Yes. I think, part of what we're not totally sure about yet, we've seen a significant strengthening, certainly June, Julyish of both our surgical and women's health businesses and diagnostics. We think a chunk of that was catch up, people that delayed and kind of got rescheduled. So we're not yet sure exactly what the trajectory will be, particularly as you have any additional hotspots and this and that. But, I think overall, we feel pretty good about the progress there. And really, our Breast Health business, the diversification that we have in that business, so much more disposable and recurring service revenue and everything else. That is probably still going to be the slower climb out. But, we're seeing some real positive signs in that business as well. But, having said that, we're obviously forecasting, as Karleen said, still to be down somewhat in the current quarter and continuing probably to strengthen here over time. I think a couple of things. We're very confident and that many of them are contractually there, both U.S. and internationally. Internationally, we really link it very clearly into -- hate to say it, but we're providing you COVID tests, and there's a clear linkage to as the COVID volume goes away, we will fill the Panthers with our women's health assays. So, there's a lot of new customers that are going to be coming on board. The other fundamental reality that we see everywhere, and it's why as you see Hologic, we haven't been showing up at the press conferences, but we're clearly showing up in the marketplace. Everybody loves Panther. And the more that people use Panther, the more they want to use it. And by definition, the lab techs are constantly out screaming -- we've got a number of governors call Kevin Thornal and say, you know what, I was just touring a couple of the labs in our state, all I keep hearing about is how great your Panther is. And so, that even experience there, I think we're seeing more and more people just getting experienced on it, and they love it. There's one that we had referenced, which is a company called LetsGetChecked, and they're doing a lot of direct to patient where they use our sample, they send it out, people send it back in and they're running it on our Panther. And while it certainly -- they were actually a nascent customer in with our base products, then as COVID came in, it's a real opportunity. We've known several people, just locally have even used them. So, I think, those are examples of one that we'll be breaking out. Thank you. Our Panthers were born to run. Yes. We do -- we've only committed to what we know we can make. So, that 500 million number that we referenced over the next four quarters internationally is included in our production plans. If we can expand beyond that, we know there continues to be more business, both domestically and abroad. What's great is this is where, frankly, having our manufacturing facility in Manchester, UK, also, because that's our diagnostics facility for Europe. Again, just not -- it's not just San Diego but it's them cranking full out now and we really got them up and running in late June on the COVID test. Yes. It's part of the magic, by the way, as you know, with the random access Panther. It's so easy to be able to run the women's health test, the COVID test simultaneously, not having to bash, not having to do all the other stuff that can slow stuff down. So, we really are seeing our key customers using it for both. And obviously, we are not going to short change our core business that we've built this Company on, which is women's health. So, all of the numbers we're providing are continuing to do well within our women's health business, plus adding on that additional COVID volume. But, I think we see the customers being able to use both and it's part of the -- again it's part of the big magic in our system, as you well know. Jack, great question. I would think you'll see us continuing or probably accelerating a little bit of our bolt-on strategy, probably with both, surgical as well as diagnostics, some things that we're looking and teeing up. And we think this is going to put us in a good position to acquire. Having said that, we also think there's -- there are clearly some lofty valuations that have been created within some of the space of diagnostics right now. So, we're also willing to be patient and certainly don't need to do anything, but I think it does give us more flexibility. And frankly, having Kevin Thornal out here running this business, as many of you know, Kevin work for several years in business development in his Stryker days, having him now running this diagnostics business and doing an amazing job of that. He also brings a deeper business development bolt-on mindset. And I can tell you, there's a lot more activity going on in the division with his leadership here. Certainly, starting on the 500 million, which is an international number, that's called Asia Pac as well as Europe, it's primarily Europe, but just let me set the record straight there. I think, a good way to think about that is fairly level loaded over the next four quarters is kind of the way that the contracts are laying out. As it relates to back to school, we're clearly -- we've been building and trying to ramp to get more and more production for this September-October period. So, I think that we're clearly seeing and expecting continued growth in this September timeframe. And that's what's baked into our guidance. Yes. Well, obviously, we've effectively given you a number in terms of, if you take that 500 million outside and divide it by 4 over the next four quarters, hopefully, it keeps you in the range of what the international component will be. Obviously, there'll still be more of it going to the U.S. as well. So, it's hard to exactly know where this market's going. But, I think when we were -- I remember being part of an AdvaMed call in -- geez, it was late April, early May, and they were saying that the country has the capacity to maybe do 400,000 tests a day maximum. We're now in that -- I love your report every day, 750,000 to 800,000 and we've hit 900,000 a day. I'd be surprised probably, if we're not at 1 million a day in that September timeframe. But again, we're -- obviously we've gone -- the way I think about it as we went 5 million in April, 10 million in May, 15 in June. July is going to be over 20 million. It probably puts us on that pace to a 30ish million number of tests in the United States in that September timeframe, and I think, being very persistent as it goes through the whole cold and flu season. Yes. I think, think about it, particularly for the first half of \u201821, while the vaccine is rolling out, there's still going to be a bunch of people getting sick. And in the United States, by the way, you got what 350ish million people. And the big part that I keep coming back to because of all of our discussions and as a global enterprise, I think there has been so much focus on COVID in the U.S. We're not going to eradicate -- we're not going to vaccinate 7 billion people in the world. And given how persistent this is, just Vietnam, if you heard today, right, Vietnam had gone I think 90 days without any cases, and suddenly three popped up in Vietnam. So, I think there is going to be -- this is going to be circulating around the world. And again, exactly what that means -- none of us have the crystal ball. The CDC doesn't have it, the WHO doesn't have it. God forbid, I certainly and our team don't have it. But, I think just trying to use some common sense, thinking about the real realities, by the way, I mean if I'm honest with you, who's going to likely get vaccinated first in the United States is probably going to be people who have a little more money, who are in the suburbs, and are we going to be getting the migrant worker population and a lot of the other folks that we really need to get where the persistence is bigger? Not sure we're going to get all of those people right away. So, I think there's going to be all kinds of reasons why this thing's still going to be out there. The other reality is, even though with the next five, six months before a vaccine comes, I think we're going to start to get better at realizing. And it'd be helpful if some of the public officials would say, what we have to do is realize we've got to live with this and learn how to cope and learn how to manage. And diagnostics is such a great tool to help people better understand where is it breaking out, what should we not do? And I think we're getting smarter and smarter, so that we don't go into complete lockdowns again and everything else. So, I think there is going to be all kinds of ways. If you're a university president right now, so many folks that need information that we're going to be helpful too to provide. That was good job, getting about 14 questions in there, Ivy. So, very impressive. Let me try to get as much of those answers as I can. First off, to clarify, the 40 million that we're building for production capacity is our total molecular volumes, of which clearly well more than half of that will be going pretty much towards our base business. So, I just want to make sure we didn't confuse and suggest that was a COVID production volume. In terms of market share, we're really not that focused on market share right now because I don't think any of us can provide. The real battle -- while we normally battle our competitors, the battle here is all of us battling this pandemic and battling coronavirus. So, I think there's going to be plenty of business for us going here. I think, as it relates to point-of-care, the point-of-care certainly has a role. But at the end of the day, super high volume, it's hard to test 1,000 people using point-of-care just from a manual -- the time that it takes. While it's quick to get one test back for one person, or you get four people tested, it's hard to do hundreds of people in a point-of-care world. And when you're as a country right now conducting the level of tests, 700,000, 800,000, 900,000 tests a day, you've got to have high throughput, high volume systems to do that. So, I think, we're in one of those unique situations where point-of-care is probably going to continue to grow and we're going to continue to grow. Yes. Rich, we're not going to get into how the last two weeks were relative to other two weeks and this and that. I think it's baked into our guidance. We see our surgical business being down roughly 20ish percent this quarter. That's a dramatic improvement from the down 50% plus last quarter. I think, we like seeing a comeback. And then, we have some really good days and then you have Texas or Florida goes into a slight little lockdown again or whatever, and you see a little bit of things back. So, we don't have perfect visibility to the trend going forward, but we feel really good about the trajectory. We do -- to the second part of your question on new visits versus backlog, we're trying to track that and we've got combinations of both a little more new. We don't have exact numbers. But clearly, MyoSure with its -- people have fibroid cases. That's going to be -- that's a lot of new and existing. And NovaSure, there was a little more catch-up initially. But, I think we're starting to see new patients coming back in as well."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to Hologic's Second Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Bryce and I'm your operator for today's call. Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions].  I would now like to introduce Mike Watts, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications to begin the call. Please go ahead.\nMichael Watts: Thank you, Bryce. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us for Hologic's Second Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer. Steve and Karleen both have some prepared remarks, then we'll have a question-and-answer session. Our second quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. Finally, a replay of this call will be archived through May 22.  Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in our safe harbor statement that's included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, a reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. One of these non-GAAP measures is organic revenue. As a reminder, we're defining organic revenue as constant currency revenue less the divested Blood Screening and Cynosure businesses as well as the acquired SuperSonic Imagine business. Finally, any percentage changes that we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be expressed in constant currency unless otherwise noted.  Now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO.\nStephen MacMillan: Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start by stating the obvious. This is an unprecedented time for the company, our shareholders and the entire world. Therefore, we're going to structure our remarks differently today. First, I'm going to discuss 3 strategic topics related to the COVID-19 pandemic, then hand it over to Karleen, who will cover our results and outlook.  Rather than keep you in suspense, here are my key points upfront. First, Hologic was performing exceptionally well until late March, continuing the strong momentum that has been building over the last few years. Second, as COVID-19 spread and threaten global economies, we moved quickly to mitigate the risk with a focus on cash so that our healthy fundamentals would be intact on the other side of the pandemic. And third, as one of the world's leading molecular diagnostics firms, this is a unique moment for us to live into our purpose by providing solutions for the most important issue facing the globe today.  So while we are scaling back in some areas in the short term, we are simultaneously boosting investments in our diagnostics business to respond to the world's needs, which will make us a much stronger company on the other side of this. Obviously, it's our employees who are making this possible, and we want to take a moment to thank them. I am so unbelievably proud of the engagement and commitment we've seen inside Hologic in the face of these challenging times. Countless employees from all our divisions have volunteered to help with our COVID efforts, offering everything from new business ideas that keep customers safe to their own hands and feet for the packaging line in our San Diego plant.  A special thanks goes out to our diagnostics team under the leadership of Kevin Thornal. In so many ways, the work of countless current and former employees over the years has positioned us to have a massive impact when the world needs us most. But I'd like to specifically highlight Marcos Borrell's project managers; Maurice Exner's development team; Matt Friedenberg's instrument group; Kathy Chester's regulatory team; Dave Tyler's manufacturing organization; and Keith Gantner's commercial team. Someday, you'll look back on this as one of the highlights of your professional careers, mainly because the world has never needed you more. We'll catch up on sleep when we reach the other side, which we will.  With that introduction, now let me turn to those 3 key points. First, we were performing exceptionally well until late March, continuing the strong momentum that's been building over the last few years. This is important because women's health needs are not going away due to COVID-19 and we'll still be a market leader on the other side of the pandemic. Our growth strategies will continue to pay off. We'll keep leveraging our strong U.S. commercial positions in breast health, diagnostics and surgical. We'll keep growing internationally across all our franchises. We'll keep investing in innovative research and development that drives new product growth, and we'll keep boosting our growth rate through tuck-in acquisitions.  As we said in our earnings release, organic revenue growth was 5.2% through the end of February and we were on pace for another beat-and-raise quarter. Three areas drove our growth in the second quarter. First, global molecular revenue increased 14.2%, the highest growth rate since 2012. This included only about $3.4 million of assay revenue related to our COVID test. Excluding this, the business still grew more than 12% as we continue to layer additional tests including now our COVID assays onto our Panther installed base. Make no mistake about it, our Molecular Diagnostics business is on a roll on a global basis.  Second, sales in our European region grew by a whopping 20.8% for the second quarter, excluding the divested Cynosure business. An outstanding performance by Jan Verstreken's team. Diagnostics led the way in the quarter, driven by cervical cancer co-testing in Germany and viral load testing in Africa. But Breast Health and Surgical also posted low double-digit growth.  Third, U.S. Surgical was incredibly strong for most of the quarter, up 14.7% in the first two months, building on recent acceleration and on pace to be an exceptional quarter. For the full quarter, U.S. Surgical still managed to grow 3.1% despite a significant decline in March.  Now let me turn to our second key point. As COVID-19 spread and threaten global economies in March, we moved quickly to mitigate the risk with a focus on cash. Our primary goal was to ensure that our healthy fundamentals would still be intact on the other side of the pandemic. I'd like to highlight several actions in this regard.  First, our efforts to strengthen our balance sheet over the last several years prepared us well to face the COVID crisis. For example, several years ago, we established a $1.5 billion revolving credit line, with a very attractive interest rate and covenants that are usually seen only with investment-grade companies. As the pandemic rapidly spread, we moved quickly to borrow $750 million from this line of credit, both to prepare for lower future cash flows and to pay off our $250 million accounts receivable securitization program. We wanted to act early and be at the front of the line with our bank partners. We also suspended our share buyback activities in March. Before then however, we completed our previously announced ASR and also repurchased 5.9 million shares for $267.6 million, which we believe will be an excellent investment over the long term.  Second, we moved quickly and decisively to reduce operating expenses through a combination of actions, hopefully temporary, that were specific to each division, function and geography across the company. Based on the needs of each business, we eliminated temporary employees and contractors, furloughed employees and temporarily shut down or shortened work weeks at several of our manufacturing plants. In other areas, we implemented broad pay reductions. We cut salaries for me and the Board by 50%, for our global leadership team by 25% and for other salaried employees by roughly 10%. At the same time, we made conscious decisions to preserve 401(k) matches and actually supplement the compensation of those salespeople who would normally receive 100% of their pay through commissions. Our goals were to keep our good people, reduce outright layoffs as much as possible and be in a position to emerge quickly on the other side of the pandemic.  In total, these and other actions should help us temporarily reduce operating expenses compared to the second quarter run rate by almost $40 million in the third quarter. Going forward, we intend to continue managing discretionary spending closely, while still taking care of our employees and funding future growth initiatives, such as boosting capital expenditures to ramp up our COVID manufacturing capacity.  Which brings us to our third major topic. As one of the world's leading molecular diagnostics firms, this is a special moment in time for us to live into our corporate purpose and become a much stronger company in the process. Building on the success we've had over the last several years, in placing Panther instruments around the world. We are in a unique position to help fight the coronavirus by providing the molecular testing that's needed to preserve human health as well as reopen our economies. And our efforts could provide a significant positive offset to pressures elsewhere in our business.  When the genetic sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was published in January, our scientists immediately jumped on it, just as they did when H1N1 influenza and the Zika virus emerged in the past. Our focus then was on speed. We wanted to get a test to market as soon as possible. With support from BARDA, we were able to secure emergency use authorization for our assay in about 2 months. We chose to develop a PCR-based test for a few reasons. First, it was faster as we leveraged the Open Access software that was previously written for the Fusion module. Second, we sell PCR-based test for influenza and other respiratory viruses that run on the Fusion side of our instrument. These viruses can cause symptoms that resemble COVID-19 disease so we wanted to give labs the capability to test a single patient sample for multiple targets. Third, there was a clear regulatory pathway for assays based on PCR, which is the backbone of most existing respiratory tests and the first couple of COVID assays.  Today, we have all come to understand that a real key to controlling this disease and getting people back to work is delivering fast, highly accurate test results on a truly unprecedented scale. Let me focus on that word results. Many investors have asked us why U.S. testing volumes are still limited, even as the diagnostics industry is producing more tests. One reason is that many of these tests are run on manual or semi-automated systems, putting a tremendous strain on lab technicians who are in short supply to begin with. Some of these systems require reagents from multiple vendors, which have been limited. In addition, while point-of-care tests have an important role to play against the pandemic, they can't be done in high volumes. In fact, high-volume testing has been concentrated in a relatively small number of labs, which can lead to longer turnaround times and backlogs.  For all these reasons, we quickly dedicated enormous resources to develop a second COVID test to run on the base Panther system, using our proprietary Aptima technologies, including transcription-mediated amplification, which is an alternative to PCR. Our lab customers already use these Aptima technologies to perform tens of millions of molecular tests a year for sexually transmitted infections, cervical cancer screening and virology. There are 2 major advantages to this approach, which is again, being supported by BARDA, this time with about $13 million.  First, because our supply chain has been scaled to produce massive numbers of Aptima tests for other infectious diseases, we can now redirect these manufacturing resources to produce large quantities of coronavirus assays. Specifically, we expect to provide our lab customers about 3 million Aptima tests next week -- yes, 3 million -- and are planning to produce at least 1 million tests a week starting in late May. Customers using our Aptima assays do not need to perform additional sample preparation steps or by other commercial reagents for nucleic acid extraction. This should help reduce competition for raw materials and further increase global testing capacity.  Finally, to help alleviate shortages of commonly used sample collection swabs and transport media, we have validated our Aptima multitest swab specimen collection kit, which is used today, mainly for STD testing for use with both the Aptima and Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assays.  Second, our Aptima tests run on the world's largest installed base of high throughput systems. More than 1,800 Panthers are in use globally compared to about 200 of the much newer Panther Fusion platform. You can do the simple math. This is almost a tenfold increase in our ability to leverage our industry-leading installed base of high throughput instruments. This means that more hospital, public health and reference lab customers can apply the power of full automation to coronavirus testing. This automation reduces hands-on time and the potential for manual error, and helps reduce the labor bottlenecks that have emerged given the unprecedented volume of COVID tests needed. So our lab customers will be able to deliver more results when and where they are needed.  Adding a COVID assay to the Panther menu provides a unique opportunity to turbocharge the strategy we have been pursuing in molecular diagnostics for years. COVID testing will help us place more Panthers, both in the United States and overseas, and also drive higher assay utilization on the systems that are already in the field, and it will accelerate the positive change in diagnostics that we've previously discussed, as we move from being the leader in STDs to a much stronger position as a broad-based molecular diagnostics leader with strong customer partnerships.  Before I turn it over to Karleen, let me conclude by saying that in these unprecedented times, our purpose, passion and promise remains steadfast. Our purpose is to help enable healthier lives everywhere, every day. Never has that been more relevant than today as we battle a global pandemic. Our passion is to become global champions for women's health. Obviously, women are affected by COVID-19, but when the pandemic is under control, demand for our market-leading products and services will come back. Early detection of diseases like breast and cervical cancer will always be important. And our promise is rooted in what we call The Science of Sure, providing highly accurate, differentiated products, which has never been more important than when combating a public health crisis.  As difficult as the current environment is, I have never been more energized about our chance to play a major role in the toughest issue facing the world today while knowing that our efforts today are also strengthening us for the future.  Now let me turn the call over to Karleen.\nKarleen Oberton: Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'm going to provide an overview of our divisional sales results, walk through the rest of our income statement, briefly touch on our overall financial condition and discuss some expectations for the future. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results, and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis and constant currency.  Let me start by summarizing our second quarter results. Revenue of $756.1 million declined 7.1% due to the divestiture of Cynosure. Organically, we grew 1.1% despite the impact of COVID-19 pandemic late in the quarter. EPS of $0.57 was below our expectations, commensurate with the decrease in revenue but basically flat compared to a year ago.  Now I will provide some more detail on our divisional revenue results. Diagnostics became our largest division in the second quarter by growing a strong 8.3%, despite a substantial decrease in demand in late March. Cytology had a good quarter internationally, driven by Germany's decision to adopt co-testing for cervical cancer screening. But the primary growth driver was Molecular, as it has been for many quarters. International sales were exceptionally strong, based in part on the continued uptake of viral load assays in Africa. The U.S. business performed very well, even when you exclude sales of our COVID assay on Panther Fusion, which were only $3.4 million in the quarter.  In Breast Health, underlying trends were solid, and the division performed well through most of the quarter. However, gantries, accessories and 3D upgrade volumes were substantially impacted as a result of COVID-19 disruptions late in March, as our customers focus on responding to the pandemic and our field service engineers weren't allowed to install new products. Given these factors, global Breast Health sales of $307.8 million decreased 3.7%, excluding $5.8 million of sales from SuperSonic Imagine, global sales decreased 5.5%.  In Surgical, Steve already pointed out that the team was crushing at through most of March, especially in the United States. However, like most companies, we saw a significant impact to demand in late March as elective procedures were postponed. Despite this, the business still grew 3.6% for the full quarter based on the excellent momentum we had in January and February.  Overall, in terms of geography, domestic sales of $574.9 million were down 1% on an organic basis and down 6.6% on a reported basis due to the Cynosure divestiture. Outside the United States, reported sales of $181.2 million decreased 8.6% but revenue increased 8.4% organically, reflecting the strong foundations we have built for sustainable growth. As Steve noted, this growth was primarily driven by our European and Canadian franchises. Not surprisingly, sales in Asia Pacific were negatively affected by COVID, especially in China.  Moving on to our P&L for the second quarter. Gross margin of 61% was actually flat compared to the prior year period, as benefits from the Cynosure divestiture were offset by lower sales due to the COVID-19 pandemic, unfavorable product sales mix, and to a lesser extent, the strong U.S. dollar. Total operating expenses of $222.5 million decreased 18.4% in the second quarter, which was primarily driven by the divestiture of Cynosure. In addition, the decline in equity markets reduced expenses associated with our deferred compensation plan as the liability is marked to market. Finally, as Steve said, we did begin to reduce discretionary costs in late March as the negative effects of COVID-19 became more clear. As a result, operating margin of 31.5% increased 380 basis points. Overall, our profitability remains very healthy.  Net margin of 20% increased 100 basis points compared to the prior year period, with the benefits I just discussed, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. This resulted from an unfavorable divisional and geographic mix of income, primarily as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. All this led to non-GAAP net income of $150.9 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.57, commensurate with our lower-than-expected revenue. Finally, ROIC was 12.5% on a trailing 12-month basis, an increase of 20 basis points over the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was $248.3 million, which decreased 2.3% compared to the prior year.  Moving on, I'd like to briefly discuss our overall financial condition as we navigate through these uncertain times. The COVID-19 pandemic is a vivid reminder of how and how fast unforeseen events can change our economic environment. But even in this context, Hologic's financial position is strong because we have put a heavy emphasis on debt reduction and cash flow generation over the last several years. Maintaining a conservative liquidity posture is even more important during these challenging times as we focus on taking care of our employees, ensuring our products remain available to our customers and patients, and investing in critical COVID-19 diagnostics testing.  At the end of the second quarter, our leverage ratio stood at 2.6x and we had approximately $800 million of cash and equivalents. The actions we have taken to reduce expenses, which Steve discussed, have put us in a strong position to weather a wide range of potential outcomes that may emerge over the coming months related to COVID-19.  Before we open the call for questions, I would like to discuss our expectations for the second half of fiscal 2020. As a reminder, we withdrew our formal financial guidance when we preannounced quarterly revenue earlier this month. To state the obvious, the market environment is very fluid and unpredictable today. Our future results will be highly dependent on what the virus does and how successful global containment efforts are. But I want to clearly emphasize that we believe we are well prepared for either extreme scenario, a strong recovery or a prolonged downturn.  That said, to give you a sense of the magnitude of the effect that COVID-19 has had on our business, we expect organic sales in our fiscal April to be down 45% to 50% from the prior year period, excluding sales of our COVID test on Panther Fusion, which we'll come back to in a second. We are planning for our base business to be down by a similar percentage for the full quarter. Again, excluding our own COVID assay sales since April sales probably benefited a little from our strength through most of March. By planning for a significant downturn and being ready for it, we believe we prepare appropriately for an uncertain time.  By division, we believe that Surgical will be the hardest hit by COVID in the short term. In April, for example, global Surgical sales are expected to be down about 85% compared to the prior year period. We believe this business will begin to improve soon based on both the clinical need and the desire of our hospital customers to shore up their finances by addressing pent-up demand.  In Breast and Skeletal Health, April sales will be down more than 30% compared to the prior year period. Recurring revenues such as service should compensate somewhat for a steeper decline in capital sales, reflecting the diversification strategy that we have been pursuing for several years. We have recently seen access restrictions loosening somewhat, so we are optimistic that conditions will improve gradually going forward. The pace of this recovery, however, is uncertain as it's hard to predict how long a general economic downturn will affect capital investments by customers. While recovery could take a while, it's worth emphasizing that our Breast business has become far less capital dependent in recent years as we increase service and other recurring revenue across the full continuum of breast health care.  In Diagnostics, sales of our core women's health tests have fallen significantly as routine screening has been put on hold. April sales, as a result, are expected to be down about 45%, excluding sales of our Panther Fusion COVID assay. It's worth noting that the strength we've seen internationally in the areas like viral load testing should slightly offset the negative impact of COVID on our women's health assays.  Our own COVID test, especially the new TMA assay on Panther, could represent a significant positive offset to the pressures we are experiencing in our other parts of our business. We know that in the near term, demand for our COVID assays is very high as testing is essential to get people back to work and reopen economies. And as we said in our press release, the combination of our large TMA manufacturing capacity with our Panther installed base can help labs deliver test results when and where they are needed. We could generate $150 million or more of COVID sales in our third fiscal quarter.  In the future, we believe that significant levels of testing will continue to be needed worldwide. But it's impossible to predict the exact quantity and duration at this stage. So from a revenue perspective going forward, we will continue to watch the interplay between recovery in our base businesses in COVID test volumes. We are hopeful that most of our businesses will get back to normal in the first half of our fiscal 2021. But if not, we believe we have significant offsets in terms of our own testing volumes. But if our base franchises gradually improve over the next several quarters and COVID revenues remain high, there's at least the potential that our results could be exceptionally strong. We are making plans to significantly increase our manufacturing capacity to prepare for this possibility.  Before we open the call for questions, let me conclude by saying that even in these uncertain times, the fundamentals of our business are strong as is our financial condition. Although COVID-19 will continue to negatively affect most of our business, our efforts to develop and manufacture molecular diagnostics test to fight the pandemic could represent a significant offset that will help us emerge a stronger company in the long run.  With that, I will ask the operator to open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, we are ready for the first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll now take our first question from Tycho Peterson at JP Morgan.\nTycho Peterson: Steve, congrats on getting the new COVID test out. You highlighted the large installed base. I'm just curious about how you think about COVID driving incremental Panther placements, particularly on the hospital side, given the push toward more on-site testing? And then for the follow-up, I assume serology is not a focus given the divestiture of the Blood Screening business, but I'm curious if that's something you would consider?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. Thanks, Tycho. And by the way, Tony and the rest of the guys at the warehouse are busting their butts right now. So -- and part of it is on Panthers. We have, as you can imagine, getting a significant increase in interest in Panthers around the world. And I think everybody is realizing just what an incredible platform it is. So as a reminder, folks, we've been placing about 200 to 250 Panthers a year. Generally in that, call it, 20-ish a month. We are also scaling capacity right now for Panthers, they're much longer lead times but we're having significant additional requests, particularly as well, frankly, from departments of health, some of the additional labs from hospitals, but it's across the board and including even the largest reference labs. So it's almost across the board, people wanting to get even more access to capacity.  On the serology piece, to your second part, yes, don't expect us to really do anything there. We're not sure we bring anything to the party in that game. We're just putting all of our resources in the molecular world that we know so well.\nOperator: We'll now take our next question from Patrick Donnelly at Citi.\nPatrick Donnelly: Steve, maybe a follow-up there, talking about the significant increase in interest in Panthers. I guess there's a bit of a debate out there. Does this pandemic fundamentally change kind of the diagnostics market on the other side of this, you might see a broad increase in testing? I guess what's your guys view on the diagnostics side that you feel like you're getting out in front of customers you didn't have the opportunity to before and you could get integrated with some new systems and all of a sudden, on the other side of this, Hologic was great during COVID. Now why don't we use them for a bunch of other testing? What's your view for the Diagnostics business as we get to the other side of this one?\nStephen MacMillan: I'll try to answer this real simply because it's an incredibly insightful question, Patrick. We've never had more calls from people wanting our products. And I mean this on a very global basis, right to various regions within European countries, particularly, frankly, all across Europe but also wildly in the U.S. We've literally been in touch with virtually every governor's office. It seems like half of Congress, obviously, with the White House Task Force on a daily basis, the Department of Defense, it's been mind blowing in terms of the interest, really just since we launched the PCR assay. And Kevin Thornal, our commercial teams and our European teams, even the Asia Pac teams, right down to the Prime Minister in New Zealand, I mean we've got everybody reaching out to us and it is elevating our profile to a very different level than anything we've ever experienced. And there is zero doubt in my mind that's absolutely creating a tremendous runway for us coming out of this.\nPatrick Donnelly: Okay. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on the Breast Health side. I know you talked about, obviously, volumes are very hard to predict there and the recurring revenue is a bigger piece of the business for you guys now. I guess how quickly do you think this could come back again on the other side of COVID? I mean do you expect women to be a bit reluctant to come back into the doctor's office? Or do you think things could ramp pretty quickly?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. I think it's still an evolving piece, Patrick. I think -- frankly, our orders were positive in the quarter. We had a tremendous Breast Health orders quarter. I do worry and having lived through the '08-'09 downturn, where I know a lot of the hospitals and the radiology suites, they want new capital. I'm sure in a month or 2, as things start to settle back down, you know hospital CFOs are going to go back through their CapEx with a fine tooth comb and do some of those get pushed out.  I think if we're a betting person, I think Breast Health will probably be a little slower to come back because of that. Now the positive for us is, remember, we don't really get paid on a -- even as the patients take a little time to get back in, we've got the capital sales and then the recurring revenue in a lot of cases, really from service and those kinds of things. So it probably won't go down quite as deeply but it will probably be a longer road back.\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. I would just add to kind of remind folks that the U.S. gantries, the U.S. capital is only about 21% of the total divisional revenue at this point in time.\nOperator: We'll now take our next question from Brian Weinstein at William Blair.\nBrian Weinstein: Congrats on the progress that you guys made with this new assay. Should we be thinking about an ASP similar to what you saw in Fusion on a worldwide basis here? And then I think Karleen was kind of talking about this a little bit, the ability to manufacture. Should we be thinking about this level of manufacturing even when core Aptima kind of comes back? Or will there need to be some sort of a trade off there?\nStephen MacMillan: Great question, Brian. And I think as we look forward, certainly, some of this will be volume dependent, but we've been building our capacity to be able to serve, even as the core business comes back to also be able to meet these demands. So it's -- we're looking at our total capacity to be able to deliver on this.\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. And I would just say, we have, as Steve made meaningful investments in capital to do that, so that we don't have to make those trade offs.\nBrian Weinstein: And then on that ASP, around 25%, is that how we should be thinking about it?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. I'd probably go just a little below that, probably when you think about a global weighted ASP.\nBrian Weinstein: Okay. And then a final question here. I know you mentioned not being involved in serology and that makes sense. But is there an opportunity here for you to participate in viral load? We're seeing much more literature about viral load being used to determine kind of where somebody is in the course of the COVID-19 infection or maybe using viral load to trying to determine how severe that infection might be. Is the team working on anything there? Is that an opportunity for you guys, given your presence there?\nStephen MacMillan: It's not a focus at this point. We've been so locked and loaded on trying to realize this major testing opportunity, which we think is going to be the single biggest need to really get people back to work and everything else. But like everything else, as we get this out the door and as the science continues to evolve, our team will be looking at the areas that do make some sense for us. And that one clearly would be closer in, but nothing under progress at this point or nothing under development at this point, to be honest.\nOperator: We'll now take our next question from Doug Schenkel at Cowen.\nDoug Schenkel: Steve, and I'll echo what others have said, thanks to you and the team for moving so quickly with more solutions in the midst of the pandemic. The first thing I want to touch on is -- and this has kind of been alluded to in some of the other questions, there are clinical labs that we've talked to and we've read about that have talked about molecular systems, being hard to get and oftentimes being on back order. We know you've been placing around 200 Panthers per year and that's separate from the pandemic. I guess the question is, what is capacity for Panthers? And for that matter, Fusions to add on to existing Panthers? And then I guess that's really the first part.  I guess another question is, is it possible -- I just don't remember, is it possible to run Panther and Fusion assays simultaneously? So why don't I pause there on those questions?\nStephen MacMillan: Sure. On the second part, yes, you can run Panther and Fusion simultaneously. In terms of supply, I think part of the reason, frankly, that Dr. Birx and the government are so excited that we're a little bit of the cavalry coming to the rescue here is we already have the systems everywhere. We're the only folks that have high throughput systems in all 50 states. So while there were a lot of tests that were approved and suddenly people are scrambling for equipment, I think we feel pretty good that we've already got this massive installed base that's been building over the last 6, 7 years as opposed to this mass scramble now. Can we supplement it? Are we getting additional requests? Yes. But fundamentally, we can ship 3 million tests next week. And the capacity is already there to be able to produce -- to be able to run those.\nDoug Schenkel: Yes. Yes. No, that's a great point. Okay. And then I know there's been some other questions about adjacencies that you might be able to move into to do more than you're already doing, which again, is great. But I guess one thing I'm wondering is as we think about reopening in the U.S. and broadly, there's a lot of talk about the need to not just run a lot more tests but potentially to move closer to point of care, especially when it comes to things like using molecular test as part of getting folks back to work for some employers. Is there any opportunity for you guys to do something there? I mean I know it would be herculean to move quickly on like a smaller Aptima-based system for use in smaller labs. But I'm just wondering, is there anything that was maybe already going there that could be expedited to allow you to play a bigger role in that need?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes, Doug, I think, again, the best thing we have going for us is already the installed base that we have out there. It's hard to underscore the people over 1,000 of these systems in the United States. So let's just take an example, Northwell hospital or the more than 400 of these that are already in the hospitals. One of the key areas to keeping our health care workers safe is making sure that they're all tested on a regular basis. So picture this. Most of the hospitals that already have these employees at the end of the day could all be tested. The test can be run overnight and in the morning, they know if somebody shouldn't show up for work. The same can be true in so many decentralized areas, even companies around, not necessarily via us, but there's going to be labs all over the place, very close that we'll be able to run these things.  So it's back to -- it's not point -- let's be very clear, we are not point of care, but we are able to run a whole bunch of tests in a very local geography. So to a large degree, again, if somebody wants to do a drive-through, pop-up thing, there's generally a Panther not too far away that they should be able to access through either a hospital lab, one of the reference labs or even the departments of health within their states. So again, we -- do we wish we had even more? Yes, but it's already an incredible installed base that again, nobody else has had. When you look at the marketplace, you got point-of-care on one end and you've got the massive systems in a centralized reference lab at the other end, which you have not had is the ability to have high throughput testing close to the patient to be able to deliver those results where and when they're needed, not a week later.\nOperator: We'll now take our next question from Ivy Ma at Bank of America.\nIvy M&A: Congrats on the new test. So first question is we've seen estimates from anywhere just on the broad testing market, the need for like anywhere 50,000 -- 500,000 molecular test a day and up to 1 million a day just throwing around in the news these days. So just wanted to get your thoughts on what sort of capacity expectations or need expectations you are eventually planning for since there are plans to get to -- to make investment to increase that by the fall. So first part of this question is just on what you think the ultimate testing need will be and how long the duration of that is. And this goes into a question about where you think your ultimate market share would be.\nStephen MacMillan: Sure, Ivy. I'll start backwards. In terms of market share, we're not really focused on that the way we typically are because I think we're all rooting -- it's a unique time in the world where I think we're less about competing against each other and more all trying to race to create enough capacity to help not just this country but help the world get back to work, which kind of gets back to the first part of your question. There are so many unknowns. Come the fall, are we running 500,000 tests a day. Are we running 200,000 tests a day, we're running 3 million tests a day in the U.S. It's just so hard to know at this point in time. We are planning to continue to invest in capacity. Candidly, one of the biggest rate-limiting steps for us is our very unique cap system, which is what makes our system so highly automated.  We're building more cap machines. These things typically take 18 months to build. We've got people working around the clock to try to build them and call it a 6-month time frame. So we want to be prepared to bring on even more capacity later in the fall, ahead of the next flu season in the Northern Hemisphere because we do believe the way we look at it is, next year, when anybody -- there's any outbreak of flu or anything as soon as somebody coughs we're going to be wanting to be testing them just for regular flu as well as for COVID. So we want to have even more capacity online by the fall. But I don't really want to get into giving specific numbers.\nIvy Ma: Great. Appreciate sharing the color. I know there's a lot of unknowns around this. So just a follow-up on serology. There's clearly a lot of serology testing capacity in the U.S., maybe more than that is in molecular. So I'm just curious how you see the market demand evolving going forward in terms of the split between molecular and serologic testing, especially when we're thinking more about getting people back to work?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. At the end of the day, we view there's going to be a massive need for diagnostic testing because at the end of -- even in a serology world, first off, there's so many unknowns with serology, as you well know, just because you may have some antibodies and it may appear -- are you really immune to others? There's just a lot of uncertainties to it and it's still going to be only a percentage of the population.  At the end of the day, what is going to be critically important to getting people confident to go back into the workplace, to get to back to where we can have everybody back in school, have people traveling on airplanes again, has got to be a robust testing real-time capability. And that plays to our strength. That's where our focus is. And again, how big the serology market becomes on that end, we don't know but we frankly think there's enough for us to play in, in the area that we know a lot about.\nOperator: We'll now be taking our next question from Raj Denhoy at Jefferies.\nAnthony Petrone: This is Anthony for Raj, and I'll second and third the congratulations here. It's unbelievable work you guys have done. Maybe Scott -- Steve, just a question on something you mentioned in your prepared remarks, just in terms of the availability of viral transport medium swabs as you scale on Panther, the SARS-CoV-2 test on Panther as opposed to Fusion, how much of a limitation is that? Is there an opportunity for Hologic to actually bundle there? And then the second quick follow-up would be just any thoughts on the Boston Scientific announcement today on the sale of their intrauterine portfolio to Minerva? What are the implications for NovaSure?\nStephen MacMillan: Anthony, say hi to Raj for us, too. As it relates to the swab, the magic that we referenced, obviously, is we're -- we've qualified our Aptima swab to be used along with us. So the great part about it is we basically have some degree, it's a closed system, we can ship the swab and the vials together, boom, they test, use our swab and they're ready to go. So we're providing the customer with effectively a complete package. And I think that's going to dramatically streamline. I think it's hard for people that aren't close to these to fully understand the incredible workflow efficiencies that come from using the Aptima system all the way through. So that should be a huge advantage for us.  On the Boston news with Minerva, I think we continue to feel really good about what our Surgical business is doing. As we mentioned, it was up 14.7% through the first 2 months of the last quarter. Our Surgical business has just really had an incredible turnaround and strength over the last couple of years. Clearly, Boston was not -- they're an incredibly successful company and having a challenge in that space with those products, I think our team is quite happy to see whoever is out there and continue to fight. So we think we've got better products and a better sales team.\nOperator: We'll now take our next question from David Lewis at Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Lewis: Two testing questions for me, one for Karleen and one for Steve. So clearly, I just wanted to net out some math here for the third quarter. So if I just assume capacity for a second here, we have roughly $45 million of Fusion sales, maybe $75 million in that bolus Panther order. You get to 1 million test per week at the end of May, so it's kind of 1 million tests a week in June, that's another, obviously, kind of $100 million. And then if I just adjust that ASP below 25% and assume kind of a 20%, 30% cannibalization rate on the core platform, does that kind of get me close to $150 million? Anything materially off in that math?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. I would say that the 1 million per week is an average. So with lot -- this product is built in lot, so we may not actually ship 1 million each week. But yes, that probably gets you pretty close.\nDavid Lewis: Okay. And then, Steve, I think getting Panther out there can be underestimated from sort of public health perspective. I want you to just sort of share your thoughts. There's been significant barriers to testing, reagents, nasal swabs and then general protocols and infrastructure, I would sort of call it, and yet 5 days ago, we have 300,000 tests a day and then yesterday, we had 200,000 tests. So reagents are coming on but the test numbers haven't gone in the right direction. As you think about the infrastructure and these barriers that have been addressed, just wondering if you could share your thoughts with us about do you think all the barriers have been addressed out there? And what are some of the outstanding barriers that are sort of creating this disconnect between capacity and then usable test? And great work on this.\nStephen MacMillan: Sure, David. And I think the way to think about the barriers that you're getting to is, I think one of the biggest barriers, let's face it, just in normal day-to-day activities has been people who feel like they should be tested to actually getting tests. And so I think they've -- all of the states, all the hospitals, all the doctors have been fairly restrictive in allowing people to get tested. You've had to fight through hoops and everything just to get a test because the supply was so constrained. So I think one of the magical things that may start to happen right now is as people start to get more comfortable that there's -- the supply is really starting to ramp up, I think we will start to see a little bit more of the loosening of the gauntlet that a patient has to run through to get tested.  And I think as we start to open that up, to me, the magic of that will be, we'll start to get truly more tests out there. The ability of the people on the front line just to administer the swabs, so I think, again, in our case, we're going to have the swabs. You don't need separate transport media when it gets to the lab, you don't need somebody to extract it from the transport media, put it into another vial. So there's an incredible -- and I think you understand as well, there's an incredible efficiency on that side. So I think it's like everything, even in another week, things will start to go out. You know what we know that Dr. Birx and her team are in touch with all the public health labs, letting people know where we're coming. There's incredible excitement there. I think those things will, I think, help to finally unlock. It's not going to be the unlock, but I think the progress there will really start to see coming in a big way.\nMichael Watts: Operator, I think we have time for maybe two more questions, if we can be quick.\nOperator: Yes. And we'll now be taking our next question from Dan Leonard at Wells Fargo.\nDaniel Leonard: So I'll just ask one. Steve, you've talked a lot about the Aptima test for COVID. As we think about 12 months down the road, your Fusion is about 10% of your Panther total installed base. Does that ratio meaningfully change, post this pandemic? Do you see yourself having a much higher proportion of Fusions? Or is all the excitement around just the traditional Panther, not to minimize it, but just I'm curious your thoughts on that equation.\nStephen MacMillan: Sure, Dan. I think it will ramp up over time. If anything, it will probably take a short-term pause because we're going to be running the machines probably at a fairly hefty pace. Nobody's going to even want to shut one down to accommodate adding a Fusion onto the side. And now with the TMA assay out there, they frankly can manage without it for a while. So I think we'll continue to build it over time. Mike, did you want to add something?\nMichael Watts: Yes. Dan, the only thing I would say is once we get into the fall and the winter with the flu season and you get kind of intermingled virus in order to be able to test for both, you do need a Fusion. So we think that will be helpful in the medium term as well.\nStephen MacMillan: Yes.\nMichael Watts: We have time for one more question, operator.\nOperator: All right. We'll now be taking our last question from Dan Brennan at UBS.\nDaniel Brennan: I guess I'll ask a question on Breast Health then. So the numbers that you gave for April and for the quarter, maybe could you parse out a little bit between, Steve, in terms of the U.S. gantry being 20%, but how do we think about the math on that in terms of what gantries are doing, kind of service and then interventional? And then as we look out, is there any predicate for '08 and '09 that you suggested about how we might look further out beyond the next quarter or 2 and how hospital CFOs might react?\nStephen MacMillan: Sure. We're kind of describing this internally as everybody talks about Vs, Ws, Ls, use whatever in terms of recovery. We're describing it as kind of a checkmark, a sharp down and then certainly coming back, I think nicely, it will be probably a little jagged there on the way back up. But I think what we see and we feel really good about the Breast Health business overall that it has become so much more diversified. But the capital will probably be lagging a little bit as it comes back.  And then the flip side is, in the grand scheme, our capital purchases are also not a huge amount for any given hospital system. So we're not totally sure, but we feel really good that we're going to be able to work with our customers to have it coming back online. But I would -- I think we'll be back by a year from now but I wouldn't expect to be back in the next couple of quarters. Karleen?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. And I would just add, the biggest component of revenue for that business is the service business. So this stability within foundationally for that division was that recurring revenue.\nMichael Watts: Great. Thank you, everybody.\nOperator: Thank you. And that is all the time we have for questions today. This now concludes Hologic's Second Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Have a good evening.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Karleen Oberton",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'm going to provide an overview of our divisional sales results, walk through the rest of our income statement, briefly touch on our overall financial condition and discuss some expectations for the future. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results, and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis and constant currency.  Let me start by summarizing our second quarter results. Revenue of $756.1 million declined 7.1% due to the divestiture of Cynosure. Organically, we grew 1.1% despite the impact of COVID-19 pandemic late in the quarter. EPS of $0.57 was below our expectations, commensurate with the decrease in revenue but basically flat compared to a year ago.  Now I will provide some more detail on our divisional revenue results. Diagnostics became our largest division in the second quarter by growing a strong 8.3%, despite a substantial decrease in demand in late March. Cytology had a good quarter internationally, driven by Germany's decision to adopt co-testing for cervical cancer screening. But the primary growth driver was Molecular, as it has been for many quarters. International sales were exceptionally strong, based in part on the continued uptake of viral load assays in Africa. The U.S. business performed very well, even when you exclude sales of our COVID assay on Panther Fusion, which were only $3.4 million in the quarter.  In Breast Health, underlying trends were solid, and the division performed well through most of the quarter. However, gantries, accessories and 3D upgrade volumes were substantially impacted as a result of COVID-19 disruptions late in March, as our customers focus on responding to the pandemic and our field service engineers weren't allowed to install new products. Given these factors, global Breast Health sales of $307.8 million decreased 3.7%, excluding $5.8 million of sales from SuperSonic Imagine, global sales decreased 5.5%.  In Surgical, Steve already pointed out that the team was crushing at through most of March, especially in the United States. However, like most companies, we saw a significant impact to demand in late March as elective procedures were postponed. Despite this, the business still grew 3.6% for the full quarter based on the excellent momentum we had in January and February.  Overall, in terms of geography, domestic sales of $574.9 million were down 1% on an organic basis and down 6.6% on a reported basis due to the Cynosure divestiture. Outside the United States, reported sales of $181.2 million decreased 8.6% but revenue increased 8.4% organically, reflecting the strong foundations we have built for sustainable growth. As Steve noted, this growth was primarily driven by our European and Canadian franchises. Not surprisingly, sales in Asia Pacific were negatively affected by COVID, especially in China.  Moving on to our P&L for the second quarter. Gross margin of 61% was actually flat compared to the prior year period, as benefits from the Cynosure divestiture were offset by lower sales due to the COVID-19 pandemic, unfavorable product sales mix, and to a lesser extent, the strong U.S. dollar. Total operating expenses of $222.5 million decreased 18.4% in the second quarter, which was primarily driven by the divestiture of Cynosure. In addition, the decline in equity markets reduced expenses associated with our deferred compensation plan as the liability is marked to market. Finally, as Steve said, we did begin to reduce discretionary costs in late March as the negative effects of COVID-19 became more clear. As a result, operating margin of 31.5% increased 380 basis points. Overall, our profitability remains very healthy.  Net margin of 20% increased 100 basis points compared to the prior year period, with the benefits I just discussed, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. This resulted from an unfavorable divisional and geographic mix of income, primarily as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. All this led to non-GAAP net income of $150.9 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.57, commensurate with our lower-than-expected revenue. Finally, ROIC was 12.5% on a trailing 12-month basis, an increase of 20 basis points over the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was $248.3 million, which decreased 2.3% compared to the prior year.  Moving on, I'd like to briefly discuss our overall financial condition as we navigate through these uncertain times. The COVID-19 pandemic is a vivid reminder of how and how fast unforeseen events can change our economic environment. But even in this context, Hologic's financial position is strong because we have put a heavy emphasis on debt reduction and cash flow generation over the last several years. Maintaining a conservative liquidity posture is even more important during these challenging times as we focus on taking care of our employees, ensuring our products remain available to our customers and patients, and investing in critical COVID-19 diagnostics testing.  At the end of the second quarter, our leverage ratio stood at 2.6x and we had approximately $800 million of cash and equivalents. The actions we have taken to reduce expenses, which Steve discussed, have put us in a strong position to weather a wide range of potential outcomes that may emerge over the coming months related to COVID-19.  Before we open the call for questions, I would like to discuss our expectations for the second half of fiscal 2020. As a reminder, we withdrew our formal financial guidance when we preannounced quarterly revenue earlier this month. To state the obvious, the market environment is very fluid and unpredictable today. Our future results will be highly dependent on what the virus does and how successful global containment efforts are. But I want to clearly emphasize that we believe we are well prepared for either extreme scenario, a strong recovery or a prolonged downturn.  That said, to give you a sense of the magnitude of the effect that COVID-19 has had on our business, we expect organic sales in our fiscal April to be down 45% to 50% from the prior year period, excluding sales of our COVID test on Panther Fusion, which we'll come back to in a second. We are planning for our base business to be down by a similar percentage for the full quarter. Again, excluding our own COVID assay sales since April sales probably benefited a little from our strength through most of March. By planning for a significant downturn and being ready for it, we believe we prepare appropriately for an uncertain time.  By division, we believe that Surgical will be the hardest hit by COVID in the short term. In April, for example, global Surgical sales are expected to be down about 85% compared to the prior year period. We believe this business will begin to improve soon based on both the clinical need and the desire of our hospital customers to shore up their finances by addressing pent-up demand.  In Breast and Skeletal Health, April sales will be down more than 30% compared to the prior year period. Recurring revenues such as service should compensate somewhat for a steeper decline in capital sales, reflecting the diversification strategy that we have been pursuing for several years. We have recently seen access restrictions loosening somewhat, so we are optimistic that conditions will improve gradually going forward. The pace of this recovery, however, is uncertain as it's hard to predict how long a general economic downturn will affect capital investments by customers. While recovery could take a while, it's worth emphasizing that our Breast business has become far less capital dependent in recent years as we increase service and other recurring revenue across the full continuum of breast health care.  In Diagnostics, sales of our core women's health tests have fallen significantly as routine screening has been put on hold. April sales, as a result, are expected to be down about 45%, excluding sales of our Panther Fusion COVID assay. It's worth noting that the strength we've seen internationally in the areas like viral load testing should slightly offset the negative impact of COVID on our women's health assays.  Our own COVID test, especially the new TMA assay on Panther, could represent a significant positive offset to the pressures we are experiencing in our other parts of our business. We know that in the near term, demand for our COVID assays is very high as testing is essential to get people back to work and reopen economies. And as we said in our press release, the combination of our large TMA manufacturing capacity with our Panther installed base can help labs deliver test results when and where they are needed. We could generate $150 million or more of COVID sales in our third fiscal quarter.  In the future, we believe that significant levels of testing will continue to be needed worldwide. But it's impossible to predict the exact quantity and duration at this stage. So from a revenue perspective going forward, we will continue to watch the interplay between recovery in our base businesses in COVID test volumes. We are hopeful that most of our businesses will get back to normal in the first half of our fiscal 2021. But if not, we believe we have significant offsets in terms of our own testing volumes. But if our base franchises gradually improve over the next several quarters and COVID revenues remain high, there's at least the potential that our results could be exceptionally strong. We are making plans to significantly increase our manufacturing capacity to prepare for this possibility.  Before we open the call for questions, let me conclude by saying that even in these uncertain times, the fundamentals of our business are strong as is our financial condition. Although COVID-19 will continue to negatively affect most of our business, our efforts to develop and manufacture molecular diagnostics test to fight the pandemic could represent a significant offset that will help us emerge a stronger company in the long run.  With that, I will ask the operator to open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, we are ready for the first question. Yes. I would just add to kind of remind folks that the U.S. gantries, the U.S. capital is only about 21% of the total divisional revenue at this point in time. Yes. And I would just say, we have, as Steve made meaningful investments in capital to do that, so that we don't have to make those trade offs. Yes. I would say that the 1 million per week is an average. So with lot -- this product is built in lot, so we may not actually ship 1 million each week. But yes, that probably gets you pretty close. Yes. And I would just add, the biggest component of revenue for that business is the service business. So this stability within foundationally for that division was that recurring revenue."

            "name": "Stephen MacMillan",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start by stating the obvious. This is an unprecedented time for the company, our shareholders and the entire world. Therefore, we're going to structure our remarks differently today. First, I'm going to discuss 3 strategic topics related to the COVID-19 pandemic, then hand it over to Karleen, who will cover our results and outlook.  Rather than keep you in suspense, here are my key points upfront. First, Hologic was performing exceptionally well until late March, continuing the strong momentum that has been building over the last few years. Second, as COVID-19 spread and threaten global economies, we moved quickly to mitigate the risk with a focus on cash so that our healthy fundamentals would be intact on the other side of the pandemic. And third, as one of the world's leading molecular diagnostics firms, this is a unique moment for us to live into our purpose by providing solutions for the most important issue facing the globe today.  So while we are scaling back in some areas in the short term, we are simultaneously boosting investments in our diagnostics business to respond to the world's needs, which will make us a much stronger company on the other side of this. Obviously, it's our employees who are making this possible, and we want to take a moment to thank them. I am so unbelievably proud of the engagement and commitment we've seen inside Hologic in the face of these challenging times. Countless employees from all our divisions have volunteered to help with our COVID efforts, offering everything from new business ideas that keep customers safe to their own hands and feet for the packaging line in our San Diego plant.  A special thanks goes out to our diagnostics team under the leadership of Kevin Thornal. In so many ways, the work of countless current and former employees over the years has positioned us to have a massive impact when the world needs us most. But I'd like to specifically highlight Marcos Borrell's project managers; Maurice Exner's development team; Matt Friedenberg's instrument group; Kathy Chester's regulatory team; Dave Tyler's manufacturing organization; and Keith Gantner's commercial team. Someday, you'll look back on this as one of the highlights of your professional careers, mainly because the world has never needed you more. We'll catch up on sleep when we reach the other side, which we will.  With that introduction, now let me turn to those 3 key points. First, we were performing exceptionally well until late March, continuing the strong momentum that's been building over the last few years. This is important because women's health needs are not going away due to COVID-19 and we'll still be a market leader on the other side of the pandemic. Our growth strategies will continue to pay off. We'll keep leveraging our strong U.S. commercial positions in breast health, diagnostics and surgical. We'll keep growing internationally across all our franchises. We'll keep investing in innovative research and development that drives new product growth, and we'll keep boosting our growth rate through tuck-in acquisitions.  As we said in our earnings release, organic revenue growth was 5.2% through the end of February and we were on pace for another beat-and-raise quarter. Three areas drove our growth in the second quarter. First, global molecular revenue increased 14.2%, the highest growth rate since 2012. This included only about $3.4 million of assay revenue related to our COVID test. Excluding this, the business still grew more than 12% as we continue to layer additional tests including now our COVID assays onto our Panther installed base. Make no mistake about it, our Molecular Diagnostics business is on a roll on a global basis.  Second, sales in our European region grew by a whopping 20.8% for the second quarter, excluding the divested Cynosure business. An outstanding performance by Jan Verstreken's team. Diagnostics led the way in the quarter, driven by cervical cancer co-testing in Germany and viral load testing in Africa. But Breast Health and Surgical also posted low double-digit growth.  Third, U.S. Surgical was incredibly strong for most of the quarter, up 14.7% in the first two months, building on recent acceleration and on pace to be an exceptional quarter. For the full quarter, U.S. Surgical still managed to grow 3.1% despite a significant decline in March.  Now let me turn to our second key point. As COVID-19 spread and threaten global economies in March, we moved quickly to mitigate the risk with a focus on cash. Our primary goal was to ensure that our healthy fundamentals would still be intact on the other side of the pandemic. I'd like to highlight several actions in this regard.  First, our efforts to strengthen our balance sheet over the last several years prepared us well to face the COVID crisis. For example, several years ago, we established a $1.5 billion revolving credit line, with a very attractive interest rate and covenants that are usually seen only with investment-grade companies. As the pandemic rapidly spread, we moved quickly to borrow $750 million from this line of credit, both to prepare for lower future cash flows and to pay off our $250 million accounts receivable securitization program. We wanted to act early and be at the front of the line with our bank partners. We also suspended our share buyback activities in March. Before then however, we completed our previously announced ASR and also repurchased 5.9 million shares for $267.6 million, which we believe will be an excellent investment over the long term.  Second, we moved quickly and decisively to reduce operating expenses through a combination of actions, hopefully temporary, that were specific to each division, function and geography across the company. Based on the needs of each business, we eliminated temporary employees and contractors, furloughed employees and temporarily shut down or shortened work weeks at several of our manufacturing plants. In other areas, we implemented broad pay reductions. We cut salaries for me and the Board by 50%, for our global leadership team by 25% and for other salaried employees by roughly 10%. At the same time, we made conscious decisions to preserve 401(k) matches and actually supplement the compensation of those salespeople who would normally receive 100% of their pay through commissions. Our goals were to keep our good people, reduce outright layoffs as much as possible and be in a position to emerge quickly on the other side of the pandemic.  In total, these and other actions should help us temporarily reduce operating expenses compared to the second quarter run rate by almost $40 million in the third quarter. Going forward, we intend to continue managing discretionary spending closely, while still taking care of our employees and funding future growth initiatives, such as boosting capital expenditures to ramp up our COVID manufacturing capacity.  Which brings us to our third major topic. As one of the world's leading molecular diagnostics firms, this is a special moment in time for us to live into our corporate purpose and become a much stronger company in the process. Building on the success we've had over the last several years, in placing Panther instruments around the world. We are in a unique position to help fight the coronavirus by providing the molecular testing that's needed to preserve human health as well as reopen our economies. And our efforts could provide a significant positive offset to pressures elsewhere in our business.  When the genetic sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was published in January, our scientists immediately jumped on it, just as they did when H1N1 influenza and the Zika virus emerged in the past. Our focus then was on speed. We wanted to get a test to market as soon as possible. With support from BARDA, we were able to secure emergency use authorization for our assay in about 2 months. We chose to develop a PCR-based test for a few reasons. First, it was faster as we leveraged the Open Access software that was previously written for the Fusion module. Second, we sell PCR-based test for influenza and other respiratory viruses that run on the Fusion side of our instrument. These viruses can cause symptoms that resemble COVID-19 disease so we wanted to give labs the capability to test a single patient sample for multiple targets. Third, there was a clear regulatory pathway for assays based on PCR, which is the backbone of most existing respiratory tests and the first couple of COVID assays.  Today, we have all come to understand that a real key to controlling this disease and getting people back to work is delivering fast, highly accurate test results on a truly unprecedented scale. Let me focus on that word results. Many investors have asked us why U.S. testing volumes are still limited, even as the diagnostics industry is producing more tests. One reason is that many of these tests are run on manual or semi-automated systems, putting a tremendous strain on lab technicians who are in short supply to begin with. Some of these systems require reagents from multiple vendors, which have been limited. In addition, while point-of-care tests have an important role to play against the pandemic, they can't be done in high volumes. In fact, high-volume testing has been concentrated in a relatively small number of labs, which can lead to longer turnaround times and backlogs.  For all these reasons, we quickly dedicated enormous resources to develop a second COVID test to run on the base Panther system, using our proprietary Aptima technologies, including transcription-mediated amplification, which is an alternative to PCR. Our lab customers already use these Aptima technologies to perform tens of millions of molecular tests a year for sexually transmitted infections, cervical cancer screening and virology. There are 2 major advantages to this approach, which is again, being supported by BARDA, this time with about $13 million.  First, because our supply chain has been scaled to produce massive numbers of Aptima tests for other infectious diseases, we can now redirect these manufacturing resources to produce large quantities of coronavirus assays. Specifically, we expect to provide our lab customers about 3 million Aptima tests next week -- yes, 3 million -- and are planning to produce at least 1 million tests a week starting in late May. Customers using our Aptima assays do not need to perform additional sample preparation steps or by other commercial reagents for nucleic acid extraction. This should help reduce competition for raw materials and further increase global testing capacity.  Finally, to help alleviate shortages of commonly used sample collection swabs and transport media, we have validated our Aptima multitest swab specimen collection kit, which is used today, mainly for STD testing for use with both the Aptima and Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assays.  Second, our Aptima tests run on the world's largest installed base of high throughput systems. More than 1,800 Panthers are in use globally compared to about 200 of the much newer Panther Fusion platform. You can do the simple math. This is almost a tenfold increase in our ability to leverage our industry-leading installed base of high throughput instruments. This means that more hospital, public health and reference lab customers can apply the power of full automation to coronavirus testing. This automation reduces hands-on time and the potential for manual error, and helps reduce the labor bottlenecks that have emerged given the unprecedented volume of COVID tests needed. So our lab customers will be able to deliver more results when and where they are needed.  Adding a COVID assay to the Panther menu provides a unique opportunity to turbocharge the strategy we have been pursuing in molecular diagnostics for years. COVID testing will help us place more Panthers, both in the United States and overseas, and also drive higher assay utilization on the systems that are already in the field, and it will accelerate the positive change in diagnostics that we've previously discussed, as we move from being the leader in STDs to a much stronger position as a broad-based molecular diagnostics leader with strong customer partnerships.  Before I turn it over to Karleen, let me conclude by saying that in these unprecedented times, our purpose, passion and promise remains steadfast. Our purpose is to help enable healthier lives everywhere, every day. Never has that been more relevant than today as we battle a global pandemic. Our passion is to become global champions for women's health. Obviously, women are affected by COVID-19, but when the pandemic is under control, demand for our market-leading products and services will come back. Early detection of diseases like breast and cervical cancer will always be important. And our promise is rooted in what we call The Science of Sure, providing highly accurate, differentiated products, which has never been more important than when combating a public health crisis.  As difficult as the current environment is, I have never been more energized about our chance to play a major role in the toughest issue facing the world today while knowing that our efforts today are also strengthening us for the future.  Now let me turn the call over to Karleen. Yes. Thanks, Tycho. And by the way, Tony and the rest of the guys at the warehouse are busting their butts right now. So -- and part of it is on Panthers. We have, as you can imagine, getting a significant increase in interest in Panthers around the world. And I think everybody is realizing just what an incredible platform it is. So as a reminder, folks, we've been placing about 200 to 250 Panthers a year. Generally in that, call it, 20-ish a month. We are also scaling capacity right now for Panthers, they're much longer lead times but we're having significant additional requests, particularly as well, frankly, from departments of health, some of the additional labs from hospitals, but it's across the board and including even the largest reference labs. So it's almost across the board, people wanting to get even more access to capacity.  On the serology piece, to your second part, yes, don't expect us to really do anything there. We're not sure we bring anything to the party in that game. We're just putting all of our resources in the molecular world that we know so well. I'll try to answer this real simply because it's an incredibly insightful question, Patrick. We've never had more calls from people wanting our products. And I mean this on a very global basis, right to various regions within European countries, particularly, frankly, all across Europe but also wildly in the U.S. We've literally been in touch with virtually every governor's office. It seems like half of Congress, obviously, with the White House Task Force on a daily basis, the Department of Defense, it's been mind blowing in terms of the interest, really just since we launched the PCR assay. And Kevin Thornal, our commercial teams and our European teams, even the Asia Pac teams, right down to the Prime Minister in New Zealand, I mean we've got everybody reaching out to us and it is elevating our profile to a very different level than anything we've ever experienced. And there is zero doubt in my mind that's absolutely creating a tremendous runway for us coming out of this. Yes. I think it's still an evolving piece, Patrick. I think -- frankly, our orders were positive in the quarter. We had a tremendous Breast Health orders quarter. I do worry and having lived through the '08-'09 downturn, where I know a lot of the hospitals and the radiology suites, they want new capital. I'm sure in a month or 2, as things start to settle back down, you know hospital CFOs are going to go back through their CapEx with a fine tooth comb and do some of those get pushed out.  I think if we're a betting person, I think Breast Health will probably be a little slower to come back because of that. Now the positive for us is, remember, we don't really get paid on a -- even as the patients take a little time to get back in, we've got the capital sales and then the recurring revenue in a lot of cases, really from service and those kinds of things. So it probably won't go down quite as deeply but it will probably be a longer road back. Great question, Brian. And I think as we look forward, certainly, some of this will be volume dependent, but we've been building our capacity to be able to serve, even as the core business comes back to also be able to meet these demands. So it's -- we're looking at our total capacity to be able to deliver on this. Yes. I'd probably go just a little below that, probably when you think about a global weighted ASP. It's not a focus at this point. We've been so locked and loaded on trying to realize this major testing opportunity, which we think is going to be the single biggest need to really get people back to work and everything else. But like everything else, as we get this out the door and as the science continues to evolve, our team will be looking at the areas that do make some sense for us. And that one clearly would be closer in, but nothing under progress at this point or nothing under development at this point, to be honest. Sure. On the second part, yes, you can run Panther and Fusion simultaneously. In terms of supply, I think part of the reason, frankly, that Dr. Birx and the government are so excited that we're a little bit of the cavalry coming to the rescue here is we already have the systems everywhere. We're the only folks that have high throughput systems in all 50 states. So while there were a lot of tests that were approved and suddenly people are scrambling for equipment, I think we feel pretty good that we've already got this massive installed base that's been building over the last 6, 7 years as opposed to this mass scramble now. Can we supplement it? Are we getting additional requests? Yes. But fundamentally, we can ship 3 million tests next week. And the capacity is already there to be able to produce -- to be able to run those. Yes, Doug, I think, again, the best thing we have going for us is already the installed base that we have out there. It's hard to underscore the people over 1,000 of these systems in the United States. So let's just take an example, Northwell hospital or the more than 400 of these that are already in the hospitals. One of the key areas to keeping our health care workers safe is making sure that they're all tested on a regular basis. So picture this. Most of the hospitals that already have these employees at the end of the day could all be tested. The test can be run overnight and in the morning, they know if somebody shouldn't show up for work. The same can be true in so many decentralized areas, even companies around, not necessarily via us, but there's going to be labs all over the place, very close that we'll be able to run these things.  So it's back to -- it's not point -- let's be very clear, we are not point of care, but we are able to run a whole bunch of tests in a very local geography. So to a large degree, again, if somebody wants to do a drive-through, pop-up thing, there's generally a Panther not too far away that they should be able to access through either a hospital lab, one of the reference labs or even the departments of health within their states. So again, we -- do we wish we had even more? Yes, but it's already an incredible installed base that again, nobody else has had. When you look at the marketplace, you got point-of-care on one end and you've got the massive systems in a centralized reference lab at the other end, which you have not had is the ability to have high throughput testing close to the patient to be able to deliver those results where and when they're needed, not a week later. Sure, Ivy. I'll start backwards. In terms of market share, we're not really focused on that the way we typically are because I think we're all rooting -- it's a unique time in the world where I think we're less about competing against each other and more all trying to race to create enough capacity to help not just this country but help the world get back to work, which kind of gets back to the first part of your question. There are so many unknowns. Come the fall, are we running 500,000 tests a day. Are we running 200,000 tests a day, we're running 3 million tests a day in the U.S. It's just so hard to know at this point in time. We are planning to continue to invest in capacity. Candidly, one of the biggest rate-limiting steps for us is our very unique cap system, which is what makes our system so highly automated.  We're building more cap machines. These things typically take 18 months to build. We've got people working around the clock to try to build them and call it a 6-month time frame. So we want to be prepared to bring on even more capacity later in the fall, ahead of the next flu season in the Northern Hemisphere because we do believe the way we look at it is, next year, when anybody -- there's any outbreak of flu or anything as soon as somebody coughs we're going to be wanting to be testing them just for regular flu as well as for COVID. So we want to have even more capacity online by the fall. But I don't really want to get into giving specific numbers. Yes. At the end of the day, we view there's going to be a massive need for diagnostic testing because at the end of -- even in a serology world, first off, there's so many unknowns with serology, as you well know, just because you may have some antibodies and it may appear -- are you really immune to others? There's just a lot of uncertainties to it and it's still going to be only a percentage of the population.  At the end of the day, what is going to be critically important to getting people confident to go back into the workplace, to get to back to where we can have everybody back in school, have people traveling on airplanes again, has got to be a robust testing real-time capability. And that plays to our strength. That's where our focus is. And again, how big the serology market becomes on that end, we don't know but we frankly think there's enough for us to play in, in the area that we know a lot about. Anthony, say hi to Raj for us, too. As it relates to the swab, the magic that we referenced, obviously, is we're -- we've qualified our Aptima swab to be used along with us. So the great part about it is we basically have some degree, it's a closed system, we can ship the swab and the vials together, boom, they test, use our swab and they're ready to go. So we're providing the customer with effectively a complete package. And I think that's going to dramatically streamline. I think it's hard for people that aren't close to these to fully understand the incredible workflow efficiencies that come from using the Aptima system all the way through. So that should be a huge advantage for us.  On the Boston news with Minerva, I think we continue to feel really good about what our Surgical business is doing. As we mentioned, it was up 14.7% through the first 2 months of the last quarter. Our Surgical business has just really had an incredible turnaround and strength over the last couple of years. Clearly, Boston was not -- they're an incredibly successful company and having a challenge in that space with those products, I think our team is quite happy to see whoever is out there and continue to fight. So we think we've got better products and a better sales team. Sure, David. And I think the way to think about the barriers that you're getting to is, I think one of the biggest barriers, let's face it, just in normal day-to-day activities has been people who feel like they should be tested to actually getting tests. And so I think they've -- all of the states, all the hospitals, all the doctors have been fairly restrictive in allowing people to get tested. You've had to fight through hoops and everything just to get a test because the supply was so constrained. So I think one of the magical things that may start to happen right now is as people start to get more comfortable that there's -- the supply is really starting to ramp up, I think we will start to see a little bit more of the loosening of the gauntlet that a patient has to run through to get tested.  And I think as we start to open that up, to me, the magic of that will be, we'll start to get truly more tests out there. The ability of the people on the front line just to administer the swabs, so I think, again, in our case, we're going to have the swabs. You don't need separate transport media when it gets to the lab, you don't need somebody to extract it from the transport media, put it into another vial. So there's an incredible -- and I think you understand as well, there's an incredible efficiency on that side. So I think it's like everything, even in another week, things will start to go out. You know what we know that Dr. Birx and her team are in touch with all the public health labs, letting people know where we're coming. There's incredible excitement there. I think those things will, I think, help to finally unlock. It's not going to be the unlock, but I think the progress there will really start to see coming in a big way. Sure, Dan. I think it will ramp up over time. If anything, it will probably take a short-term pause because we're going to be running the machines probably at a fairly hefty pace. Nobody's going to even want to shut one down to accommodate adding a Fusion onto the side. And now with the TMA assay out there, they frankly can manage without it for a while. So I think we'll continue to build it over time. Mike, did you want to add something? Yes. Sure. We're kind of describing this internally as everybody talks about Vs, Ws, Ls, use whatever in terms of recovery. We're describing it as kind of a checkmark, a sharp down and then certainly coming back, I think nicely, it will be probably a little jagged there on the way back up. But I think what we see and we feel really good about the Breast Health business overall that it has become so much more diversified. But the capital will probably be lagging a little bit as it comes back.  And then the flip side is, in the grand scheme, our capital purchases are also not a huge amount for any given hospital system. So we're not totally sure, but we feel really good that we're going to be able to work with our customers to have it coming back online. But I would -- I think we'll be back by a year from now but I wouldn't expect to be back in the next couple of quarters. Karleen?"

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to Hologic's First Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Justin, and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions].  I would now like to introduce Mike Watts, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, to begin the call.\nMichael Watts: Thank you, Justin. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us for Hologic's First Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer. Steve and Karleen both have some prepared remarks, then we'll have a question-and-answer session. Our first quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. Finally, a replay of this call will be archived through February 21. Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those that are referenced in the safe harbor statement that's included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. One of these non-GAAP measures is organic revenue, which we are defining as constant currency revenue less the divested Blood Screening and Cynosure businesses as well as the acquired SuperSonic Imagine business. We hope that our discussion of organic revenue in this call will simplify a complex quarter and help you focus on the parts of our business that matter most. Finally, any percentage changes that we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be expressed in constant currency unless otherwise noted. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO.\nStephen MacMillan: Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to discuss our strong financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. But before we get into those details, let me start by saying that it's an exciting time for the company and for our shareholders. Now that the divestiture of Cynosure is behind us, we're able to double down on what we do best: helping women and their families live healthier lives through early detection and treatment of disease. Along those lines, at the recent JPMorgan conference, it was exciting to reintroduce ourselves to investors as a unique asset in women's health. Now with a simpler story, minus the overhang of Medical Aesthetics, shareholders can focus on the significant positive changes that have occurred in each of our businesses over the last couple of years. When you do, we think you'll find a company with a broad portfolio of market-leading products for women's health; a company that, over the last 6 years, has grown the top line at mid- single-digit rate and leveraged that into low double-digit growth on the bottom line; a company where each business has strengthened significantly since the first half of 2018, positioning us to drive faster organic revenue growth and better margins in 2020; and a company that is focused on redeploying its strong cash flow more aggressively into growth-accretive tuck-in acquisitions as well as returning cash to our shareholders via stock buybacks. I'm proud to say that for the first time since I joined Hologic, all our domestic divisions as well as our international regions are performing well at the same time, and behind the scenes, that's because our corporate and divisional leadership teams have never been stronger than they are today. With that introduction, let me turn to our first quarter results, which represent our seventh consecutive quarter of solid, consistent performance. Total revenue finished slightly above the high end of our guidance at $850.5 million. This was only 2.8% growth, but it's important to break down the components, as Mike said. He defined organic revenue, which excludes the divested Blood Screening and Medical Aesthetics businesses as well as some earlier-than-expected revenue from SuperSonic Imagine this quarter. So organically, we significantly outperformed expectations, growing 4.6% against our toughest comparable of the year. And this 4.6% compares favorably to our last quarterly guidance, which called for growth of 1.2% to 3%. In terms of the bottom line, we were pleased to hit the high end of our guidance range with EPS of $0.61 in the first quarter, even while absorbing a much worse-than-expected loss from Cynosure. So we are off to a good start in fiscal 2020, with all our divisions and regions showing solid performance. We are particularly excited about our Surgical division, which led the way with 10.2% growth in the quarter; and our Diagnostics business, which outperformed with 6.5% growth, excluding Blood. In terms of geography, domestic sales of $632.7 million increased 1.8% in the first quarter but 3.2% on an organic basis. Outside the United States, sales of $217.8 million increased 6%. But excluding acquisitions and divestitures again, revenue increased 9.2% organically, reflecting the strong foundations we have built for sustainable international growth. Core U.S. sales have grown at a low double-digit rate in each of the last 3 years, and we're well positioned to maintain that pace in the balance of 2020. Now let me provide some more detail on our divisional revenue results. In our biggest division, Breast Health, our core 3D mammography business remains rock solid, and we are building on it with an increasingly diversified product portfolio that spans the continuum of breast health care. As we said at JPMorgan, we have overhauled our sales talent, structure and process to help key account managers sell a growing product portfolio more strategically. And this has led to a more diverse, consistent revenue growth. In the first quarter, underlying trends in Breast Health remained solid. Though consistent with our guidance, growth was slower due to a very difficult prior year comparable when worldwide sales grew more than 13%. Against this, global Breast Health sales totaled $331.1 million this quarter and increased 2.4%. Excluding $6.1 million of sales from SuperSonic Imagine, which was not included in our last guidance, global growth was 0.5%. In terms of geography, domestic Breast Health revenue finished in line with our expectations, with growth of 1.5%. OUS sales increased 5.5% in total but decreased 1.4% without SSI against a very challenging 16.1% comparable in the prior year period. We do expect OUS growth rates to rebound strongly in the balance of the year as the business grows and the comps ease. In terms of the breast subsegments, imaging sales grew 2.4%, benefiting from the SSI revenue I mentioned earlier, while interventional sales increased 2.6%. In imaging, sales of our Genius 3D Mammography systems remain steady driven by our new 3Dimensions and 3D Performance gantries. As we said in San Francisco, we have sold more than 1,000 gantries a year in the United States for each of the last 5 years, a remarkably durable performance that has defied expectations of a rapid drop-off in sales. Not only have we been converting our own 2D units to 3D, we have been gaining a much higher share of competitive conversions than anticipated. This market leadership position provides a solid foundation for divisional growth and a platform onto which we can add new products and strengthen our strategic advantages. In interventional, our first quarter results benefited from strong growth in biopsy disposables as our account managers focus on selling our entire portfolio. However, this was largely offset by a headwind from lower Brevera capital sales, which peaked in the first quarter of 2019 before we began limiting supply. We expect the Brevera headwind to be less onerous in the second and third quarters then flip to a tailwind in the fourth quarter when we begin selling capital again. Our new breast surgery franchise, which consists of the acquired Faxitron and Focal brands plus some legacy Hologic products, also continues to perform very well, with growth in the low teens in the quarter. We're pleased to see our strategic rationale for these division-led tuck-in acquisitions playing out as we accelerate growth by coupling clinically differentiated products with Hologic's commercial infrastructure. And we are equally excited about our acquisition of SuperSonic Imagine, or SSI, during the first quarter. As a reminder, SSI is a French innovator in cart-based ultrasound technology, which is used across the continuum of breast health care. Integration is off to a good start, and we continue to believe that the business will be accretive to our revenue growth rate, albeit with some slight dilution to EPS in the near term. We are especially excited about the opportunity in the United States, where SSI had a very limited sales presence, but will now be able to benefit from our commercial infrastructure and relationships with key customers. Now let's turn to Diagnostics, where we have upgraded our talent and aligned our commercial structure to help lab customers of all sizes grow their business. In the first quarter, total revenue of $311.5 million increased 5.5%. Excluding sales from the divested Blood Screening business, Diagnostics revenue grew 6.5%, an even stronger performance. The growth driver here remains Molecular, where we're placing more Panthers with more assay menu in more countries. This has led to strong increases in consumable sales and consistent revenue growth. In the first quarter, for example, worldwide Molecular sales of $178.5 million grew a robust 9% against a challenging prior year comparable. International Molecular continues to be a standout in both the speed and consistency of growth. OUS Molecular sales increased 22.2%, well into the double digits for the 14th time in 15 quarters. Growth was led by our core women's health tests, our viral load assays, with a growing contribution from HIV in Africa and Panther Fusion.  And in the U.S., although we already enjoy high market shares in key assay categories, Molecular sales still grew 6%. This reflects how we work collaboratively with our customers to drive volumes and better patient care in established markets. Domestic growth was again broad-based as customers consolidated testing on our large installed base of Panther instruments. As we showed at JPMorgan, we have shipped more than 200 Panthers globally in each of the last 5 years, fueling a very consistent, profitable razor-blade business model. In the first quarter, our legacy women's health assays for chlamydia, gonorrhea, HPV and Trichomonas drove the growth, with our new vaginosis test, Panther Fusion, and our viral load assays contributing as well. Moving on, we were also pleased that Cytology & Perinatal sales of $121 million grew by 3.1% in the quarter, admittedly versus a soft prior year comp. Perinatal sales were flat, so the growth came from our Thinprep cytology franchise. Domestic sales were down slightly, consistent with recent trends, but OUS sales grew solidly, in part, reflecting the early phase of Germany's decision to adopt co-testing screening for HPV and PAP as the standard of care to minimize cervical cancer risk. To wrap up Diagnostics, revenue related to our divested Blood Screening business was slightly higher than expected at $12 million but declined by 15.5%. As a reminder, this revenue reflects low-margin products and services under transition agreements with Grifols and is excluded from our organic results. Now let's turn to GYN Surgical, our most profitable division on a percentage basis, where best-in-class products, new leadership, new commercial models and new product launches have been consistently accelerating growth for 2-plus years. In the first quarter specifically, sales of $119.1 million increased 10.2%, our fastest growth in 11 quarters. Surgical growth was driven by 3 main factors. First, core MyoSure continues to perform well, with mid-teens growth in the quarter as we expand the market for fibroid removal while gaining share. Second, although the domestic endometrial ablation market continues to contract, NovaSure is stabilizing thanks to renewed focus by our commercial teams. NovaSure was down low single digits in the quarter, an improvement compared to recent periods. We are pleased with the number of competitive wins we are seeing for NovaSure and ended the first quarter with more NovaSure customers in the United States than we started with. Third, new products are growing rapidly, although they still represent less than 10% of divisional revenue. Our Fluent Fluid Management System is our best-selling new Surgical product thus far, with more innovations emerging from our development efforts. And fourth, although international represents less than 20% of Surgical sales, it is growing rapidly, 19.6% in the first quarter. And we've only scratched the surface of this opportunity. To round out the revenue discussion, Skeletal sales of $23.5 million grew 11.4%, our best performance since the fourth quarter of 2017, based on strong growth of our DEXA systems. We're pleased to see the top college and professional sports teams are adopting DEXA technology for body composition testing and that our products will once again be used to assess football players participating in the NFL draft combine. Before we turn the call over to Karleen, let me just close our Medical Aesthetics chapter by saying that we are pleased to have completed the divestiture at the end of December. Cynosure sales in the first quarter were clearly much weaker than expected across the board. And as I mentioned earlier, the business was a significant drag on profitability as well. In terms of our business development strategy moving ahead, we look forward to pursuing more of the smaller division-led deals that have been working well for us. Net, we feel really good about the businesses we're currently in and don't see a need to add a fourth leg to our strategy given the many opportunities for tuck-ins that leverage our existing commercial channels. So in conclusion, it's an exciting time for the company and our shareholders. We are pleased to report our seventh consecutive quarter of strong execution, with 4.6% organic growth against our toughest comparable of the year. Our Surgical and Molecular Diagnostics businesses stood out this quarter, aided by strong international growth. But Breast Health is also performing well, with a multitude of opportunities still ahead. The efforts we have made over the last few years to strengthen capabilities and accelerate growth are paying off across the company, and we are supplementing these efforts with smart capital deployment that is focused on tuck-in acquisitions and share buybacks. Now let me turn the call over to Karleen.\nKarleen Oberton: Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'm going to walk through the rest of our income statement, touch on a few other key financial metrics, then finish with our updated financial guidance for 2020 as well as for the second quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results, and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis in constant currency. As Steve described, we are pleased with our first quarter results as organic revenue growth of 4.6% drove sales of $850.5 million, which slightly exceeded our guidance range. In addition, EPS of $0.61 finished at the top end of our guidance despite significant underperformance from the divested Medical Aesthetics business. We also executed on a $205 million accelerated share repurchase program following the Cynosure announcement and bought back an additional $81 million worth of shares on the open market. And our Board has authorized an additional $500 million repurchase program beginning in the third quarter. For all these reasons, fiscal 2020 is off to a great start, and we are raising our guidance for organic revenue growth and EPS accordingly. I'll discuss that more in a minute. But before I do, let me start by reviewing our P&L for the first quarter. Gross margins of 61.6% decreased 60 basis points compared to the prior year period. This was primarily due to the disappointing sales in the divested Cynosure business, product and geographic sales mix and the stronger U.S. dollar. Total operating expenses of $289.3 million increased 5.3% in the first quarter or 4.1% if you exclude SSI's expenses. This increase was driven mainly by higher G&A costs associated with our deferred compensation plan, in which the associated liability is mark-to-market, resulting in higher expense. It's important to note, however, that we hedge this exposure. So most of this expense is offset by a benefit below the line in other income. In addition, research and development expenses increased as we continue to balance growth investments with our goal to drive operating leverage. Based on these increases in operating expenses, operating margin of 27.5% decreased 170 basis points. However, given the deferred compensation dynamic that I just discussed and the benefit in other income, it's probably more appropriate to focus on net margins of 19.3%, which increased 40 basis points despite the Cynosure headwind. Overall, our profitability remains very healthy. All of this led to non-GAAP net income of $164.1 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.61, at the top end of our guidance range, despite absorbing the Cynosure loss. Cynosure ended up costing us more than $0.02 in the quarter, net of the fixed overhead cost that, that division absorbed. Before we cover our revised 2020 guidance, I'll quickly touch on a few other financial metrics. Our leverage ratio stood at 2.5x at the end of the first quarter as we used cash to acquire SuperSonic Imagine and buy back shares. We remain comfortable with a leverage ratio between 2.5 and 3x, recognizing that this could fluctuate based on the timing of acquisitions and buyback activity. Moving on, ROIC was 12.3% on a trailing 12-month basis, an increase of 10 basis points over the prior year. Finally, adjusted EBITDA of $261.9 million increased slightly compared to the prior year. Now I'd like to shift gears and discuss our non-GAAP financial guidance for the full year and second quarter. We are updating our full year guidance based on our good first quarter results and to account for the divestiture of Cynosure. At the high -- at a high level, we are raising our organic constant currency revenue guidance as well as our EPS forecast. Let's start with revenue. As a reminder, we previously guided to reported sales of $3.45 billion to $3.5 billion, which represented constant currency growth of between 3% and 4.5%. This original guidance contemplated an equivalent organic growth rate of 3% to 4.5% since the forecast from the acquired SSI business and the divested Blood Screening business basically offset each other. Based on our strong first quarter results in our core businesses, the divestiture of Cynosure and an updated currency headwind of $10 million, we are increasing our organic revenue growth guidance to a range of 4% to 5%. If we meet or exceed the middle of this range, organic revenue growth would accelerate compared to 2019, as Steve said in his introduction. Now let me transition to reported growth guidance for the full year. We now expect revenue of $30 million to $35 million from SSI and $35 million to $40 million from Blood Screening. This helps us build up to a total reported revenue range of $3.238 billion to $3.268 billion. This range equates to constant currency decline of 3.5% to 2.6% or a reported decline of 3.8% to 2.9%. These declines are driven by the absence of Cynosure revenue in the balance of the year. Based on the improved revenue performance in our core businesses, we expect to invest additional resources in future growth. But at the same time, our buyback activities enable us to offset these additional investments while still driving leverage bottom line growth. So despite absorbing the $0.02 Cynosure loss in the first quarter, we are increasing our full year EPS guidance to a range of $2.63 to $2.67 a share, which represents growth between 8.2% and 9.9%. This full updated -- full year updated guidance is based on diluted shares outstanding of 268 million to 269 million for the full year, which reflects progress on our buyback program and an effective tax rate of approximately 21.75%, the same as our original guidance. Now let's turn to guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2020. We expect organic revenue growth of 3.4% to 4.8%. This organic growth, combined with the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, leads to a total revenue range of $770 million to $780 million for the quarter. This equates to constant currency decline of 5.4% to 4.2% and a reported decline of between 5.9% and 4.7%. Again, these declines are due to the absence of Cynosure revenue compared to the prior year period. On the bottom line, we expect EPS of $0.61 to $0.63 in the second quarter. This implies growth rates of between 5.2% and 8.6% continuing to outpace revenue. Let me point out that this EPS range incorporates improved gross margins of 62% to 63% in the second quarter, mainly reflecting benefits from the Cynosure divestiture. I'd also like to point out that while other expenses net were $24.8 million in the first quarter, we expect these expenses to increase by more than $5 million sequentially in the second quarter as we don't forecast the benefits we saw in the first quarter to recur. As you update your forecast, let me remind you that we're raising our guidance materially this quarter, so we would encourage you to model to the middle of our guidance range. It's still early in the year, and we've tried to set realistic ranges that incorporate both potential upsides and downsides. Before we open the call for questions, let me conclude by saying we are pleased with how we started 2020. We feel great about our core businesses and now raising our organic growth rate guidance accordingly. We are encouraged by continued strong commercial execution, the progress in our international franchises, the productivity of our R&D pipeline and the deals we have completed. And we are excited about the opportunity to strategically redeploy capital going forward through division-led business development and share buybacks. Overall, we believe we have multiple levers to deliver healthy organic growth -- revenue growth and EPS growth in 2020. With that, I will ask you to operator to open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, we are ready for the first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And we'll go ahead and take the first question from Patrick Donnelly with Citi.\nPatrick Donnelly: Maybe just on Cynosure in the wake of the divestiture. Obviously, this was a big focus or distraction, whatever you want to call it, for the investor base. But how much in the divestiture allow for an increased focus internally? Given things are segmented out, did it not consume too much mind share? Or do you feel like there's not going to be a renewed focus on the core business, particularly in areas like internationally, your businesses seem to be run a little closer to each other? Did Cyno get kind of a disproportionate amount of attention there? Or do you feel like there's going to be an increase especially even outside of the removal on the overall growth number?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. Patrick, your -- the last part of your question is extra insightful, that in the U.S., there was -- really, the core businesses were not as distracted, but clearly, Karleen, me and Mike, the whole senior management team was. Internationally, to your point, I think what we're really excited about is the international folks being able to really double down on the 3 core businesses because like anything, they were probably spending a disproportionate amount of time and energy dealing with customer issues, service issues, whatever it might be on the Cynosure business. And I will tell you, if you talk to our head of Asia Pac, our head of the European area and then you get into the country leaders and everything else, they, I think, are very excited about the opportunities ahead. And I think we've been making very nice progress in the last few years internationally, but this is probably the best news they can get out of it. And it makes us more excited about the opportunities ahead.\nKarleen Oberton: And Patrick, this is Karleen. The only thing I would also add is that it kind of shows such a back-end-loaded revenue in the quarter. Really, this divesture also gives us increased confidence in our forecasting ability and ability to reinvest when we see upside. So I think it's a benefit there though as well.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Doug Schenkel with Cowen.\nChris Lin: This is Chris on for Doug today. Maybe just to follow up on the Cynosure question a bit.\nMichael Watts: Hey, Chris, before you get started, just for the -- this is Mike. Just for the operator, it's fine to let folks ask a second follow-up question, just to be clear. So I just wanted to make that point that you're welcome to ask a follow-up. Sorry about that.\nChris Lin: Go ahead. Okay. So could you just help us bridge the organic revenue growth guidance as it relates to Cynosure in the core business? I guess, said differently, to what extent was organic revenue growth guidance increased due to the removal of Cynosure from results?\nStephen MacMillan: There was a bit of both. I think at the -- truthfully, at the start of the year, Cynosure, we thought, was going to grow roughly in line with the rest of the businesses. Now clearly, that did not happen in the first quarter because of the divestiture and the announcement. So it was a pretty ugly quarter. But I think if you really look at it, at the end of the day, the revised guidance upward is also more conviction and confidence in our core businesses. So it's really more about the additional confidence we have in our core businesses. We didn't really see Cyno being a drag. Now probably, it would have been, but it's -- clearly, we feel better and better about each of the 3 other businesses.\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. And I think to the point that Steve made earlier, internationally, is it's a significant piece of the upward take in that guidance.\nChris Lin: Okay. And then for a follow-up question, has the severe flu season benefited your Panther Fusion respiratory assays? And could you just ballpark how big that business is now?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. We wish it was, but we're still so small in the flu business. If anything, we always -- we're probably still at that stage where it could possibly hurt us a touch as people may give up other visits to their doctors. But I think, overall, awash, but we don't see it being a big benefit to us yet just because we're not as big yet in that space.\nMichael Watts: Yes. Chris, just -- this is Mike. Just to give a little more color on that. I think we've said, last year, our Fusion respiratory assay revenue was around $10 million, a little bit less. So that will give you a sense. I mean certainly, we were up in the quarter as you would expect, and we would expect to be up in the year. But as Steve said, not a huge deal.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.\nTycho Peterson: Just looking at guidance, the midpoint and higher end obviously implies an acceleration, ex Cyno. Can you just talk about, by segment, where you're seeing the acceleration for 2020? Is it mostly on the GYN Surg side? And if so, how sustainable is that? You hit over 10% there this quarter, so just curious about where you see the acceleration this year.\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. Clearly, we're really pleased with the Surgical performance and the continued improved performance we've seen over the -- several quarters now. But yes, I would say acceleration is clearly from Surgical and probably Diagnostic as well.\nTycho Peterson: And then you're bumping up the SSI guide from $25 million to $30 million to $30 million to $35 million. Can you just talk a little bit about how you're bundling that with the rest of the offering? Anything to note on the integration front and how you see that ramp going?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. So I would just say that the increase really has to do with the timing of obtaining the controlling interest. So when we originally guided in Q4, we assumed we would not have a controlling interest and therefore, no revenue in the first quarter. So the uptake is really the timing of that controlling interest. And I think it's early days, but the integration is off to a start. And I think, as we've said before, SSI had minimal presence in the U.S., only, I think, 5 reps -- sales reps in the U.S. And so our teams are excited to drop that product into their -- our sophisticated commercial infrastructure here in the U.S.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays.\nJack Meehan: I wanted to go back to the Molecular growth in the quarter and maybe just focus on what's going on in the U.S. I think you mentioned in the script that the core women's health was still growing well. But I'm just curious because we've seen, in just the past couple of quarters, I think last quarter, U.S. Molecular grew 9%. Just what was the -- maybe just why did that slow down a little bit in the quarter? Was there anything from a comp perspective? Or what's going on, on the women's health side?\nMichael Watts: Yes. Jack, it's Mike. I think we were pretty happy with the Molecular number in the quarter, both U.S. as well as OUS. As we've talked about in that business, it's not really any one thing that drives growth. Certainly, the core women's health assay, specifically chlamydia, gonorrhea, HPV and Trich, are the biggest tests. So they have to grow for the business to kind of show the performance that you've seen, but they were up very solidly in the quarter in mature markets. Viral load was a nice contributor as well. I think we highlighted some growth in Africa, in particular, from viral load. And I would say some of the new products, particularly the vaginosis panel, the BV/CV test, are starting to contribute as well. So pleased with where that division is. And I guess I would say -- sorry, Jack, I guess the other thing. I mean remember, that had a really bad comp last year, too. It was a very challenging prior year comp. So that might be some of what you're seeing.\nJack Meehan: Okay. Got it. And then I think on the flip side, with Cytology, I thought the international growth looks pretty good, and I know, working off somewhat small numbers. And I picked up, I guess, the comment around Germany. Just do you feel like there's -- how durable do you think the double digit on the international side is as a lever to keep Cytology nudging forward?\nStephen MacMillan: I would not expect it to be a double-digit growth. I think like all these things in international, sometimes, it's the smaller bases and timing, you get a little capital sale, you get some things like -- having said that, I think we do see it being at least a slightly growing asset outside the U.S. to offset the declines in the U.S. And it's why I think, globally, we feel like Cytology is roughly a flattish business. And international gets a little more growth. It might tweak that slightly better, but I don't think it's necessarily a double-digit grower.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Bill Kirk with Piper Sandler.\nRachel Vatnsdal: This is Rachel on for Bill. So the international Diagnostics business continues to grow to a fast level of a pace. How much of this is driven by new products versus share gains? And how long can this sort of pace continue?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. I think we talked about -- I think the majority of the growth is from share gains, a little less from the -- the new products' contribution is the viral load internationally, which is contributing nicely. But we expect continued double-digit growth, probably maybe not at the rate that we've seen as they come against some of those tougher comps, but feel really good about that business.\nStephen MacMillan: We have been placing more Panthers internationally over the recent quarters than we have in the U.S. So I think our ability to continue to sustain that we feel really good about.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Great. And then given the combination of new products across almost all of your divisions and M&A completed so far, how much capacity do your teams have for additional transactions?\nKarleen Oberton: I'm sorry. We couldn't hear that. Could you repeat that question?\nRachel Vatnsdal: Yes. So given the combination of new products across all divisions and M&A completed so far, how much capacity do you think your teams have for additional transactions?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. So I think the transactions that we've done to date have been in the Breast Health division because certainly, within Diagnostics and Surgical, there's more than adequate capacity to take on transactions. I think Breast Health has -- still has a very active M&A pipeline. They do have a lot of integration activities. But certainly, we feel that if the right deal came along, we have the ability to make the capacity to do a transaction.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Brian Weinstein with William Blair.\nBrian Weinstein: Just going back to OUS here for a minute. Obviously, it's been a great driver, and it looks like there's a lot to go here. But can you give us any kind of an update on where you actually do stand in terms of market share for some of the key products? You've typically said that they were around half of what they were for key products here in the States. Where is that now? And what are your longer-term kind of thoughts about where market shares can wind up over there? Can they get to U.S. level still, do you think?\nStephen MacMillan: Brian, I think it's so hard, quite frankly, to really have a great handle on our market shares by segment because there's not great data on a lot of these. I think, anecdotally, from what we just feel, yes, there's still enormous opportunities ahead. And when you look at our relative revenue, under 1/4 of most of our businesses are outside the U.S., where clearly huge opportunities do, again, continue to be playing out not just in the coming quarters, but really, we think we've got a decade's worth of runway here in terms of solid growth before they even catch up to the U.S., probably ultimately the U.S. shares.\nBrian Weinstein: Okay. And then on some of the investments that you're talking about and having a little bit more flexibility to make some of those investments, what are the key strategic investment areas that you guys are focusing on this year? And if there was some upside to develop, where are the incremental investments likely to be made?\nStephen MacMillan: Sure. There's always the extra R&D projects that will come up even during the course of the year that we'll look at. I think we now have better and better leadership internationally. And so that ability to be thinking about adding some more sales reps behind certain franchises in certain countries, I think those kind of opportunities are the kind that can -- we can redeploy efforts as we go through and then the occasional marketing activities as well. But it's really looked at by franchise, by geography, combination, sales, marketing, R&D.\nOperator: And our next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Lewis: Just two questions on earnings and margins for Karleen. Karleen, so $0.03 in the buyback, $0.02 to $0.04 from removed Cyno dilution. That's around $0.05 to $0.07, and you're raising the guide by $0.02. So that incremental $0.03 to $0.05 of additional reinvestment, where is that going? And a quick follow-up on margins.\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. So Dave, let me walk you through how we thought about we'd raise the guidance on the bottom line. So yes, we absorbed the $0.02, additional $0.02 loss. We'd talked about the ASR was about $0.02. Again, there is -- that includes the impact of the stranded costs in the -- from Cynosure because they will bring a piece of our overhead. And then the incremental ASR -- the incremental open share repurchase is less than $0.01 for the full year. So it gets you close to $0.025 at the midpoint.\nDavid Lewis: Okay. But you still expect the Cynosure divestiture to be $0.02 to $0.04 accretive for the year?\nMichael Watts: Yes, I don't -- hey, David, it's Mike. I don't know that we said $0.02 to $0.04 accretive for the year. I think when we announced the divestiture, basically, the business was breakeven or at least was expected to be breakeven for the year. Clearly, they did worse than that in the first quarter. We said that the combination of the divestiture and the ASR would be about $0.02 accretive. Maybe that's where we weren't clear. But -- so we were kind of looking at those things as roughly $0.02 accretive. And then, of course, we absorbed, as Karleen said, some extra dilution that's baked into the raise in Q1 here.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Raj Denhoy with Jefferies.\nRajbir Denhoy: I wonder if maybe I could hit on a couple of things. You mentioned the gantry placement number has been pretty consistent at about 1,000 for several years running now. I realize that the acceleration of this business is only about 6 or 7 years old. But at some point, do we start to see a replacement cycle in 3D? Could that number start to pick up as you move out a couple of years from now?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. I mean I think, eventually, that if you think about 3D was originally approved in 2011, but you had that significant uptake in the 2014, 2015 time frame. With the 7-year life, 7 to 9 year life, at some point, there's a replacement cycle there. But I think we've intentionally smoothed out that cycle with the upgrades that we're doing to the field now. Because if you think about our greatest gantry, 3D, 3Dimensions, those features and functionalities are backwards-compatible to the installed base. So really, trying to minimize that pent-up demand in our replacement cycle. So we feel good and really are pleased with the steady approach of placements over the coming years.\nRajbir Denhoy: Okay. That's fair. And maybe just a follow-up on the last question, on David's question, about the guidance, the earnings guidance, in particular, all of the raises just around the ASR and the Cynosure divestiture. And so Karleen, I'm just curious about your views on sort of other margin expansion initiatives, which you guys can undertake over the next year-plus in order to take your margins even higher than where they are now.\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. So certainly, that's always a focus, to create leverage in an operating margin. And I think, always, we have ongoing programs within the supply chain organization to work on that. And then there's still efforts within the middle of the P&L that we can take. It's an active -- it's an ongoing activity throughout the organization to look for leverage points.\nStephen MacMillan: I would remind you, Raj, as you well know, our margins are already pretty good. So a big part of our focus at this point has really been on accelerating that organic growth rate via the investments in R&D, sales, marketing. And we think, overall, it's going to be a pretty good combination, but more on accelerating the sales growth than on huge additional focuses on margins. But again, obviously, we're always working and expect to improve the margins as well.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Ivy Ma with Bank of America.\nIvy M&A: Karleen, appreciate the color on the guide so far. Not to beat the margin question to death, I just wanted to see how should we think about the margin improvement in this fiscal year and beyond given the removal of Cynosure in terms of both gross margin and operating margin would be great. And then I have a follow-up on the gross margin this quarter as well.\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. So if you look even at just what we've guided to for Q2, 62% to 63%, compared to where we ended Q1, you can see the midpoint of the 100 basis improvement in the margin profile. So I think that's 50 to 100 basis points is how we're thinking the impact is for Cynosure as we move forward. And I think operating margins certainly will be more than that on the gross margin given that Cynosure was such a heavy OpEx business.\nIvy Ma: Great. That's helpful. And then a follow-up. So on the gross margin decline this quarter, could you help us unpack how much in the 60 bps just relates to Cynosure, the mix and then the stuff that you would see, please?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes, maybe I'll describe it another ways. The majority of that decline was really Cynosure. So if you looked at the base business, gross margins are essentially flat year-over-year. And if we looked at quarterly trending of gross margins in '19, Q1 was our best gross margin quarter. So majority is really Cynosure-related.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James.\nJayson Bedford: So I wanted just to revisit the segment growth. I came off the fourth quarter call thinking Diagnostics, Breast Health, Surgical would all grow in that 4% to 5% range for the year. I realize that comps come into play here, but Surgical was obviously well above this level. Breast Health was below this level. So maybe you can just level-set us on segment expectations for the year, if they've changed at all.\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. I think, overall, probably each of our businesses is going to grow solidly in the mid-singles for the year. Breast Health, that will include a little bit of help from SSI, as we said at the start. And then Surgical was probably a little bit at the higher end of that piece; and Diagnostics, pretty much right in the middle. So I think all of that gets to that 4% to 5% organic that we're talking about.\nJayson Bedford: The Breast Health mid-single include SSI?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes.\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. I think, as we always said, especially going against the first 2 quarters where we had these monster comps from a year ago. That's why our initial guidance, if you recall from last quarter, only called for 1.2% to 3.0% organic growth.\nOperator: And we'll go back to Dan Brennan with UBS.\nNathan Treybeck: This is Nathan Treybeck calling for Dan Brennan. Can you hear me?\nStephen MacMillan: Hey. There we go. All right.\nMichael Watts: A lot of pressure on this question now.\nNathan Treybeck: Yes. Definitely. Third time is the charm, I guess. In terms of going back to Molecular, can you frame the size of the OUS opportunity in terms of, I guess, an addressable dollar figure?\nStephen MacMillan: I don't know. We've got a great number on that because, again, just some of the data sources and other stuff. But I think it gets back to we have a lot of runway ahead to consider the size of our Molecular business outside the U.S. relative to inside. Can we easily double and triple it over the longer term where we are today to outside the U.S.? Yes.\nNathan Treybeck: Okay. And just staying on Molecular. Can you discuss the split between share gains from other Molecular players versus, let's say, converting less from non-Molecular approaches?\nStephen MacMillan: It's so hard to know that when you start to deal country-by-country and everything else. I think we feel good about the trajectory. And obviously, it sources above.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Ivy Ma with Bank of America.\nIvy Ma: I just wanted to talk about Surgical for a minute. Can you talk about how sustainable is that segment's growth and what your expectations are for the rest of this fiscal year, especially as the comp gets tougher later in the year?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. I think we -- what we said is Surgical -- I think Steve just talked about the segment, that we expect Surgical at the high end of that mid-single digit given the Q1 performance. Again, we have contribution from new products coming throughout the continuation of the year. But to your point, we are coming up against higher comps. So that's why we don't -- we're not projecting that 10% for the full year.\nOperator: And thank you. That is all the time we have for questions today. This now concludes Hologic's First Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Have a good evening.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Karleen Oberton",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'm going to walk through the rest of our income statement, touch on a few other key financial metrics, then finish with our updated financial guidance for 2020 as well as for the second quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results, and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis in constant currency. As Steve described, we are pleased with our first quarter results as organic revenue growth of 4.6% drove sales of $850.5 million, which slightly exceeded our guidance range. In addition, EPS of $0.61 finished at the top end of our guidance despite significant underperformance from the divested Medical Aesthetics business. We also executed on a $205 million accelerated share repurchase program following the Cynosure announcement and bought back an additional $81 million worth of shares on the open market. And our Board has authorized an additional $500 million repurchase program beginning in the third quarter. For all these reasons, fiscal 2020 is off to a great start, and we are raising our guidance for organic revenue growth and EPS accordingly. I'll discuss that more in a minute. But before I do, let me start by reviewing our P&L for the first quarter. Gross margins of 61.6% decreased 60 basis points compared to the prior year period. This was primarily due to the disappointing sales in the divested Cynosure business, product and geographic sales mix and the stronger U.S. dollar. Total operating expenses of $289.3 million increased 5.3% in the first quarter or 4.1% if you exclude SSI's expenses. This increase was driven mainly by higher G&A costs associated with our deferred compensation plan, in which the associated liability is mark-to-market, resulting in higher expense. It's important to note, however, that we hedge this exposure. So most of this expense is offset by a benefit below the line in other income. In addition, research and development expenses increased as we continue to balance growth investments with our goal to drive operating leverage. Based on these increases in operating expenses, operating margin of 27.5% decreased 170 basis points. However, given the deferred compensation dynamic that I just discussed and the benefit in other income, it's probably more appropriate to focus on net margins of 19.3%, which increased 40 basis points despite the Cynosure headwind. Overall, our profitability remains very healthy. All of this led to non-GAAP net income of $164.1 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.61, at the top end of our guidance range, despite absorbing the Cynosure loss. Cynosure ended up costing us more than $0.02 in the quarter, net of the fixed overhead cost that, that division absorbed. Before we cover our revised 2020 guidance, I'll quickly touch on a few other financial metrics. Our leverage ratio stood at 2.5x at the end of the first quarter as we used cash to acquire SuperSonic Imagine and buy back shares. We remain comfortable with a leverage ratio between 2.5 and 3x, recognizing that this could fluctuate based on the timing of acquisitions and buyback activity. Moving on, ROIC was 12.3% on a trailing 12-month basis, an increase of 10 basis points over the prior year. Finally, adjusted EBITDA of $261.9 million increased slightly compared to the prior year. Now I'd like to shift gears and discuss our non-GAAP financial guidance for the full year and second quarter. We are updating our full year guidance based on our good first quarter results and to account for the divestiture of Cynosure. At the high -- at a high level, we are raising our organic constant currency revenue guidance as well as our EPS forecast. Let's start with revenue. As a reminder, we previously guided to reported sales of $3.45 billion to $3.5 billion, which represented constant currency growth of between 3% and 4.5%. This original guidance contemplated an equivalent organic growth rate of 3% to 4.5% since the forecast from the acquired SSI business and the divested Blood Screening business basically offset each other. Based on our strong first quarter results in our core businesses, the divestiture of Cynosure and an updated currency headwind of $10 million, we are increasing our organic revenue growth guidance to a range of 4% to 5%. If we meet or exceed the middle of this range, organic revenue growth would accelerate compared to 2019, as Steve said in his introduction. Now let me transition to reported growth guidance for the full year. We now expect revenue of $30 million to $35 million from SSI and $35 million to $40 million from Blood Screening. This helps us build up to a total reported revenue range of $3.238 billion to $3.268 billion. This range equates to constant currency decline of 3.5% to 2.6% or a reported decline of 3.8% to 2.9%. These declines are driven by the absence of Cynosure revenue in the balance of the year. Based on the improved revenue performance in our core businesses, we expect to invest additional resources in future growth. But at the same time, our buyback activities enable us to offset these additional investments while still driving leverage bottom line growth. So despite absorbing the $0.02 Cynosure loss in the first quarter, we are increasing our full year EPS guidance to a range of $2.63 to $2.67 a share, which represents growth between 8.2% and 9.9%. This full updated -- full year updated guidance is based on diluted shares outstanding of 268 million to 269 million for the full year, which reflects progress on our buyback program and an effective tax rate of approximately 21.75%, the same as our original guidance. Now let's turn to guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2020. We expect organic revenue growth of 3.4% to 4.8%. This organic growth, combined with the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, leads to a total revenue range of $770 million to $780 million for the quarter. This equates to constant currency decline of 5.4% to 4.2% and a reported decline of between 5.9% and 4.7%. Again, these declines are due to the absence of Cynosure revenue compared to the prior year period. On the bottom line, we expect EPS of $0.61 to $0.63 in the second quarter. This implies growth rates of between 5.2% and 8.6% continuing to outpace revenue. Let me point out that this EPS range incorporates improved gross margins of 62% to 63% in the second quarter, mainly reflecting benefits from the Cynosure divestiture. I'd also like to point out that while other expenses net were $24.8 million in the first quarter, we expect these expenses to increase by more than $5 million sequentially in the second quarter as we don't forecast the benefits we saw in the first quarter to recur. As you update your forecast, let me remind you that we're raising our guidance materially this quarter, so we would encourage you to model to the middle of our guidance range. It's still early in the year, and we've tried to set realistic ranges that incorporate both potential upsides and downsides. Before we open the call for questions, let me conclude by saying we are pleased with how we started 2020. We feel great about our core businesses and now raising our organic growth rate guidance accordingly. We are encouraged by continued strong commercial execution, the progress in our international franchises, the productivity of our R&D pipeline and the deals we have completed. And we are excited about the opportunity to strategically redeploy capital going forward through division-led business development and share buybacks. Overall, we believe we have multiple levers to deliver healthy organic growth -- revenue growth and EPS growth in 2020. With that, I will ask you to operator to open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, we are ready for the first question. And Patrick, this is Karleen. The only thing I would also add is that it kind of shows such a back-end-loaded revenue in the quarter. Really, this divesture also gives us increased confidence in our forecasting ability and ability to reinvest when we see upside. So I think it's a benefit there though as well. Yes. And I think to the point that Steve made earlier, internationally, is it's a significant piece of the upward take in that guidance. Yes. Clearly, we're really pleased with the Surgical performance and the continued improved performance we've seen over the -- several quarters now. But yes, I would say acceleration is clearly from Surgical and probably Diagnostic as well. Yes. So I would just say that the increase really has to do with the timing of obtaining the controlling interest. So when we originally guided in Q4, we assumed we would not have a controlling interest and therefore, no revenue in the first quarter. So the uptake is really the timing of that controlling interest. And I think it's early days, but the integration is off to a start. And I think, as we've said before, SSI had minimal presence in the U.S., only, I think, 5 reps -- sales reps in the U.S. And so our teams are excited to drop that product into their -- our sophisticated commercial infrastructure here in the U.S. Yes. I think we talked about -- I think the majority of the growth is from share gains, a little less from the -- the new products' contribution is the viral load internationally, which is contributing nicely. But we expect continued double-digit growth, probably maybe not at the rate that we've seen as they come against some of those tougher comps, but feel really good about that business. I'm sorry. We couldn't hear that. Could you repeat that question? Yes. So I think the transactions that we've done to date have been in the Breast Health division because certainly, within Diagnostics and Surgical, there's more than adequate capacity to take on transactions. I think Breast Health has -- still has a very active M&A pipeline. They do have a lot of integration activities. But certainly, we feel that if the right deal came along, we have the ability to make the capacity to do a transaction. Yes. So Dave, let me walk you through how we thought about we'd raise the guidance on the bottom line. So yes, we absorbed the $0.02, additional $0.02 loss. We'd talked about the ASR was about $0.02. Again, there is -- that includes the impact of the stranded costs in the -- from Cynosure because they will bring a piece of our overhead. And then the incremental ASR -- the incremental open share repurchase is less than $0.01 for the full year. So it gets you close to $0.025 at the midpoint. Yes. I mean I think, eventually, that if you think about 3D was originally approved in 2011, but you had that significant uptake in the 2014, 2015 time frame. With the 7-year life, 7 to 9 year life, at some point, there's a replacement cycle there. But I think we've intentionally smoothed out that cycle with the upgrades that we're doing to the field now. Because if you think about our greatest gantry, 3D, 3Dimensions, those features and functionalities are backwards-compatible to the installed base. So really, trying to minimize that pent-up demand in our replacement cycle. So we feel good and really are pleased with the steady approach of placements over the coming years. Yes. So certainly, that's always a focus, to create leverage in an operating margin. And I think, always, we have ongoing programs within the supply chain organization to work on that. And then there's still efforts within the middle of the P&L that we can take. It's an active -- it's an ongoing activity throughout the organization to look for leverage points. Yes. So if you look even at just what we've guided to for Q2, 62% to 63%, compared to where we ended Q1, you can see the midpoint of the 100 basis improvement in the margin profile. So I think that's 50 to 100 basis points is how we're thinking the impact is for Cynosure as we move forward. And I think operating margins certainly will be more than that on the gross margin given that Cynosure was such a heavy OpEx business. Yes, maybe I'll describe it another ways. The majority of that decline was really Cynosure. So if you looked at the base business, gross margins are essentially flat year-over-year. And if we looked at quarterly trending of gross margins in '19, Q1 was our best gross margin quarter. So majority is really Cynosure-related. Yes. Yes. I think we -- what we said is Surgical -- I think Steve just talked about the segment, that we expect Surgical at the high end of that mid-single digit given the Q1 performance. Again, we have contribution from new products coming throughout the continuation of the year. But to your point, we are coming up against higher comps. So that's why we don't -- we're not projecting that 10% for the full year."

            "name": "Stephen MacMillan",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to discuss our strong financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. But before we get into those details, let me start by saying that it's an exciting time for the company and for our shareholders. Now that the divestiture of Cynosure is behind us, we're able to double down on what we do best: helping women and their families live healthier lives through early detection and treatment of disease. Along those lines, at the recent JPMorgan conference, it was exciting to reintroduce ourselves to investors as a unique asset in women's health. Now with a simpler story, minus the overhang of Medical Aesthetics, shareholders can focus on the significant positive changes that have occurred in each of our businesses over the last couple of years. When you do, we think you'll find a company with a broad portfolio of market-leading products for women's health; a company that, over the last 6 years, has grown the top line at mid- single-digit rate and leveraged that into low double-digit growth on the bottom line; a company where each business has strengthened significantly since the first half of 2018, positioning us to drive faster organic revenue growth and better margins in 2020; and a company that is focused on redeploying its strong cash flow more aggressively into growth-accretive tuck-in acquisitions as well as returning cash to our shareholders via stock buybacks. I'm proud to say that for the first time since I joined Hologic, all our domestic divisions as well as our international regions are performing well at the same time, and behind the scenes, that's because our corporate and divisional leadership teams have never been stronger than they are today. With that introduction, let me turn to our first quarter results, which represent our seventh consecutive quarter of solid, consistent performance. Total revenue finished slightly above the high end of our guidance at $850.5 million. This was only 2.8% growth, but it's important to break down the components, as Mike said. He defined organic revenue, which excludes the divested Blood Screening and Medical Aesthetics businesses as well as some earlier-than-expected revenue from SuperSonic Imagine this quarter. So organically, we significantly outperformed expectations, growing 4.6% against our toughest comparable of the year. And this 4.6% compares favorably to our last quarterly guidance, which called for growth of 1.2% to 3%. In terms of the bottom line, we were pleased to hit the high end of our guidance range with EPS of $0.61 in the first quarter, even while absorbing a much worse-than-expected loss from Cynosure. So we are off to a good start in fiscal 2020, with all our divisions and regions showing solid performance. We are particularly excited about our Surgical division, which led the way with 10.2% growth in the quarter; and our Diagnostics business, which outperformed with 6.5% growth, excluding Blood. In terms of geography, domestic sales of $632.7 million increased 1.8% in the first quarter but 3.2% on an organic basis. Outside the United States, sales of $217.8 million increased 6%. But excluding acquisitions and divestitures again, revenue increased 9.2% organically, reflecting the strong foundations we have built for sustainable international growth. Core U.S. sales have grown at a low double-digit rate in each of the last 3 years, and we're well positioned to maintain that pace in the balance of 2020. Now let me provide some more detail on our divisional revenue results. In our biggest division, Breast Health, our core 3D mammography business remains rock solid, and we are building on it with an increasingly diversified product portfolio that spans the continuum of breast health care. As we said at JPMorgan, we have overhauled our sales talent, structure and process to help key account managers sell a growing product portfolio more strategically. And this has led to a more diverse, consistent revenue growth. In the first quarter, underlying trends in Breast Health remained solid. Though consistent with our guidance, growth was slower due to a very difficult prior year comparable when worldwide sales grew more than 13%. Against this, global Breast Health sales totaled $331.1 million this quarter and increased 2.4%. Excluding $6.1 million of sales from SuperSonic Imagine, which was not included in our last guidance, global growth was 0.5%. In terms of geography, domestic Breast Health revenue finished in line with our expectations, with growth of 1.5%. OUS sales increased 5.5% in total but decreased 1.4% without SSI against a very challenging 16.1% comparable in the prior year period. We do expect OUS growth rates to rebound strongly in the balance of the year as the business grows and the comps ease. In terms of the breast subsegments, imaging sales grew 2.4%, benefiting from the SSI revenue I mentioned earlier, while interventional sales increased 2.6%. In imaging, sales of our Genius 3D Mammography systems remain steady driven by our new 3Dimensions and 3D Performance gantries. As we said in San Francisco, we have sold more than 1,000 gantries a year in the United States for each of the last 5 years, a remarkably durable performance that has defied expectations of a rapid drop-off in sales. Not only have we been converting our own 2D units to 3D, we have been gaining a much higher share of competitive conversions than anticipated. This market leadership position provides a solid foundation for divisional growth and a platform onto which we can add new products and strengthen our strategic advantages. In interventional, our first quarter results benefited from strong growth in biopsy disposables as our account managers focus on selling our entire portfolio. However, this was largely offset by a headwind from lower Brevera capital sales, which peaked in the first quarter of 2019 before we began limiting supply. We expect the Brevera headwind to be less onerous in the second and third quarters then flip to a tailwind in the fourth quarter when we begin selling capital again. Our new breast surgery franchise, which consists of the acquired Faxitron and Focal brands plus some legacy Hologic products, also continues to perform very well, with growth in the low teens in the quarter. We're pleased to see our strategic rationale for these division-led tuck-in acquisitions playing out as we accelerate growth by coupling clinically differentiated products with Hologic's commercial infrastructure. And we are equally excited about our acquisition of SuperSonic Imagine, or SSI, during the first quarter. As a reminder, SSI is a French innovator in cart-based ultrasound technology, which is used across the continuum of breast health care. Integration is off to a good start, and we continue to believe that the business will be accretive to our revenue growth rate, albeit with some slight dilution to EPS in the near term. We are especially excited about the opportunity in the United States, where SSI had a very limited sales presence, but will now be able to benefit from our commercial infrastructure and relationships with key customers. Now let's turn to Diagnostics, where we have upgraded our talent and aligned our commercial structure to help lab customers of all sizes grow their business. In the first quarter, total revenue of $311.5 million increased 5.5%. Excluding sales from the divested Blood Screening business, Diagnostics revenue grew 6.5%, an even stronger performance. The growth driver here remains Molecular, where we're placing more Panthers with more assay menu in more countries. This has led to strong increases in consumable sales and consistent revenue growth. In the first quarter, for example, worldwide Molecular sales of $178.5 million grew a robust 9% against a challenging prior year comparable. International Molecular continues to be a standout in both the speed and consistency of growth. OUS Molecular sales increased 22.2%, well into the double digits for the 14th time in 15 quarters. Growth was led by our core women's health tests, our viral load assays, with a growing contribution from HIV in Africa and Panther Fusion.  And in the U.S., although we already enjoy high market shares in key assay categories, Molecular sales still grew 6%. This reflects how we work collaboratively with our customers to drive volumes and better patient care in established markets. Domestic growth was again broad-based as customers consolidated testing on our large installed base of Panther instruments. As we showed at JPMorgan, we have shipped more than 200 Panthers globally in each of the last 5 years, fueling a very consistent, profitable razor-blade business model. In the first quarter, our legacy women's health assays for chlamydia, gonorrhea, HPV and Trichomonas drove the growth, with our new vaginosis test, Panther Fusion, and our viral load assays contributing as well. Moving on, we were also pleased that Cytology & Perinatal sales of $121 million grew by 3.1% in the quarter, admittedly versus a soft prior year comp. Perinatal sales were flat, so the growth came from our Thinprep cytology franchise. Domestic sales were down slightly, consistent with recent trends, but OUS sales grew solidly, in part, reflecting the early phase of Germany's decision to adopt co-testing screening for HPV and PAP as the standard of care to minimize cervical cancer risk. To wrap up Diagnostics, revenue related to our divested Blood Screening business was slightly higher than expected at $12 million but declined by 15.5%. As a reminder, this revenue reflects low-margin products and services under transition agreements with Grifols and is excluded from our organic results. Now let's turn to GYN Surgical, our most profitable division on a percentage basis, where best-in-class products, new leadership, new commercial models and new product launches have been consistently accelerating growth for 2-plus years. In the first quarter specifically, sales of $119.1 million increased 10.2%, our fastest growth in 11 quarters. Surgical growth was driven by 3 main factors. First, core MyoSure continues to perform well, with mid-teens growth in the quarter as we expand the market for fibroid removal while gaining share. Second, although the domestic endometrial ablation market continues to contract, NovaSure is stabilizing thanks to renewed focus by our commercial teams. NovaSure was down low single digits in the quarter, an improvement compared to recent periods. We are pleased with the number of competitive wins we are seeing for NovaSure and ended the first quarter with more NovaSure customers in the United States than we started with. Third, new products are growing rapidly, although they still represent less than 10% of divisional revenue. Our Fluent Fluid Management System is our best-selling new Surgical product thus far, with more innovations emerging from our development efforts. And fourth, although international represents less than 20% of Surgical sales, it is growing rapidly, 19.6% in the first quarter. And we've only scratched the surface of this opportunity. To round out the revenue discussion, Skeletal sales of $23.5 million grew 11.4%, our best performance since the fourth quarter of 2017, based on strong growth of our DEXA systems. We're pleased to see the top college and professional sports teams are adopting DEXA technology for body composition testing and that our products will once again be used to assess football players participating in the NFL draft combine. Before we turn the call over to Karleen, let me just close our Medical Aesthetics chapter by saying that we are pleased to have completed the divestiture at the end of December. Cynosure sales in the first quarter were clearly much weaker than expected across the board. And as I mentioned earlier, the business was a significant drag on profitability as well. In terms of our business development strategy moving ahead, we look forward to pursuing more of the smaller division-led deals that have been working well for us. Net, we feel really good about the businesses we're currently in and don't see a need to add a fourth leg to our strategy given the many opportunities for tuck-ins that leverage our existing commercial channels. So in conclusion, it's an exciting time for the company and our shareholders. We are pleased to report our seventh consecutive quarter of strong execution, with 4.6% organic growth against our toughest comparable of the year. Our Surgical and Molecular Diagnostics businesses stood out this quarter, aided by strong international growth. But Breast Health is also performing well, with a multitude of opportunities still ahead. The efforts we have made over the last few years to strengthen capabilities and accelerate growth are paying off across the company, and we are supplementing these efforts with smart capital deployment that is focused on tuck-in acquisitions and share buybacks. Now let me turn the call over to Karleen. Yes. Patrick, your -- the last part of your question is extra insightful, that in the U.S., there was -- really, the core businesses were not as distracted, but clearly, Karleen, me and Mike, the whole senior management team was. Internationally, to your point, I think what we're really excited about is the international folks being able to really double down on the 3 core businesses because like anything, they were probably spending a disproportionate amount of time and energy dealing with customer issues, service issues, whatever it might be on the Cynosure business. And I will tell you, if you talk to our head of Asia Pac, our head of the European area and then you get into the country leaders and everything else, they, I think, are very excited about the opportunities ahead. And I think we've been making very nice progress in the last few years internationally, but this is probably the best news they can get out of it. And it makes us more excited about the opportunities ahead. There was a bit of both. I think at the -- truthfully, at the start of the year, Cynosure, we thought, was going to grow roughly in line with the rest of the businesses. Now clearly, that did not happen in the first quarter because of the divestiture and the announcement. So it was a pretty ugly quarter. But I think if you really look at it, at the end of the day, the revised guidance upward is also more conviction and confidence in our core businesses. So it's really more about the additional confidence we have in our core businesses. We didn't really see Cyno being a drag. Now probably, it would have been, but it's -- clearly, we feel better and better about each of the 3 other businesses. Yes. We wish it was, but we're still so small in the flu business. If anything, we always -- we're probably still at that stage where it could possibly hurt us a touch as people may give up other visits to their doctors. But I think, overall, awash, but we don't see it being a big benefit to us yet just because we're not as big yet in that space. I would not expect it to be a double-digit growth. I think like all these things in international, sometimes, it's the smaller bases and timing, you get a little capital sale, you get some things like -- having said that, I think we do see it being at least a slightly growing asset outside the U.S. to offset the declines in the U.S. And it's why I think, globally, we feel like Cytology is roughly a flattish business. And international gets a little more growth. It might tweak that slightly better, but I don't think it's necessarily a double-digit grower. We have been placing more Panthers internationally over the recent quarters than we have in the U.S. So I think our ability to continue to sustain that we feel really good about. Brian, I think it's so hard, quite frankly, to really have a great handle on our market shares by segment because there's not great data on a lot of these. I think, anecdotally, from what we just feel, yes, there's still enormous opportunities ahead. And when you look at our relative revenue, under 1/4 of most of our businesses are outside the U.S., where clearly huge opportunities do, again, continue to be playing out not just in the coming quarters, but really, we think we've got a decade's worth of runway here in terms of solid growth before they even catch up to the U.S., probably ultimately the U.S. shares. Sure. There's always the extra R&D projects that will come up even during the course of the year that we'll look at. I think we now have better and better leadership internationally. And so that ability to be thinking about adding some more sales reps behind certain franchises in certain countries, I think those kind of opportunities are the kind that can -- we can redeploy efforts as we go through and then the occasional marketing activities as well. But it's really looked at by franchise, by geography, combination, sales, marketing, R&D. I would remind you, Raj, as you well know, our margins are already pretty good. So a big part of our focus at this point has really been on accelerating that organic growth rate via the investments in R&D, sales, marketing. And we think, overall, it's going to be a pretty good combination, but more on accelerating the sales growth than on huge additional focuses on margins. But again, obviously, we're always working and expect to improve the margins as well. Yes. I think, overall, probably each of our businesses is going to grow solidly in the mid-singles for the year. Breast Health, that will include a little bit of help from SSI, as we said at the start. And then Surgical was probably a little bit at the higher end of that piece; and Diagnostics, pretty much right in the middle. So I think all of that gets to that 4% to 5% organic that we're talking about. Yes. I think, as we always said, especially going against the first 2 quarters where we had these monster comps from a year ago. That's why our initial guidance, if you recall from last quarter, only called for 1.2% to 3.0% organic growth. Hey. There we go. All right. I don't know. We've got a great number on that because, again, just some of the data sources and other stuff. But I think it gets back to we have a lot of runway ahead to consider the size of our Molecular business outside the U.S. relative to inside. Can we easily double and triple it over the longer term where we are today to outside the U.S.? Yes. It's so hard to know that when you start to deal country-by-country and everything else. I think we feel good about the trajectory. And obviously, it sources above."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon and welcome to the Hologic's Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Sara and I am your operator for today's call. This conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce Mike Watts, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, to begin the call. Please go ahead sir.\nMichael Watts: Thank you, Sara. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us for Hologic's fourth quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer; and Ryan Simon, our new Vice President of Investor Relations. Our fourth quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them today. A replay of this call will be archived through December 3rd. Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that certain statements we make today will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor statement included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. One of these non-GAAP measures is organic revenue, which we define as constant currency revenue excluding the divested Blood Screening business and revenue from acquired businesses owned by [indiscernible]. Finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis and revenue growth rates will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO.\nStephen MacMillan: Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to discuss our strong financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Revenue was $1.32 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.61, both figures significantly exceeded our guidance. Since this quarter marks the end of our fiscal year, we want to highlight some annual numbers and themes today. First, the numbers. For the year, total revenue was $5.63 billion, up 47% versus 2020. Non-GAAP EPS was $8.41, more than double the prior year. Some really big numbers and a truly impressive performance that was driven by our COVID test sales, as well as the recovery of our core women's health businesses. Along these lines, if you back out COVID test sales as well as revenue from COVID-related products, such as instruments and collection kits, we grew about 12% in the quarter, a very nice start versus the long-term guidance of 5% to 7% that we introduced in our last call. We believe we are well positioned for success regardless of the future direction of the pandemic. If it drags on, we have shown that we can respond aggressively and generate financial upside. For example, since the beginning of the pandemic, we have provided more than 130 million highly accurate COVID tests to our customers in more than 50 countries. And when the pandemic subsides, we can rely on a base business that has never been stronger or more diversified than it is today. Now let's turn to those annual themes. We want to focus on the strengthening of our major businesses over the last 12 months, as well as 2 very important social initiatives that help improve health access and equality. We're so proud of everything that Hologic has done to help fight the COVID pandemic. And the resulting financial success has made us a significantly stronger company for the future. Our core businesses are more diverse with more growth drivers than ever before. Our R&D pipelines are producing innovative new products and our commercial organizations are fully engaged. And our international business has emerged as a consistent growth driver with passionate teams on the ground who are building relationships and market presence all around the world. On top of all this, we have used the strong cash flow we are generating from COVID test sales to acquire companies that we expect to generate more than $150 million in revenue in 2022. Although these acquisitions are slightly dilutive to near-term EPS, we expect them to accelerate our top line growth rate. Now let's get into the specifics by division. First, in Diagnostics. Our Panther footprint continues to grow as we respond to the pandemic. In our fourth quarter, we placed 167 Panther instruments worldwide and about 650 for the year, well ahead of what we originally forecast. Our Panther installed base currently stands at more than 1,500 in the United States and almost 2,900 worldwide. Remarkably, this represents a 2/3 increase in our total installed base since the end of fiscal 2019, when we had about 1,700 instruments in the field. And looking forward to 2022, we continue to see strong demand for additional placements globally. Utilization of this growing footprint and leveraging our robust portfolio of 19 assays will be key to driving the business forward in a post-COVID world. Toward this end, in 2021, we signed up more new assay business in the U.S. than ever before. While our legacy women's health assays are leading the way, we also expect newer assays to make material contributions. For example, sales of our vaginosis panel almost doubled to nearly $30 million in 2021. We expect significant growth in 2022 as well, which would make this product our most successful diagnostics launch ever, aside from COVID. In addition, we completed the back to back to back acquisitions of Biotheranostics, Diagenode and Mobidiag in 2021, our first diagnostic acquisitions in nearly a decade. These deals are broadening our product offering and customer base and strengthening our R&D capabilities around the world. While still in the early innings, Biotheranostics continues to exceed expectations with sales of more than $16 million in our fourth quarter. In addition, the broad European launch of the Novodiag system represents a meaningful early achievement in our integration process, and we have already secured some encouraging customer wins. We are excited about opportunities to invest in these businesses in the near term and expect them to accelerate our top line growth in the years to come. Second, in Breast and Skeletal Health, we are well positioned for fiscal year 2022 and beyond. Our Genius 3D mammography systems remain the core of our business, and our market share remains very high. Despite COVID pressures, we placed almost 950 3D units in the United States in 2021. We now have a domestic installed base of almost 8,700, which we can build on with new software and hardware upgrades. At the same time, our business is now more balanced than ever as we operate across the entire continuum of breast health care; from screening and diagnosis through surgery and treatment. As a result, we are now less susceptible to the boom and bust cycle of years past and better able to capitalize on opportunities as demand continues to recover from the headwinds created by the pandemic. Third, in our Surgical division, we are executing on our plan to broaden the division from a two-product hysteroscopy business to a more diverse provider focused on the OB/GYN. In fiscal 2021, we broadened our portfolio by having Acessa, a laparoscopic fibroid removal system used to treat larger, more complicated fibroids that MyoSure cannot reach. We are pleased that insurance coverage for the Acessa procedure has steadily expanded. And with this tailwind, we expect to grow Acessa into a third important surgical brand alongside MyoSure and NovaSure. Taking another step forward, we are also very excited about the recent signing of an agreement to purchase Bolder Surgical, which offers additional laparoscopic devices. We expect this deal to close later this calendar year. Bolder offers a portfolio of advanced energy vessel sealing surgical devices currently marketed primarily in the pediatric space. Once the deal is closed, we expect to again leverage our strong customer relationships to grow Bolder sales in the OB/GYN market, which we estimate to be five times the size of the pediatric market. Bolder and Acessa represents solid examples of executing against our tuck-in acquisition strategy, using our strong cash flow to add products that leverage our existing channel strength and accelerate our growth. Fourth, let's discuss our international business, which was growing nicely before COVID, but has become even stronger, thanks to our pandemic contributions. Even excluding COVID, our international revenue has nearly doubled in just five years. And the business is positioned to continue its impressive strength of double-digit core growth. I recently had the pleasure of being with Jan Verstreken's leadership team in Dubai, as they made plans to kick off fiscal 2022. It was inspiring to see the deep talent that Jan has assembled and the passion for women's health that helps them build and strengthen commercial relationships. I saw business benefiting from tremendous leadership and from years of dedication, transitioning from a distribution model to direct on-the-ground commercial expertise. Further, the acquisitions of Diagenode, based in Belgium; Mobidiag based in Finland; and SOMATEX, based in Germany provide tailwinds to our international business going forward. Since the close of each deal, dozens of team members, including technical experts and leadership, have made numerous trips across Europe and across the Atlantic to ensure successful integration of these companies, all while dealing with strict COVID protocols, truly a global collaborative effort that we expect to accelerate growth for years to come. Now, let's shift gears and discuss two groundbreaking social initiatives that we launched this year and that were made possible by our financial success. These efforts represent unique ways that we can extend our purpose, passion and promise even further for the benefit of women's health. First, in May of this year, we launched Project Health Equality, a $20 million initiative to address the structural and cultural barriers that prevent black and Hispanic women in the United States from receiving the same quality healthcare as white women. By teaming up with leading non-profit groups focused on minority health, our goals are to drive culturally competent care, improve public health policy, increase access and ultimately decrease disparities that lead to disproportionate mortality rates for Black and Hispanic women. Second, in September, we released the findings of our inaugural Hologic Global Women\u2019s Health Index. As leaders in diagnostics, we understand the importance of data and know that what we can measure, we can improve. We also know that women's health has been overlooked for centuries. That's why we created the index. The first, to statistically represent the health of 2.5 billion women and girls worldwide. Developed in partnership with Gallup, the Hologic Global Women's Health Index is an unprecedented in-depth examination of critical markers for women's health by country and territory and over time. Notably, 60% of those surveyed, equating to about 1.5 billion women and girls, had not been tested in the last year for four common diseases that affect women's health: cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure and sexually transmitted infections. As we share this kind of data with international leaders and health organizations, our goal is to provide an actionable, science-backed data road map for improving life expectancy and quality of life for women around the world. While we have made a tremendous impact around the world with our innovative products, the Hologic Global Women's Health Index may ultimately prove to be our most important accomplishment for women's health. We hope that sharing a little about these initiatives is helpful to all our investors, but especially those who are focused on ESG issues. We also are pleased to share that we recently received some recognition for our efforts as Investors Business Daily just named us one of their top 100 ESG stocks. Before I turn the call over to Karleen, let me wrap-up by saying that based on the stabilization, growth and diversification of our core businesses. We expect to grow revenue at least in line with our 5% to 7% long-term guidance in 2022. And on top of this, we have the potential for significant financial upside based on our sales of COVID tests. To state the obvious, our success in 2021 and our optimism for 2022 would not be possible without our 6,000-plus employees. I am incredibly proud of them for their continued dedication and resilience. In a year marked by day-to-day, hour-by-hour management of highly variable pandemic demands, Hologic continues to make an enormous impact on humanity. As I visit Hologic sites and talk to employees, the sense of pride, morale and engagement is palpable. The belief in our mission to enable healthier lives everywhere, every day is real. I personally have never been more proud or excited for our organization. As a reflection of our global leadership team's gratitude, in the fourth quarter, we provided all our employees a special onetime cash bonus regardless of function and level. In an environment where finding and developing talent is increasingly challenging, we've strengthened our talent across all levels of the organization with individuals who embody our purpose, passion and promise. To all of you around the world, thank you. Now let me hand our call over to Karleen.\nKarleen Oberton: Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to share our fourth quarter results that significantly exceeded our guidance. In our last earnings call, we said that while we were forecasting conservatively, we were well prepared to generate upside if COVID testing demand increased due to the Delta variant. And that's exactly what happened. Increased COVID test sales in the fourth quarter more than compensated for macro headwinds that have affected many med tech companies recently. Our fourth quarter performance demonstrates that we are in a strong position regardless of how COVID evolves. We benefit from our invaluable testing contributions as the pandemic drags on or from a strong base business when it wanes. In the fourth quarter, revenue and EPS were down compared to the prior year, when COVID-19 testing volumes will be near their peak. Total revenue of $1.32 billion declined almost 3% and 6% organically. But these figures mask the solid recovery of our base businesses. As Steve said, if you back out COVID assay revenue as well as collection kits, instruments and ancillaries that are shared by our COVID and other tests, revenue grew by 12% organically. This growth, which compares favorably to the 5% to 7% long-term guidance we provided last quarter, was driven by resilience across all of our divisions despite utilization pressures from the Delta variant and customer staffing shortages. EPS of $1.61 in the fourth quarter was down 22% compared to the prior year as expected, but earnings exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by about 68%. Underlying this, our cash flow conversion remains tremendous, allowing us to continue pursuing tuck-in M&A and share repurchase, which I'll touch on in a moment. Before I do that, let me provide some detail on our divisional revenue results. To provide a more complete picture of our performance, I will at times compare our results to both 2020 and 2019 as well as exclude the impact of COVID-19 where applicable. In Diagnostics, global revenue of $8 36.8 million declined 11.5% compared to the prior year. However, excluding COVID assay sales and related items, worldwide Diagnostics revenue increased 5%. Although COVID testing revenue declined compared to the prior year, it still far exceeded our expectations as the Delta variant started throughout the quarter. In Q4 2021, we shipped about 21 million COVID tests to customers, generating assay revenue of $443 million globally. Demand in the United States was robust and represented about two-thirds of total COVID assay revenue. This dynamic highlights the breadth of our Panther installed base, our commitment to respond to customer needs, and our flexibility to capture testing demand wherever and whenever it occurs. To better understand the underlying performance of our non-COVID molecular business, I will again exclude COVID assay sales and related ancillary items. If we do this, we see that the base molecular revenue grew about 6.5% organically in the fourth quarter. Compared to the same quarter of 2019, molecular grew about 10%. Rounding out Diagnostics, cytology and perinatal grew 3% compared to the prior year. But compared to 2019, these businesses were down low single-digits as well-women visits have not yet fully recovered from the pandemic. In Breast Health, global revenue of $334.2 million grew 15% as the business rebounded from weak prior year period and showcased its increasing diversity in face of the latest Delta surge. Global breast imaging and interventional businesses increased with imaging growing 12% and the interventional up 27%. Furthermore, our strategy to increase recurring revenue continues to pay off as global service revenue was approximately 40% of the division's total in the quarter, nearly twice as large as global gantry sales. In Surgical, fourth quarter revenue of $122 million grew 21%. This strong performance was driven by MyoSure, which had another impressive quarter, growing in the mid-teens. While surgical procedures were depressed in August and September, the impact was far less than what we experienced at the beginning of the pandemic. In fact, compared to 2019 levels, Surgical was up mid-single-digits. Further, we continue to add products to the bag of our best-in-class sales force. The acquisition of Acessa and agreement to acquire Bolder set us up nicely for fiscal 2022 and beyond. Lastly, in our Small Skeletal business, revenue of $23.6 million increased 26% compared to the prior year period and mid-single-digits compared to 2019. Now, let's move on to the rest of the P&L for the fourth quarter. Gross margin of 69.4% exceeded our forecast, driven by higher-than-expected COVID-19 test volumes in the period. Compared to the prior year, gross margins declined 480 basis points. Total operating expenses of $353.2 million increased 28% in the fourth quarter. The recent acquisitions contributed about a third of this increase. In addition, we deliberately reinvested for future growth with incremental spending in R&D and marketing, spent $9 million on the one-time employee bonus that Steve mentioned, and made a $10 million donation to our charitable fund in the quarter. Finally, our non-GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 21.5%, consistent with prior periods. Putting all this together, operating margin declined 1,120 basis points versus the prior year period, but came in above our forecast at a very healthy 42.5%. Net margin also declined 880 basis points, but was very strong, 31.6%. Non-GAAP net income finished at $415.7 million and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.61, far above the top end of our forecast. Before we cover our 2022 guidance, I'll touch on a few other financial metrics. Cash flow from operations was $465 million in the fourth quarter. This completed our best ever cash flow year as we generated more than $2.3 billion of operating cash in 2021. The strong cash flows continue to give us tremendous financial and strategic flexibility. For example, in the fourth quarter, we agreed to acquire Boulder Surgical for $160 million. And although we did not repurchase any shares in our fourth quarter, we have bought back more than one million shares so far in the first quarter of 2022. Finally, I should mention that we recently refinanced our credit agreement. This further strengthened our balance sheet and financial flexibility by extending the maturity date to 2026, increasing our revolver borrowing capacity to $2 billion and lowering our borrowing costs. Based on our strong operational performance, we had $1.17 billion of cash on our balance sheet at the end of the fourth quarter, and our leverage ratio was 0.6 times. We intend to continue using our cash on division-led tuck-in acquisitions and share repurchases that improve our top and bottom line growth rates. Finally, ROIC was 32.6% and on a trailing 12-month basis, a significant increase of 1,410 basis points. Before we open the call for questions, let me discuss our financial expectations for the first quarter and full year of fiscal 2022. Although the pandemic remains highly unpredictable and we are not immune from the supply chain challenges you've been hearing about, we believe we have good visibility into the recovery of our base businesses as well as a valuable hedge to COVID-19 outbreaks with our testing revenue. In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect strong financial results again with total revenue in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.15 billion. For all of fiscal 2022, we expect total revenue in the range of $3.75 billion to $4 billion, significantly exceeding our pre-pandemic sales. To help with your constant currency modeling, we are assuming foreign exchange headwinds of approximately $2 million in the first quarter of 2022 and $25 million for the full year. In terms of our divisions, we expect Breast and Skeletal Health, Surgical and Core diagnostics, excluding COVID effects, to grow in line with the 5% to 7% guidance we provided last quarter. In Diagnostics, molecular should continue to lead the way based on our larger Panther installed base, uptake of new assays like our vaginosis panel, international expansion opportunities as well as the recent change in chlamydia, gonorrhea screening guidelines that supports opt-out testing. In Breast Health, we have quietly been adding multiple growth drivers through acquisitions and breast conserving surgery, ultrasound and specimen radiography as well as internal development of software and hardware upgrades. Further, we have significant opportunities to expand our 3D installed base and service business internationally. Finally, in Surgical, we expect MyoSure to continue to drive growth but to get help from a broadening portfolio of products such as Fluent and Acessa's ProVu. Boulder is not included in our guidance because the deal has not yet closed. In terms of COVID assay sales, let me remind you that in the last 12 months, we have seen testing demand increase rapidly then decline rapidly, then increase rapidly again. Said another way, demand remains unpredictable and a lot can change between now and the end of our fiscal '22. So we continue to forecast conservatively and strong base business. But we will act aggressively to meet testing demands when and where it arises. With this perspective, we expect COVID assay sales to be at least $200 million in the first quarter of 2022 and at least $300 million for the full year. COVID-related items in Diagnostics are expected to be approximately $45 million in the first quarter and at least $120 million for the full year. Finally, COVID has given us the opportunity to discontinue certain older products in our Diagnostics franchise. We expect a headwind of about $11 million from rationalizing these products in 2022. Let me remind you that our organic guidance backs out acquired revenue until the first full quarter after the deals annualize, as well as revenue from our divested blood screening business. We expect blood screening revenue of $5 million to $6 million in Q1 and $20 million to $25 million for the full year. In total, we are backing out roughly $100 million of inorganic revenue for the year, which means that we expect organic revenue to decline 34% based on lower sales of COVID tests. However, to appreciate the underlying growth of our base women's health franchise, it's important to back out of organic revenue COVID assay sales related ancillary items and the small amount of SKU rationalization that I mentioned. On this measure, we expect revenue in 2022 to be at least in line with the 5% to 7% long-term guidance that we provided last quarter. Moving down the P&L. For the full year, we forecast our gross margin percentage to be between 63% and 65% and our operating margin percentage to be in the low to mid-30s. We expect both percentages to decline sequentially throughout the year since the vast majority of COVID testing revenue will likely be recorded in the first half of 2022. In addition, we have incorporated some inflationary pressure in our supply chain into our guidance. Despite this, for the full year, both growth and operating margins should be better than before the pandemic. In terms of operating expenses, we expect spending to be flat to down slightly versus elevated levels in 2021, even as we absorb cost increases and continue to invest proactively in our acquisitions and our base business to drive future growth. Below operating income, we expect other expenses net to be a little less than $25 million a quarter. Our guidance is based on the tax rate of 21.5% and diluted shares outstanding of around 260 million for the full year. All this nets out to expected EPS of $1.15 to $1.25 in the first quarter and $3.55 to $3.85 for the year. As you update your forecast, let me remind you that macro uncertainty due to the pandemic is still high. We would therefore encourage you to model at the middle of our ranges, which incorporate both potential upsides and downsides. Let me wrap up by saying that Hologic posted a strong end to our fiscal 2021 with the results in our fourth quarter that far exceeded expectations and guidance. With organic investments in multiple acquisitions, we are emerging from the pandemic as a stronger company with core topline growth rates of 5% to 7% and potential upside from COVID. With that, I will ask the operator to open the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up, and then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Brian Weinstein with William Blair.\nBrian Weinstein: Thanks for taking the question. I don't usually believe in public accolades for management team members on these calls. I don't think I've done this very often, but I just want to thank Mike for his work and his friendship over the last 14 or so years that we've worked together, going back to GenPro. Lots of history there. Enjoy your retirement. You've certainly heard it, Mike.\nMichael Watts: Thanks Brian.\nBrian Weinstein: Yes, of course. So, just to think about 2022 for a second, then I also want to ask a bigger macro question. But on 2022, Karleen for you, just want to kind of understand the core operating margin. I wasn't sure if you mentioned it right there at the end. I might have missed it. But if we were to sort of back out COVID-19 from both, let's say, 2021 and 2022, how is that core operating margin expanding? And what does that look like relative to pre-pandemic? Because it looked like on our method, operating margin may actually be coming down on the core a little bit. And I wasn't sure if that was acquisitions or other things that were there. So, can you just address kind of the trend in the quarter?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. So, certainly, acquisitions are dilutive. I think we've talked about at least $0.10 in 2022. I think when we look at the core, we would expect that the operating margin would be at or slightly above where we - prior to the pandemic. I think we've referenced that 31.5% right at Q2 2020 as what to think about on the base business. But certainly, as we move forward, the acquisitions are dilutive. And while we're really pleased about the international growth, that is also dilutive to the operating margin profile. But certainly, our job is to continue to look for opportunities to drive efficiencies.\nBrian Weinstein: And then the inflationary pressures there, they are being offset or are those flowing through as well?\nKarleen Oberton: To some extent, offset, but some of it's dropping to the bottom-line as well. As we always have initiatives to improve cost, but then certainly, those initiatives are at the pace of these headwinds that we're experiencing.\nStephen MacMillan: Brian, the other piece to keep in mind is what we kind of called out as well, with additional charitable contributions, extra employee bonuses. It was our - as you can tell, it was our fiscal year-end. It was a tremendous year, dropping an extra $0.01 or $0.02 to Wall Street at this point on an 8 41 number. It was probably not our top priority versus investing for the future. And you look in total, our R&D spending up significantly over 20% for the year. We really used it to make additional investments for the future.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.\nVijay Kumar: Thanks for taking my question. Steve, maybe on the Q1 on the guidance. Maybe I'll start with the queue. Breast Health, can you just talk about the CapEx environment? It looks like imaging was down Q-on-Q. I'm just curious if there was anything in the queue, whether it was the pandemic impact that had some disruption.\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. Overall, we feel really good. There were clearly some impacts on installations here and there as hospitals hunkered back down a little bit in that August-September period. We continue to feel good about the backlog and feel good about the overall trends within that Breast Health business.\nVijay Kumar: One on the fiscal 2022 guidance, the underlying base is expected to grow 5 to 7, and I want to make sure I have these numbers correct. The total COVID contribution for the year, I think the guidance is contemplating about 420, including 300 of testing and 120 of others. Did I get those numbers right? And Boulder, I'm curious what the contribution from Boulder is, what the revenue run rate is and margin is?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. So you have the 420 is correct, Vijay. There's no contribution from Boulder in the guidance as the deal hasn't closed.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.\nTycho Peterson: First question, I'll stick with the guidance, Steve. Just as we think about Panther placements, do you think about being back to kind of pre-pandemic levels, call it, 190, 200 systems next year? And then, any rough guidance you can give us on pull-through versus the historical 240,000?\nStephen MacMillan: Sure, Tycho. I think we continue to feel really good that we will not see a drop-off relative to historical placements on Panther's. And if anything, we'll probably do a little bit better than the number you just mentioned and therefore, probably a little bit better than even we've been doing the previous years going into it as global demand continues to be great. The average dollars per Panther, it's all over the place right now because, obviously, we have COVID running through a bunch of them. I think the logical expectation is we'd probably be a little bit lower than that 240 number, given the incredible number we've placed. Also, a huge amount of them are outside - if you basically look at it on a base business basis. I think what - with COVID, those numbers are going to continue to be good, but it's hard to predict for the full year, obviously, given where COVID will go. But I think what we love is they're out there, they're placed. We probably take a slight short-term dip on revenue per Panther in the short-term, while that continues to go up as they port our base assays onto those Panthers. So I do think as you're getting to the overall number of Panthers we have placed has got to bode very well. And the other reality is, we're all seeing about labor constraints. Do not underestimate - again, I know you know it, Tycho. But the fact that Panther is such an automated system. And I know there's ongoing questions of, okay, what's going to happen with all these Panthers once COVID runs down? Most of our customers are dying to get our base business on to these and for those labor savings opportunities.\nTycho Peterson: Okay. And then a follow-up on China. There's kind of two dynamics in the market there. There's China 2025, encouraging local competition. And then there's kind of the near-term dynamic around volume-based tenders. Can you maybe just touch on either both of those, and whether you're seeing any impact?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes, I hate to say it, but I think we're a little fortunate in that we're pretty small in China and therefore, are not seeing big impact in the volume-based tenders, probably not coming quite after our categories at this stage in time. But I would tell you truthfully, it's a time I'm glad we're smaller there. We see opportunities to grow there, but we probably have more upside than downside as we look at that part of the world.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research.\nJack Meehan: I wanted to continue on with Panther. It looks like just based on the disclosures, incremental Panthers in the quarter were placed internationally. Then just looking at some of Karleen's commentary around the U.S. versus international mix of the COVID sales. Most of the incremental sales actually came in the U.S., which kind of makes sense, I guess, because of the Delta. I was just curious maybe more broadly, you got thoughts around the international adoption of these Panthers. How much is getting used now for COVID and versus broadening the footprint for other things internationally?\nStephen MacMillan: Sure. I think a lot of it in the near term has still been COVID. And even \u2013 there are a lot of hospitals and a lot of labs that even as they saw - started to see some declines pre-Delta, they were starting to ramp up our base assays and then decided we better stay loose. And so, I would tell you there's probably some Panthers being a little bit underutilized right now internationally because they don't want to start to ramp them up with our tests and then have to stop. So we feel great about that as basically on deck and ready to go as soon as they have the ability. It's one reason why the Panther placements internationally have continued to be very strong because they've gotten the exposure and they want to build up with our tests. So, I think feeling great that there has been - we've even had a number of customers in the United States as well that we're just starting in kind of July to start to ramp down the COVID, ramp up our women's health stuff. And then all of a sudden, time out, we want to keep this capacity for right now on COVID.\nJack Meehan: That makes sense. Then on the Breast Health and the GYN Surgical businesses, they both came in a little below what I was expecting. I was curious if you could call out just what impact you think Delta might have had on the results in the quarter. And as you were thinking about the 2022 guidance, do you just \u2013 do you assume that was the baseline just when you were thinking about the 5% to 7% to grow off of?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. We did kind of view that in the baseline. They were a touch - obviously, as we saw the August, especially September, they had a little bit of an impact. Again, I think there's been way too much overall focus on the short-term ups and downs of COVID and what it does to the base. But I think overall, we feel very, very good about that core and about where we're headed as we come into 2022 on both of those businesses. And as Karleen and I both mentioned, those businesses are more diversified than ever, both product-wise as well as geography-wise. And I think that sets us up well here for 2022 and for the longer term.\nOperator: And next, we'll take a question from Anthony Petrone with Jefferies.\nAnthony Petrone: And I want to congratulate the team on a strong execution for the whole year. And congratulations as well to Mike Watts on your retirement. Good luck on the next phase of the transition. A couple of questions. One on actually the acquisitions, the $34 million of total deal contribution. How much of that was actually Mobidiag? And when we think about a quarterly run rate, I think the timing of Mobidiag was not a full quarter. So, should we be expecting a number perhaps in the $40 million to $45 million range for total quarterly contribution from recently closed deals? And then I'll have one quick follow-up on COVID testing.\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. So Mobidiag was roughly $7 million in the quarter. And so I think as we look to 2022, I think we talked about $150 million plus from all the acquisitions and about half of that is organic.\nAnthony Petrone: Okay, great. And then just on the newly placed Panthers throughout the pandemic, I mean how many of those systems are actually only doing COVID testing exclusively? And at what point do you think they will transition to just broader diagnostic contracts? Thanks again.\nStephen MacMillan: Thank you, Anthony. The reality is we don\u2019t exactly know and track at that level of the Panthers. But what we do know is they've clearly been running, in many cases, not quite flat out, but close to it during the pandemic that all of which creates the opportunity as COVID ramps down for us to really shift over our base business. So, I think that's what makes us so excited about the future of Diagnostics. We had good growth rates going in. Particularly internationally, you've been seeing - we'd had double-digit almost 20% growth in our molecular diagnostics business for the last few years and numbers of quarters as we come out of the pandemic or even as things slow down to a more manageable level, which looks to be hopefully on the horizon here. That creates meaningful opportunity for more and more of our base businesses to really get ramped up there.\nOperator: And Derik De Bruin with Bank of America has our next question.\nDerik De Bruin: Hi, good afternoon and Mike, happy trail. It's been a pleasure. So, just on - just once again, another Panther question, but how much is greenfield versus people just adding on additional molecular testing capabilities versus replacements of - or swap-outs from competitors?\nStephen MacMillan: So you're talking to new customers, completely new customers?\nDerik De Bruin: Completely new customers to - yes, completely new customers to testing that you've not been in the lab before versus people who have been doing molecular tests, who are adding systems or ones just beating out some competitor that's installed?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes, the vast, vast majority, Derik, are customers that we've already been doing business with. When you consider our - just our market shares, as you well know in women's health, we're pretty much in most customers. There are very few customers, certainly in the United States that we're not in. So, it's really expanding their capacities. A few more greenfield outside the United States, which is new customers coming prospecting. But the vast, vast majority across the board really is our core business. Mike, you wanted to add something?\nMichael Watts: Derik, the only thing I might add is we are seeing a lot of customers add on new assays, of course, right? So, customers for our, say, women's health panel today, call it, chlamydia, gonorrhea, HPV, but we're seeing a lot of excitement, in particular, around our vaginosis sale, which we the script as well as Amgen. So that's an existing customer, but they're bringing on a new assay or assays.\nDerik De Bruin: And then just one follow-up. What are you assuming for breast imaging growth in 2022? And on the services component at 40%, is there additional upside to that number?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. I mean, I think the thing about that service is tied to our installed base in that as we even place new gantries. Now sometimes the replacements, they kind of come off a service for you, they have warranty. So, I would expect that the service would probably be a lower end of growth when I think about that division. But certainly, as I said in the prepared remarks, the overall division should be in that 5% to 7%.\nOperator: Next, we'll take a question from Mike Matson with Needham & Company.\nMike Matson: Thanks for taking my question. I guess I want to ask one about the COVID flu combined test that you've launched. So, do you see a scenario where if COVID, maybe we don't have another big wave, but we have kind of a worse flu season that you could still see kind of a benefit from that to that combined test?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. Mike, we're prepared - and when we said we launched it, we've had it cleared now, and it's ready to go for customers. We're still basically hearing from most of our customers. They want straight COVID test. As the months evolve here, do we start to get a bigger spike in that - the flu season? Clearly, I do think that we believe as you go forward this year, and let's face it, probably even next year, most people that are going to get tested for flu are probably going to end up getting tested for COVID as well. So, we will see how it plays out. We're assuming relatively small volumes as it relates to our multiplex test at this point in time until it starts to materialize.\nMike Matson: Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then, I just want to ask about Breast Health outside - can you just maybe give us an update on where things stand with 3D penetration? And because from what I remember, there was a much bigger opportunity there to upgrade customers to 3D and some of the other newer software and things that you've offered - or introduced, sorry.\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. 3D is still very low penetration rates in much of the international markets. And frankly, it's something that we hope the Hologic Global Women's Health Index will actually be able to start to highlight a little bit more, which is many countries outside the U.S. are still only reserving 3D more for diagnostic mammograms as opposed to screening. And frankly, many still don't have great screening programs in general. So we're able, ultimately through the Global Women's Health Index, I think to start to have more discussions about better screening programs, about the need for 3D. And the fact that 3D in many cases is economically advantageous over the longer term, particularly in single-payer systems, where the ability to detect earlier, treat earlier, avoiding all the false positives, the false call - the unneeded callbacks and all of that. So I think we remain very bullish over the longer term. It continues to be something that's going to play out over years, not quarters.\nOperator: Next, we'll take a question from Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley.\nTejas Savant: Just a two-part around COVID to start with. Karleen, can you give us a sense of the impact on how we should think about pricing from the combo test launch? And the OUS mix here seems to have dipped sequentially in favor of the States? And what that means for margins?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. So certainly, from Q3 to Q4 with the Delta variant, we saw an uptick in U.S. testing. About 2/3 were from the U.S. versus last quarter, it was 2/3 OUS. So obviously, that's a little bit more favorable on pricing, so a little more benefit on the margin profile. And then what was the other part of the question?\nTejas Savant: It was on the combo test and - yes.\nKarleen Oberton: So certainly, that pricing would be favorable from the single test. But we've, to Steve's comments, really haven't assumed much related to that at this point given it seems like customers still just want COVID only.\nTejas Savant: And then just a couple of quick ones on the recent deals. On Mobidiag, I mean, given the broader launch in Europe for Novodiag, Steve, how are you thinking about that installed base of 200 units expanding over the next 12 months or so? And then on Boulder, I think you called out sort of 5x higher LAP procedures versus the pediatric setting. So over what time frame do you think you can capture that opportunity?\nStephen MacMillan: Sure. I think we're probably not ready to give exact numbers on Novo, but the initial sale is off to a good start. And we're just loving that acquisition so far. As it relates to Boulder, I think that will be a - clearly a multiyear journey to build up the market of that size. But I think the magic for us with both Acessa and Boulder is, as you know, we've long targeted surgical as an opportunity to put more into those sales force's bags. And I'm really proud of the team, Sean Doherty and Dan Essex more recently running that division and finally starting to make some good deals happen for that business. And the sales forces are excited. And I think it will create a great runway for years to come here in the surgical business.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Patrick Donnelly with Citi.\nPatrick Donnelly: Thanks for taking the question guys. Steve, maybe just on kind of some of the macro uncertainty you talked about. Can you just talk about the different businesses? I know you guys have kind of that internal red light, green light for each segment, each region. Any segments that are maybe coming back a little slower than you expected? It certainly sounds like you're pretty confident on breast. But I just wanted to talk through the different segment recovery time lines and how you thought about those going into '22?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. I think the magic, Patrick, for the first time that I've been with the company, as we look at all 3 franchises and we look both domestically and international. So, if you just play that out in 6 buckets or 9 if you count U.S., international and then worldwide, they're all looking good in that 5% to 7% range, and there's not any major hiccups that are out there. So, I think we feel really, really as good across the board. There will always be a country here or there or a little business and those kinds of things. But overall, it's probably been as solid across the board as we've seen. I think that's part of what really gave us the confidence, frankly, on the last call, we put out the 5% to 7% guidance because there's always been \u2013 there was a little more red lurking in the \u2013 on the horizon there than \u2013 it wasn't as green across the board as it looks now.\nPatrick Donnelly: That's encouraging to hear. And then maybe just on the cash flow. You talked about over $2 billion in the year, another nice quarter here - exactly. And obviously, nice to see you guys buy back 1 million shares already this quarter. How should we think about your M&A appetite? Obviously, you've done a bunch of smaller deals, relatively small. But how should we think about your appetite there, continue with these bolt-ons? Any appetite for anything larger? Just wanted to talk through that.\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. The appetite and the ability are certainly there financially as we look to continue doing tuck-ins. Just because we're generating a bunch of cash, doesn't mean, okay, we're going to start to go bigger, bigger. I can say the bigger things we're also thinking about right now is we're digesting a lot. So, there's also the organizational bandwidth. And right now, our international teams are incredibly busy. Kevin's Diagnostics team and frankly, the Surgical teams are all very, very deep into a lot of integration activity. So, the other factor that would be in our minds is ease of integration. So, if anything, probably a slower pace this year than last year as we really make sure that we optimize what we did last year. And as Karleen has mentioned, we're comfortable, continue to build a little cash here. We're not just going out and spend it because we have it. Karleen, do you want to build on that?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes, certainly. I mean, Patrick, we're going to maintain our discipline as it relates to M&A and make sure that we certainly want to do well on the deals that we've executed so far. So that will be a little bit more of a flux in the focus. But certainly, the division still have their BD teams out there identifying assets and if we find the right opportunity, we'll execute on it.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Max Masucci with Cowen and Company.\nMax Masucci: Hi thanks for taking the questions. I want to extend congratulations to Mike. So, on Bolder Surgical estimated $10 million in calendar 2021 revenues are around 2% to 3% of the annualized surgical revenues in fiscal Q4. So, I know it's a small product line today, but given the multiple on the deal, I'd imagine that the growth is already solid with the potential to accelerate as it's cross-sold into the OB/GYN channel. So, with that in mind, is there any way to think about how quickly Bolder's products could penetrate the OB/GYN channel? Or what percentage of your existing OB/GYN customers would be adopters?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. We'll probably give more of that once we close the deal. We're still obviously in the midst of - we'll probably close at the end of the calendar year and probably be in a better position, Max, honestly, to answer it next quarter. But clearly, it is growing pretty nicely. They've gotten some nice products approved over the course of the last 12 months. And we'll be very helpful in terms of the uptick. But it is - it's a new sale. It's going to take a couple of oftentimes one or two visits. And still, frankly, in some of these COVID constrained world, we want to manage our expectations upfront. We feel really good about the opportunity.\nMax Masucci: Makes sense. And I appreciate the color on Mobidiag. If we just think about the initial pandemic disruption serving as an accelerant for Panther placements globally, are there any parallels to be drawn between what you could see for Novodiag in the decentralized setting in Europe following the launch in early October? And then just curious, the role of the AmpliDiag instrument in the context of also having Panther?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. I think the Novodiag and the launch going on there, I think that's going to be the big opportunity for us as we go into the smaller labs, a broader menu and already feeling really good. Obviously, it's CE marked at this point. It's still a few years away in the United States, but feeling really good to be a nice opportunity to really drive the international business in the nearer term on that and then ultimately a big play in the U.S. over time.\nMichael Watts: Operator, I think we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. And that final question will come from Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG.\nRyan Zimmerman: Thanks for squeezing me in on the end here. I'll just keep it to one. And so, it's for Karleen. Given the COVID assay sales guidance, $200 million in the first quarter, $300 million for the year, let's just assume that, that's kind of how it goes right now. I understand that, that's a very conservative estimate, but it would suggest somewhat of a drop-off in gross margins quite rapidly, Karleen. And so one - following the first quarter, I mean. And one is that the right way to think about it? But then two, how should we be thinking about the gross margin profile kind of net the assay contribution from COVID when we think about a kind of a post-COVID Hologic? Thanks for taking the questions.\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. So certainly, I think we said in our prepared remarks that we would expect margins to come down sequentially throughout the year as the COVID at this point is heavily weighted to the first half of the year. As I look at where we exit the year in 2022, the margins are in the low-60s on the gross margin and low-30s on the operating margin as we had indicated. So - and that assumes a pretty, pretty low COVID contribution as we exit the year as we planned for right now.\nMichael Watts: Thank you, sir. Thanks, everybody.\nStephen MacMillan: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This now conclude the Hologic fourth quarter 2021 conference call. Have a good evening.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Karleen Oberton",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to share our fourth quarter results that significantly exceeded our guidance. In our last earnings call, we said that while we were forecasting conservatively, we were well prepared to generate upside if COVID testing demand increased due to the Delta variant. And that's exactly what happened. Increased COVID test sales in the fourth quarter more than compensated for macro headwinds that have affected many med tech companies recently. Our fourth quarter performance demonstrates that we are in a strong position regardless of how COVID evolves. We benefit from our invaluable testing contributions as the pandemic drags on or from a strong base business when it wanes. In the fourth quarter, revenue and EPS were down compared to the prior year, when COVID-19 testing volumes will be near their peak. Total revenue of $1.32 billion declined almost 3% and 6% organically. But these figures mask the solid recovery of our base businesses. As Steve said, if you back out COVID assay revenue as well as collection kits, instruments and ancillaries that are shared by our COVID and other tests, revenue grew by 12% organically. This growth, which compares favorably to the 5% to 7% long-term guidance we provided last quarter, was driven by resilience across all of our divisions despite utilization pressures from the Delta variant and customer staffing shortages. EPS of $1.61 in the fourth quarter was down 22% compared to the prior year as expected, but earnings exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by about 68%. Underlying this, our cash flow conversion remains tremendous, allowing us to continue pursuing tuck-in M&A and share repurchase, which I'll touch on in a moment. Before I do that, let me provide some detail on our divisional revenue results. To provide a more complete picture of our performance, I will at times compare our results to both 2020 and 2019 as well as exclude the impact of COVID-19 where applicable. In Diagnostics, global revenue of $8 36.8 million declined 11.5% compared to the prior year. However, excluding COVID assay sales and related items, worldwide Diagnostics revenue increased 5%. Although COVID testing revenue declined compared to the prior year, it still far exceeded our expectations as the Delta variant started throughout the quarter. In Q4 2021, we shipped about 21 million COVID tests to customers, generating assay revenue of $443 million globally. Demand in the United States was robust and represented about two-thirds of total COVID assay revenue. This dynamic highlights the breadth of our Panther installed base, our commitment to respond to customer needs, and our flexibility to capture testing demand wherever and whenever it occurs. To better understand the underlying performance of our non-COVID molecular business, I will again exclude COVID assay sales and related ancillary items. If we do this, we see that the base molecular revenue grew about 6.5% organically in the fourth quarter. Compared to the same quarter of 2019, molecular grew about 10%. Rounding out Diagnostics, cytology and perinatal grew 3% compared to the prior year. But compared to 2019, these businesses were down low single-digits as well-women visits have not yet fully recovered from the pandemic. In Breast Health, global revenue of $334.2 million grew 15% as the business rebounded from weak prior year period and showcased its increasing diversity in face of the latest Delta surge. Global breast imaging and interventional businesses increased with imaging growing 12% and the interventional up 27%. Furthermore, our strategy to increase recurring revenue continues to pay off as global service revenue was approximately 40% of the division's total in the quarter, nearly twice as large as global gantry sales. In Surgical, fourth quarter revenue of $122 million grew 21%. This strong performance was driven by MyoSure, which had another impressive quarter, growing in the mid-teens. While surgical procedures were depressed in August and September, the impact was far less than what we experienced at the beginning of the pandemic. In fact, compared to 2019 levels, Surgical was up mid-single-digits. Further, we continue to add products to the bag of our best-in-class sales force. The acquisition of Acessa and agreement to acquire Bolder set us up nicely for fiscal 2022 and beyond. Lastly, in our Small Skeletal business, revenue of $23.6 million increased 26% compared to the prior year period and mid-single-digits compared to 2019. Now, let's move on to the rest of the P&L for the fourth quarter. Gross margin of 69.4% exceeded our forecast, driven by higher-than-expected COVID-19 test volumes in the period. Compared to the prior year, gross margins declined 480 basis points. Total operating expenses of $353.2 million increased 28% in the fourth quarter. The recent acquisitions contributed about a third of this increase. In addition, we deliberately reinvested for future growth with incremental spending in R&D and marketing, spent $9 million on the one-time employee bonus that Steve mentioned, and made a $10 million donation to our charitable fund in the quarter. Finally, our non-GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 21.5%, consistent with prior periods. Putting all this together, operating margin declined 1,120 basis points versus the prior year period, but came in above our forecast at a very healthy 42.5%. Net margin also declined 880 basis points, but was very strong, 31.6%. Non-GAAP net income finished at $415.7 million and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.61, far above the top end of our forecast. Before we cover our 2022 guidance, I'll touch on a few other financial metrics. Cash flow from operations was $465 million in the fourth quarter. This completed our best ever cash flow year as we generated more than $2.3 billion of operating cash in 2021. The strong cash flows continue to give us tremendous financial and strategic flexibility. For example, in the fourth quarter, we agreed to acquire Boulder Surgical for $160 million. And although we did not repurchase any shares in our fourth quarter, we have bought back more than one million shares so far in the first quarter of 2022. Finally, I should mention that we recently refinanced our credit agreement. This further strengthened our balance sheet and financial flexibility by extending the maturity date to 2026, increasing our revolver borrowing capacity to $2 billion and lowering our borrowing costs. Based on our strong operational performance, we had $1.17 billion of cash on our balance sheet at the end of the fourth quarter, and our leverage ratio was 0.6 times. We intend to continue using our cash on division-led tuck-in acquisitions and share repurchases that improve our top and bottom line growth rates. Finally, ROIC was 32.6% and on a trailing 12-month basis, a significant increase of 1,410 basis points. Before we open the call for questions, let me discuss our financial expectations for the first quarter and full year of fiscal 2022. Although the pandemic remains highly unpredictable and we are not immune from the supply chain challenges you've been hearing about, we believe we have good visibility into the recovery of our base businesses as well as a valuable hedge to COVID-19 outbreaks with our testing revenue. In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect strong financial results again with total revenue in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.15 billion. For all of fiscal 2022, we expect total revenue in the range of $3.75 billion to $4 billion, significantly exceeding our pre-pandemic sales. To help with your constant currency modeling, we are assuming foreign exchange headwinds of approximately $2 million in the first quarter of 2022 and $25 million for the full year. In terms of our divisions, we expect Breast and Skeletal Health, Surgical and Core diagnostics, excluding COVID effects, to grow in line with the 5% to 7% guidance we provided last quarter. In Diagnostics, molecular should continue to lead the way based on our larger Panther installed base, uptake of new assays like our vaginosis panel, international expansion opportunities as well as the recent change in chlamydia, gonorrhea screening guidelines that supports opt-out testing. In Breast Health, we have quietly been adding multiple growth drivers through acquisitions and breast conserving surgery, ultrasound and specimen radiography as well as internal development of software and hardware upgrades. Further, we have significant opportunities to expand our 3D installed base and service business internationally. Finally, in Surgical, we expect MyoSure to continue to drive growth but to get help from a broadening portfolio of products such as Fluent and Acessa's ProVu. Boulder is not included in our guidance because the deal has not yet closed. In terms of COVID assay sales, let me remind you that in the last 12 months, we have seen testing demand increase rapidly then decline rapidly, then increase rapidly again. Said another way, demand remains unpredictable and a lot can change between now and the end of our fiscal '22. So we continue to forecast conservatively and strong base business. But we will act aggressively to meet testing demands when and where it arises. With this perspective, we expect COVID assay sales to be at least $200 million in the first quarter of 2022 and at least $300 million for the full year. COVID-related items in Diagnostics are expected to be approximately $45 million in the first quarter and at least $120 million for the full year. Finally, COVID has given us the opportunity to discontinue certain older products in our Diagnostics franchise. We expect a headwind of about $11 million from rationalizing these products in 2022. Let me remind you that our organic guidance backs out acquired revenue until the first full quarter after the deals annualize, as well as revenue from our divested blood screening business. We expect blood screening revenue of $5 million to $6 million in Q1 and $20 million to $25 million for the full year. In total, we are backing out roughly $100 million of inorganic revenue for the year, which means that we expect organic revenue to decline 34% based on lower sales of COVID tests. However, to appreciate the underlying growth of our base women's health franchise, it's important to back out of organic revenue COVID assay sales related ancillary items and the small amount of SKU rationalization that I mentioned. On this measure, we expect revenue in 2022 to be at least in line with the 5% to 7% long-term guidance that we provided last quarter. Moving down the P&L. For the full year, we forecast our gross margin percentage to be between 63% and 65% and our operating margin percentage to be in the low to mid-30s. We expect both percentages to decline sequentially throughout the year since the vast majority of COVID testing revenue will likely be recorded in the first half of 2022. In addition, we have incorporated some inflationary pressure in our supply chain into our guidance. Despite this, for the full year, both growth and operating margins should be better than before the pandemic. In terms of operating expenses, we expect spending to be flat to down slightly versus elevated levels in 2021, even as we absorb cost increases and continue to invest proactively in our acquisitions and our base business to drive future growth. Below operating income, we expect other expenses net to be a little less than $25 million a quarter. Our guidance is based on the tax rate of 21.5% and diluted shares outstanding of around 260 million for the full year. All this nets out to expected EPS of $1.15 to $1.25 in the first quarter and $3.55 to $3.85 for the year. As you update your forecast, let me remind you that macro uncertainty due to the pandemic is still high. We would therefore encourage you to model at the middle of our ranges, which incorporate both potential upsides and downsides. Let me wrap up by saying that Hologic posted a strong end to our fiscal 2021 with the results in our fourth quarter that far exceeded expectations and guidance. With organic investments in multiple acquisitions, we are emerging from the pandemic as a stronger company with core topline growth rates of 5% to 7% and potential upside from COVID. With that, I will ask the operator to open the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up, and then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question. Yes. So, certainly, acquisitions are dilutive. I think we've talked about at least $0.10 in 2022. I think when we look at the core, we would expect that the operating margin would be at or slightly above where we - prior to the pandemic. I think we've referenced that 31.5% right at Q2 2020 as what to think about on the base business. But certainly, as we move forward, the acquisitions are dilutive. And while we're really pleased about the international growth, that is also dilutive to the operating margin profile. But certainly, our job is to continue to look for opportunities to drive efficiencies. To some extent, offset, but some of it's dropping to the bottom-line as well. As we always have initiatives to improve cost, but then certainly, those initiatives are at the pace of these headwinds that we're experiencing. Yes. So you have the 420 is correct, Vijay. There's no contribution from Boulder in the guidance as the deal hasn't closed. Yes. So Mobidiag was roughly $7 million in the quarter. And so I think as we look to 2022, I think we talked about $150 million plus from all the acquisitions and about half of that is organic. Yes. I mean, I think the thing about that service is tied to our installed base in that as we even place new gantries. Now sometimes the replacements, they kind of come off a service for you, they have warranty. So, I would expect that the service would probably be a lower end of growth when I think about that division. But certainly, as I said in the prepared remarks, the overall division should be in that 5% to 7%. Yes. So certainly, from Q3 to Q4 with the Delta variant, we saw an uptick in U.S. testing. About 2/3 were from the U.S. versus last quarter, it was 2/3 OUS. So obviously, that's a little bit more favorable on pricing, so a little more benefit on the margin profile. And then what was the other part of the question? So certainly, that pricing would be favorable from the single test. But we've, to Steve's comments, really haven't assumed much related to that at this point given it seems like customers still just want COVID only. Yes, certainly. I mean, Patrick, we're going to maintain our discipline as it relates to M&A and make sure that we certainly want to do well on the deals that we've executed so far. So that will be a little bit more of a flux in the focus. But certainly, the division still have their BD teams out there identifying assets and if we find the right opportunity, we'll execute on it. Yes. So certainly, I think we said in our prepared remarks that we would expect margins to come down sequentially throughout the year as the COVID at this point is heavily weighted to the first half of the year. As I look at where we exit the year in 2022, the margins are in the low-60s on the gross margin and low-30s on the operating margin as we had indicated. So - and that assumes a pretty, pretty low COVID contribution as we exit the year as we planned for right now."

            "name": "Stephen MacMillan",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to discuss our strong financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Revenue was $1.32 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.61, both figures significantly exceeded our guidance. Since this quarter marks the end of our fiscal year, we want to highlight some annual numbers and themes today. First, the numbers. For the year, total revenue was $5.63 billion, up 47% versus 2020. Non-GAAP EPS was $8.41, more than double the prior year. Some really big numbers and a truly impressive performance that was driven by our COVID test sales, as well as the recovery of our core women's health businesses. Along these lines, if you back out COVID test sales as well as revenue from COVID-related products, such as instruments and collection kits, we grew about 12% in the quarter, a very nice start versus the long-term guidance of 5% to 7% that we introduced in our last call. We believe we are well positioned for success regardless of the future direction of the pandemic. If it drags on, we have shown that we can respond aggressively and generate financial upside. For example, since the beginning of the pandemic, we have provided more than 130 million highly accurate COVID tests to our customers in more than 50 countries. And when the pandemic subsides, we can rely on a base business that has never been stronger or more diversified than it is today. Now let's turn to those annual themes. We want to focus on the strengthening of our major businesses over the last 12 months, as well as 2 very important social initiatives that help improve health access and equality. We're so proud of everything that Hologic has done to help fight the COVID pandemic. And the resulting financial success has made us a significantly stronger company for the future. Our core businesses are more diverse with more growth drivers than ever before. Our R&D pipelines are producing innovative new products and our commercial organizations are fully engaged. And our international business has emerged as a consistent growth driver with passionate teams on the ground who are building relationships and market presence all around the world. On top of all this, we have used the strong cash flow we are generating from COVID test sales to acquire companies that we expect to generate more than $150 million in revenue in 2022. Although these acquisitions are slightly dilutive to near-term EPS, we expect them to accelerate our top line growth rate. Now let's get into the specifics by division. First, in Diagnostics. Our Panther footprint continues to grow as we respond to the pandemic. In our fourth quarter, we placed 167 Panther instruments worldwide and about 650 for the year, well ahead of what we originally forecast. Our Panther installed base currently stands at more than 1,500 in the United States and almost 2,900 worldwide. Remarkably, this represents a 2/3 increase in our total installed base since the end of fiscal 2019, when we had about 1,700 instruments in the field. And looking forward to 2022, we continue to see strong demand for additional placements globally. Utilization of this growing footprint and leveraging our robust portfolio of 19 assays will be key to driving the business forward in a post-COVID world. Toward this end, in 2021, we signed up more new assay business in the U.S. than ever before. While our legacy women's health assays are leading the way, we also expect newer assays to make material contributions. For example, sales of our vaginosis panel almost doubled to nearly $30 million in 2021. We expect significant growth in 2022 as well, which would make this product our most successful diagnostics launch ever, aside from COVID. In addition, we completed the back to back to back acquisitions of Biotheranostics, Diagenode and Mobidiag in 2021, our first diagnostic acquisitions in nearly a decade. These deals are broadening our product offering and customer base and strengthening our R&D capabilities around the world. While still in the early innings, Biotheranostics continues to exceed expectations with sales of more than $16 million in our fourth quarter. In addition, the broad European launch of the Novodiag system represents a meaningful early achievement in our integration process, and we have already secured some encouraging customer wins. We are excited about opportunities to invest in these businesses in the near term and expect them to accelerate our top line growth in the years to come. Second, in Breast and Skeletal Health, we are well positioned for fiscal year 2022 and beyond. Our Genius 3D mammography systems remain the core of our business, and our market share remains very high. Despite COVID pressures, we placed almost 950 3D units in the United States in 2021. We now have a domestic installed base of almost 8,700, which we can build on with new software and hardware upgrades. At the same time, our business is now more balanced than ever as we operate across the entire continuum of breast health care; from screening and diagnosis through surgery and treatment. As a result, we are now less susceptible to the boom and bust cycle of years past and better able to capitalize on opportunities as demand continues to recover from the headwinds created by the pandemic. Third, in our Surgical division, we are executing on our plan to broaden the division from a two-product hysteroscopy business to a more diverse provider focused on the OB/GYN. In fiscal 2021, we broadened our portfolio by having Acessa, a laparoscopic fibroid removal system used to treat larger, more complicated fibroids that MyoSure cannot reach. We are pleased that insurance coverage for the Acessa procedure has steadily expanded. And with this tailwind, we expect to grow Acessa into a third important surgical brand alongside MyoSure and NovaSure. Taking another step forward, we are also very excited about the recent signing of an agreement to purchase Bolder Surgical, which offers additional laparoscopic devices. We expect this deal to close later this calendar year. Bolder offers a portfolio of advanced energy vessel sealing surgical devices currently marketed primarily in the pediatric space. Once the deal is closed, we expect to again leverage our strong customer relationships to grow Bolder sales in the OB/GYN market, which we estimate to be five times the size of the pediatric market. Bolder and Acessa represents solid examples of executing against our tuck-in acquisition strategy, using our strong cash flow to add products that leverage our existing channel strength and accelerate our growth. Fourth, let's discuss our international business, which was growing nicely before COVID, but has become even stronger, thanks to our pandemic contributions. Even excluding COVID, our international revenue has nearly doubled in just five years. And the business is positioned to continue its impressive strength of double-digit core growth. I recently had the pleasure of being with Jan Verstreken's leadership team in Dubai, as they made plans to kick off fiscal 2022. It was inspiring to see the deep talent that Jan has assembled and the passion for women's health that helps them build and strengthen commercial relationships. I saw business benefiting from tremendous leadership and from years of dedication, transitioning from a distribution model to direct on-the-ground commercial expertise. Further, the acquisitions of Diagenode, based in Belgium; Mobidiag based in Finland; and SOMATEX, based in Germany provide tailwinds to our international business going forward. Since the close of each deal, dozens of team members, including technical experts and leadership, have made numerous trips across Europe and across the Atlantic to ensure successful integration of these companies, all while dealing with strict COVID protocols, truly a global collaborative effort that we expect to accelerate growth for years to come. Now, let's shift gears and discuss two groundbreaking social initiatives that we launched this year and that were made possible by our financial success. These efforts represent unique ways that we can extend our purpose, passion and promise even further for the benefit of women's health. First, in May of this year, we launched Project Health Equality, a $20 million initiative to address the structural and cultural barriers that prevent black and Hispanic women in the United States from receiving the same quality healthcare as white women. By teaming up with leading non-profit groups focused on minority health, our goals are to drive culturally competent care, improve public health policy, increase access and ultimately decrease disparities that lead to disproportionate mortality rates for Black and Hispanic women. Second, in September, we released the findings of our inaugural Hologic Global Women's Health Index. As leaders in diagnostics, we understand the importance of data and know that what we can measure, we can improve. We also know that women's health has been overlooked for centuries. That's why we created the index. The first, to statistically represent the health of 2.5 billion women and girls worldwide. Developed in partnership with Gallup, the Hologic Global Women's Health Index is an unprecedented in-depth examination of critical markers for women's health by country and territory and over time. Notably, 60% of those surveyed, equating to about 1.5 billion women and girls, had not been tested in the last year for four common diseases that affect women's health: cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure and sexually transmitted infections. As we share this kind of data with international leaders and health organizations, our goal is to provide an actionable, science-backed data road map for improving life expectancy and quality of life for women around the world. While we have made a tremendous impact around the world with our innovative products, the Hologic Global Women's Health Index may ultimately prove to be our most important accomplishment for women's health. We hope that sharing a little about these initiatives is helpful to all our investors, but especially those who are focused on ESG issues. We also are pleased to share that we recently received some recognition for our efforts as Investors Business Daily just named us one of their top 100 ESG stocks. Before I turn the call over to Karleen, let me wrap-up by saying that based on the stabilization, growth and diversification of our core businesses. We expect to grow revenue at least in line with our 5% to 7% long-term guidance in 2022. And on top of this, we have the potential for significant financial upside based on our sales of COVID tests. To state the obvious, our success in 2021 and our optimism for 2022 would not be possible without our 6,000-plus employees. I am incredibly proud of them for their continued dedication and resilience. In a year marked by day-to-day, hour-by-hour management of highly variable pandemic demands, Hologic continues to make an enormous impact on humanity. As I visit Hologic sites and talk to employees, the sense of pride, morale and engagement is palpable. The belief in our mission to enable healthier lives everywhere, every day is real. I personally have never been more proud or excited for our organization. As a reflection of our global leadership team's gratitude, in the fourth quarter, we provided all our employees a special onetime cash bonus regardless of function and level. In an environment where finding and developing talent is increasingly challenging, we've strengthened our talent across all levels of the organization with individuals who embody our purpose, passion and promise. To all of you around the world, thank you. Now let me hand our call over to Karleen. Brian, the other piece to keep in mind is what we kind of called out as well, with additional charitable contributions, extra employee bonuses. It was our - as you can tell, it was our fiscal year-end. It was a tremendous year, dropping an extra $0.01 or $0.02 to Wall Street at this point on an 8 41 number. It was probably not our top priority versus investing for the future. And you look in total, our R&D spending up significantly over 20% for the year. We really used it to make additional investments for the future. Yes. Overall, we feel really good. There were clearly some impacts on installations here and there as hospitals hunkered back down a little bit in that August-September period. We continue to feel good about the backlog and feel good about the overall trends within that Breast Health business. Sure, Tycho. I think we continue to feel really good that we will not see a drop-off relative to historical placements on Panther's. And if anything, we'll probably do a little bit better than the number you just mentioned and therefore, probably a little bit better than even we've been doing the previous years going into it as global demand continues to be great. The average dollars per Panther, it's all over the place right now because, obviously, we have COVID running through a bunch of them. I think the logical expectation is we'd probably be a little bit lower than that 240 number, given the incredible number we've placed. Also, a huge amount of them are outside - if you basically look at it on a base business basis. I think what - with COVID, those numbers are going to continue to be good, but it's hard to predict for the full year, obviously, given where COVID will go. But I think what we love is they're out there, they're placed. We probably take a slight short-term dip on revenue per Panther in the short-term, while that continues to go up as they port our base assays onto those Panthers. So I do think as you're getting to the overall number of Panthers we have placed has got to bode very well. And the other reality is, we're all seeing about labor constraints. Do not underestimate - again, I know you know it, Tycho. But the fact that Panther is such an automated system. And I know there's ongoing questions of, okay, what's going to happen with all these Panthers once COVID runs down? Most of our customers are dying to get our base business on to these and for those labor savings opportunities. Yes, I hate to say it, but I think we're a little fortunate in that we're pretty small in China and therefore, are not seeing big impact in the volume-based tenders, probably not coming quite after our categories at this stage in time. But I would tell you truthfully, it's a time I'm glad we're smaller there. We see opportunities to grow there, but we probably have more upside than downside as we look at that part of the world. Sure. I think a lot of it in the near term has still been COVID. And even \u2013 there are a lot of hospitals and a lot of labs that even as they saw - started to see some declines pre-Delta, they were starting to ramp up our base assays and then decided we better stay loose. And so, I would tell you there's probably some Panthers being a little bit underutilized right now internationally because they don't want to start to ramp them up with our tests and then have to stop. So we feel great about that as basically on deck and ready to go as soon as they have the ability. It's one reason why the Panther placements internationally have continued to be very strong because they've gotten the exposure and they want to build up with our tests. So, I think feeling great that there has been - we've even had a number of customers in the United States as well that we're just starting in kind of July to start to ramp down the COVID, ramp up our women's health stuff. And then all of a sudden, time out, we want to keep this capacity for right now on COVID. Yes. We did kind of view that in the baseline. They were a touch - obviously, as we saw the August, especially September, they had a little bit of an impact. Again, I think there's been way too much overall focus on the short-term ups and downs of COVID and what it does to the base. But I think overall, we feel very, very good about that core and about where we're headed as we come into 2022 on both of those businesses. And as Karleen and I both mentioned, those businesses are more diversified than ever, both product-wise as well as geography-wise. And I think that sets us up well here for 2022 and for the longer term. Thank you, Anthony. The reality is we don't exactly know and track at that level of the Panthers. But what we do know is they've clearly been running, in many cases, not quite flat out, but close to it during the pandemic that all of which creates the opportunity as COVID ramps down for us to really shift over our base business. So, I think that's what makes us so excited about the future of Diagnostics. We had good growth rates going in. Particularly internationally, you've been seeing - we'd had double-digit almost 20% growth in our molecular diagnostics business for the last few years and numbers of quarters as we come out of the pandemic or even as things slow down to a more manageable level, which looks to be hopefully on the horizon here. That creates meaningful opportunity for more and more of our base businesses to really get ramped up there. So you're talking to new customers, completely new customers? Yes, the vast, vast majority, Derik, are customers that we've already been doing business with. When you consider our - just our market shares, as you well know in women's health, we're pretty much in most customers. There are very few customers, certainly in the United States that we're not in. So, it's really expanding their capacities. A few more greenfield outside the United States, which is new customers coming prospecting. But the vast, vast majority across the board really is our core business. Mike, you wanted to add something? Yes. Mike, we're prepared - and when we said we launched it, we've had it cleared now, and it's ready to go for customers. We're still basically hearing from most of our customers. They want straight COVID test. As the months evolve here, do we start to get a bigger spike in that - the flu season? Clearly, I do think that we believe as you go forward this year, and let's face it, probably even next year, most people that are going to get tested for flu are probably going to end up getting tested for COVID as well. So, we will see how it plays out. We're assuming relatively small volumes as it relates to our multiplex test at this point in time until it starts to materialize. Yes. 3D is still very low penetration rates in much of the international markets. And frankly, it's something that we hope the Hologic Global Women's Health Index will actually be able to start to highlight a little bit more, which is many countries outside the U.S. are still only reserving 3D more for diagnostic mammograms as opposed to screening. And frankly, many still don't have great screening programs in general. So we're able, ultimately through the Global Women's Health Index, I think to start to have more discussions about better screening programs, about the need for 3D. And the fact that 3D in many cases is economically advantageous over the longer term, particularly in single-payer systems, where the ability to detect earlier, treat earlier, avoiding all the false positives, the false call - the unneeded callbacks and all of that. So I think we remain very bullish over the longer term. It continues to be something that's going to play out over years, not quarters. Sure. I think we're probably not ready to give exact numbers on Novo, but the initial sale is off to a good start. And we're just loving that acquisition so far. As it relates to Boulder, I think that will be a - clearly a multiyear journey to build up the market of that size. But I think the magic for us with both Acessa and Boulder is, as you know, we've long targeted surgical as an opportunity to put more into those sales force's bags. And I'm really proud of the team, Sean Doherty and Dan Essex more recently running that division and finally starting to make some good deals happen for that business. And the sales forces are excited. And I think it will create a great runway for years to come here in the surgical business. Yes. I think the magic, Patrick, for the first time that I've been with the company, as we look at all 3 franchises and we look both domestically and international. So, if you just play that out in 6 buckets or 9 if you count U.S., international and then worldwide, they're all looking good in that 5% to 7% range, and there's not any major hiccups that are out there. So, I think we feel really, really as good across the board. There will always be a country here or there or a little business and those kinds of things. But overall, it's probably been as solid across the board as we've seen. I think that's part of what really gave us the confidence, frankly, on the last call, we put out the 5% to 7% guidance because there's always been \u2013 there was a little more red lurking in the \u2013 on the horizon there than \u2013 it wasn't as green across the board as it looks now. Yes. The appetite and the ability are certainly there financially as we look to continue doing tuck-ins. Just because we're generating a bunch of cash, doesn't mean, okay, we're going to start to go bigger, bigger. I can say the bigger things we're also thinking about right now is we're digesting a lot. So, there's also the organizational bandwidth. And right now, our international teams are incredibly busy. Kevin's Diagnostics team and frankly, the Surgical teams are all very, very deep into a lot of integration activity. So, the other factor that would be in our minds is ease of integration. So, if anything, probably a slower pace this year than last year as we really make sure that we optimize what we did last year. And as Karleen has mentioned, we're comfortable, continue to build a little cash here. We're not just going out and spend it because we have it. Karleen, do you want to build on that? Yes. We'll probably give more of that once we close the deal. We're still obviously in the midst of - we'll probably close at the end of the calendar year and probably be in a better position, Max, honestly, to answer it next quarter. But clearly, it is growing pretty nicely. They've gotten some nice products approved over the course of the last 12 months. And we'll be very helpful in terms of the uptick. But it is - it's a new sale. It's going to take a couple of oftentimes one or two visits. And still, frankly, in some of these COVID constrained world, we want to manage our expectations upfront. We feel really good about the opportunity. Yes. I think the Novodiag and the launch going on there, I think that's going to be the big opportunity for us as we go into the smaller labs, a broader menu and already feeling really good. Obviously, it's CE marked at this point. It's still a few years away in the United States, but feeling really good to be a nice opportunity to really drive the international business in the nearer term on that and then ultimately a big play in the U.S. over time. Thank you."

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Mike Watts, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, to begin the call.\nMichael Watts: Thank you, Kathy. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us for Hologic\u2019s third quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the Company\u2019s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer. Our third quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. Finally, a replay of this call will be archived through August 27th. Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that certain statements we make today will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those are referenced in the Safe Harbor statements that's included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. One of these non-GAAP measures is organic revenue which we define as constant currency revenue excluding the divested Blood Screening business as well as year one revenue from acquired businesses currently Acessa, Biotheranostics, Diagenode and Mobidiag. Finally, any percentage changes that we discuss today will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic\u2019s CEO.\nStephen MacMillan: Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to discuss our financial performance for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. We posted excellent results overall, driven by strong rebound in our base businesses and continued contributions to fight the ongoing COVID pandemic. Total revenue was $1.17 billion, up 38% and non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.33 up 77%. We significantly exceeded our guidance on both the top and bottom lines. Our revenue outperformance was broad based in the quarter. Our Breast and Surgical divisions both grew substantially versus the prior year period when results were negatively affected by the pandemic. And importantly, both businesses also grew compared to the same period of 2019. Our Diagnostics division grew about 20% compared to last year, despite lower sales of COVID tests and increased compared to 2019 as well. Karleen will review our full financial results today, but before she does, I want to take a step back and provide some perspective on where Hologic is headed over the longer term, as many of you have requested. As mentioned in our last call, we have been working through our annual strategic planning process, and based on this, I've never been more excited about our future and the global impact we are making by pursuing our purpose, passion and promise. We know this is important to all our investors and especially those focused on ESG priorities. Hologic is clearly emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic as a stronger, faster growing company. We have a much higher profile on the global stage, which has helped create a stronger and more durable foundation to accelerate our international growth. And we have placed hundreds of new Panther instruments, which is boosting our razor and razor blade business model. From a financial perspective, we have generated more than $2.5 billion dollars of operating cash in just the last five quarters. During this time, we have used about $1.35 billion to buy six companies and about $510 million to buy back our own stock. In Diagnostics alone, we have added two new growth platforms in Biotheranostics and Mobidiag and substantially increased our assay development capabilities with Diagenode. Based on all this progress, we are now targeting organic revenue growth rates of between 5% and 7% in our base businesses between now and 2025. This excludes sales of COVID assays and related ancillaries, which we expect to decline over our strat plan horizon. Now we'd like to discuss how we expect this to play out in our three divisions. This is more detail than we typically provide in a quarterly call, but it's important to underpin the enthusiasm we have for our future. First, in Diagnostics, we are diversifying our customer base, installing more Panther instruments, continuously adding new assay menu and driving testing demand. Our foundation in diagnostics remains rock solid with leading U.S. market positions for our ThinPrep Pap Test and our key women's health assays on the Panther instrument, namely chlamydia and gonorrhea, HPV and Trichomonas. As leaders in these categories, we have built strong partnerships with many of our largest lab customers that enable us to educate physicians about testing guidelines issued by groups like the CDC. Just last week in fact, the CDC posted new recommendations that are very positive for public health and for our business. So while our market shares are already very high, we are driving growth by expanding addressable markets. In addition, we have developed related women's health tests that are often performed from the same patient's sample, such as our vaginosis panel and our test for mycoplasma genitalium. Finally, we see significant opportunities to increase sales of other products where our market shares are much lower today. Our response to the COVID pandemic has unquestionably enabled us to accelerate these growth strategies. We have grown from a successful niche player in STI testing into a much more diversified industry leader with a broader customer base. We have done this by dramatically increasing placements of Panther instruments. Since the start of the pandemic, we have increased our global installed base by more than 50% or in real numbers by almost 1000 Panthers. We now have about 1500 Panthers in the United States and more than 1200 in other countries, and we are well diversified across customer sizes and types, and as COVID testing wanes customers are beginning to use these instruments to run more non-COVID assays. This is a significant opportunity, because today about half our customers from the largest reference labs to smaller hospitals run three tests or fewer on their Panther instruments, even though we now have 19 total assays available. We are capitalizing on this opportunity by signing up record levels of new business, as reflected in the test of record, or TORs metric that we have discussed. Pre-COVID, our best year for TORs was a little more than $20 million. Last fiscal year, we set a new record with about $35 million of new business and we are on track to comfortably exceed that number in 2021. Outside the United States, where Hologic Diagnostics has been less well-known historically, COVID has materially elevated our profile. Since the pandemic began, about a third of our COVID assay sales have been generated internationally and the relationships we have established will help us win business and drive future growth. Finally, the strong cash flow we've generated from COVID sales has enabled us to complete three recent acquisitions in Diagnostics, that together are expected to contribute more than $100 million of annual revenue, as well as providing new growth platforms that increase our top line growth rate. First, Biotheranostics enables us to enter the lab-based oncology space, a long time area of interest that has been growing rapidly. Biotheranostics is off to an excellent start with about $13 million of revenue in the third quarter, more than 30% higher than their best quarter prior to the pandemic. Second, Diagenode will help us add PCR-based menu to our Panther Fusion instrument, both in Europe and the United States. And third, the acquisition of Mobidiag enables us to enter the rapidly growing market for acute care, near-patient testing, which we have been monitoring for years. We believe the Novodiag instrument provides the right combination of ease-of-use, rapid turnaround, and low manufacturing cost to expand in the smaller hospitals and create a multi-hundred million dollar product line over time. Now let's shift gears and discuss our Breast and Skeletal Health division, where revenue growth is becoming more diversified, more recurring, more global, and more consistent than ever before. Similar to Diagnostics, our strategic plan is built on a foundation of strength. We are the leaders in breast health based on our long history of innovation, partnership with customers, and focus across the continuum of breast care. Our strategy is built around innovative market-leading Genius 3D Mammography platform. Like all our key products, our Genius exam is making a real difference in women's lives. They detect more dangerous cancers while reducing unnecessary callbacks. A few years ago, many investor questions focused on whether we could overcome the 3D cliff [ph] that was thought to be inevitable once the market converted to 3D. We don\u2019t get that question much anymore, because we have leveraged our leadership in 3D to creating much more diversified business with more consistent steady revenue growth. In fact, in the third quarter, U.S. gantry sales represented less than 20% of global breast health revenue. We have accomplished this in four ways. First, we've expanded our service business. If we think of breast health service as a single product, it would be the company's second largest with more than $500 million of global revenue over the last four quarters. While we don't expect this to grow dramatically over our strategic planning horizon, service will continue to underpin our financial results and be the cornerstone of the tight relationships we have with our customers. Second, we have beefed up our R&D capabilities beyond our traditional focus on x-ray imaging. We have developed new software packages like Clarity HD, which provides the industry's fastest highest resolution images. We have introduced new tools like Genius AI detection, a deep learning based software that helps radiologists detect subtle potential cancers. And we pioneered Brevera to fully integrate the biopsy procedure with specimen radiography for the first time. Brevera alone is now generating about $40 million of annual revenue, and we expect all these new products to drive growth over our strategic strat plan horizon. Third, we acquired four companies since 2018 to broaden our product portfolio, expand across the continuum of breast health care and become the partner of choice for all our customers breast health needs. These acquisitions include Faxitron, which bolstered our offerings in specimen radiography, and Focal which moved us further into breast conserving surgery, and SuperSonic Imagine, which strengthened our position in ultrasound, and SOMATEX, which increased innovation in breast biopsy markers. In aggregate, these deals are now adding about $90 million annually to breast health revenue and are important contributors to growth in our strategic plan. And fourth, we are expanding internationally in breast health. Our focus is to continue gaining market share with our existing 3D and upgradable 2D mammography products, the same products that have established leadership positions in the United States. We are also bringing the new products I've discussed, both internally developed and acquired to additional countries. And we've purchased distributors in Germany, Spain and other markets to get closer to customers and secure more service revenue. Now let's turn to our GYN Surgical Division. Surgical with our fastest growing division before the pandemic and our strategic plan assumes that surgical will continue its momentum through 2025. We have a unique opportunity to leverage our strength in the OB/GYN channel to provide differentiated solutions throughout women's lives. While today our products mainly help middle-aged women, in the future we plan to have a stronger presence among mothers-to-be and older women as we expand our offerings within the hysteroscopic, laparoscopic, and pelvic health markets. Within Surgical, MyoSure remains the world's leading hysteroscopic product to remove smaller, less complicated fibroids. Since July is fibroid awareness month, you've probably seen many articles describing the huge number of women who are affected by fibroids and the way they often suffer in silence or undergo invasive procedures such as hysterectomies. It's clear that this market remains large and underpenetrated and that after many years of exceptional growth, MyoSure still has plenty of room to run. We are also very excited about Acessa, which we acquired in 2020 and is laparoscopic fibroid treatment system. Acessa is a perfect complement to MyoSure as the system is used to treat larger, more complicated fibroids that MyoSure can't reach. Importantly, the same OB/GYNs who rely on MyoSure, have the potential to use Acessa, so it's a great fit for our sales force. We recently received two pieces of good news on Acessa that its now included in ACOG's updated fibroid management guidance and Cigna's list of medically necessary procedures. These are important milestones on our road to creating another $100 million dollar plus surgical brand alongside MyoSure and NovaSure. Another reason we feel confident in Surgical's future is the revitalization of our R&D pipeline. A few years ago, the division was basically a two-product show. Today, however, we sell multiple versions of these products, as well as new fluid management system, hysteroscopes and other GYN surgical tools and we have a robust pipeline of new products in development. Finally, based on the strengthening of our global commercial capabilities, we now have many opportunities to deliver our less invasive surgical solutions to women around the world, since less than 20% of the divisions revenue is generated outside the United States today. Before I turn the call over to Karleen, let me wrap up by saying that to me, Hologic looks like a fundamentally different company today than just 18 months ago, before the pandemic. We have three franchises growing faster than they ever have. We are growing in all major regions of the world. We have added multiple new growth drivers in all our divisions, and with our COVID tests we have a significant new product line to provide upside to a strong base. Taken together, we are excited for the future and confident that we will grow our base, non-COVID business between 5% and 7% over the next several years. Now let me hand the call over to Karleen.\nKarleen Oberton: Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon everyone. As Steve said, our third quarter results exceeded expectations as revenue and EPS grew significantly compared to the prior year. Revenue of $1.17 billion increased 38%. Organically revenue grew 34%, driven by continued sequential improvement in our base businesses in a meaningful contribution from global COVID testing revenue. We exceeded our top and bottom line guidance with upside in both our base and COVID. We also significantly improved profitability compared to the prior year period. As a result, EPS of $1.33 in the third quarter increased 77%. Further, operating cash flow remained robust, allowing us to execute on our capital allocation strategy, which I'll discuss more in a moment. Before I do that, let me provide some detail on our divisional revenue results. Providing more complete picture of our performance, I will often compare our results to the third quarters of both 2020 and 2019. In Diagnostics, global revenue of $665.5 million grew an impressive 20% compared to the prior year period based on higher than expected COVID sales and the strength of our core molecular franchise. Within Diagnostics, molecular diagnostics increased 11.9% globally as massive growth internationally more than offset the decline in U.S. COVID sales. Although COVID testing revenue declined, it still exceeded our most recent guidance. Specifically, we shipped about 14 million COVID tests to customers, generating assay revenue of $291 million globally. About two thirds of COVID assay revenue was generated outside the United States in the quarter, reflecting the broader global footprint that Steve discussed. To better understand the underlying performance of our non-COVID businesses, let me remind you that the pandemic has also increased sales of collection kits, instruments and ancillaries that are used with our COVID tests. Backing this revenue out of the current and prior year periods provides a better picture of true underlying trends. If we do this, we see that base molecular revenue in total Diagnostics sales grew about 76% organically in the third quarter. Compared to the same quarter of 2019, molecular grew in the mid teens and total Diagnostics grew mid single digits. Rounding out Diagnostics, our Cytology & Perinatal businesses grew 75% compared to the prior year, but compared to 2019 these businesses were still slightly behind their pre-pandemic levels. In Breast Health, global revenue of $349 million grew 53% and exceptional results as the franchise continues to gain momentum. As evidence of this, revenues have now increased sequentially and compared to 2019 for the last three quarters. The division's strong performance remains well rounded, reflecting our commitment to diversifying revenue streams as Steve discussed. Both breast imaging and interventional businesses increased compared to the prior year period with imaging growing 43% and interventional increasing 120%. Although we remain encouraged by continued improvement in the capital environment, capital is still not quite back to the 2019 levels. However, breast screening rates continued to improve and with the healthy backlog we are encouraged about continued recovery over the next few quarters. In Surgical, third quarter revenue of $127.9 million to 143%, while also exceeding 2019 levels by low double digits. Surgical's strong performance has been driven by normalizing procedure volumes, MyoSure and new products in the hands of our exceptional sales force. Lastly in Skeletal, revenue of $25.9 million, increased 66% compared to the prior year period. It was also up low single digits compared to 2019. Overall, in terms of geography, domestic sales of $749.9 million increased almost 14%. On an organic basis, U.S. revenue was up 10%. Outside the United States, sales of $418.4 million increased 137%. Organically sales Outside the U.S. grew 131% a tremendous result. Now let's move on to the rest of the P&L for the third quarter. Gross margin of 66.1% increased 140 basis points, driven by volume recovery in our base businesses, and a nice contribution from sales of our COVID tests. Continuing down the P&L, total operating expenses of $310.1 million, increased 19% in the third quarter. Excluding expenses from our recent acquisitions, operating expenses would have increased about 11% as we reinvested for our future growth incremental spending in R&D and marketing. In addition, remember that given uncertainties associated with the pandemic, we cut back on spending in our third quarter of 2020. Out non-GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 21.5%, driven by a favorable geographic income mix, mainly sales of COVID tests outside the United States. Putting this altogether, operating margin increased 650 basis points to 39.5% and net margin increased 580 basis points to 29.5%. As a result, non-GAAP net income finished at $344.8 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.33 exceeding the top end of our guidance. Before we cover our fourth quarter guidance, I'll quickly touch on few other financial metrics. Driven by a strong performance of our base businesses, as well as the contribution from COVID testing, cash flow from operations were $663 million in the third quarter. This was nearly double our non-GAAP net income, highlighting excellent cash conversion. These strong cash flows continue to give us tremendous financial and strategic flexibility. For example, in the third quarter we closed the acquisition of Mobidiag for an enterprise value of $808 million, and also repurchased 3 million shares of stock for $188 million. Overall, we had $828 million of cash at the end of the third quarter, and our leverage ratio was 0.7 times. We intend to continue using our cash on division-led, tuck-in acquisitions and share repurchases that improve our top and bottom -line growth rates. Finally, ROIC was 34.7% on a trailing 12-month basis, a significant increase of 2,190 basis points. Before we open the call for questions, let me discuss our expectations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and provide a few comments on longer-term targets. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we expect strong financial results again, with total revenue in the range of $1 billion to $1.04 billion, representing constant currency decline of 27% to 24% versus the prior year period, which benefited from huge COVID assay sales. For perspective, in the fourth quarter of 2019, we generated less than $800 million of revenue excluding the divested Cynosure business, so we expect to grow significantly above pre-pandemic levels. In our base businesses, we expect continued momentum and recovery to generate very strong growth rates compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, given the negative impact of the pandemic a year ago and we expect these franchises to grow nicely compared to 2019 as well. In terms of COVID assay sales, the U.S. testing market continues to decline as we forecasted last quarter, and we expect this trend to continue as more people are vaccinated. In addition, summer vacations may further reduce demand domestically and in Europe. With these factors in mind, we expect COVID assay sales to range from $150 to $170 million in the fourth quarter. In addition, COVID related items in Diagnostics are expected to be approximately $30 million in the fourth quarter, down roughly $20 million sequentially. If new variants drive demand that exceeds our current expectations, we are well-prepared to deliver for our customers and generate upside to our estimates. Our fourth quarter guidance includes approximately $35 million of acquired revenue from Mobidiag, Biotheranostics, Diagenode and Acessa. Backing this out, as well as $9 million of expected Blood Screening revenue, we expect organic revenue to decline 30% to 27%. But excluding COVID assay sales and related revenue, we forecast organic revenue to grow low-to-mid-teens in the fourth quarter. Below operating income, I would point out that we expect other expenses, net, to increase to about $25 million in the fourth quarter. Our guidance is based on a tax rate of 21.5%, and diluted shares outstanding of $260 million for the quarter. All this nets out to expected EPS of $0.92 to $1 in the fourth quarter. Given the outsized impact of COVID assay sales in the prior year period, this translates to a decline of 56% to 52%. As you update your forecasts, let me remind you that macro uncertainty due to the pandemic is still high. We would therefore encourage you to model at the middle of our ranges, which incorporates both potential upsides and downsides. Before we open up the call for questions, let me touch on a few longer-term items. As Steve discussed, based on our recent strategic planning process we are confident that organic revenue can grow 5% to 7% through our fiscal 2025, excluding sales of COVID assays as well as the related ancillaries and instruments. Many of you have also asked for our perspective on COVID assay sales next year. And the shortest, most accurate answer is, we don\u2019t know. No one does, given the significant uncertainties that still exist and that seemingly change on a weekly basis. Having said that, we do understand your desire for some kind of framework. Toward that end, we believe that given the scope of the ongoing pandemic and our broad global installed base of Panther instruments, it is unlikely that COVID assay's revenue will be much less than $200 million next year, which would make COVID one of our biggest molecular assays. It\u2019s certainly possible that sales could be more than that, maybe as much as double, but we are going to be conservative at this stage and consider anything above $200 million potential upside. We would encourage you to do the same, and focus instead on the strong underlying growth rates in our base businesses that Steve discussed. Let me wrap up by saying that Hologic showed tremendous growth in the third quarter, with results that exceeded guidance. We continue to make a huge impact on women\u2019s health globally and are meeting COVID testing needs as the pandemic evolves. Further, with organic investments and multiple acquisitions, we are emerging from the pandemic as a stronger company with top-line growth rates of 5% to 7%, excluding COVID impacts. With that, I will ask the operator to open the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up, then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator instructions] We'll go first to Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan.\nTycho Peterson: Hey thanks. A question that I get often on guidance, both near term and then the longer term outlook. So the fourth quarter guidance you are a bit below consensus at the midpoint of both revenue and earnings. You know a lot that's obviously the COVID roll off, but I just want to make sure there's not any deterioration model for the base business in the fourth quarter outlook. And then longer term the 5% to 7% growth, obviously you've got easy comps from 2021 as it was still impacted heavily by COVID. So should we assume the core, non-COVID growth longer term and it could be at the high end or above, given the comp dynamic here in the near term?\nStephen MacMillan: Sure, starting with the fourth quarter guidance Tycho, you should feel very good about the underlying trends in the base businesses. We feel really good about each of them and it's the COVID decline that really leads us and we're continuing to be conservative day to day. It's hard to exactly predict what's going on in the COVID world. Three weeks ago it looked very different than a week ago. So we want to continue to be able to get people to focus on our based businesses that we feel good about. And we don't want to go too far on the longer term piece, but I think saying 5% to 7% for this company is very different than where we've been. And yes, so the comps are a little depressed someone next year, but not dramatically given that some of our businesses bounced back pretty well, and I think we feel good about each franchise contributing steady growth as we go through that period. Karleen?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes and I would just add to that Tycho that some of the elements of our franchises are not back to the 2019 levels if you think about psychology or you think about NovaSure and some of our STIs that are related to well women in business, those are still getting back to those 2019 levels.\nTycho Peterson: Okay that's helpful, and then a follow up on capital deployment. Obviously you've been very active on the M&A front, but you did repurchase 3 million shares this quarter. I'm just curious, how you think about M&A going forward? Do you have a pause here and would you shift more to buy backs given the valuation and the growth that we will see right out here?\nKarleen Oberton: No, I think the M&A pipeline is still certainly active. Again it's division led, so maybe a little more quiet on the Diagnostics front for a while, but the other divisions are certainly active and I think, given the cash flow Tycho, we can still continue to do both. We can still continue to do M&A and share repurchase and that strategy will continue.\nOperator: Out next question will come from Patrick Donnelly of Citi.\nPatrick Donnelly: Great thanks, Steve may be one for you on the long-term guide, certainly I appreciate all the color there. One of the biggest questions we get, is just how to get comfortable with the pretty good increase in Panther placements, that utilization and beyond COVID I mean we've seen so many various systems see their installed base move higher as well. I guess when you guys work through the guidance, how do you think about this piece? I mean obviously, there's things like test of record that you look at and feel good about the attach rate in the near term and driving, healthy utilization, but maybe just talk about that dynamic? But again, there's a ton of systems out there, what would you kind of include in the guidance in terms of Panther winning out in terms of some of that share beyond COVID?\nStephen MacMillan: Sure, Patrick, it really comes across on multiple fronts, some is actually the contractual obligations as we've placed these Panthers particularly to provide both COVID revenue with an ongoing basis. The other pieces and your right, there's a lot of systems out there now. The simple, my super simple way is the common sense talk to the customer approach and I think, you've been out there with enough of the labs as well to hear what is going to be important on an ongoing basis is the most highly automated instruments that provide the best level of tests. And it -- what has led us to really the unbelievable market shares that we have in virtually all of our businesses. But when you look at Panther, the automated platform, the incredible automation and particularly as labs start to look to the future, where labor is going to be tougher and tougher to combine. And so, what we continue to hear, is Panthers where they want to consolidate, and in the early days of COVID everybody went everywhere and got every machine, and every test that they could get and some are still bleeding off inventory from some of those, we just keep hearing over and over. The lab techs especially, they're still running out of inventory of other people's stuff. They want to consolidate on Panther, and I think we've got a multi-year long-term track record of delivering on that. This is not a pie in the sky, hey we just placed a bunch of Panthers in the last 15 months and think this is going to happen. It's what we've been doing for six or seven years, pre-Panther which is we placed more Panthers every year, as our customers get used to them, they want to put more and more stuff on them. So I think it's going to really help us emerge, all automated platforms, not the same all boxes are not the same. Panthers established itself in the high volume space, high throughput space for a good reason.\nMichael Watts: Hey Pat it's Mike, the only think I might add to that just briefly is, although we weren't aware when we put our strat plan together of the new CDC guidelines that were just issued I think last week, certainly those are helpful to our business when you think about things like the opportunity for universal screening around chlamydia and gonorrhea, when you think about molecular testing for Amgen [ph], when you think about molecular testing for BD [ph]. So, as I said that wasn't something we were aware of at the time, but it certainly speaks to our ability to work with our largest lab customers to drive primary demand and expense in those categories.\nPatrick Donnelly: That's helpful perspective, and then maybe just a quick follow up for Karleen, just on the COVID piece. Can you talk about the pricing another two thirds of the business that you mentioned is OUS, I know that was kind of shaken around 20 bucks, have the recent contracts been a little more in the mid teams? What is the right way to think about that and just pushing that forward on that $200 million floor for next year, how should we be thinking about pricing as we go forward? Thank you.\nKarleen Oberton: Yes, certainly, yes from Q2 to Q3 we saw that average pricing come down from 25 to closer to 20, given that dynamic of OUS being two thirds of the revenue, and I think what we'll see is that as we renew those contracts, we'll probably see pricing coming down and then as maybe reimbursement goes away, we'll have some pricing pressure, but I think, even if we end up with an average ASP in the low to mid teens that's still very profitable assay for us.\nOperator: And next we will go to Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI.\nVijay Kumar: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Steve, a lot of details here, a lot of numbers, I appreciate the color. May be some -- a little bit more details on some of the assumptions behind the 5 to 7? That 5 to 7 over the next few years, are we starting at 5 and progressing towards the higher end or maybe talk a little of the cadence, which best plays it assuming for Breast versus Diagnostic versus Surgical franchises?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes, I think Vijay at the highest level, we probably see each franchise being roughly in that range, some maybe a little bit faster and we don't see dramatic changes year-over-year. It's not frontend loaded, it's not backend loaded. So we're not ready to give formal year-by-year guidance, but let's wait until our November call, we'll give our 2022 guidance. But I think our underlying belief is as you well know, those are growth rates better than we were coming in, and we always said when COVID struck, we're going to emerge as a stronger faster growing company, and we feel like this is exactly what we see for each of the businesses going forward.\nKarleen Oberton: Yes and I would just add that to your point, Steve that historically it's never been all the businesses growing at these rates, it's been one of the other, so this is what gives us confidence and excitement when the growth rate is driven by all the businesses.\nStephen MacMillan: Yes, which I think the magic of that as well Vijay and you know it from having lived through the Breast Health peaks and valleys, even surgical early on week and then kind of some good quarters and back down. I think we just see this profound underlying strength of each of the franchises, both domestically and internationally with a cadence of product flow and the installed base, and the service, where there's just a strength that has now existed and we've been building over time in each of the businesses and then supplemented with the acquisitions that are giving us effectively accretive to the top line growth rates more products in the bag, it's just, there's no magic to it but it's a lot of things coming together.\nVijay Kumar: And so that's helpful Steve. And maybe Karleen one for you, what should the 5 or 7 on the top translate to the bottom line? I guess going back to some of the debates on the stock a few years ago, peak margins was a question. So where are we on margins right now and some CapEx logic and also in the double digit earnings growth trajectory?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes, so certainly I think if you looked at our historical trends prior to the pandemic of either a regular cadence and growing EPS high single low double digits I mean, I think -- I don't think that's an unreasonable expectation. I think if you go back to Q2 2020 kind of our last clean quarter before the pandemic, operating income was in the low 30s. Certainly as we move forward, any COVID revenue is going to be accretive to that percentage, but I do, I would also say that as we look to that 5% to 7% they are international can be growing faster than us, which is a little lower on the margin side and certainly acquisitions, probably over the near term are a little dilutive to that.\nOperator: And now we will go to Jack Meehan of Nephron Research.\nJack Meehan: Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to turn back to Diagnostics and get some color on the Panther trajectory. I think I got 2700 total systems now. It seems like you're still placing instruments at a higher rate than you have in the past and I just thought it was interesting given where we are in the pandemic. I'm curious to get your thoughts, how that will trend from here? And if you look at the systems I appreciate the color on test or record, but is there any color of how many are just doing COVID only inability to translate them to other things?\nStephen MacMillan: So Jack, I think the -- as we look to call it next year 2022, yes we're already starting to think about, okay, where we would we place some Panthers. And I think, a little early to tell, but we're still seeing pretty strong demand. So I would expect 2022 not to fall off a cliff, even though we've just placed, literally four years, we're in about 15-16 months. And I think some concern that that would drop off. I think we'll probably still be in the 200-ish plus Panthers to be placed even in the next fiscal year. So we're continuing to see very encouraging demand, and I think part of what we're seeing right now is some of our folks picking back up that were running, flat out COVID, I don't think there's a ton of them today that are running COVID flat out. I think we're starting to see them picking back up as women's visits are starting to go back in. So part of the magic of the platform is and it's even with the batching not needing to batch, you can just start to get back to running a women's health as a viral loads or COVID tests all simultaneously. So I think we're feeling pretty good about that.\nJack Meehan: Right, and sticking with molecular, you know the Mobidiag acquisition, can you give us an updated timeline for when you think Novodiag can enter the U.S. market, and as you look out to 2025, can you humor us with what you think the revenue contribution for this platform can look like here and how it sits next to Panther?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes, I think the best way to think about Novo come to the U.S. is towards the end of that strat plan horizon. I think we've got a few years worth of work to get it. In the meantime, we do have installs in Europe, and already some more interest among customers in Europe since we've acquired in our sales force that already sells Panthers. So I think we see some opportunity to immediately inject even additional life into that. And I think, beyond that, I think as we said in the script, we do see this becoming a multi 100 million dollar business over time. That's probably closer to the end of that, the end of the strat plan horizon to particularly, we've really got to get into the U.S., to really get that -- those numbers.\nOperator: And now we'll take a question from Brian Weinstein of William Blair.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey guys this is Dustin on the line for Brian. There's been a lot of talk regarding democratization of testing and in particular STI testing, where we're kind of seeing a number of diagnostic companies going after this market. Can you talk about your viewpoint on how the centralized testing plays and where do you think STI testing will kind of take place longer term? And as it relates to you guys, where does entering this market rank in terms of company priorities?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes, I think, first off, we've established ourselves with a pretty strong presence in the STIs and there's always a lot of competition in every market we're in. There's also a lot of hype and talk frankly from companies putting projections out there that haven't necessarily operated for a long time in the real world. And at the end of the day I think we do see increased decentralization. We see opportunities for whether it's home collection or other stuff and we're positioned, both with our customers, as well as frankly just the decentralized footprint that we already have with Panther. So I think it's also important that it's back to the CDC guidelines that just came out last week that we also see significant market expansion and we're the ones have been helping to drive that over time. So there will be certainly more competition, more tests being done in different places and I think we continue to be there.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great, thanks, I appreciate that. And this kind of goes off in earlier question a little bit, but I'm wondering if you guys can give an update on the recent diagnostic acquisitions. Things seem to be going pretty well for Biotheranostics, but just looking for a general update of how integrations are going versus expectations, and how these businesses were doing in the years previously?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes, I think Biotheranostics is a great one. We absolutely love it. It's right down the street here in San Diego, the integration has gone very well in our San Diego facility this week I've seen some of the Biotheranostics people. They are already well integrated with our team. And I think excited to be part of Hologic. Diagenode our team over in Belgium, we've been working with them really for five years. They've been developing assays. So we have great relationships there. And on Mobi, I'm exceptionally pleased with what we're seeing and hearing. Kevin Thornal and his team have made multiple trips over to Finland at a time when lots of people don't want to be traveling those kind of distances and masks and everything else. Our teams have been getting very close to the teams over there. So feeling really, really good and it's really the power of the division lead acquisitions where our teams were deeply involved in the diligence and getting to know the teams in advance and chomping at the bit to work together. So I think what's been need is particularly each of those three companies, the employees of each of those companies, I think have genuinely been excited to be a part of a company that's got our purpose, passion, promise and it's not just good old American company focused only on profit, but we've actually got a much bigger purpose. And I think particularly as we've done some of the deals in Europe that's been a big deal to the employees, and the same practice on the tax and SSI we've done a lot in Europe recently between Breast Health and Diagnostics and I think it really resonates with the teams on the ground over there.\nKarleen Oberton: And I'll just add in Surgical, our Acessa acquisition, there is some recent good news there. We've got guidelines from ACOG and coverage from Cigna, so we're excited for what that's going to do in FY 2022.\nOperator: And now we will go to Anthony Petrone with Jeffries.\nAnthony Petrone:\nMichael Watts: Anthony, are you there?\nOperator: And Anthony your line is open, do you have this on mute?\nMichael Watts: Well, move on.\nOperator: We will take our next question that will be from Tejas Savant of Morgan Stanley.\nTejas Savant: Hey guys, good evening. So Steve, one on the Panther replacements for you, particularly in terms of the new Panthers that you're placing with new to whole logic customers. How has that mix evolved over the last few quarters and specific to those customers, can you share some color in terms of the menu uptake?\nStephen MacMillan: Sure, we don't have the incredible detail on that, other then I would just say, frankly a lot of them are in place with existing customers, a lot with new customers. What we've been seeing on each of them is, they -- certainly a lot of the new customers, the initial impetus was for COVID revenue, but they've been qualifying and porting over the other assays as the COVID revenue is starting to come down a little bit and as frankly the lab techs have been able to come up for air and qualify things. So I think we feel very good as evidenced by the underlying trajectory of our core diagnostics business coming back.\nMichael Watts: Hey Tejas, it is Mike. If we look at our tested record metric as an indicator of what you're asking about, probably no surprise we've got a big chunk of [indiscernible] to new business coming in, that's our biggest selling assay as in COVID we've got a big chunk of HPV in the papillomavirus [ph] business coming in. But I think what's really encouraging is even bigger than that is the interest in our vaginosis, BV [ph]. So that's a little bit of reflection of what we are talking about before in terms of our ability to take existing menu and build out from it with a new test and often oftentimes comes from the same sample type, so that's been encouraging.\nTejas Savant: Got it very helpful. And then a couple of unrelated ones for Karleen here. Karleen you spoke about sort of about $160 million in COVID testing contributions for the fourth quarter and then about $200 million as a floor for fiscal 2022. Can you just outline what your assumptions were around sort of potentially the Delta variant leading to an uptick in testing and perhaps even a relatively strong flu season, would that all be upside and are you seeing any pickup at all in the last few weeks in terms of a trend reversal because of the Delta dynamic?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes, I would say our approach to the Q4 guide was similar to what we did in Q3 was looking at our July actual, looking at what's contracted pretty much outside the U.S. as a commitment, and then looking at recent trends. So for the most part I would say Delta accelerating with the upside as well as the flu season would likely be upside to those numbers that we've provided.\nOperator: And now we will go to [indiscernible] of Bank of America.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is John on for Dick. Thanks for taking our question. You've alluded today that with specifically on Mobidiag's competitive landscape you have, other companies pushing into this multiplex molecular landscape and I was wondering how we should think about the revenue ramp had before the kind of in for me and of course, it's going to be the leading growth driver in 2025, and also what was the contribution in this quarter? Thank you.\nStephen MacMillan: Sure. I think the -- we clearly do see it getting much bigger in the out years as we come United States. So it will be a few million a quarter right now. Part of that has been particularly in -- it is all European business right now. I think you'll see it build over the year. Now they had some COVID revenue last year. So again, the core business we see it picking up over time here and even starting if we're going to into the New Year.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got you and then, are there any other assets that you want to divest in the near-term may be again in the Diagnostics or on the European front seeing that the integrations of the markdown [indiscernible] as you know like most of it is all going well?\nStephen MacMillan: I think we feel really good with what we have and it allows us to be opportunistic. There's nothing that we're lapping right now and we'll continue just to kind of keep our eyes and ears open. I would say I think we feel very good about integrating everything we have right now and that that alone, one way to think about it, we've accelerated multiple years of acquisitions in Diagnostics in a real short period of time. We did three deals in a three to four-month window announcing actual closing three deals in call it a six, seven-month window, that covered our next couple of years and some of what we were hoping to do. So we're now hot and heavy into the integrations and into the execution mode that we tend to be pretty good on the execution side, but we'll continue to keep our eyes open, but there's no gaping holes in our portfolio.\nOperator: And now we will go to Max Masucci of Cowen and Company.\nMax Masucci: Hi good afternoon, thanks for all the details today. Can you just give us a bit more detail around how the recoveries has trended for routine wellness and blood screening business lately, where that backlog stands and what's sort of impact are you seeing more recently just with the emergence of the delta variant?\nStephen MacMillan: Sure, I think overall we've seen pretty good recoveries really in mammography. The core women's health, some of the sexually transmitted infection and Pap tests have not bounced fully back yet, and I think we see that as, it's opportunity for the future when they will get back, but I think we've seen a little more recovery on the mammography side, most places back close to 100%. I think they are very recent trends with delta we're seeing little pockets here and there of small hospital systems here or there and certain geographies that may not be scheduling extra visits right now and things like that. But I don't think it will be material to the quarter going forward.\nMax Masucci: Got it, and Mobidiag has allowed you to serve customers that want both low plex or higher plex testing capabilities in a decentralized setting, but just at an industry level have you seen rising demand for higher plex testing today compared to pre-pandemic times? And just as a followup, do you view Mobidiag as a bigger share taker or game changer in the low plex or higher plex segment in the market over time?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes I think we think it is going to play very well in both, but certainly in the multiplex area over time I think it's going to be a great platform for us. The magic for us is, it does give us a completely new growth platform in addition to Panther. So we've got all the additional Panthers we've placed, now it will be building up the menu over time and getting those Panthers working at a higher rate while we -- and subsequently we'll start to bring in the Mobidiag platform, both frankly more around Europe right now it's largely just in a few northern European countries as we expand it across Europe and then ultimately bring it to the States.\nOperator: And we have time for one final question and that will come from Anthony Petrone again from Jefferies.\nAnthony Petrone: Apologies, just hopping between calls, I just have two on Diagnostics. First on the CDC guidelines, it sort of recommends universal screening, but it looks like it will be site-specific in terms of adopting that protocol. So just wondering how you actually see that rolling out? And certainly represents upside for the Aptima Combo STI franchise, but any thoughts early on what that can mean for tailwind? And the second one quickly on COVID testing, OUS some of your competitors have referenced tenders. I'm just wondering if the company is participating in tenders and what that kind of represents going forward? Thanks a lot.\nStephen MacMillan: Sure, I'll certainly take the first, yes we are certainly involved in any of the tenders for COVID revenue. When we establish very strong relationships upfront, it's also well frankly our ability to serve our customers internationally as we said about two thirds of our revenue from COVID last quarter was international. We've built some very strong relationships and frankly the health ministers around the world have known they can count on us and they can count on Panthers to deliver. So we feel pretty good about being involved in those. And back to your first piece on the CDC we feel really, really good about these new guidelines. And specifically, while it leads it up to regional we've got couple of things going for us. First, our own Diagnostics sales team, the calls on physicians and also to educate them, but really more importantly going from effectively and opt into an opt out system. So there have been so many women who should be having these tests done on routine visits that have really had to be opted in and then all the default should go the other way. So is that going to affect this coming quarter? Probably not. We'll we significantly expand the market here in the coming years, we think so and we think it's a great move for human health because a lot of the young women when they are -- if they are at the doctor' s office and they are with their mum and the doctor is asking question about the sexually active to decide do I give this test or not, and therefore okay, wait, if the kid has to answer yes to get the test written. As soon as the default becomes hey, you might not be, but we're just going to order this test anyway, that is a much, I think a much better way for society ultimately to probably have better handle on what's really going on.\nAnthony Petrone: Thanks again.\nStephen MacMillan: Great, thank you.\nMichael Watts: Hey Kathy, it looks like we've just got one more left in the queue. We can take that last question quickly if he is still there.\nOperator: Certainly. We will go to Ryan Zimmerman of BTIG.\nRyan Zimmerman: Hey Mike, thanks for squeezing me in. Stephen, Karleen, thank you. Just one from me\u2026\nMichael Watts: Ryan, if I know it was you I wouldn\u2019t have done it, sorry about that.\nStephen MacMillan: Thanks for hanging on as well, we couldn\u2019t have cut off.\nRyan Zimmerman: Well, with that said, just one from me? So Breast growth, Steve you called out cliff, and certainly the percentage of sales, again for sales, gantry sales is declining and it kind of dull tales with BJ's question, how do you think about that growth rate over time given the long range guidance you've provided, can that move up from what people have historically thought of as a kind of low single digit, mid single digit growth rate within Breast as the dynamics of that business shift over the three years?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes Ryan. I think what we're very encouraged by and give Pete Valenti who has subsequently retired from Hologic, but when he came into the company and joined me in early 2014, our entire goal was to eliminate the boom-bust, the cliffs and the peaks and all that stuff in the Breast Health business, and we've achieved exactly that going to a much more consistent business were both diversifying, but also by bringing additional ideas to the gantries where we continue to do want better gantries along the way make a much more stable. So I think what we see there is a core underlying gantry business and service business, but then also as we're getting into a little more of the disposable stuff and the Breast Surgery stuff and those things, whether it's a bit of Focal and trying to be the markers that SOMATEX brings, now Brevera with the biopsy which is the capital, but really then it has been needle [ph] use is adding these ongoing revenue streams that are a little bit accretive to that underlying market growth that we have. So is Breast Health going to be the fastest growing business? Probably not, but is it going to be comfortably in that range, I think we feel really good about it.\nKarleen Oberton: Yes Ryan, I think I would just add that internationally if you think about historically about Breast business was managed commercially with that of dealing that work that under Kevin Thornal who had a strategy to go direct, we're seeing that improve the international business, I think there are other markets we're looking to go direct and in general internationally our commercial capabilities continue to grow and believe that's going to be helped -- international Breast will be -- Breast growth will be accretive to the overall [indiscernible] division.\nStephen MacMillan: And Ryan will yell at Mike afterwards being [indiscernible].\nRyan Zimmerman: Thank you.\nMichael Watts: Thanks everybody. We appreciate your time this afternoon.\nOperator: Thank you. This now concludes the Hologic's third quarter fiscal 2021 earnings conference call. Have a good evening.",

            "name": "Karleen Oberton",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon everyone. As Steve said, our third quarter results exceeded expectations as revenue and EPS grew significantly compared to the prior year. Revenue of $1.17 billion increased 38%. Organically revenue grew 34%, driven by continued sequential improvement in our base businesses in a meaningful contribution from global COVID testing revenue. We exceeded our top and bottom line guidance with upside in both our base and COVID. We also significantly improved profitability compared to the prior year period. As a result, EPS of $1.33 in the third quarter increased 77%. Further, operating cash flow remained robust, allowing us to execute on our capital allocation strategy, which I'll discuss more in a moment. Before I do that, let me provide some detail on our divisional revenue results. Providing more complete picture of our performance, I will often compare our results to the third quarters of both 2020 and 2019. In Diagnostics, global revenue of $665.5 million grew an impressive 20% compared to the prior year period based on higher than expected COVID sales and the strength of our core molecular franchise. Within Diagnostics, molecular diagnostics increased 11.9% globally as massive growth internationally more than offset the decline in U.S. COVID sales. Although COVID testing revenue declined, it still exceeded our most recent guidance. Specifically, we shipped about 14 million COVID tests to customers, generating assay revenue of $291 million globally. About two thirds of COVID assay revenue was generated outside the United States in the quarter, reflecting the broader global footprint that Steve discussed. To better understand the underlying performance of our non-COVID businesses, let me remind you that the pandemic has also increased sales of collection kits, instruments and ancillaries that are used with our COVID tests. Backing this revenue out of the current and prior year periods provides a better picture of true underlying trends. If we do this, we see that base molecular revenue in total Diagnostics sales grew about 76% organically in the third quarter. Compared to the same quarter of 2019, molecular grew in the mid teens and total Diagnostics grew mid single digits. Rounding out Diagnostics, our Cytology & Perinatal businesses grew 75% compared to the prior year, but compared to 2019 these businesses were still slightly behind their pre-pandemic levels. In Breast Health, global revenue of $349 million grew 53% and exceptional results as the franchise continues to gain momentum. As evidence of this, revenues have now increased sequentially and compared to 2019 for the last three quarters. The division's strong performance remains well rounded, reflecting our commitment to diversifying revenue streams as Steve discussed. Both breast imaging and interventional businesses increased compared to the prior year period with imaging growing 43% and interventional increasing 120%. Although we remain encouraged by continued improvement in the capital environment, capital is still not quite back to the 2019 levels. However, breast screening rates continued to improve and with the healthy backlog we are encouraged about continued recovery over the next few quarters. In Surgical, third quarter revenue of $127.9 million to 143%, while also exceeding 2019 levels by low double digits. Surgical's strong performance has been driven by normalizing procedure volumes, MyoSure and new products in the hands of our exceptional sales force. Lastly in Skeletal, revenue of $25.9 million, increased 66% compared to the prior year period. It was also up low single digits compared to 2019. Overall, in terms of geography, domestic sales of $749.9 million increased almost 14%. On an organic basis, U.S. revenue was up 10%. Outside the United States, sales of $418.4 million increased 137%. Organically sales Outside the U.S. grew 131% a tremendous result. Now let's move on to the rest of the P&L for the third quarter. Gross margin of 66.1% increased 140 basis points, driven by volume recovery in our base businesses, and a nice contribution from sales of our COVID tests. Continuing down the P&L, total operating expenses of $310.1 million, increased 19% in the third quarter. Excluding expenses from our recent acquisitions, operating expenses would have increased about 11% as we reinvested for our future growth incremental spending in R&D and marketing. In addition, remember that given uncertainties associated with the pandemic, we cut back on spending in our third quarter of 2020. Out non-GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 21.5%, driven by a favorable geographic income mix, mainly sales of COVID tests outside the United States. Putting this altogether, operating margin increased 650 basis points to 39.5% and net margin increased 580 basis points to 29.5%. As a result, non-GAAP net income finished at $344.8 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.33 exceeding the top end of our guidance. Before we cover our fourth quarter guidance, I'll quickly touch on few other financial metrics. Driven by a strong performance of our base businesses, as well as the contribution from COVID testing, cash flow from operations were $663 million in the third quarter. This was nearly double our non-GAAP net income, highlighting excellent cash conversion. These strong cash flows continue to give us tremendous financial and strategic flexibility. For example, in the third quarter we closed the acquisition of Mobidiag for an enterprise value of $808 million, and also repurchased 3 million shares of stock for $188 million. Overall, we had $828 million of cash at the end of the third quarter, and our leverage ratio was 0.7 times. We intend to continue using our cash on division-led, tuck-in acquisitions and share repurchases that improve our top and bottom -line growth rates. Finally, ROIC was 34.7% on a trailing 12-month basis, a significant increase of 2,190 basis points. Before we open the call for questions, let me discuss our expectations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and provide a few comments on longer-term targets. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we expect strong financial results again, with total revenue in the range of $1 billion to $1.04 billion, representing constant currency decline of 27% to 24% versus the prior year period, which benefited from huge COVID assay sales. For perspective, in the fourth quarter of 2019, we generated less than $800 million of revenue excluding the divested Cynosure business, so we expect to grow significantly above pre-pandemic levels. In our base businesses, we expect continued momentum and recovery to generate very strong growth rates compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, given the negative impact of the pandemic a year ago and we expect these franchises to grow nicely compared to 2019 as well. In terms of COVID assay sales, the U.S. testing market continues to decline as we forecasted last quarter, and we expect this trend to continue as more people are vaccinated. In addition, summer vacations may further reduce demand domestically and in Europe. With these factors in mind, we expect COVID assay sales to range from $150 to $170 million in the fourth quarter. In addition, COVID related items in Diagnostics are expected to be approximately $30 million in the fourth quarter, down roughly $20 million sequentially. If new variants drive demand that exceeds our current expectations, we are well-prepared to deliver for our customers and generate upside to our estimates. Our fourth quarter guidance includes approximately $35 million of acquired revenue from Mobidiag, Biotheranostics, Diagenode and Acessa. Backing this out, as well as $9 million of expected Blood Screening revenue, we expect organic revenue to decline 30% to 27%. But excluding COVID assay sales and related revenue, we forecast organic revenue to grow low-to-mid-teens in the fourth quarter. Below operating income, I would point out that we expect other expenses, net, to increase to about $25 million in the fourth quarter. Our guidance is based on a tax rate of 21.5%, and diluted shares outstanding of $260 million for the quarter. All this nets out to expected EPS of $0.92 to $1 in the fourth quarter. Given the outsized impact of COVID assay sales in the prior year period, this translates to a decline of 56% to 52%. As you update your forecasts, let me remind you that macro uncertainty due to the pandemic is still high. We would therefore encourage you to model at the middle of our ranges, which incorporates both potential upsides and downsides. Before we open up the call for questions, let me touch on a few longer-term items. As Steve discussed, based on our recent strategic planning process we are confident that organic revenue can grow 5% to 7% through our fiscal 2025, excluding sales of COVID assays as well as the related ancillaries and instruments. Many of you have also asked for our perspective on COVID assay sales next year. And the shortest, most accurate answer is, we don't know. No one does, given the significant uncertainties that still exist and that seemingly change on a weekly basis. Having said that, we do understand your desire for some kind of framework. Toward that end, we believe that given the scope of the ongoing pandemic and our broad global installed base of Panther instruments, it is unlikely that COVID assay's revenue will be much less than $200 million next year, which would make COVID one of our biggest molecular assays. It's certainly possible that sales could be more than that, maybe as much as double, but we are going to be conservative at this stage and consider anything above $200 million potential upside. We would encourage you to do the same, and focus instead on the strong underlying growth rates in our base businesses that Steve discussed. Let me wrap up by saying that Hologic showed tremendous growth in the third quarter, with results that exceeded guidance. We continue to make a huge impact on women's health globally and are meeting COVID testing needs as the pandemic evolves. Further, with organic investments and multiple acquisitions, we are emerging from the pandemic as a stronger company with top-line growth rates of 5% to 7%, excluding COVID impacts. With that, I will ask the operator to open the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up, then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question. Yes and I would just add to that Tycho that some of the elements of our franchises are not back to the 2019 levels if you think about psychology or you think about NovaSure and some of our STIs that are related to well women in business, those are still getting back to those 2019 levels. No, I think the M&A pipeline is still certainly active. Again it's division led, so maybe a little more quiet on the Diagnostics front for a while, but the other divisions are certainly active and I think, given the cash flow Tycho, we can still continue to do both. We can still continue to do M&A and share repurchase and that strategy will continue. Yes, certainly, yes from Q2 to Q3 we saw that average pricing come down from 25 to closer to 20, given that dynamic of OUS being two thirds of the revenue, and I think what we'll see is that as we renew those contracts, we'll probably see pricing coming down and then as maybe reimbursement goes away, we'll have some pricing pressure, but I think, even if we end up with an average ASP in the low to mid teens that's still very profitable assay for us. Yes and I would just add that to your point, Steve that historically it's never been all the businesses growing at these rates, it's been one of the other, so this is what gives us confidence and excitement when the growth rate is driven by all the businesses. Yes, so certainly I think if you looked at our historical trends prior to the pandemic of either a regular cadence and growing EPS high single low double digits I mean, I think -- I don't think that's an unreasonable expectation. I think if you go back to Q2 2020 kind of our last clean quarter before the pandemic, operating income was in the low 30s. Certainly as we move forward, any COVID revenue is going to be accretive to that percentage, but I do, I would also say that as we look to that 5% to 7% they are international can be growing faster than us, which is a little lower on the margin side and certainly acquisitions, probably over the near term are a little dilutive to that. And I'll just add in Surgical, our Acessa acquisition, there is some recent good news there. We've got guidelines from ACOG and coverage from Cigna, so we're excited for what that's going to do in FY 2022. Yes, I would say our approach to the Q4 guide was similar to what we did in Q3 was looking at our July actual, looking at what's contracted pretty much outside the U.S. as a commitment, and then looking at recent trends. So for the most part I would say Delta accelerating with the upside as well as the flu season would likely be upside to those numbers that we've provided. Yes Ryan, I think I would just add that internationally if you think about historically about Breast business was managed commercially with that of dealing that work that under Kevin Thornal who had a strategy to go direct, we're seeing that improve the international business, I think there are other markets we're looking to go direct and in general internationally our commercial capabilities continue to grow and believe that's going to be helped -- international Breast will be -- Breast growth will be accretive to the overall [indiscernible] division."

            "name": "Stephen MacMillan",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to discuss our financial performance for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. We posted excellent results overall, driven by strong rebound in our base businesses and continued contributions to fight the ongoing COVID pandemic. Total revenue was $1.17 billion, up 38% and non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.33 up 77%. We significantly exceeded our guidance on both the top and bottom lines. Our revenue outperformance was broad based in the quarter. Our Breast and Surgical divisions both grew substantially versus the prior year period when results were negatively affected by the pandemic. And importantly, both businesses also grew compared to the same period of 2019. Our Diagnostics division grew about 20% compared to last year, despite lower sales of COVID tests and increased compared to 2019 as well. Karleen will review our full financial results today, but before she does, I want to take a step back and provide some perspective on where Hologic is headed over the longer term, as many of you have requested. As mentioned in our last call, we have been working through our annual strategic planning process, and based on this, I've never been more excited about our future and the global impact we are making by pursuing our purpose, passion and promise. We know this is important to all our investors and especially those focused on ESG priorities. Hologic is clearly emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic as a stronger, faster growing company. We have a much higher profile on the global stage, which has helped create a stronger and more durable foundation to accelerate our international growth. And we have placed hundreds of new Panther instruments, which is boosting our razor and razor blade business model. From a financial perspective, we have generated more than $2.5 billion dollars of operating cash in just the last five quarters. During this time, we have used about $1.35 billion to buy six companies and about $510 million to buy back our own stock. In Diagnostics alone, we have added two new growth platforms in Biotheranostics and Mobidiag and substantially increased our assay development capabilities with Diagenode. Based on all this progress, we are now targeting organic revenue growth rates of between 5% and 7% in our base businesses between now and 2025. This excludes sales of COVID assays and related ancillaries, which we expect to decline over our strat plan horizon. Now we'd like to discuss how we expect this to play out in our three divisions. This is more detail than we typically provide in a quarterly call, but it's important to underpin the enthusiasm we have for our future. First, in Diagnostics, we are diversifying our customer base, installing more Panther instruments, continuously adding new assay menu and driving testing demand. Our foundation in diagnostics remains rock solid with leading U.S. market positions for our ThinPrep Pap Test and our key women's health assays on the Panther instrument, namely chlamydia and gonorrhea, HPV and Trichomonas. As leaders in these categories, we have built strong partnerships with many of our largest lab customers that enable us to educate physicians about testing guidelines issued by groups like the CDC. Just last week in fact, the CDC posted new recommendations that are very positive for public health and for our business. So while our market shares are already very high, we are driving growth by expanding addressable markets. In addition, we have developed related women's health tests that are often performed from the same patient's sample, such as our vaginosis panel and our test for mycoplasma genitalium. Finally, we see significant opportunities to increase sales of other products where our market shares are much lower today. Our response to the COVID pandemic has unquestionably enabled us to accelerate these growth strategies. We have grown from a successful niche player in STI testing into a much more diversified industry leader with a broader customer base. We have done this by dramatically increasing placements of Panther instruments. Since the start of the pandemic, we have increased our global installed base by more than 50% or in real numbers by almost 1000 Panthers. We now have about 1500 Panthers in the United States and more than 1200 in other countries, and we are well diversified across customer sizes and types, and as COVID testing wanes customers are beginning to use these instruments to run more non-COVID assays. This is a significant opportunity, because today about half our customers from the largest reference labs to smaller hospitals run three tests or fewer on their Panther instruments, even though we now have 19 total assays available. We are capitalizing on this opportunity by signing up record levels of new business, as reflected in the test of record, or TORs metric that we have discussed. Pre-COVID, our best year for TORs was a little more than $20 million. Last fiscal year, we set a new record with about $35 million of new business and we are on track to comfortably exceed that number in 2021. Outside the United States, where Hologic Diagnostics has been less well-known historically, COVID has materially elevated our profile. Since the pandemic began, about a third of our COVID assay sales have been generated internationally and the relationships we have established will help us win business and drive future growth. Finally, the strong cash flow we've generated from COVID sales has enabled us to complete three recent acquisitions in Diagnostics, that together are expected to contribute more than $100 million of annual revenue, as well as providing new growth platforms that increase our top line growth rate. First, Biotheranostics enables us to enter the lab-based oncology space, a long time area of interest that has been growing rapidly. Biotheranostics is off to an excellent start with about $13 million of revenue in the third quarter, more than 30% higher than their best quarter prior to the pandemic. Second, Diagenode will help us add PCR-based menu to our Panther Fusion instrument, both in Europe and the United States. And third, the acquisition of Mobidiag enables us to enter the rapidly growing market for acute care, near-patient testing, which we have been monitoring for years. We believe the Novodiag instrument provides the right combination of ease-of-use, rapid turnaround, and low manufacturing cost to expand in the smaller hospitals and create a multi-hundred million dollar product line over time. Now let's shift gears and discuss our Breast and Skeletal Health division, where revenue growth is becoming more diversified, more recurring, more global, and more consistent than ever before. Similar to Diagnostics, our strategic plan is built on a foundation of strength. We are the leaders in breast health based on our long history of innovation, partnership with customers, and focus across the continuum of breast care. Our strategy is built around innovative market-leading Genius 3D Mammography platform. Like all our key products, our Genius exam is making a real difference in women's lives. They detect more dangerous cancers while reducing unnecessary callbacks. A few years ago, many investor questions focused on whether we could overcome the 3D cliff [ph] that was thought to be inevitable once the market converted to 3D. We don't get that question much anymore, because we have leveraged our leadership in 3D to creating much more diversified business with more consistent steady revenue growth. In fact, in the third quarter, U.S. gantry sales represented less than 20% of global breast health revenue. We have accomplished this in four ways. First, we've expanded our service business. If we think of breast health service as a single product, it would be the company's second largest with more than $500 million of global revenue over the last four quarters. While we don't expect this to grow dramatically over our strategic planning horizon, service will continue to underpin our financial results and be the cornerstone of the tight relationships we have with our customers. Second, we have beefed up our R&D capabilities beyond our traditional focus on x-ray imaging. We have developed new software packages like Clarity HD, which provides the industry's fastest highest resolution images. We have introduced new tools like Genius AI detection, a deep learning based software that helps radiologists detect subtle potential cancers. And we pioneered Brevera to fully integrate the biopsy procedure with specimen radiography for the first time. Brevera alone is now generating about $40 million of annual revenue, and we expect all these new products to drive growth over our strategic strat plan horizon. Third, we acquired four companies since 2018 to broaden our product portfolio, expand across the continuum of breast health care and become the partner of choice for all our customers breast health needs. These acquisitions include Faxitron, which bolstered our offerings in specimen radiography, and Focal which moved us further into breast conserving surgery, and SuperSonic Imagine, which strengthened our position in ultrasound, and SOMATEX, which increased innovation in breast biopsy markers. In aggregate, these deals are now adding about $90 million annually to breast health revenue and are important contributors to growth in our strategic plan. And fourth, we are expanding internationally in breast health. Our focus is to continue gaining market share with our existing 3D and upgradable 2D mammography products, the same products that have established leadership positions in the United States. We are also bringing the new products I've discussed, both internally developed and acquired to additional countries. And we've purchased distributors in Germany, Spain and other markets to get closer to customers and secure more service revenue. Now let's turn to our GYN Surgical Division. Surgical with our fastest growing division before the pandemic and our strategic plan assumes that surgical will continue its momentum through 2025. We have a unique opportunity to leverage our strength in the OB/GYN channel to provide differentiated solutions throughout women's lives. While today our products mainly help middle-aged women, in the future we plan to have a stronger presence among mothers-to-be and older women as we expand our offerings within the hysteroscopic, laparoscopic, and pelvic health markets. Within Surgical, MyoSure remains the world's leading hysteroscopic product to remove smaller, less complicated fibroids. Since July is fibroid awareness month, you've probably seen many articles describing the huge number of women who are affected by fibroids and the way they often suffer in silence or undergo invasive procedures such as hysterectomies. It's clear that this market remains large and underpenetrated and that after many years of exceptional growth, MyoSure still has plenty of room to run. We are also very excited about Acessa, which we acquired in 2020 and is laparoscopic fibroid treatment system. Acessa is a perfect complement to MyoSure as the system is used to treat larger, more complicated fibroids that MyoSure can't reach. Importantly, the same OB/GYNs who rely on MyoSure, have the potential to use Acessa, so it's a great fit for our sales force. We recently received two pieces of good news on Acessa that its now included in ACOG's updated fibroid management guidance and Cigna's list of medically necessary procedures. These are important milestones on our road to creating another $100 million dollar plus surgical brand alongside MyoSure and NovaSure. Another reason we feel confident in Surgical's future is the revitalization of our R&D pipeline. A few years ago, the division was basically a two-product show. Today, however, we sell multiple versions of these products, as well as new fluid management system, hysteroscopes and other GYN surgical tools and we have a robust pipeline of new products in development. Finally, based on the strengthening of our global commercial capabilities, we now have many opportunities to deliver our less invasive surgical solutions to women around the world, since less than 20% of the divisions revenue is generated outside the United States today. Before I turn the call over to Karleen, let me wrap up by saying that to me, Hologic looks like a fundamentally different company today than just 18 months ago, before the pandemic. We have three franchises growing faster than they ever have. We are growing in all major regions of the world. We have added multiple new growth drivers in all our divisions, and with our COVID tests we have a significant new product line to provide upside to a strong base. Taken together, we are excited for the future and confident that we will grow our base, non-COVID business between 5% and 7% over the next several years. Now let me hand the call over to Karleen. Sure, starting with the fourth quarter guidance Tycho, you should feel very good about the underlying trends in the base businesses. We feel really good about each of them and it's the COVID decline that really leads us and we're continuing to be conservative day to day. It's hard to exactly predict what's going on in the COVID world. Three weeks ago it looked very different than a week ago. So we want to continue to be able to get people to focus on our based businesses that we feel good about. And we don't want to go too far on the longer term piece, but I think saying 5% to 7% for this company is very different than where we've been. And yes, so the comps are a little depressed someone next year, but not dramatically given that some of our businesses bounced back pretty well, and I think we feel good about each franchise contributing steady growth as we go through that period. Karleen? Sure, Patrick, it really comes across on multiple fronts, some is actually the contractual obligations as we've placed these Panthers particularly to provide both COVID revenue with an ongoing basis. The other pieces and your right, there's a lot of systems out there now. The simple, my super simple way is the common sense talk to the customer approach and I think, you've been out there with enough of the labs as well to hear what is going to be important on an ongoing basis is the most highly automated instruments that provide the best level of tests. And it -- what has led us to really the unbelievable market shares that we have in virtually all of our businesses. But when you look at Panther, the automated platform, the incredible automation and particularly as labs start to look to the future, where labor is going to be tougher and tougher to combine. And so, what we continue to hear, is Panthers where they want to consolidate, and in the early days of COVID everybody went everywhere and got every machine, and every test that they could get and some are still bleeding off inventory from some of those, we just keep hearing over and over. The lab techs especially, they're still running out of inventory of other people's stuff. They want to consolidate on Panther, and I think we've got a multi-year long-term track record of delivering on that. This is not a pie in the sky, hey we just placed a bunch of Panthers in the last 15 months and think this is going to happen. It's what we've been doing for six or seven years, pre-Panther which is we placed more Panthers every year, as our customers get used to them, they want to put more and more stuff on them. So I think it's going to really help us emerge, all automated platforms, not the same all boxes are not the same. Panthers established itself in the high volume space, high throughput space for a good reason. Yes, I think Vijay at the highest level, we probably see each franchise being roughly in that range, some maybe a little bit faster and we don't see dramatic changes year-over-year. It's not frontend loaded, it's not backend loaded. So we're not ready to give formal year-by-year guidance, but let's wait until our November call, we'll give our 2022 guidance. But I think our underlying belief is as you well know, those are growth rates better than we were coming in, and we always said when COVID struck, we're going to emerge as a stronger faster growing company, and we feel like this is exactly what we see for each of the businesses going forward. Yes, which I think the magic of that as well Vijay and you know it from having lived through the Breast Health peaks and valleys, even surgical early on week and then kind of some good quarters and back down. I think we just see this profound underlying strength of each of the franchises, both domestically and internationally with a cadence of product flow and the installed base, and the service, where there's just a strength that has now existed and we've been building over time in each of the businesses and then supplemented with the acquisitions that are giving us effectively accretive to the top line growth rates more products in the bag, it's just, there's no magic to it but it's a lot of things coming together. So Jack, I think the -- as we look to call it next year 2022, yes we're already starting to think about, okay, where we would we place some Panthers. And I think, a little early to tell, but we're still seeing pretty strong demand. So I would expect 2022 not to fall off a cliff, even though we've just placed, literally four years, we're in about 15-16 months. And I think some concern that that would drop off. I think we'll probably still be in the 200-ish plus Panthers to be placed even in the next fiscal year. So we're continuing to see very encouraging demand, and I think part of what we're seeing right now is some of our folks picking back up that were running, flat out COVID, I don't think there's a ton of them today that are running COVID flat out. I think we're starting to see them picking back up as women's visits are starting to go back in. So part of the magic of the platform is and it's even with the batching not needing to batch, you can just start to get back to running a women's health as a viral loads or COVID tests all simultaneously. So I think we're feeling pretty good about that. Yes, I think the best way to think about Novo come to the U.S. is towards the end of that strat plan horizon. I think we've got a few years worth of work to get it. In the meantime, we do have installs in Europe, and already some more interest among customers in Europe since we've acquired in our sales force that already sells Panthers. So I think we see some opportunity to immediately inject even additional life into that. And I think, beyond that, I think as we said in the script, we do see this becoming a multi 100 million dollar business over time. That's probably closer to the end of that, the end of the strat plan horizon to particularly, we've really got to get into the U.S., to really get that -- those numbers. Yes, I think, first off, we've established ourselves with a pretty strong presence in the STIs and there's always a lot of competition in every market we're in. There's also a lot of hype and talk frankly from companies putting projections out there that haven't necessarily operated for a long time in the real world. And at the end of the day I think we do see increased decentralization. We see opportunities for whether it's home collection or other stuff and we're positioned, both with our customers, as well as frankly just the decentralized footprint that we already have with Panther. So I think it's also important that it's back to the CDC guidelines that just came out last week that we also see significant market expansion and we're the ones have been helping to drive that over time. So there will be certainly more competition, more tests being done in different places and I think we continue to be there. Yes, I think Biotheranostics is a great one. We absolutely love it. It's right down the street here in San Diego, the integration has gone very well in our San Diego facility this week I've seen some of the Biotheranostics people. They are already well integrated with our team. And I think excited to be part of Hologic. Diagenode our team over in Belgium, we've been working with them really for five years. They've been developing assays. So we have great relationships there. And on Mobi, I'm exceptionally pleased with what we're seeing and hearing. Kevin Thornal and his team have made multiple trips over to Finland at a time when lots of people don't want to be traveling those kind of distances and masks and everything else. Our teams have been getting very close to the teams over there. So feeling really, really good and it's really the power of the division lead acquisitions where our teams were deeply involved in the diligence and getting to know the teams in advance and chomping at the bit to work together. So I think what's been need is particularly each of those three companies, the employees of each of those companies, I think have genuinely been excited to be a part of a company that's got our purpose, passion, promise and it's not just good old American company focused only on profit, but we've actually got a much bigger purpose. And I think particularly as we've done some of the deals in Europe that's been a big deal to the employees, and the same practice on the tax and SSI we've done a lot in Europe recently between Breast Health and Diagnostics and I think it really resonates with the teams on the ground over there. Sure, we don't have the incredible detail on that, other then I would just say, frankly a lot of them are in place with existing customers, a lot with new customers. What we've been seeing on each of them is, they -- certainly a lot of the new customers, the initial impetus was for COVID revenue, but they've been qualifying and porting over the other assays as the COVID revenue is starting to come down a little bit and as frankly the lab techs have been able to come up for air and qualify things. So I think we feel very good as evidenced by the underlying trajectory of our core diagnostics business coming back. Sure. I think the -- we clearly do see it getting much bigger in the out years as we come United States. So it will be a few million a quarter right now. Part of that has been particularly in -- it is all European business right now. I think you'll see it build over the year. Now they had some COVID revenue last year. So again, the core business we see it picking up over time here and even starting if we're going to into the New Year. I think we feel really good with what we have and it allows us to be opportunistic. There's nothing that we're lapping right now and we'll continue just to kind of keep our eyes and ears open. I would say I think we feel very good about integrating everything we have right now and that that alone, one way to think about it, we've accelerated multiple years of acquisitions in Diagnostics in a real short period of time. We did three deals in a three to four-month window announcing actual closing three deals in call it a six, seven-month window, that covered our next couple of years and some of what we were hoping to do. So we're now hot and heavy into the integrations and into the execution mode that we tend to be pretty good on the execution side, but we'll continue to keep our eyes open, but there's no gaping holes in our portfolio. Sure, I think overall we've seen pretty good recoveries really in mammography. The core women's health, some of the sexually transmitted infection and Pap tests have not bounced fully back yet, and I think we see that as, it's opportunity for the future when they will get back, but I think we've seen a little more recovery on the mammography side, most places back close to 100%. I think they are very recent trends with delta we're seeing little pockets here and there of small hospital systems here or there and certain geographies that may not be scheduling extra visits right now and things like that. But I don't think it will be material to the quarter going forward. Yes I think we think it is going to play very well in both, but certainly in the multiplex area over time I think it's going to be a great platform for us. The magic for us is, it does give us a completely new growth platform in addition to Panther. So we've got all the additional Panthers we've placed, now it will be building up the menu over time and getting those Panthers working at a higher rate while we -- and subsequently we'll start to bring in the Mobidiag platform, both frankly more around Europe right now it's largely just in a few northern European countries as we expand it across Europe and then ultimately bring it to the States. Sure, I'll certainly take the first, yes we are certainly involved in any of the tenders for COVID revenue. When we establish very strong relationships upfront, it's also well frankly our ability to serve our customers internationally as we said about two thirds of our revenue from COVID last quarter was international. We've built some very strong relationships and frankly the health ministers around the world have known they can count on us and they can count on Panthers to deliver. So we feel pretty good about being involved in those. And back to your first piece on the CDC we feel really, really good about these new guidelines. And specifically, while it leads it up to regional we've got couple of things going for us. First, our own Diagnostics sales team, the calls on physicians and also to educate them, but really more importantly going from effectively and opt into an opt out system. So there have been so many women who should be having these tests done on routine visits that have really had to be opted in and then all the default should go the other way. So is that going to affect this coming quarter? Probably not. We'll we significantly expand the market here in the coming years, we think so and we think it's a great move for human health because a lot of the young women when they are -- if they are at the doctor' s office and they are with their mum and the doctor is asking question about the sexually active to decide do I give this test or not, and therefore okay, wait, if the kid has to answer yes to get the test written. As soon as the default becomes hey, you might not be, but we're just going to order this test anyway, that is a much, I think a much better way for society ultimately to probably have better handle on what's really going on. Great, thank you. Thanks for hanging on as well, we couldn't have cut off. Yes Ryan. I think what we're very encouraged by and give Pete Valenti who has subsequently retired from Hologic, but when he came into the company and joined me in early 2014, our entire goal was to eliminate the boom-bust, the cliffs and the peaks and all that stuff in the Breast Health business, and we've achieved exactly that going to a much more consistent business were both diversifying, but also by bringing additional ideas to the gantries where we continue to do want better gantries along the way make a much more stable. So I think what we see there is a core underlying gantry business and service business, but then also as we're getting into a little more of the disposable stuff and the Breast Surgery stuff and those things, whether it's a bit of Focal and trying to be the markers that SOMATEX brings, now Brevera with the biopsy which is the capital, but really then it has been needle [ph] use is adding these ongoing revenue streams that are a little bit accretive to that underlying market growth that we have. So is Breast Health going to be the fastest growing business? Probably not, but is it going to be comfortably in that range, I think we feel really good about it. And Ryan will yell at Mike afterwards being [indiscernible]."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to Hologic\u2019s Second Quarter Fiscal 2021 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Jenny, and I\u2019m your operator for today\u2019s call. Today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Mike Watts, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, to begin the call.\nMichael Watts: Thank you, Jenny. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us for Hologic\u2019s second quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the Company\u2019s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer. Steve and Karleen both have some prepared remarks, then we will have a question-and-answer session. Our second quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. Finally, a replay of this call will be archived through May 21st. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those that are referenced in the Safe Harbor statement included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. One of these non-GAAP measures is organic revenue. We define organic revenue as constant currency revenue excluding the divested Blood Screening business as well as the acquired Acessa, Biotheranostics and Diagenode businesses. Finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be expressed in constant currency unless otherwise noted. Now I would like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic\u2019s CEO.\nStephen MacMillan: Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to discuss our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. We posted excellent financial results overall, highlighted by best-in-class growth rates. Total revenue was $1.54 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.59, both in line with our guidance. Organic revenue doubled, driven by strong recovery and momentum in our base businesses as well as our continued contributions to the COVID-19 fight. On the bottom line, EPS more than quadrupled. Our diversified business model again demonstrated its value in the second quarter as strong growth rates in our core businesses enabled us to meet our overall guidance even though COVID assay sales were less than expected. Our base Diagnostics business and our Surgical franchise, both finished slightly better than forecast, even while overcoming a tough January for U.S. Healthcare utilization that was driven by increasing COVID cases. And our Breast Health division clearly outperformed as our diversification strategy has led to a faster-than-expected recovery. Karleen will cover the revenue and expense details. But before she does, I would like to discuss two primary topics. When the COVID pandemic began more than a year ago, we set out to accomplish two things in simple terms: first, we committed to make as big an impact as possible against the pandemic. And second, we wanted to ensure that every action we took helped us emerge from the pandemic as a stronger company. We are clearly accomplishing both goals, which makes us more excited than ever about our future. In terms of our first goal, helping fight the pandemic on a global scale. Let\u2019s summarize our contributions by focusing on four key numbers. Our first number is 100 million. Soon, we will ship our 100 millionth COVID test to customers, which included 27 million in the second quarter. At the same time, we have maintained our commitment to provide Women\u2019s Health test by dramatically increasing total molecular diagnostics production capacity. We are on-track with our expansion plans in San Diego and Manchester, U.K. to have the capacity to make at least 75 million tests a quarter across our portfolio by January of 2022. Our second number is 40. This is the number of countries in which we have sold COVID tests as we help battle what has been and continues to be a global crisis. COVID testing continues to strengthen our international business, our relationships with customers, our future prospects in diagnostics and even market access for our other franchises. These COVID sales contributed to total international revenue of $474 million in the second quarter, which represented tremendous growth of 142%. Our third number is 717. This is the number of Panther instruments we have shipped to global customers over the last year, including about 190 in the second quarter. As a reminder, in the five-years before COVID, we shipped an average of 225 Panthers a year. So we have more than tripled that pace over the last 12-months. In addition, we are encouraged that demand for Panthers remains very high and for all of fiscal 2021, we expect to exceed last year\u2019s record placements. Overall, our global installed base now stands at roughly 2,600 instruments, approximately 40% higher than when the pandemic began, giving us a robust platform for future growth as more customers come to appreciate our system\u2019s best-in-class capabilities. And as we have discussed, we are seeing this play out with record levels of new non-COVID business on these Panthers. All these numbers lead to our fourth number, which is $2.35 billion. This is the total COVID assay revenue we have generated on a global basis since the pandemic began, including $680 million in the second quarter. And this has contributed very significantly to operating cash flow of nearly $1.9 billion over the last year. This has enabled us to acquire four companies and sign a deal for a fifth, even while further strengthening our balance sheet. We will discuss our business development activity more in a minute. Before we do that, we wanted to provide our current perspective on the changes in the COVID testing market that you have all seen, with the understanding that the pandemic and its impact on Hologic remain highly unpredictable. Based on publicly available data for the U.S., molecular COVID testing volumes remain very high, much higher than for any other molecular test. But have declined significantly since January based on a better-than-expected vaccine rollout. In this context, our U.S. sales of COVID tests also declined significantly in March and further in April. We believe that molecular COVID testing demand will likely decline further as vaccines roll out, but remain important into fiscal 2022 and beyond. This reflects the ongoing need for accurate clinical diagnosis, the value of testing for infection control purposes and the so-called back to life testing that is helping to reopen economies. Panther installed base at facilities close to the patient and our gold-standard assay performance have us uniquely positioned to gain market share. Customers continue to tell us that Panther and Aptima remain their products of choice and that they intend to consolidate on our platforms. But we believe many of them are using up less automated assays before they expire. Customers had accumulated these tests in the winter when they needed multiple manufacturers to accommodate than higher levels of demand. This dynamic is further supported by the public AdvaMed data that many of you see, which show that industry-wide tests performed are now running ahead of tests shipped, indicating that inventory is being worked down. In response to these market changes, we pivoted in two ways in the second quarter. First, by selling more COVID tests to our base hospital customers who want to bring highly accurate testing closer to their patients, improving turnaround times and clinical relevance. Panther is well positioned for this with first test results being delivered in about three hours. Notably, COVID tests are now being run on Panthers in more than 600 clinical labs in the United States. This means that COVID is the second most decentralized test that we sell, following only Aptima Combo 2, which has been on the U.S. market for roughly 20-years. Second, we pivoted by selling more tests internationally. As everyone has seen in the news, the vaccine rollout is proceeding at different paces around the world. Europe, in particular, has struggled with inoculations, increasing the importance of testing. For example, in the second quarter, almost 40% of our COVID assay revenue came from outside the United States, mainly from Europe. Now let\u2019s shift gears to our second major topic, an update on how the tremendous impact we have made against COVID has strengthened our business for the other side of the pandemic. As many of you will recall, before the pandemic hit, our organic growth rate had been steadily improving to around 5% based on new products, international expansion and our early acquisitions. Now as we begin our annual strategic planning process, we are confident that organic growth for the next several years, excluding COVID assay sales, will be higher than it was before the pandemic hit. In Diagnostics, we have used COVID cash flows to broaden our portfolio by buying assets that are growing faster than our base business. Since the Gen-Probe acquisition in 2012, we had acquired exactly zero companies in Diagnostics. But since late February, we have completed two deals and announced a third, dramatically accelerating our long-standing goal to become a more complete diversified diagnostics leader. In February, we closed our $232 million acquisition of Biotheranostics, a leader in molecular tests for breast and metastatic cancers, enabling us to expand into the adjacent growth market of oncology. This business is off to a very strong start, based mainly on the inclusion of the Breast Cancer Index test in NCCN guidelines to predict the benefit of extended treatment with endocrine therapies. A few days after we closed Biotheranostics, we acquired Diagenode, a Belgian developer and manufacturer of molecular diagnostic assays and epigenetics products for approximately $153 million. Diagenode, which generated more than $30 million of revenue in the last year, will enable us to offer a broader, more differentiated menu of molecular diagnostic tests on our fully automated high-throughput Panther Fusion instrument. We know Diagenode\u2019s capabilities in assay development well, since we have partnered with them since 2016 to develop and manufacture PCR bases assays for Fusion. As you might recall, the ability to leverage external PCR expertise was one of the reasons we developed the Fusion system years ago. Now that Diagenode is part of Hologic, we can accelerate those assay development efforts and make many of their CE Mark PCR tests available on our unique platform, further enhancing European growth. Finally, earlier this month, we announced our agreement to acquire Mobidiag, a Finnish developer of innovative molecular diagnostics tests and instrumentation for approximately $795 million. In contrast to Diagenode, which helps us leverage our Fusion installed base around the world, Mobidiag brings new capabilities that we have been interested in for more than a decade. Specifically, Mobidiag is an innovator in near-patient acute care diagnostics, a large, rapidly growing area that we don\u2019t compete in today. This market encompasses test for respiratory and gastrointestinal conditions, health care-associated infections and antibiotic resistance among others. Having monitored this space closely over the years, we believe Mobidiag\u2019s Novodiag platform is a truly differentiated assay with a unique combination of ease of use, rapid turnaround, multiplexing and low cost. Mobidiag generated more than $40 million of revenue in calendar 2020 with a limited commercial presence and no sales in the United States. So we believe we can accelerate their growth globally, but especially in the United States once we get some of their assays approved here. Before I turn the call over to Karleen, I wanted to touch briefly on how we have also strengthened our Breast and Surgical businesses during the pandemic. In Breast, we have continued to expand on our strategy to diversify the business across the patient continuum of care. We now sell a full portfolio of capital equipment, hardware and software upgrades, interventional tools and service. While the world has been understandably focused on COVID, we have increased our direct presence with Breast Health customers. We have launched new software products based on our investments in artificial intelligence. And we have strengthened our interventional franchise by re-launching Brevera, which is doing very well, and buying SOMATEX, a longtime partner and leading developer of breast cancer markers. Together, all these strategies helped Breast Health outperform in the second quarter with total sales exceeding 2019 levels and global growth of 7.3%. While the mammography market is not quite back to pre-COVID levels, we are very pleased with our competitive position and growth outlook for the future. In Surgical, both our R&D and business development pipelines have been productive. Broadening the portfolio of products that we sell through a high-performing, highly-engaged sales force. New products such as our Fluent Fluid Management System, new hysteroscopes and Acessa\u2019s laparoscopic RF product, ProVu are complementing our market-leading MyoSure and NovaSure devices. As a result, Surgical sales surpassed 2019 levels in the second quarter and grew 6.6% on a global basis, even while overcoming a slow January that resulted from reduced procedures in U.S. regions that were hit hard by COVID. So in conclusion, I want to emphatically state that I have never been more excited or confident in our future. We have responded to the world\u2019s need for COVID testing in a remarkable fashion and will continue to be there for testing needs around the world. Even more importantly, we have literally strengthened every one of our businesses in every geography and added multiple new growth platforms to our company during the last 12-months. I\u2019m truly amazed at what our team has done, and we really look forward to the quarters and years ahead. Now I will turn the call over to Karleen.\nKarleen Oberton: Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I\u2019m going to provide an overview of our divisional sales results, walk through our income statement, touch on a few other key financial metrics and finish with our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. As Steve said, our second quarter results were excellent as revenue and EPS grew significantly compared to the prior year. Reported revenue of 1.54 billion increased 99%. Organically, revenue grew an even 100%, driven by strong growth in our base businesses and a healthy contribution from global COVID testing revenue. We met our top and bottom line guidance even as the COVID testing market changed rapidly late in the quarter. Based on our strong top line, we significantly improved profitability compared to the prior year. As a result, EPS of $2.59 more than quadrupled in the second quarter, increasing 354%. Further, operating cash flow has continued to be exceptionally strong, which I will discuss in a moment. Before I do that, let me provide some detail on our divisional revenue results. In Diagnostics, our largest division, global revenue of 1.065 billion grew 225% in the second quarter. This was driven by molecular where sales increased 378%. Although COVID testing declined sequentially from peak levels in the first quarter, demand is still very high. We shipped about 27 million COVID tests to customers, generating revenue of 680 million globally. Excluding COVID, our base molecular business continue to grow as customers capitalize on the breadth of our assay menu and the strength of Panther\u2019s best-in-class automation. Rounding out Diagnostics, the Cytology & Perinatal businesses grew 1% in the quarter, in line with trends before the pandemic. In Breast Health, global revenue of $336.3 million grew 7%, which we are very pleased with. Revenue also increased sequentially compared to Q1 and exceeded the second quarter of 2019 on a reported basis. The division\u2019s strong performance was well rounded as breast imaging grew 6%, driven by upgrade packages, and the interventional business increased 14%, driven by Brevera. Furthermore, Breast Health achieved growth in disposables, service and even capital versus the prior year period. Although the capital environment probably isn\u2019t fully back to normal, we have been encouraged by the continued improvement in this area as customers have learned to effectively manage through the pandemic and become more comfortable making future investments. In Surgical, second quarter revenue also exceeded 2019 levels, continuing the division\u2019s rapid recovery. Compared to the prior year, sales of 114.2 million grew 7% as elective procedure volumes strengthened throughout the quarter following a challenging January. The improving macro environment, coupled with multiple new products and a motivated sales force gives us confidence in the future trajectory of the Surgical franchise. Lastly, in Skeletal, revenue of 22.6 million declined 7% compared to the prior year. Overall, in terms of geography, domestic sales of 1.06 billion increased 85% on a reported basis. On an organic basis, U.S. revenue was up 87%. Outside the United States, sales of 474 million increased 142%. Organically, sales outside the U.S. grew 141%, a fantastic result that reflects our growing international strength. Now let\u2019s move on to the rest of the P&L for the second quarter. Gross margins of 75% increased 1,400 basis points driven by the sales of our high-margin COVID tests. Total operating expenses of 277.7 million increased 25% in the second quarter. This included about 1.3 million of credits from BARDA associated with the development of our COVID assays. This is about five million less than in Q1. The increase in our operating expenses was driven by investments in R&D and marketing for future growth as well as incremental expense from the acquisitions that Steve discussed. Also remember, that in the second quarter of 2020, we had begun to pull back on spending, given the initial uncertainty of the pandemic. Our non-GAAP tax rate in the quarter is 21.2%, slightly lower than forecast, driven by a favorable geographic mix of income, primarily from sales of COVID-19 assays outside the United States. Putting these all together, operating margin increased 2,540 basis points to 56.9%, and net margin increased 2,380 basis points to 43.8%. As a result, non-GAAP income finished at 674.1 million and non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.59, in line with our guidance in more than four times the prior year period. Before we cover our guidance, I will quickly touch on a few other financial metrics. Driven by demand for our COVID tests and the strong performance of our base business, cash flow from operations was 552 million in the second quarter. These strong cash flows have given us tremendous financial and strategic flexibility. For example, in the second quarter alone, our operating cash flow essentially paid for 568 million of productive capital redeployment. Specifically, we repurchased 1.6 million shares of stock for $120 million, closed the SOMATEX deals for 63 million, acquired Biotheranostics for 232 million and bought Diagenode for 153 million. As Steve said, we believe these acquisitions will make Hologic a stronger company as the pandemic subsides and sets us up for faster growth. Overall, we had 816 million of cash at the end of the second quarter, and our leverage ratio was 0.7 times. We intend to continue to put our cash to work on a combination of division-led, tuck-in acquisitions and share repurchases that improve our top and bottom line growth rates. Finally, ROIC was 33.4% on a trailing 12-month basis, a significant increase of 2,090 basis points. Before we open the call for questions, let me discuss our expectations for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. While we anticipate that fiscal 2021 will be an excellent year for Hologic overall, COVID testing revenue remains highly unpredictable, so we are continuing our recent practice of providing a single quarter of guidance today. In our third quarter of fiscal 2021, we expect strong financial results again with total revenue in the range of one billion to 1.07 billion, representing constant currency growth of 18% to 26% versus the prior year period. As a reminder, in the third quarter of 2019, we generated about 850 million of revenue, which also included the divested Cynosure business, so we expect to grow above those pre-pandemic levels. In our base businesses, we expect continued momentum and recovery to generate very strong revenue growth rates compared to the prior year given the negative impact of the pandemic a year ago. In terms of COVID assay sales, the market remains unpredictable as discussed. While trends seem to be stabilizing today, the environment certainly could change again in May or June, depending on a number of factors, so we are going to be very cautious with our third quarter guidance and get back to our usual practice of providing conservative estimates that we have high visibility on. If demand exceeds our current expectations, we are poised to deliver for our customers. There is a lot we don\u2019t know, but what we do know is that our assays and systems are best-in-class, and that we have Panthers in all the right hospitals and labs. So we are confident that we will get more than our fair share of the ongoing demand. With this background, we expect sales of our COVID test to range from 200 million to 250 million in the third quarter. In addition, COVID-related items in Diagnostics such as collection kits, instruments and ancillaries are expected to be down 40 million to 45 million sequentially. Our third quarter guidance includes about more than $20 million of revenue from SOMATEX, Biotheranostics and Diagenode. Backing this out, as well as nine million of expected Blood Screening revenue, we expect organic revenue growth of 15% to 24% in the quarter. This is excellent growth against a difficult comp as we generated 324 million of COVID assay sales in the prior year period. Beyond revenue, here are a few other points on guidance. Our guidance does not include the impact of the pending Mobidiag acquisition, which is expected to close early in our fourth fiscal quarter. It does, however, include a full quarter of expenses from Biotheranostics and Diagenode, which will contribute to a sequential increase in total operating expenses. Below operating income, I would point out that we expect other expenses net to increase to about 25 million in the third quarter. Our guidance is based on a tax 21.5% and diluted shares outstanding of 261 million for the quarter. All these nets out to expected EPS of $1 to $1.15 in the third quarter. This would translate into very strong growth rates of 33% to 53% that significantly outpaced revenue, even as we increase investments for future growth. As you update your forecast, let me remind you that macro uncertainty due to the pandemic is still high. We would therefore encourage you to model at the middle of our ranges which incorporate both potential upsides and downsides. Before we open the call for questions, let me wrap up by saying that Hologic showed tremendous growth in the second quarter and posted results that met our guidance. We continue to make a huge impact on the pandemic and on Women\u2019s Health globally. Further, with organic investments in multiple acquisitions, I\u2019m confident that we will emerge from the pandemic a stronger, larger, faster-growing company. With that, I will ask the operator to open the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up, then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will go first to Jack Meehan of Nephron Research.\nJack Meehan: Thank you, good afternoon. Steve, Karleen, I appreciate all the color on the many dynamics at play when it comes to COVID testing. I was wondering, as you look at the guidance for the upcoming quarter, how much of the sequential step down would you say is related to kind of burn down of inventory that is in the channel? And if you will humor me, how are you thinking about longer-term demand for COVID testing given all the additional capacity that you are building?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes, Jeff, it is a great question. If we dimensionalize, we clearly see the inventory bleeding down, both in the tail - really throughout last quarter, and we are assuming continuing to bleed down this quarter. The hard part for us, we kind of internally use the toilet paper analogy and I think people can understand this really easy. When households first went into COVID, they are ordering toilet paper from everywhere, right and multiple brands and from multiple vendors. And what clearly happened here, I don\u2019t think it is been as fully grasped in the outside world has been all of the vendors stockpiled as much supply as they could get from multiple vendors because we of course had people on allocation. So when you can\u2019t get enough when do you order and now they are bleeding through that. I think we look forward to the day where that is probably bled down and we are back to tests matching - test chip matching test performed. I think as that comes, that would clearly probably be a little bit of upside. We are being a little cautious in how we are continuing to think about that bleed down. Looking forward to the second part of your question, you have been all over it. Look at everything. I think we still see this as a meaningful business for us in the future. And to put in perspective, the $200 million to $250 million that we have guided to for this quarter, while it looks like a big step down from where we have been, I would remind everybody on this call that is larger than our entire Molecular Diagnostics business ever was pre-COVID. So we are still looking at a big business, and that is why we are continuing to expand our production. And personally, I think we are going to see a pretty strong - we are assuming right now within the U.S., call it, June, July, August could be pretty fallow. I think as things come down, people get up. But dollars to dots, next fall, you know what? People didn\u2019t get the flu this year. They didn\u2019t get sick as people start to get out again, there is going to be a lot of people getting sniffles, getting all kinds of stuff. And whether it is COVID or not, the fear of COVID is going to create an enduring demand. And by that point, all the peripheral vendors candidly will be gone. And it is going to be the big folks with the installed bases and the most automated basis that will prevail. And so I think we feel really good as we listen to all of our customers, they want the automated platforms. They are using up their non-automated stuff just because they bought it, and they can\u2019t wait to really start just running Panthers in our tests. So I don\u2019t want to give you an exact number at this point because I think anybody that does is wildly speculating. But I do think this is going to be a big sizable business for us, certainly well into our next fiscal year. But we are planning a little more cautiously near-term.\nJack Meehan: That makes sense. And pricing looks firm in the quarter at around $25. Do you expect to hold at these levels, given your positioning with the automated system in the market or do you think it makes sense to get a little bit more aggressive here?\nStephen MacMillan: I think we will be more aggressive here as we go forth, particularly as some of our possible vendors buy for, for example, the school contracts that, you know, just got sort of delayed. At this point, as supply has ramped up in our ability, we can offer some of the cost savings through to our customers. And frankly, it will still be very good for us and very good for them. But I would think as we look over the next year, you should expect that to definitely move down. Karleen.\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. I would just say as well, Jack, as international becomes a bigger piece, again we will see the overall average ASP come down for sure.\nOperator: And so we will move to our next question from Dan Leonard of Wells Fargo.\nDaniel Leonard: Thank you. So two questions. First off, it looks like your Diagnostics business, excluding COVID, might have grown about 11% organically, first off, is that correct? And then secondly, why wouldn\u2019t that be a bit better given the easy comp, the tours, the higher Panther installed base, the things we have been talking about?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. Dan, I think a couple of pieces there. First off, we didn\u2019t exactly have an easy comp. Last year, if you recall, in Europe, our Molecular Diagnostics business grew, I think, well over 30% in the quarter. We had actually a monster quarter last year when we reported at this time, so we had a big number. The other piece, candidly, is we are watching the toggle and the shift. So still a huge part of the volume is being used for COVID. I think as we start to shift out here that will start to grow. Now it is also dependent on women going back for their health visits. And the one thing we have certainly seen, and I think this bodes well for the future quarters for us is while women\u2019s visits are still way down, there are still a lot of basically pent-up demand that should come back here over time, but it doesn\u2019t snap back immediately to 100%. A lot of the intercity clinics have been diverted to doing COVID testing as they start to get back up to speed. So in a weird way, I think it gives us more runway going forward, but probably slightly less than exciting in the near-term on necessarily that base. We also have the ancillaries and some of the other stuff that are in those numbers.\nDaniel Leonard: Okay. And then my second question, so the COVID views amongst the peer sets are really diverging this quarter. Some are using the flu analogy for what might be durable. What do you think about that analogy and how defensible then is your position in COVID, given that you hadn\u2019t historically had a whole lot of market share in molecular flu and how important is Mobidiag to this calculus? Thank you.\nStephen MacMillan: Sure. Certainly, over the longer run Mobidiag is going to play beautifully into that. For the coming season, as it relates particularly to the United States, Mobidiag will not be a factor for us. But I still think there is going to be a strong need - there will certainly be the multiplex opportunities out there. But we think there is going to also be a very strong need as we had continued to say through this year to confirm whether something is truly coven or not as all the broad test. So we believe, with our customer base, hospitals, especially key labs, everything else, that there is going to be a meaningful need to confirm whether people have COVID and using a true good molecular platform. Whereas, frankly, traditional flu, you haven\u2019t needed the levels of sensitivity and specificity. When it comes to COVID, people are still going to want that.\nOperator: And moving on, we will hear from Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan.\nTycho Peterson: Hey, thanks. I actually want to follow up on the Mobidiag question and a couple as well on Diagenode. I\u2019m just wondering, Steve, if you could talk a little bit more about the strategy here with Diagenode? You talked about the CE Mark assays infusion, so how do we think about bringing those to the U.S. and time lines to build out the menu? And then similarly, with Mobidiag, you are giving two instruments, the Amplidiag, which similar to Panther, so how do you think about kind of future menu development on those platforms? Obviously, those are multiplexing, but those platforms versus content on Panther?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. I think, clearly, the way we think about Diagenode is all about content on Panther. And particularly, a lot of the - if you look at the European landscape, particularly too, there is a much been a little bit of a competitive disadvantage is why we started to work with Diagenode in the first place. So it is really filling out that menu with largely still a focus on our European business. And I think a totally underappreciated aspect of what has happened to this company in the last 12-months, I would argue, is the strength of our European and frankly, broader international business. We are a completely different player in Europe today when looked at by leading customers, leading governments, everything than where we were 12-months ago. We were barely known, and now we are front and center on so many discussions. So Diagenode is going to play there beautifully. And then for Mobidiag, we really see it, over time, especially getting into the acute care settings as a big, big opportunity. First, obviously, in Europe, where they have already got a little bit of a presence, but ultimately getting everything ported over and cleared here in the United States. That is probably going to be more of a 2024, 2025 massive growth drivers then. We are being a little conservative in terms of when we get all of that proof tier. But it is going to give us another chance to place a box that is a different kind of box with different capabilities closer to the patient setting. So I think a really great technology. We know that was a highly competitive are really pleased we have prevailed in that.\nTycho Peterson: Okay. And then for the follow-up, back to kind of the COVID dynamics. As we think about the Panthers you placed over the past year, what percentage of those went into the reference labs because I think Quest has said they are expecting 50% sequential decline in COVID volumes this quarter. And then on the hospital side, how long do you think that inventory work down last?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes, we are not going to get into the exact split between the reference labs and the hospital labs. I would say they were all meaningful when you look at 717 that we have placed. I think the magic, for us, even with the reference labs as their volumes come down recall, on TIGRIS, we only have four assays approved. On Panther, we have in the teens. So it is immediately opening up the dialogue with those customers to expand our menu, particularly as we come out with the BV/CV other things. So I think that is going to be part of the magic for us as well as being there certainly, if they do end up getting some help on if they get some of the school contracts or other things, but even as we go into next year. So I think we just feel better poised across the board with our Panther placements, which just gives us much more optionality.\nOperator: We will move to our next question from Patrick Donnelly of Citi.\nPatrick Donnelly: Good thanks. Steve, maybe just a follow-up on that last comment. It is great to obviously see the Panther placements, I think, 190 in the quarter. The installed base is obviously much more significant now. Just kind of wondering, I guess, when you think out about the clearly built out a lot of capacity given kind of this unprecedented demand for COVID. Just wondering, in your view, kind of the key pieces that fill that gap as COVID pulls back clearly comping now, but even if that remains some level of volumes, what are the key pieces to kind of fill that and where do you see utilization going on this larger fleet even a couple of years out?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. I think it is hard to probably fully describe our excitement, Patrick, as to where this goes. And let\u2019s take it in simple terms. First off, lab folks have been going on adrenaline for the last year trying to get - there is been so much automated stuff they were dealing with. They all want to consolidate on an automated platform. We are even hearing out of Europe is from a number of customers just recently They just can\u2019t wait to get our Panthers fully up and running because they know they can run them after hours. They don\u2019t need to be handheld. They don\u2019t need people there. And so I think, as you really look at it, everybody is going to go to the best-performing most automated machines with the best menu. And I hate to say it, but we say it all the time, the cream rises to the top. It is hard to beat our Panther system and with our menu. And the number of governors that called us last year early on asking why they wanted more samples was because \"They kept touring the labs in their states and the people kept saying, look, we need Panthers. We want Panthers that is the one we want.\" So I think as this all shakes out here in the coming months, that we will do what we have always done really well and continue to grow our menu and Panther and that volume, which, as you had seen, average revenues per Panther, we have had a tremendous track record over seven, eight, nine years now. That number is just going to continue to go north.\nPatrick Donnelly: That is helpful. And then maybe just focusing on COVID again can you just talk about the trends in the quarter? And clearly, as you noticed, we can all see the data that showed significant softening in March and April. Any metrics you can give around kind of Hologic-specific volume decline? And then going forward, just how you are specifically thinking about your share as the pie continues to shrink here in the U.S. and the OUS I know you guys have some pretty large contracts historically tied to COVID. How much can those help provide a level of stable volumes and should we expect any more of those or is that dialogue quieted down a bit?\nStephen MacMillan: That was a great like five-part follow-up, Patrick. We are going to give you the new award. I will try to get it all. And if I don\u2019t get it, hopefully, Karleen and Mike are paying close attention. In terms of the quarter, January continued to be remarkably strong. So at the time we were sitting here giving our guidance, think about it, only 90-days ago, vaccines were just barely beginning. We were just transitioning from one president to another, vaccines were in the very early days and the post-holiday testing was spiking. So then we clearly saw it kind of turned a little bit in Feb. I think March and April have really been a lot of inventory catch up. And I would argue that that will shake itself out here probably pretty quickly, and then we will be a good place. The longer-term contracts on the last part, it is why we feel really good about a lot of the approaches we have taken with our governments particularly around the world, where we have often signed folks up for six, nine, 12-months contract where we guaranteed them supply and you know as of right now we have not - you want to knock on wood, but every customer that we have sold into has continued to come back and wants to continue to work with us. And I think that is where we feel really good, we know a number of the countries that even early on, we said we couldn\u2019t provide them what they wanted and they went elsewhere they also came back to us. So I think we see this being more persistent and it is where, certainly, our international footprint, particularly Europe and then the Australias and New Zealands of the world. Obviously, we are not a big player in India, so don\u2019t expect anything there. But for the major Western markets, we are in a really good place.\nOperator: And we will move to our next question from Chris Lin of Cowen.\nChris Lin: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two questions. So first, I wanted to follow-up on the COVID-19 dynamic. So Steve, Hologic has meaningfully accelerated organic and inorganic investments due to the cash flow associated with COVID-19. So with this in mind, could you just comment on how lower-than-expected 2019 volume and potential cash flow impact how you think about making these investments going forward? Do you need to pull back or are you still going to invest significantly with the longer-term horizon in mind?\nStephen MacMillan: We don\u2019t need to pull back on anything because none of the forward-looking thinking is any different than what we probably really expected. So I think what has been magical is we have used the cash, and it just kind of worked out really well in terms of the investments that we have made. We never expected this. It is why we didn\u2019t give guidance for the full year. the way we have approached COVID completely has been, look, there is an opportunity here, we are going to try to maximize it for as long as it is there. And eventually, we will get back to our other business. So I think we feel really good. I would also say the balance sheet is even stronger despite being able to buy shares back, done 5 acquisitions, we will still generate a meaningful amount of cash here even in the coming quarters. And candidly, we will probably hit a point where there is only so many more assets we would be able to metabolize in the recent term, especially in the Diagnostics and European footprints. So I wouldn\u2019t expect us to be continuing to try to gobble up as many companies in the coming quarters as we just have. It has been an opportunistic thing, but also no reason to pull back. We are not pulling back on any forward-looking plans.\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. And I would say we are not different from pre-pandemic. We had talked about focused on deploying our free cash flow to share repurchase and tuck-in acquisitions, so we will continue to do that even as the COVID testing comes down.\nChris Lin: Okay. Great. And then for my follow-up question, I think your 10-Q mentioned that chlamydia and gonorrhea volumes were lower on a year-over-year basis. Could you just elaborate how sexual health testing volumes are tracking to pre-pandemic levels and when you see that fully recovering and I guess, specific to Q3, whether you have built into guidance for non-COVID-19 tests? Thank you.\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. So I think what we are seeing is that business is still recovering, that women still aren\u2019t getting back to their well visits at the pre-pandemic levels, coupled with a temporary guideline from the CDC about not doing a screening for asymptomatic women. So I think that is some of the pressure we see here in the current quarter. I think we are assuming that will continue into the next quarter, probably some improvement on well women visits, but we fully expect that, that business will recover as again we kind of get back to pre-pandemic life.\nOperator: And we will go next to Dan Brennan of UBS.\nDaniel Brennan: Great thanks for taking the questions. Steve, you talked about in the opening remarks how the company was growing 5% pre-COVID. And now, certainly, given the acquisitions and the installed base, you expect to be a higher level. I haven\u2019t heard the question asked, maybe I missed it, but can you elaborate a little bit on that? Give us a sense of what you are thinking about go-forward growth rate for Hologic? And any other kind of building blocks to get to that number?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. Dan, we are not going to articulate on this call exactly what that looks like. But clearly, as you know, for years, we were kind of in that three to four-ish range. We were moving it up into that five range. And I think as we look at what we have been able to do both organically, but really strengthened - the acquisitions we have been able to do put us a lot better off than if COVID hadn\u2019t hit, right. We probably wouldn\u2019t have bought Mobidiag, Biotheranostics, all of these things, all of which should be accretive to that growth rate. So do we see us moving a little north of that 5%? Yes. Are we ready to commit to an exact range? We have our June Board meeting where we will be looking at our strat plan with our Board. But I can just tell you the early roll-ups, I think we look at every business being able to be at least mid-single, if not moving into the higher single-digit and particularly with our international business. Now on a completely different footing than it ever was, we think we will be able to really drive all of our franchises stronger outside the U.S. So I think it puts us clearly north of 5, which I think is a very meaningful step-up for this company. It is not something we have had from a sustained growth, and I think that should not be lost. And I\u2019m glad you asked about it.\nDaniel Brennan: Great. Thank you Steve. And then as a follow-up, I know It is been asked a number of times. I\u2019m just wondering, given the COVID strength that you have had and obviously, the rate of decay that we see will be important for your top line results. But just how do you think about the right mix, if you will, of testing as we move out beyond this year into next and we get to a steady state on COVID between PCR and maybe rapid testing. I think you discussed earlier the accuracy is really important here, much more so than flu. So we are just trying to try to think about what the right numbers to plug into models and kind of that aspect will help in terms of the mix that you see unfolding as COVID flows. Thank you.\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. Thanks, Dan. I think consider us biased because we are in the molecular space. But I think as more and more people have had bad experiences candidly with rapid tests. And I think all of us know a number of people who have had false results. I think the dynamic is going to play out where there is going to be less people racing out to need the immediate test and to try to get something super quick. And as you move into a vaccinated world and more of an ongoing monitoring where a few hours isn\u2019t going to make a difference, I think it is going to evolve much more towards most diagnostic testing, which is you want to use the most sensitive and most specific tests. And we just think that is going to ultimately prevail and that a lot of the euphoria and urgency and design - even some of these people calling for - everybody would be taking a test every day, dah, dah, dah, you know what, it is just we don\u2019t see it that way. Ultimately, the market will decide and you can come back and slap us upside our heads if we are wrong. But I think we see it playing out as a more traditional market overtime where it goes to our advantage. Thanks.\nOperator: And we will go next to Anthony Petrone of Jefferies.\nAnthony Petrone: Thanks and few follow-ups on just all around Diagnostics and one on capital. Steve, maybe in the 200 to 250, if you could give us a break on U.S. and Europe I know, in the past few quarters, Europe, as it relates to COVID testing, was underweighted for Hologic, what was growing. So I\u2019m just wondering how Europe plays out when there is still heightened pandemic there? And then on Mobidiag and Diagenode, I\u2019m wondering what the combined installed base of platforms is there and is there a pathway to consolidating those tests on Panther overtime?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. In terms of the first part, the COVID, I think we will see Europe being a bigger percentage of our revenue probably this quarter than even the 40%, I think part of our business, we feel really good about the longer-term contracts we booked with Europe and obviously, with the rollout of the vaccinations not going nearly as rapidly there. I feel pretty good about the persistence of the COVID testing in Europe. And then Mike is waving his hand here.\nMichael Watts: So Anthony, on the second piece about installed base, you remember Diagenode, think of Diagenode as an assay factory. So the priority there is to really get their PCR expertise in those tests onto our Fusion installed base, right, which is roughly 15 or so, 1 5 percent, of the 2,600 that we have out in the field. Mobidiag is a little bit of a different situation. The focus there is really on their Novodiag instrument, which is the more rapid turnaround instrument, and they are really just getting started with a relatively small installed base, even in Europe. And in the United States, I don\u2019t think they have any revenue, so there is clearly some big opportunity there on that Novodiag instrument.\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. It will be more focused on driving that instrument than necessarily taking their stuff over to Panther. Thanks.\nAnthony Petrone: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: And we will go to that last question from Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is [Cindy] on for Vijay. We notice the gross margin this quarter was down about 200 basis points sequentially. Could you - drivers behind that decline?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. That is simply just because of the lower COVID revenue. So COVID revenue was about 745 million in Q1 and 680 million in Q2, so that decline in that very accretive gross margin revenue was the reason for the decline. But note, it is still at - 75% is pretty exceptional.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks.\nOperator: And we will go to Ivy Ma of Bank of America.\nXiaoxiao Ma: Hi, thank you for squeezing me in. So just wanted to follow-up on the broad screening opportunity. Steve, as you mentioned earlier, the school programs sort of got delayed. So just wanted to see if there is any details you could share around upcoming catalysts and when we could expect those would be helpful.\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. I think the broad approach we are taking is just trying to be there for our customers. If some get the school contracts, that would be great, we will be there for them. If they don\u2019t, we will be supporting other stuff. So I think that is probably the only potential bigger catalyst, I think, Ivy on the horizon, and obviously, that will really kick in for the fall. But I think there will be ways that, obviously, we will be working with various customers to be able to help support any of those initiatives.\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. And we have the pooling claim as well, which will be helpful for those screening programs.\nXiaoxiao Ma: Great. And a quick follow-up for Karleen. Could you maybe comment more on the margin profile of the recent acquisitions and any opportunities for margin upside from those and how long those might take? Thank you.\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. I think we had talked about Biotheranostics is probably a little accretive to the overall gross margin profile of the company, but more in line with diagnostics. And I would think that Diagenode, at this point, may be a little less than the overall average and Mobidiag would be a little less than the average at this point. But those are things that as we build those installed base and grow those revenues they should get in line.\nOperator: Thank you. That is all the time we have for questions today. This now concludes Hologic\u2019s second quarter fiscal 2021 earnings conference call. Have a good evening.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Karleen Oberton",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'm going to provide an overview of our divisional sales results, walk through our income statement, touch on a few other key financial metrics and finish with our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. As Steve said, our second quarter results were excellent as revenue and EPS grew significantly compared to the prior year. Reported revenue of 1.54 billion increased 99%. Organically, revenue grew an even 100%, driven by strong growth in our base businesses and a healthy contribution from global COVID testing revenue. We met our top and bottom line guidance even as the COVID testing market changed rapidly late in the quarter. Based on our strong top line, we significantly improved profitability compared to the prior year. As a result, EPS of $2.59 more than quadrupled in the second quarter, increasing 354%. Further, operating cash flow has continued to be exceptionally strong, which I will discuss in a moment. Before I do that, let me provide some detail on our divisional revenue results. In Diagnostics, our largest division, global revenue of 1.065 billion grew 225% in the second quarter. This was driven by molecular where sales increased 378%. Although COVID testing declined sequentially from peak levels in the first quarter, demand is still very high. We shipped about 27 million COVID tests to customers, generating revenue of 680 million globally. Excluding COVID, our base molecular business continue to grow as customers capitalize on the breadth of our assay menu and the strength of Panther's best-in-class automation. Rounding out Diagnostics, the Cytology & Perinatal businesses grew 1% in the quarter, in line with trends before the pandemic. In Breast Health, global revenue of $336.3 million grew 7%, which we are very pleased with. Revenue also increased sequentially compared to Q1 and exceeded the second quarter of 2019 on a reported basis. The division's strong performance was well rounded as breast imaging grew 6%, driven by upgrade packages, and the interventional business increased 14%, driven by Brevera. Furthermore, Breast Health achieved growth in disposables, service and even capital versus the prior year period. Although the capital environment probably isn't fully back to normal, we have been encouraged by the continued improvement in this area as customers have learned to effectively manage through the pandemic and become more comfortable making future investments. In Surgical, second quarter revenue also exceeded 2019 levels, continuing the division's rapid recovery. Compared to the prior year, sales of 114.2 million grew 7% as elective procedure volumes strengthened throughout the quarter following a challenging January. The improving macro environment, coupled with multiple new products and a motivated sales force gives us confidence in the future trajectory of the Surgical franchise. Lastly, in Skeletal, revenue of 22.6 million declined 7% compared to the prior year. Overall, in terms of geography, domestic sales of 1.06 billion increased 85% on a reported basis. On an organic basis, U.S. revenue was up 87%. Outside the United States, sales of 474 million increased 142%. Organically, sales outside the U.S. grew 141%, a fantastic result that reflects our growing international strength. Now let's move on to the rest of the P&L for the second quarter. Gross margins of 75% increased 1,400 basis points driven by the sales of our high-margin COVID tests. Total operating expenses of 277.7 million increased 25% in the second quarter. This included about 1.3 million of credits from BARDA associated with the development of our COVID assays. This is about five million less than in Q1. The increase in our operating expenses was driven by investments in R&D and marketing for future growth as well as incremental expense from the acquisitions that Steve discussed. Also remember, that in the second quarter of 2020, we had begun to pull back on spending, given the initial uncertainty of the pandemic. Our non-GAAP tax rate in the quarter is 21.2%, slightly lower than forecast, driven by a favorable geographic mix of income, primarily from sales of COVID-19 assays outside the United States. Putting these all together, operating margin increased 2,540 basis points to 56.9%, and net margin increased 2,380 basis points to 43.8%. As a result, non-GAAP income finished at 674.1 million and non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.59, in line with our guidance in more than four times the prior year period. Before we cover our guidance, I will quickly touch on a few other financial metrics. Driven by demand for our COVID tests and the strong performance of our base business, cash flow from operations was 552 million in the second quarter. These strong cash flows have given us tremendous financial and strategic flexibility. For example, in the second quarter alone, our operating cash flow essentially paid for 568 million of productive capital redeployment. Specifically, we repurchased 1.6 million shares of stock for $120 million, closed the SOMATEX deals for 63 million, acquired Biotheranostics for 232 million and bought Diagenode for 153 million. As Steve said, we believe these acquisitions will make Hologic a stronger company as the pandemic subsides and sets us up for faster growth. Overall, we had 816 million of cash at the end of the second quarter, and our leverage ratio was 0.7 times. We intend to continue to put our cash to work on a combination of division-led, tuck-in acquisitions and share repurchases that improve our top and bottom line growth rates. Finally, ROIC was 33.4% on a trailing 12-month basis, a significant increase of 2,090 basis points. Before we open the call for questions, let me discuss our expectations for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. While we anticipate that fiscal 2021 will be an excellent year for Hologic overall, COVID testing revenue remains highly unpredictable, so we are continuing our recent practice of providing a single quarter of guidance today. In our third quarter of fiscal 2021, we expect strong financial results again with total revenue in the range of one billion to 1.07 billion, representing constant currency growth of 18% to 26% versus the prior year period. As a reminder, in the third quarter of 2019, we generated about 850 million of revenue, which also included the divested Cynosure business, so we expect to grow above those pre-pandemic levels. In our base businesses, we expect continued momentum and recovery to generate very strong revenue growth rates compared to the prior year given the negative impact of the pandemic a year ago. In terms of COVID assay sales, the market remains unpredictable as discussed. While trends seem to be stabilizing today, the environment certainly could change again in May or June, depending on a number of factors, so we are going to be very cautious with our third quarter guidance and get back to our usual practice of providing conservative estimates that we have high visibility on. If demand exceeds our current expectations, we are poised to deliver for our customers. There is a lot we don't know, but what we do know is that our assays and systems are best-in-class, and that we have Panthers in all the right hospitals and labs. So we are confident that we will get more than our fair share of the ongoing demand. With this background, we expect sales of our COVID test to range from 200 million to 250 million in the third quarter. In addition, COVID-related items in Diagnostics such as collection kits, instruments and ancillaries are expected to be down 40 million to 45 million sequentially. Our third quarter guidance includes about more than $20 million of revenue from SOMATEX, Biotheranostics and Diagenode. Backing this out, as well as nine million of expected Blood Screening revenue, we expect organic revenue growth of 15% to 24% in the quarter. This is excellent growth against a difficult comp as we generated 324 million of COVID assay sales in the prior year period. Beyond revenue, here are a few other points on guidance. Our guidance does not include the impact of the pending Mobidiag acquisition, which is expected to close early in our fourth fiscal quarter. It does, however, include a full quarter of expenses from Biotheranostics and Diagenode, which will contribute to a sequential increase in total operating expenses. Below operating income, I would point out that we expect other expenses net to increase to about 25 million in the third quarter. Our guidance is based on a tax 21.5% and diluted shares outstanding of 261 million for the quarter. All these nets out to expected EPS of $1 to $1.15 in the third quarter. This would translate into very strong growth rates of 33% to 53% that significantly outpaced revenue, even as we increase investments for future growth. As you update your forecast, let me remind you that macro uncertainty due to the pandemic is still high. We would therefore encourage you to model at the middle of our ranges which incorporate both potential upsides and downsides. Before we open the call for questions, let me wrap up by saying that Hologic showed tremendous growth in the second quarter and posted results that met our guidance. We continue to make a huge impact on the pandemic and on Women's Health globally. Further, with organic investments in multiple acquisitions, I'm confident that we will emerge from the pandemic a stronger, larger, faster-growing company. With that, I will ask the operator to open the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up, then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question. Yes. I would just say as well, Jack, as international becomes a bigger piece, again we will see the overall average ASP come down for sure. Yes. And I would say we are not different from pre-pandemic. We had talked about focused on deploying our free cash flow to share repurchase and tuck-in acquisitions, so we will continue to do that even as the COVID testing comes down. Yes. So I think what we are seeing is that business is still recovering, that women still aren't getting back to their well visits at the pre-pandemic levels, coupled with a temporary guideline from the CDC about not doing a screening for asymptomatic women. So I think that is some of the pressure we see here in the current quarter. I think we are assuming that will continue into the next quarter, probably some improvement on well women visits, but we fully expect that, that business will recover as again we kind of get back to pre-pandemic life. Yes. That is simply just because of the lower COVID revenue. So COVID revenue was about 745 million in Q1 and 680 million in Q2, so that decline in that very accretive gross margin revenue was the reason for the decline. But note, it is still at - 75% is pretty exceptional. Yes. And we have the pooling claim as well, which will be helpful for those screening programs. Yes. I think we had talked about Biotheranostics is probably a little accretive to the overall gross margin profile of the company, but more in line with diagnostics. And I would think that Diagenode, at this point, may be a little less than the overall average and Mobidiag would be a little less than the average at this point. But those are things that as we build those installed base and grow those revenues they should get in line."

            "name": "Stephen MacMillan",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to discuss our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. We posted excellent financial results overall, highlighted by best-in-class growth rates. Total revenue was $1.54 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.59, both in line with our guidance. Organic revenue doubled, driven by strong recovery and momentum in our base businesses as well as our continued contributions to the COVID-19 fight. On the bottom line, EPS more than quadrupled. Our diversified business model again demonstrated its value in the second quarter as strong growth rates in our core businesses enabled us to meet our overall guidance even though COVID assay sales were less than expected. Our base Diagnostics business and our Surgical franchise, both finished slightly better than forecast, even while overcoming a tough January for U.S. Healthcare utilization that was driven by increasing COVID cases. And our Breast Health division clearly outperformed as our diversification strategy has led to a faster-than-expected recovery. Karleen will cover the revenue and expense details. But before she does, I would like to discuss two primary topics. When the COVID pandemic began more than a year ago, we set out to accomplish two things in simple terms: first, we committed to make as big an impact as possible against the pandemic. And second, we wanted to ensure that every action we took helped us emerge from the pandemic as a stronger company. We are clearly accomplishing both goals, which makes us more excited than ever about our future. In terms of our first goal, helping fight the pandemic on a global scale. Let's summarize our contributions by focusing on four key numbers. Our first number is 100 million. Soon, we will ship our 100 millionth COVID test to customers, which included 27 million in the second quarter. At the same time, we have maintained our commitment to provide Women's Health test by dramatically increasing total molecular diagnostics production capacity. We are on-track with our expansion plans in San Diego and Manchester, U.K. to have the capacity to make at least 75 million tests a quarter across our portfolio by January of 2022. Our second number is 40. This is the number of countries in which we have sold COVID tests as we help battle what has been and continues to be a global crisis. COVID testing continues to strengthen our international business, our relationships with customers, our future prospects in diagnostics and even market access for our other franchises. These COVID sales contributed to total international revenue of $474 million in the second quarter, which represented tremendous growth of 142%. Our third number is 717. This is the number of Panther instruments we have shipped to global customers over the last year, including about 190 in the second quarter. As a reminder, in the five-years before COVID, we shipped an average of 225 Panthers a year. So we have more than tripled that pace over the last 12-months. In addition, we are encouraged that demand for Panthers remains very high and for all of fiscal 2021, we expect to exceed last year's record placements. Overall, our global installed base now stands at roughly 2,600 instruments, approximately 40% higher than when the pandemic began, giving us a robust platform for future growth as more customers come to appreciate our system's best-in-class capabilities. And as we have discussed, we are seeing this play out with record levels of new non-COVID business on these Panthers. All these numbers lead to our fourth number, which is $2.35 billion. This is the total COVID assay revenue we have generated on a global basis since the pandemic began, including $680 million in the second quarter. And this has contributed very significantly to operating cash flow of nearly $1.9 billion over the last year. This has enabled us to acquire four companies and sign a deal for a fifth, even while further strengthening our balance sheet. We will discuss our business development activity more in a minute. Before we do that, we wanted to provide our current perspective on the changes in the COVID testing market that you have all seen, with the understanding that the pandemic and its impact on Hologic remain highly unpredictable. Based on publicly available data for the U.S., molecular COVID testing volumes remain very high, much higher than for any other molecular test. But have declined significantly since January based on a better-than-expected vaccine rollout. In this context, our U.S. sales of COVID tests also declined significantly in March and further in April. We believe that molecular COVID testing demand will likely decline further as vaccines roll out, but remain important into fiscal 2022 and beyond. This reflects the ongoing need for accurate clinical diagnosis, the value of testing for infection control purposes and the so-called back to life testing that is helping to reopen economies. Panther installed base at facilities close to the patient and our gold-standard assay performance have us uniquely positioned to gain market share. Customers continue to tell us that Panther and Aptima remain their products of choice and that they intend to consolidate on our platforms. But we believe many of them are using up less automated assays before they expire. Customers had accumulated these tests in the winter when they needed multiple manufacturers to accommodate than higher levels of demand. This dynamic is further supported by the public AdvaMed data that many of you see, which show that industry-wide tests performed are now running ahead of tests shipped, indicating that inventory is being worked down. In response to these market changes, we pivoted in two ways in the second quarter. First, by selling more COVID tests to our base hospital customers who want to bring highly accurate testing closer to their patients, improving turnaround times and clinical relevance. Panther is well positioned for this with first test results being delivered in about three hours. Notably, COVID tests are now being run on Panthers in more than 600 clinical labs in the United States. This means that COVID is the second most decentralized test that we sell, following only Aptima Combo 2, which has been on the U.S. market for roughly 20-years. Second, we pivoted by selling more tests internationally. As everyone has seen in the news, the vaccine rollout is proceeding at different paces around the world. Europe, in particular, has struggled with inoculations, increasing the importance of testing. For example, in the second quarter, almost 40% of our COVID assay revenue came from outside the United States, mainly from Europe. Now let's shift gears to our second major topic, an update on how the tremendous impact we have made against COVID has strengthened our business for the other side of the pandemic. As many of you will recall, before the pandemic hit, our organic growth rate had been steadily improving to around 5% based on new products, international expansion and our early acquisitions. Now as we begin our annual strategic planning process, we are confident that organic growth for the next several years, excluding COVID assay sales, will be higher than it was before the pandemic hit. In Diagnostics, we have used COVID cash flows to broaden our portfolio by buying assets that are growing faster than our base business. Since the Gen-Probe acquisition in 2012, we had acquired exactly zero companies in Diagnostics. But since late February, we have completed two deals and announced a third, dramatically accelerating our long-standing goal to become a more complete diversified diagnostics leader. In February, we closed our $232 million acquisition of Biotheranostics, a leader in molecular tests for breast and metastatic cancers, enabling us to expand into the adjacent growth market of oncology. This business is off to a very strong start, based mainly on the inclusion of the Breast Cancer Index test in NCCN guidelines to predict the benefit of extended treatment with endocrine therapies. A few days after we closed Biotheranostics, we acquired Diagenode, a Belgian developer and manufacturer of molecular diagnostic assays and epigenetics products for approximately $153 million. Diagenode, which generated more than $30 million of revenue in the last year, will enable us to offer a broader, more differentiated menu of molecular diagnostic tests on our fully automated high-throughput Panther Fusion instrument. We know Diagenode's capabilities in assay development well, since we have partnered with them since 2016 to develop and manufacture PCR bases assays for Fusion. As you might recall, the ability to leverage external PCR expertise was one of the reasons we developed the Fusion system years ago. Now that Diagenode is part of Hologic, we can accelerate those assay development efforts and make many of their CE Mark PCR tests available on our unique platform, further enhancing European growth. Finally, earlier this month, we announced our agreement to acquire Mobidiag, a Finnish developer of innovative molecular diagnostics tests and instrumentation for approximately $795 million. In contrast to Diagenode, which helps us leverage our Fusion installed base around the world, Mobidiag brings new capabilities that we have been interested in for more than a decade. Specifically, Mobidiag is an innovator in near-patient acute care diagnostics, a large, rapidly growing area that we don't compete in today. This market encompasses test for respiratory and gastrointestinal conditions, health care-associated infections and antibiotic resistance among others. Having monitored this space closely over the years, we believe Mobidiag's Novodiag platform is a truly differentiated assay with a unique combination of ease of use, rapid turnaround, multiplexing and low cost. Mobidiag generated more than $40 million of revenue in calendar 2020 with a limited commercial presence and no sales in the United States. So we believe we can accelerate their growth globally, but especially in the United States once we get some of their assays approved here. Before I turn the call over to Karleen, I wanted to touch briefly on how we have also strengthened our Breast and Surgical businesses during the pandemic. In Breast, we have continued to expand on our strategy to diversify the business across the patient continuum of care. We now sell a full portfolio of capital equipment, hardware and software upgrades, interventional tools and service. While the world has been understandably focused on COVID, we have increased our direct presence with Breast Health customers. We have launched new software products based on our investments in artificial intelligence. And we have strengthened our interventional franchise by re-launching Brevera, which is doing very well, and buying SOMATEX, a longtime partner and leading developer of breast cancer markers. Together, all these strategies helped Breast Health outperform in the second quarter with total sales exceeding 2019 levels and global growth of 7.3%. While the mammography market is not quite back to pre-COVID levels, we are very pleased with our competitive position and growth outlook for the future. In Surgical, both our R&D and business development pipelines have been productive. Broadening the portfolio of products that we sell through a high-performing, highly-engaged sales force. New products such as our Fluent Fluid Management System, new hysteroscopes and Acessa's laparoscopic RF product, ProVu are complementing our market-leading MyoSure and NovaSure devices. As a result, Surgical sales surpassed 2019 levels in the second quarter and grew 6.6% on a global basis, even while overcoming a slow January that resulted from reduced procedures in U.S. regions that were hit hard by COVID. So in conclusion, I want to emphatically state that I have never been more excited or confident in our future. We have responded to the world's need for COVID testing in a remarkable fashion and will continue to be there for testing needs around the world. Even more importantly, we have literally strengthened every one of our businesses in every geography and added multiple new growth platforms to our company during the last 12-months. I'm truly amazed at what our team has done, and we really look forward to the quarters and years ahead. Now I will turn the call over to Karleen. Yes, Jeff, it is a great question. If we dimensionalize, we clearly see the inventory bleeding down, both in the tail - really throughout last quarter, and we are assuming continuing to bleed down this quarter. The hard part for us, we kind of internally use the toilet paper analogy and I think people can understand this really easy. When households first went into COVID, they are ordering toilet paper from everywhere, right and multiple brands and from multiple vendors. And what clearly happened here, I don't think it is been as fully grasped in the outside world has been all of the vendors stockpiled as much supply as they could get from multiple vendors because we of course had people on allocation. So when you can't get enough when do you order and now they are bleeding through that. I think we look forward to the day where that is probably bled down and we are back to tests matching - test chip matching test performed. I think as that comes, that would clearly probably be a little bit of upside. We are being a little cautious in how we are continuing to think about that bleed down. Looking forward to the second part of your question, you have been all over it. Look at everything. I think we still see this as a meaningful business for us in the future. And to put in perspective, the $200 million to $250 million that we have guided to for this quarter, while it looks like a big step down from where we have been, I would remind everybody on this call that is larger than our entire Molecular Diagnostics business ever was pre-COVID. So we are still looking at a big business, and that is why we are continuing to expand our production. And personally, I think we are going to see a pretty strong - we are assuming right now within the U.S., call it, June, July, August could be pretty fallow. I think as things come down, people get up. But dollars to dots, next fall, you know what? People didn't get the flu this year. They didn't get sick as people start to get out again, there is going to be a lot of people getting sniffles, getting all kinds of stuff. And whether it is COVID or not, the fear of COVID is going to create an enduring demand. And by that point, all the peripheral vendors candidly will be gone. And it is going to be the big folks with the installed bases and the most automated basis that will prevail. And so I think we feel really good as we listen to all of our customers, they want the automated platforms. They are using up their non-automated stuff just because they bought it, and they can't wait to really start just running Panthers in our tests. So I don't want to give you an exact number at this point because I think anybody that does is wildly speculating. But I do think this is going to be a big sizable business for us, certainly well into our next fiscal year. But we are planning a little more cautiously near-term. I think we will be more aggressive here as we go forth, particularly as some of our possible vendors buy for, for example, the school contracts that, you know, just got sort of delayed. At this point, as supply has ramped up in our ability, we can offer some of the cost savings through to our customers. And frankly, it will still be very good for us and very good for them. But I would think as we look over the next year, you should expect that to definitely move down. Karleen. Yes. Dan, I think a couple of pieces there. First off, we didn't exactly have an easy comp. Last year, if you recall, in Europe, our Molecular Diagnostics business grew, I think, well over 30% in the quarter. We had actually a monster quarter last year when we reported at this time, so we had a big number. The other piece, candidly, is we are watching the toggle and the shift. So still a huge part of the volume is being used for COVID. I think as we start to shift out here that will start to grow. Now it is also dependent on women going back for their health visits. And the one thing we have certainly seen, and I think this bodes well for the future quarters for us is while women's visits are still way down, there are still a lot of basically pent-up demand that should come back here over time, but it doesn't snap back immediately to 100%. A lot of the intercity clinics have been diverted to doing COVID testing as they start to get back up to speed. So in a weird way, I think it gives us more runway going forward, but probably slightly less than exciting in the near-term on necessarily that base. We also have the ancillaries and some of the other stuff that are in those numbers. Sure. Certainly, over the longer run Mobidiag is going to play beautifully into that. For the coming season, as it relates particularly to the United States, Mobidiag will not be a factor for us. But I still think there is going to be a strong need - there will certainly be the multiplex opportunities out there. But we think there is going to also be a very strong need as we had continued to say through this year to confirm whether something is truly coven or not as all the broad test. So we believe, with our customer base, hospitals, especially key labs, everything else, that there is going to be a meaningful need to confirm whether people have COVID and using a true good molecular platform. Whereas, frankly, traditional flu, you haven't needed the levels of sensitivity and specificity. When it comes to COVID, people are still going to want that. Yes. I think, clearly, the way we think about Diagenode is all about content on Panther. And particularly, a lot of the - if you look at the European landscape, particularly too, there is a much been a little bit of a competitive disadvantage is why we started to work with Diagenode in the first place. So it is really filling out that menu with largely still a focus on our European business. And I think a totally underappreciated aspect of what has happened to this company in the last 12-months, I would argue, is the strength of our European and frankly, broader international business. We are a completely different player in Europe today when looked at by leading customers, leading governments, everything than where we were 12-months ago. We were barely known, and now we are front and center on so many discussions. So Diagenode is going to play there beautifully. And then for Mobidiag, we really see it, over time, especially getting into the acute care settings as a big, big opportunity. First, obviously, in Europe, where they have already got a little bit of a presence, but ultimately getting everything ported over and cleared here in the United States. That is probably going to be more of a 2024, 2025 massive growth drivers then. We are being a little conservative in terms of when we get all of that proof tier. But it is going to give us another chance to place a box that is a different kind of box with different capabilities closer to the patient setting. So I think a really great technology. We know that was a highly competitive are really pleased we have prevailed in that. Yes, we are not going to get into the exact split between the reference labs and the hospital labs. I would say they were all meaningful when you look at 717 that we have placed. I think the magic, for us, even with the reference labs as their volumes come down recall, on TIGRIS, we only have four assays approved. On Panther, we have in the teens. So it is immediately opening up the dialogue with those customers to expand our menu, particularly as we come out with the BV/CV other things. So I think that is going to be part of the magic for us as well as being there certainly, if they do end up getting some help on if they get some of the school contracts or other things, but even as we go into next year. So I think we just feel better poised across the board with our Panther placements, which just gives us much more optionality. Yes. I think it is hard to probably fully describe our excitement, Patrick, as to where this goes. And let's take it in simple terms. First off, lab folks have been going on adrenaline for the last year trying to get - there is been so much automated stuff they were dealing with. They all want to consolidate on an automated platform. We are even hearing out of Europe is from a number of customers just recently They just can't wait to get our Panthers fully up and running because they know they can run them after hours. They don't need to be handheld. They don't need people there. And so I think, as you really look at it, everybody is going to go to the best-performing most automated machines with the best menu. And I hate to say it, but we say it all the time, the cream rises to the top. It is hard to beat our Panther system and with our menu. And the number of governors that called us last year early on asking why they wanted more samples was because \"They kept touring the labs in their states and the people kept saying, look, we need Panthers. We want Panthers that is the one we want.\" So I think as this all shakes out here in the coming months, that we will do what we have always done really well and continue to grow our menu and Panther and that volume, which, as you had seen, average revenues per Panther, we have had a tremendous track record over seven, eight, nine years now. That number is just going to continue to go north. That was a great like five-part follow-up, Patrick. We are going to give you the new award. I will try to get it all. And if I don't get it, hopefully, Karleen and Mike are paying close attention. In terms of the quarter, January continued to be remarkably strong. So at the time we were sitting here giving our guidance, think about it, only 90-days ago, vaccines were just barely beginning. We were just transitioning from one president to another, vaccines were in the very early days and the post-holiday testing was spiking. So then we clearly saw it kind of turned a little bit in Feb. I think March and April have really been a lot of inventory catch up. And I would argue that that will shake itself out here probably pretty quickly, and then we will be a good place. The longer-term contracts on the last part, it is why we feel really good about a lot of the approaches we have taken with our governments particularly around the world, where we have often signed folks up for six, nine, 12-months contract where we guaranteed them supply and you know as of right now we have not - you want to knock on wood, but every customer that we have sold into has continued to come back and wants to continue to work with us. And I think that is where we feel really good, we know a number of the countries that even early on, we said we couldn't provide them what they wanted and they went elsewhere they also came back to us. So I think we see this being more persistent and it is where, certainly, our international footprint, particularly Europe and then the Australias and New Zealands of the world. Obviously, we are not a big player in India, so don't expect anything there. But for the major Western markets, we are in a really good place. We don't need to pull back on anything because none of the forward-looking thinking is any different than what we probably really expected. So I think what has been magical is we have used the cash, and it just kind of worked out really well in terms of the investments that we have made. We never expected this. It is why we didn't give guidance for the full year. the way we have approached COVID completely has been, look, there is an opportunity here, we are going to try to maximize it for as long as it is there. And eventually, we will get back to our other business. So I think we feel really good. I would also say the balance sheet is even stronger despite being able to buy shares back, done 5 acquisitions, we will still generate a meaningful amount of cash here even in the coming quarters. And candidly, we will probably hit a point where there is only so many more assets we would be able to metabolize in the recent term, especially in the Diagnostics and European footprints. So I wouldn't expect us to be continuing to try to gobble up as many companies in the coming quarters as we just have. It has been an opportunistic thing, but also no reason to pull back. We are not pulling back on any forward-looking plans. Yes. Dan, we are not going to articulate on this call exactly what that looks like. But clearly, as you know, for years, we were kind of in that three to four-ish range. We were moving it up into that five range. And I think as we look at what we have been able to do both organically, but really strengthened - the acquisitions we have been able to do put us a lot better off than if COVID hadn't hit, right. We probably wouldn't have bought Mobidiag, Biotheranostics, all of these things, all of which should be accretive to that growth rate. So do we see us moving a little north of that 5%? Yes. Are we ready to commit to an exact range? We have our June Board meeting where we will be looking at our strat plan with our Board. But I can just tell you the early roll-ups, I think we look at every business being able to be at least mid-single, if not moving into the higher single-digit and particularly with our international business. Now on a completely different footing than it ever was, we think we will be able to really drive all of our franchises stronger outside the U.S. So I think it puts us clearly north of 5, which I think is a very meaningful step-up for this company. It is not something we have had from a sustained growth, and I think that should not be lost. And I'm glad you asked about it. Yes. Thanks, Dan. I think consider us biased because we are in the molecular space. But I think as more and more people have had bad experiences candidly with rapid tests. And I think all of us know a number of people who have had false results. I think the dynamic is going to play out where there is going to be less people racing out to need the immediate test and to try to get something super quick. And as you move into a vaccinated world and more of an ongoing monitoring where a few hours isn't going to make a difference, I think it is going to evolve much more towards most diagnostic testing, which is you want to use the most sensitive and most specific tests. And we just think that is going to ultimately prevail and that a lot of the euphoria and urgency and design - even some of these people calling for - everybody would be taking a test every day, dah, dah, dah, you know what, it is just we don't see it that way. Ultimately, the market will decide and you can come back and slap us upside our heads if we are wrong. But I think we see it playing out as a more traditional market overtime where it goes to our advantage. Thanks. Yes. In terms of the first part, the COVID, I think we will see Europe being a bigger percentage of our revenue probably this quarter than even the 40%, I think part of our business, we feel really good about the longer-term contracts we booked with Europe and obviously, with the rollout of the vaccinations not going nearly as rapidly there. I feel pretty good about the persistence of the COVID testing in Europe. And then Mike is waving his hand here. Yes. It will be more focused on driving that instrument than necessarily taking their stuff over to Panther. Thanks. Yes. I think the broad approach we are taking is just trying to be there for our customers. If some get the school contracts, that would be great, we will be there for them. If they don't, we will be supporting other stuff. So I think that is probably the only potential bigger catalyst, I think, Ivy on the horizon, and obviously, that will really kick in for the fall. But I think there will be ways that, obviously, we will be working with various customers to be able to help support any of those initiatives."

My name is Edwardo, and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute.  I\u2019d now like to introduce Mike Watts, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications to begin the call.\nMike Watts: Thank you, Edwardo. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us for Hologic\u2019s first quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the Company\u2019s Chairman, President and CEO, and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer. Steve and Karleen both have some prepared remarks, then we\u2019ll have a question-and-answer session today. Our first quarter press release is available now on the investors section of our website. We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. Finally, a replay of this call will be archived through February 26. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor statement that\u2019s included in our earnings release, and in our filings with the SEC. Also during this call we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. One of these non-GAAP measures is organic revenue, and we define organic revenue as constant currency revenue excluding the divested Blood Screening and Cynosure businesses, as well as the acquired Acessa business. Finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be expressed in constant currency, unless otherwise noted. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic\u2019s CEO.\nSteve MacMillan: Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. We are off to a very strong start to the year across all our businesses and major geographies.  Once again, our Diagnostics division delivered incredible performance by making a massive impact against COVID-19. And our Breast Health and Surgical businesses continue to strengthen, with each returning to growth in the United States, Europe and Asia-Pacific. So our performance was strong and broad-based across both divisions and geographies. As a result, our financial results were exceptional in the first quarter. Let\u2019s provide a quick overview. Total revenue was $1.61 billion, with non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.86. Organic revenue more than doubled, up 104%, while EPS increased more than four-fold, as higher production volumes in Diagnostics enabled us to leverage our fixed cost base. Both revenue and EPS came in well ahead of our expectations at the beginning of the quarter.  With that introduction, I\u2019d like to cover three main topics in my remarks today, which will echo some of the themes from our presentation at the JPMorgan conference earlier this month. First, how our purpose-driven culture is contributing to, and we believe driving our excellent financial results; second, how we\u2019re making a huge difference in the fight against COVID-19; and third, why we\u2019ll be a stronger company on the other side of the pandemic. To begin, many of you will recall that Larry Fink, the CEO of Blackrock, wrote in early 2018 that companies both public and private, should serve a social purpose. Three years later, we would argue that Hologic is the epitome of such a company. We are an incredibly purpose-driven, highly engaged team that is waking up every day wanting to make a positive difference in the world. And we believe this culture is contributing to differentiated financial performance, both in terms of our COVID response and the faster-than-expected return to growth in our Breast Health and Surgical divisions. Our employees understand that the bigger our collective impact on the world, the more they and our shareholders benefit. What makes us tick is our strong purpose of enabling healthier lives everywhere, every day. Within this, we have a special passion to champion women\u2019s health. But we don\u2019t just help women. If, for example, you\u2019re one of the tens of millions of people who have had a Hologic COVID test in the last year, you can rest assured that you\u2019re getting a high-quality, highly accurate result. That\u2019s the promise we make to our customers, which we call The Science of Sure. Our purpose, passion and promise have shown up in countless ways since the pandemic began. Some are visible externally, like extraordinarily rapid EUAs or massive increases in production capacity. But many are behind the scenes, from how we rewarded our front-line employees for their heroic efforts during the pandemic, to how our board and management team found safe ways to meet in person, to how we always tried to under-promise and over-deliver on the COVID test commitments we made to customers and governments around the world.  We talk about many of these topics in our second annual sustainability report, titled the Power of Purpose, which we just published on our website last week. I\u2019d encourage all our investors, but especially those interested in ESG issues to take a look. Now let us give you an update on our COVID testing efforts. As you can probably tell from our financial results, we continue to make good progress on our plans to expand manufacturing capacity for our two COVID assays out of our plants in San Diego and Manchester, UK.  Total output increased sequentially compared to the September quarter, which enabled us to provide about 30 million COVID assays to customers, generating revenue of about $745 million. As we have said, we are now selling more COVID tests each quarter than we had ever produced of all of our molecular tests before the pandemic. And we are on track to meet our goal to produce at least 75 million total molecular diagnostic tests a quarter globally by January of 2022. This would represent more than 3.5x our total capacity pre-COVID, a tremendous accomplishment. Thanks to our employees, our suppliers, and the U.S. government, which is providing financial support.  In the first quarter, about one-third of our COVID test revenue came outside the United States, mainly from Europe. COVID testing continues to strengthen our international business, our relationships with customers, our future prospects in Diagnostics, and even market access for our other franchises. These COVID sales contributed to total international revenue of $472 million in the quarter, which represented tremendous growth of 145% on an organic basis. At the same time, we are also encouraged that demand for new Panther instruments remains very strong. You might recall that last fiscal year, we placed more than 500 new Panther systems worldwide, more than double our usual run rate. And we are off to an excellent start in fiscal 2021, with another 150 shipments in the first quarter alone. We still have a long waiting list for instruments, which we believe reflects the longevity of COVID testing that our customers anticipate.  Overall, our global installed base now stands at roughly 2,400 instruments, giving us a robust platform for future growth as more customers come to appreciate our system\u2019s best-in-class capabilities. Now let us shift gears to our third major topic, why we believe our business will be much stronger on the other side of the pandemic. First, it\u2019s never been more clear to us that demand for highly accurate molecular COVID testing will remain robust for a while. While we may have become a little numb to infection rates that remain staggeringly high in the United States and globally. But as a reminder, the almost 2 million molecular tests that are being performed daily in the United States today would annualize to a market that\u2019s about 17x bigger than the single largest molecular market before COVID. So while demand will inevitably decline as vaccines roll out, nucleic acid testing is likely to have a long, meaningful tail that extends into fiscal \u201822 and beyond, with COVID likely remaining our biggest molecular product for years to come.  As we have seen, it will take time to manufacture and administer vaccines broadly, and many people will choose not to be vaccinated. The societal need for, and focus on, COVID testing far exceeds anything we have ever seen before, and the pandemic\u2019s emotional toll will last much longer, driving future demand. As public concern around COVID persists, the combination of our huge Panther installed base, at facilities close to the patient and our gold standard assay performance have us uniquely positioned to pursue many use cases that will be around for the long-term. These include testing before hospital admissions, asymptomatic screening for various purposes, and even confirmatory testing of other, less accurate modalities.  Studies have shown that these other tests can miss two-thirds of asymptomatic cases, and these false negative results can contribute to super-spreader events. Even as the market matures and our production capacity increases, we believe our combination of robust chemistry, innovative engineering on Panther, and differentiated labeling from the FDA will help us gain market share.  Moving on, the second reason Hologic will be stronger in the future is the significant non-COVID business we are gaining on our rapidly growing installed base of Panther instruments. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an exaggeration to say that in the United States, Europe and Asia, every single Panther that our commercial teams have placed has been with an eye toward the future. They are doing a fantastic job of extending and broadening commercial contracts, winning key strategic accounts, and fueling our razor, razor blade business model. As an indicator of this, last quarter we discussed Tests of Record, or TORs, which represent contracted, year-one revenue from new assay customers. We said that we achieved a new record in TORs in fiscal 2020, with non-COVID business totaling $35 million in the United States, about 50% more than we had ever done before. This positive trend has actually accelerated in early 2021, with more than $20 million of additional TORs in the first quarter alone. That\u2019s one reason that momentum in our molecular business, which was already good before COVID, is improving further today, especially in Europe. For example, when we remove COVID assay sales from our molecular number as well as instruments and ancillaries, core assay sales grew roughly 10% globally in the first quarter, more than double the rate a quarter ago. The third reason we believe we will be stronger post-COVID is that thanks to the tremendous success of our Diagnostics business, we have been able to use the last several quarters to further bolster our Breast and Surgical franchises for the future. In Breast, we have continued to expand on our strategy to diversify the business across the patient continuum of care. Rather than just placing capital equipment, we are now selling a full portfolio of hardware and software upgrades, interventional tools and service.  While the world has been understandably focused on COVID, we have increased our direct presence with Breast Health customers, and developed and launched products such as Brevera, which is off to a very good start in its re-launch. And most recently, we acquired for $64 million the German company Somatex, a long-time partner of ours, to strengthen our portfolio of breast cancer markers, enhance our commercial presence in Europe, and improve our profitability. In Surgical, both our R&D and business development pipelines have been productive, broadening the portfolio of products that we sell through a high-performing, highly engaged sales force. New products such as our Fluent, fluid management system and new hysteroscopes are complementing our market- leading MyoSure and NovaSure devices, and helped that division return to growth in the first quarter, well ahead of schedule. On the business development front, in August we spent approximately $80 million, plus future contingent earn-outs to buy Acessa Health. Acessa\u2019s ProVu is a laparoscopic RF product that is used to treat fibroids that MyoSure can\u2019t reach, so it\u2019s very complementary to our Surgical business and a nice fit for our sales force. And so far, early feedback from our customers has been good. The acquisitions of Acessa and Somatex demonstrate the final reason we will be stronger after the pandemic, the ability to use the healthy cash flow that COVID tests are generating to step up our business development activities. The pending, $230 million acquisition of Biotheranostics, which we announced earlier this month, is another good example of this strategy. Biotheranostics, a leader in molecular tests for breast and metastatic cancers, enables us to expand into the adjacent growth market of oncology. More specifically, Biotheranostics has done a great job of developing a strong clinical and reimbursement foundation for their flagship Breast Cancer Index test, which plays an important role in a large but underpenetrated breast cancer market that we know a lot about.  In addition, Biotheranostics provides us clinical lab capabilities that we can use to develop markets for novel content down the road. From a financial perspective, Biotheranostics brings more than $30 million of annual revenue, growth rates in excess of 20%, and strong gross margins. We\u2019re excited that since we announced the deal, Biotheranostics has received some very good news that will benefit women with early-stage, hormone receptor positive breast cancer. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network, or NCCN, included the Breast Cancer Index test in its guidelines to predict the benefit of extended treatment with various endocrine therapies. This should help establish the test as the standard of care for this important clinical question, and contribute to increased patient access.  Before turning the call over to Karleen, let me conclude by saying that we are off to an excellent start in fiscal 2021. Our purpose-driven culture is driving excellent execution and performance, both in terms of our COVID tests and the recovery of our other businesses. And we are working hard to ensure that the financial success we are experiencing now will translate into a stronger company down the road. We are confident it will. Now we\u2019ll turn the call over to Karleen. \nKarleen Oberton: Thank you Steve, and good afternoon everyone. In my remarks today, I\u2019m going to provide an overview of our divisional sales results, walk through our income statement, briefly touch on a few other key financial metrics, and finish with our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. As Steve said, we are very pleased with our first quarter results, as revenue and EPS significantly exceeded our guidance. Reported revenue of $1.61 billion increased 87%. Organically, revenue grew 104%, driven by strong COVID sales and the continued improvement of our base business across all major geographies. Given the incredible demand for our COVID tests and the strong results in our base business, we were able to significantly improve profit, margins and cash flow. As a result, EPS of $2.86 in the first quarter increased 369%, well ahead of our expectations. Further, operating cash flow has continued to be extremely strong, which I\u2019ll discuss in a moment. Before I do that, let me provide some detail on our divisional revenue results. In Diagnostics, our largest division, global revenue of $1.128 billion grew 256% in the first quarter driven by molecular, where sales increased 449%. In response to the unprecedented demand for COVID testing, we shipped about 30 million COVID tests to customers, generating revenue of $745 million globally. And excluding COVID, our base molecular business accelerated sequentially, as customers continue to see the benefit of our assay menu and the strength of Panther\u2019s high throughput automation. Rounding out diagnostics, the cytology and perinatal businesses grew by 1% in the quarter, driven in part by a catch-up in cytology procedures at calendar year-end.  In Breast Health, global revenue of $332.7 million was down slightly overall. However, performance improved compared to the fourth quarter and the business returned to slight growth in all geographies except for Latin America. The division\u2019s performance was driven by the interventional business, which grew 15% in the quarter and was helped by the re-launch of our Brevera biopsy system. Although we were encouraged by sequential improvement in the capital environment and by healthy equipment sales at calendar year-end, overall spending remains challenged because of COVID. However, our intentional diversification to service and consumables, as well as several recent acquisitions, have helped mitigate pressures on capital. As an example, Breast Health service revenue, which is larger than capital sales, grew by mid-single-digits in the quarter.  In Surgical, sales of $124 million grew 3.3%, a great result given headwinds on elective procedures from recently increasing COVID cases in some parts of the country. This result shows the strength and commitment of our Surgical sales force, as well as the benefit of several new products. Overall, in terms of geography, domestic sales of $1.14 billion increased 80% on a reported basis. On an organic basis, U.S. revenue was up 91%. Outside the United States, sales of $472 million increased 106% in constant currency. Organically, sales outside the U.S. grew 145%, a stellar result that reflects our growing international strength. Now let\u2019s move on to the rest of the P&L for the first quarter . Gross margin of 77.2% increased 1,560 basis points, driven by sales of high-margin COVID tests and the divestiture of the lower-margin Cynosure business. Total operating expenses of $274.5 million decreased 5.1% in the first quarter. However, expenses actually increased when normalizing for the Cynosure sale, and about $6.5 million of credits from BARDA associated with the development of our COVID assays.  These increases were driven by investments in R&D and marketing for future growth. In addition, expenses associated with our deferred compensation plan increased as a result of equity market gains. As a reminder, while this liability is marked to market, most of the expense is offset by a benefit we realized in other income in the quarter.  In addition, our non-GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 21.75%, slightly lower than previously forecast driven by a favorable geographic mix of income, primarily from sales of COVID-19 assays outside the United States. Putting all this together, operating margin increased 3,270 basis points to 60.2%, and net margin increased 2,730 basis points to 46.6%. As a result, non-GAAP net income finished at $749.6 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.86, well ahead of expectations. Before we cover our 2021 second quarter guidance, I\u2019ll quickly touch on a few other financial metrics. Driven by demand for our COVID tests, cash flow from operations was $650 million in the first quarter, a very strong result. In fact, this was about the same as our total cash flow from operations for all of fiscal 2019.  Looked at another way, in just the last two quarters we have generated about $1.1 billion in operating cash flow, which gives us tremendous financial and strategic flexibility. For example, we repurchased nearly 1.5 million shares of stock for $101 million in the first quarter, and our Board recently approved a new $1 billion authorization, highlighting our commitment to capital deployment. And we were also able to strengthen our balance sheet by repaying our outstanding revolver balance of $250 million. As a reminder, we had borrowed against the revolver as a precautionary measure very early in the pandemic. Overall, we had $869 million of cash at the end of the first quarter. And with more than $1 billion of EBITDA for the quarter, our leverage ratio fell to 0.8 times. While we remain comfortable with a leverage ratio between two and three over the long-term, we also have no problem with a lower ratio in the short term. As you know, we are actively pursuing a number of division-led, tuck-in acquisitions and hope to use our cash to complete more deals this year, in addition to buying back our stock. Finally, ROIC was 26.7% on a trailing 12-month basis, a significant increase of 1,440 basis points. Before we open the call for questions, let me discuss our expectations for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. We anticipate that fiscal 2021 will be an excellent year for Hologic overall, but our business environment remains fluid due to the ongoing effects of the pandemic.  Therefore, we are only providing a single quarter of guidance today. Let me also point out that our guidance does not include the impact of the pending Biotheranostics acquisition, which has not yet closed. In the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we expect excellent financial results again, with total revenue in the range of $1.5 to $1.56 billion. This represents an approximate doubling of organic revenue growth, to roughly 96% to 104%. Underlying this, we expect similar sales of our COVID tests to drive exceptional Diagnostics growth. As a reminder, most of our new molecular production capacity is expected to come on-line in the second half of our fiscal year. Blood screening revenue, which we back out of our organic calculations, is expected to be about $10 million in the quarter.  In our other businesses, let me remind you that March quarter sales are typically down sequentially compared to the December period for our Breast, Surgical and base Diagnostics businesses, as capital sales and semi-elective procedures tend to be seasonally stronger at the end of the calendar year.  In addition, our guidance incorporates headwinds related to customer spending constraints and restrictions on procedure volumes given rising COVID cases. While our customers are much better- prepared than they were last spring to manage through local increases in COVID prevalence, we have seen a recent slowdown in some elective surgeries. On the bottom line, we expect EPS of $2.56 to $2.68 in the second quarter, with extraordinary growth rates that significantly outpace revenue even as we increase investments for future growth. To put this in perspective, we expect to earn more in the second quarter alone than we did in the full year of 2019. This second quarter guidance is based on a tax rate of 21.75%, and diluted shares outstanding of 262 to 263 million for the quarter. I\u2019d also like to point out that we expect other expenses, net, to increase to close to $25 million in the second quarter, as we don\u2019t forecast gains or losses related to certain hedging activities like we saw in the first quarter. As you update your forecasts, let me remind you that macro uncertainty has increased in recent weeks due to the pandemic. While our visibility has improved compared to several months ago, we would still encourage you to model at the middle of our ranges, which incorporate both potential upsides and downsides. Before we open the call for questions, let me wrap up by saying that Hologic\u2019s financial performance in the first quarter was terrific. We continue to make a huge impact fighting the COVID-19 pandemic and on women\u2019s health globally. Further, I am confident that we have positioned ourselves to deliver exceptional long-term performance.  With that, I will ask the operator to open the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up, then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll now take our first question from Dan Leonard at Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nDan Leonard: Thank you. So first question, you made a comment that your success for COVID testing outside of the U.S. has actually helped strengthen your other franchises. Could you elaborate a bit on that?\nSteve MacMillan: Yes, Dan, thank you. First off, it's funny how things go in full circle. As you know, over the last few years, we've acquired a number of our dealers in Europe on the Breast Health side and that gave us much more of a direct presence in a lot of the key countries, the UK, Germany, Spain, Portugal, just to name a few, and it\u2019s really helped us strengthen our whole team in Europe. So we've been building relationships at a higher level. As COVID has hit, it's given us incredible access to a lot of the major governments. We've got contracts with just about every major government in Europe. And in so doing, we're now on their radar screen that they really \u2013 a lot of them didn't know about the Diagnostics business and how much of a leader we are in the sexually transmitted infections and other stuff. So we've been able, as we've been selling in COVID and giving them Panthers to really be booking new business that will come online as the Panthers go down, and really just being able to talk more about our cytology business, our HPV business, and really just a different level of relationship that we think is going to strengthen us significantly down the road.\nDan Leonard: Okay, that's helpful. And then a bit of an unrelated follow-up. How would you characterize the M&A environment right now? I mean, during the pandemic, in diagnostics specifically, do you think it will be -- is it feasible to do something in your core infectious disease testing phase or do you think this is an environment where you really got to wait for the pandemic to subside before those types of assets become available? Thank you.\nSteve MacMillan: Great question, Dan. I think, we\u2019d probably put it in a couple of different perspectives. First and foremost, I would say is as -- while we are obviously generating a ton of cash right now, we also have the luxury of being in an enormous position of strength and that our base businesses are performing. And I think the best way that you can be very disciplined on deals is when it's easy to walk away from anything because you don't need anything and you feel good about your underlying business. So then if we look at the market specifically, it's been fascinating to watch over the last eight months, right? First, everybody hunkered down back March, April, May, including ourselves. We had pushed things like the Acessa deal. We had even pushed out a few months and we'd had a relationship with Biotheranostics and kind of just wanted to see where our own cash flow was at that point in time. So now, obviously, there is a lot of companies that are fairly flushed with cash. There is also a fairly healthy IPO market right now. So there is a bit of froth out there I think and we want to be disciplined. So I would tell you, as excited as the deals we've done. I'm probably more proud of some deals we've gone pretty deep on over the last three, four months that we walked away from, really over valuation or other issues in diligence. And that's I think the maturing of our team here and that the fundamental strength. So I think we're in a position where if we can get the right assets at the right price with good ROICs, hey, that's great. And if we need to wait some things out or even miss some things, we're not going to get caught into bidding wars and overpay. So I do think it's a pretty vibrant market right now. We've had every banker beating us \u2013 beating our door down trying to sell us things as you can imagine, but staying very disciplined.\nDan Leonard: I appreciate that color. Thank you.\nOperator: All right. We\u2019ll now take our next question from Patrick Donnelly at Citi. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Donnelly: Great. Thanks, guys. Steve, maybe one for you. Just on the COVID testing side, I\u2019m sure you get this a lot obviously. But just on the durability side, as we think out to the back-half, obviously, the vaccine is rolling out, a little choppy here, but it's going out. As you think about the back-half and the pie possibly beginning to naturally shrink there, all test aren't created equal. So I guess where do you see Hologic kind of landing in terms of when that pie starts shrinking? Do you get a bigger piece? How does that play out? And again, certainly, your capacity is expanding. What's the view of that split between COVID and non-COVID as we get through this year?\nSteve MacMillan: Sure, Patrick. You're hitting on clearly one of \u2018the biggest questions. I believe very strongly that we will continue to improve our market share, right? In the beginning this was kind of the wild, wild west. The FDA granted a gazillion EUAs, everybody raced out to the market. At the end of the day, we have some very powerful and enduring assets that we believe will put us in a really good place over the long run. It starts frankly with Panther and the installed base. We know there is a ton of hospitals that in a bare minimum are going to want to continue to test everybody that comes in their doors for procedures. They have them on site, they'll be doing that.  As we seek to get more people back to work and back-to-school, there is going to be a need for high-level testing that's asymptomatic. And I think again, what's been happening in the short-term, because there wasn't enough molecular tests in the beginning and the long turnaround times, there is a big emphasis on a lot of the rapid tests, particularly some of the antigen stuff and they're going to have a place. But at the end of the day, they're not indicated, most of them for asymptomatic screening and we keep learning more and more by the day. How much of this is asymptomatically being passed along?  And when you look at a lot of these super spreader events, they are quite frankly being caused by using the wrong tests off label to try to determine whether people have something. And I think over time, what we always say to our team is the cream rises to the top. So you have Panther and it\u2019s where it's located. You have an assay that's got incredible sensitivity specificity and one of the best labels. We also have the pooling indication. And once you get back into screening, call it, next fall, right, think about simple things. We want to get everybody back to school in the fall. The vaccines still aren't indicated for people under 16. So as we keep talking about vaccinating the country, children are going to be excluded from that. We're going to want to be doing asymptomatic screening and a lot of the antigen tests that people may say are great right now, they're not going to be as effective at picking up particularly asymptomatic indications. So we have that and then you just have the pure workflow advantage that should never be forgotten and that is the workflow of Panther, the random access automation ability to just make this as easy. The lab techs around the world have been running a marathon at sprint speed, they are exhausted. You can't walk in any lab and not hear from the lab director that their techs are just tired and they would much rather be able to be using Panther.  And one of the fundamental realities is, we've been shipping so much, but not all of it has been with our full pen caps and that's part of the capacity we've been building up. And as we're able to provide more and more of our pen caps, it creates the full automation benefit that not everybody has even been fully getting yet.  So, we have no idea, truly exactly how this is going to play out, but all the discussions we've been having with the Biden transition team has been continued about, \u201cHey, are you still building up more capacity?\u201c And we certainly are. We'll see how it all plays out. But I think like every market we compete in, we think we're going to be there standing.\nPatrick Donnelly: That's really helpful perspective, I appreciate that. And then maybe just one; you know I think Karleen mentioned it there at the end. You have seen a little bit of a recent slowdown in some elective surgeries, elective procedures, customers seeing rising COVID cases being a bit of a headwind. Can you just expand a little bit on kind of what you're seeing this quarter sequentially versus last quarter in terms of that slowdown and kind of where it's taking you guys and what the impact could be? Just want to make sure we have a good handle on that.\nSteve MacMillan: Yes. Overall, I would say it's really on the margin. We \u2013 frankly I think we finished the last quarter better than most. The fact that Surgical and Breast Health both ended up growing, which we wouldn't have expected. Whether they grow or stay flattish, we're probably talking little pieces here. We're seeing little pockets right in certain geographies; certainly, we\u2019ll have a couple of slower days in the surgical business or in the Breast Health consumable business. So it's I'd call it, it's a little temporary outages, but fundamentally it's going to be tiny for us given that we've got the COVID offset and I think we just continue to focus on sharing it will, take care of itself here over time, but maybe slightly more muted this quarter on a couple of those businesses, but still overall good.\nPatrick Donnelly: Alright, that's good to hear. Thanks Steve.\nSteve MacMillan: Alright.\nOperator: We'll now take our next question from Chris Lin of Cowen. Please go ahead.\nChris Lin: Hey, good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Also, welcome back to the earnings call, Karleen.\nKarleen Oberton: Thank you.\nSteve MacMillan: Good job Chris remembering, alright.\nChris Lin: Steve, in past quarters you provided an estimate on what percentage of Panther placements are expected to replace Tigris and also what percentage of Panther placements displace a competitor or enabled a new customer to begin testing? Do you have an update on those figures for us? Also, I know you test the record, the test of records metric to track assay adoption, but do you have an estimate on what percentage of Panthers placed over the past year are now also running non-COVID-19 tests?\nMichael Watts: Hey Chris, it\u2019s Mike. Let me take a crack at that. I think on your first point we \u2013 what we said a few quarters ago is in the early days we placed a significant portion of our Panthers into some of our largest customers where they were going to replace Tigris\u2019s over time and provide access to a broader menu, there\u2019s four test approved on Tigris I think, now 18 on Panther if you include the two COVID test. We haven\u2019t given an update on that since then, so I don\u2019t have an update for a specific number for you today. I would tell you that by and large, we are focusing on our existing customers obviously and broadening our relationships with those customers.  If you think about where our Panthers sit overall, you know most of them still in hospital labs and I think this gets back to one of the comments as Steve was making earlier about how getting testing closer to the patient is going to help us from a share perspective going forward for pre-op procedures, things like that. And then the second part of your question Chris, on TOR\u2019s was what percentage of the new Panthers, isn\u2019t it? Yes, I don\u2019t know that number either, but I think as Steve said in his prepared remarks, that\u2019s what the sales force is focused on, right. And we\u2019ve talked a bit in the past about how we\u2019re extra incentivizing our sales force to bring in new non-COVID business and they\u2019ve done a great job of that.  So I think as Steve said in the prepared remarks, I mean basically every Panther that we placed is being placed with an eye toward the future and that run rate of TORs. I mean we did $35 million last year, we talked about this. That was 50% more than we had ever done before, pretty excited about that, and now in the first quarter we do another $20 million. So don\u2019t know if that will continue with that pace, but certainly at a good run rate here out of the SHU.\nChris Lin: Okay, great. Then for my follow-up, I just wanted to go back to the topic of decentralization. One of your largest peers and hired throughput COVID-19 Diagnostics recently announced the acquisition of a molecular point-of-care platform. Beyond that acquisition I think this pandemic has also just highlighted the need for rapid but accurate diagnostic tools. Now given that Panther is in a unique position as a leading mid-to-high throughput molecular diagnostics platform, do you want to extend that leadership to a lower volume setting. Really, do you have any updated thoughts on that market opportunity? \nSteve MacMillan: Yes. We continue to look at different areas and different technologies Chris. I mean I\u2019ll tell you, if we\u2019ve been inundated we\u2019d probably get five or 10 per day, little companies, different technologies coming our way. We\u2019re certainly looking at some. We\u2019re probably generally a little more focused in the labs that we\u2019re \u2013 you know in our existing customers. We\u2019re always looking on the fringe other ways to extend out from there. So we\u2019ll continue to look at everything and stay disciplined on where we can get a good return and where we can bring value to the market.\nChris Lin: Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Alright, we\u2019ll take our next question from Tycho Peterson at J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\nTycho Peterson: Hey, thanks Steve. I\u2019m going to stick with the durability seen. I\u2019m just curious, you know in the last few weeks, obviously new strengths have emerged and then you\u2019ve got the new administration making a big push here, so a couple of quick hits if you will.  Where are you on a test for the new variants? And then as we think about mix, I think up till now you basically have been doing lots of stand-alone COVID. How do you think about combo assays, mix shifting over the course of the year, and then how do you think about the sustainability of the current pricing trends and reimbursement as it stands today?\nSteve MacMillan: Yes Tycho, thanks. I think in terms of the new variance, right now we feel very good that the way we\u2019ve designed our test, you know we have basically designed ours with two targets to ensure there\u2019s a backup target in case the virus mutates. So we continue to watch that but feel very good, and this is part of many advantages of having an incredibly sensitive and specific test to begin with, it targets the genomic regions that are less likely to mutate. So I think we feel very good about our ability to continue to catch those very well. And the second part of that was what again the multiplex.\nTycho Peterson: [Cross Talk]\nSteve MacMillan: I\u2019m sorry. Yes, the multiplex, we figure come the fall \u2013 for this winter as we all know there\u2019s basically been no flu season demand for our product. It\u2019s virtually been entirely our single COVID test. I think come next fall, having a syndromic multi, multiple option is probably going to make more sense and you would expect that we\u2019ll typically be there.\nTycho Peterson: And pricing and reimbursement?\nSteve MacMillan: I think at least in the short term, we\u2019re probably still reasonable. I think over the long run we\u2019ve got to assume both of those will eventually come down. But I think at this point, particularly with the Biden administration extending the public health emergency through the end of 2021, we don\u2019t see any real near-term pressure on reimbursement.  I\u2019m sure again, that will probably start to evolve as we go forward and it may evolve at different paces with different governments around the world as well, but so that ultimately will be some downward pressure certainly probably on pricing, but feel pretty good about where we are right now.\nTycho Peterson: And then one on capital deployment for [inaudible] you\u2019re putting up great numbers, your stock still trading around 10x EBITDA, so how are you thinking about buybacks? Would you consider an ASR?\nSteve MacMillan: Yes. We certainly did an ASR in conjunction with the Cynosure divestiture. In general, not a huge fan of those short of an event. I think we\u2019ve been pretty good buyers of our stock. When you look back over the last, really five fiscal years, I think we\u2019ve bought back over 30 million shares and been fairly consistent last year even more so.  I think it continues to be an important part of our strategy, but probably more executed along the way, both offsetting dilution, as well as frankly we\u2019ve been reducing our share count really now for a number of years.\nTycho Peterson: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Alright, we\u2019ll now take our next question from Raj Denhoy at Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nZachary Weiner: Hey, this is Zach on for Raj. Just a few from us. You started the year by announcing two acquisitions and a $1 billion buyback. Can you give any more detail on the potential timing of that share repurchase program? Should we expect it to start to come in post COVID? And then also, can you give any more color on potential deals size and/or timing of future deals?\nKarleen Oberton: Hi, this is Karleen, so let me just make a couple of comments in regards to capital allocation. Certainly we\u2019re focused on deploying our free cash flow, which has grown tremendously over the last several quarters. Our priority is going to be that tuck-in M&A growth accretive assets and I think to build on the comments that Steve made, capital - share repurchase is going to be part of that strategy, but I would say the $1 billion authorization is over a five year period. So we would expect to utilize that on some regular cadence over that period of time.\nSteve MacMillan: Great! Next.\nOperator: We\u2019ll now take our next question from Jack Meehan at Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nJack Meehan: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys.\nSteve MacMillan: Hey, Jack.\nJack Meehan: Wanting to talk about the core business. So as you reflected on the quarter, how much do you think pent-up demand contributed across the three segments? I know you talked about some catch-up in cytology, but do you think there might have been some flush from hospitals in Breast Health and timed surgical procedures going back?\nSteve MacMillan: We think there was probably some catch-up. Again is it a few percentage points, is it saying \u2013 it\u2019s hard to completely quantify Jack in terms of both cytology, as well as surgical and plus you have the year-end, people trying to get them in who have exceeded their Caps for the year, so you tend to have a pretty good time at year-end.  In terms of capital a little hard to know; we saw a little bit of strength in pockets, certainly. I think the way we\u2019re thinking about it overall is there\u2019s still going to be some little puts and takes here as the markets settle back down in the coming quarters. Are we continuing to take market share? Are we continuing to get stronger? And none of it frankly is going to make a huge difference. Do we grow a 100% next quarter or 95%, it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re talking on the base business, what would be minor percentages in terms of the total.\nKarleen Oberton: Yes, the only thing I would add on that is that on the Brevera relaunch there was definitely some pent-up demand for capital for that relaunch and I think that really bodes well for that product moving forward and we think that will be a nice contributor to the Breast Health division.\nZachary Weiner: Great! And then I was hoping to maybe give a little bit of color around expectations for new product launches throughout 2021. What do you have in the pipeline? Should we think kind of more incremental launches and how does the environment make you think about maybe doing larger moves in any other businesses for coming out of the R&D portfolio?\nSteve MacMillan: Yes, I think in terms of your \u2013 the first question, I think we\u2019ve got you know consistently a lot of singles coming in new product development. Frankly we hit a Grand Slam in Diagnostics and put all of our energy and it\u2019s hard for people to fully understand how much R&D and manufacturing and quality assurance resources went into getting all of both the assays out for COVID, as well as the additional label indications, things like pooling and they involve a lot of software. So we\u2019re continuing even just on pathways to continue to strengthen there.  In Breast Health we\u2019ve got a number of things coming out using AI. We\u2019ve got follow-ups from the SSI acquisition on ultrasound. You know Brevera is really in the process of rolling out. So we\u2019ve got a lot of additional software and smaller things there. Then we\u2019ve got obviously Acessa, the Pro-View product rolling in within the surgical business. So I think we feel very good about the cadence of those things rolling out. And then on the M&A front, I\u2019ll probably go back to our \u2013 the comment I made in probably answering the first question or so, which is to me the best way to be disciplined in M&A is to have a great core business and all of our business\u2019s right now are good. We\u2019ve also got just really good teams able to do some great due diligence. We\u2019ve really walked away from a number of things actually even over the last few months and we continue to work others. So I think we\u2019re able to look a little bit bigger, certainly given the cash, but we don\u2019t necessarily have big eyes or big needs and I think if anything, we\u2019re probably likely to be building a little bit more of a cash position here in the near term as Karleen mentioned. We\u2019ve generated a $1 billion [ph] of cash, just in the last two quarters. We certainly aren\u2019t spending at that rate and that\u2019s okay for right now, we\u2019ll be patient and disciplined.\nMichael Watts: Hey Edwardo, I think we have\u2026\nZachary Weiner: Thank you guys.\nMichael Watts: Edwardo, I think we have time for may be one more question.\nOperator: Alright, we\u2019ll now take our last question from Vijay Kumar at Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Markowitz: Hi, this is Daniel on for Vijay. Thanks for taking the question. Your comment on the 150 Panther placements in the quarter with a strong order book, I\u2019m just wondering on capacity for Panther production or in other words, how I should think about the unwind on that order book?\nSteve MacMillan: Sure, we\u2019re continuing to produce Panthers at a similar rate right now to what we just placed, given that we still have very strong demand. I think probably later into calendar year \u201821, does that start to back down a little bit, probably given the extreme ramp-up, but we are continuing to produce at a similar rate right now.\nDaniel Markowitz : Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That is all the time we have for questions today. This now concludes Hologic's first quarter of fiscal 2021 earnings conference call. Have a good evening!",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Karleen Oberton",
            "content": "Thank you Steve, and good afternoon everyone. In my remarks today, I'm going to provide an overview of our divisional sales results, walk through our income statement, briefly touch on a few other key financial metrics, and finish with our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. As Steve said, we are very pleased with our first quarter results, as revenue and EPS significantly exceeded our guidance. Reported revenue of $1.61 billion increased 87%. Organically, revenue grew 104%, driven by strong COVID sales and the continued improvement of our base business across all major geographies. Given the incredible demand for our COVID tests and the strong results in our base business, we were able to significantly improve profit, margins and cash flow. As a result, EPS of $2.86 in the first quarter increased 369%, well ahead of our expectations. Further, operating cash flow has continued to be extremely strong, which I'll discuss in a moment. Before I do that, let me provide some detail on our divisional revenue results. In Diagnostics, our largest division, global revenue of $1.128 billion grew 256% in the first quarter driven by molecular, where sales increased 449%. In response to the unprecedented demand for COVID testing, we shipped about 30 million COVID tests to customers, generating revenue of $745 million globally. And excluding COVID, our base molecular business accelerated sequentially, as customers continue to see the benefit of our assay menu and the strength of Panther's high throughput automation. Rounding out diagnostics, the cytology and perinatal businesses grew by 1% in the quarter, driven in part by a catch-up in cytology procedures at calendar year-end.  In Breast Health, global revenue of $332.7 million was down slightly overall. However, performance improved compared to the fourth quarter and the business returned to slight growth in all geographies except for Latin America. The division's performance was driven by the interventional business, which grew 15% in the quarter and was helped by the re-launch of our Brevera biopsy system. Although we were encouraged by sequential improvement in the capital environment and by healthy equipment sales at calendar year-end, overall spending remains challenged because of COVID. However, our intentional diversification to service and consumables, as well as several recent acquisitions, have helped mitigate pressures on capital. As an example, Breast Health service revenue, which is larger than capital sales, grew by mid-single-digits in the quarter.  In Surgical, sales of $124 million grew 3.3%, a great result given headwinds on elective procedures from recently increasing COVID cases in some parts of the country. This result shows the strength and commitment of our Surgical sales force, as well as the benefit of several new products. Overall, in terms of geography, domestic sales of $1.14 billion increased 80% on a reported basis. On an organic basis, U.S. revenue was up 91%. Outside the United States, sales of $472 million increased 106% in constant currency. Organically, sales outside the U.S. grew 145%, a stellar result that reflects our growing international strength. Now let's move on to the rest of the P&L for the first quarter . Gross margin of 77.2% increased 1,560 basis points, driven by sales of high-margin COVID tests and the divestiture of the lower-margin Cynosure business. Total operating expenses of $274.5 million decreased 5.1% in the first quarter. However, expenses actually increased when normalizing for the Cynosure sale, and about $6.5 million of credits from BARDA associated with the development of our COVID assays.  These increases were driven by investments in R&D and marketing for future growth. In addition, expenses associated with our deferred compensation plan increased as a result of equity market gains. As a reminder, while this liability is marked to market, most of the expense is offset by a benefit we realized in other income in the quarter.  In addition, our non-GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 21.75%, slightly lower than previously forecast driven by a favorable geographic mix of income, primarily from sales of COVID-19 assays outside the United States. Putting all this together, operating margin increased 3,270 basis points to 60.2%, and net margin increased 2,730 basis points to 46.6%. As a result, non-GAAP net income finished at $749.6 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.86, well ahead of expectations. Before we cover our 2021 second quarter guidance, I'll quickly touch on a few other financial metrics. Driven by demand for our COVID tests, cash flow from operations was $650 million in the first quarter, a very strong result. In fact, this was about the same as our total cash flow from operations for all of fiscal 2019.  Looked at another way, in just the last two quarters we have generated about $1.1 billion in operating cash flow, which gives us tremendous financial and strategic flexibility. For example, we repurchased nearly 1.5 million shares of stock for $101 million in the first quarter, and our Board recently approved a new $1 billion authorization, highlighting our commitment to capital deployment. And we were also able to strengthen our balance sheet by repaying our outstanding revolver balance of $250 million. As a reminder, we had borrowed against the revolver as a precautionary measure very early in the pandemic. Overall, we had $869 million of cash at the end of the first quarter. And with more than $1 billion of EBITDA for the quarter, our leverage ratio fell to 0.8 times. While we remain comfortable with a leverage ratio between two and three over the long-term, we also have no problem with a lower ratio in the short term. As you know, we are actively pursuing a number of division-led, tuck-in acquisitions and hope to use our cash to complete more deals this year, in addition to buying back our stock. Finally, ROIC was 26.7% on a trailing 12-month basis, a significant increase of 1,440 basis points. Before we open the call for questions, let me discuss our expectations for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. We anticipate that fiscal 2021 will be an excellent year for Hologic overall, but our business environment remains fluid due to the ongoing effects of the pandemic.  Therefore, we are only providing a single quarter of guidance today. Let me also point out that our guidance does not include the impact of the pending Biotheranostics acquisition, which has not yet closed. In the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we expect excellent financial results again, with total revenue in the range of $1.5 to $1.56 billion. This represents an approximate doubling of organic revenue growth, to roughly 96% to 104%. Underlying this, we expect similar sales of our COVID tests to drive exceptional Diagnostics growth. As a reminder, most of our new molecular production capacity is expected to come on-line in the second half of our fiscal year. Blood screening revenue, which we back out of our organic calculations, is expected to be about $10 million in the quarter.  In our other businesses, let me remind you that March quarter sales are typically down sequentially compared to the December period for our Breast, Surgical and base Diagnostics businesses, as capital sales and semi-elective procedures tend to be seasonally stronger at the end of the calendar year.  In addition, our guidance incorporates headwinds related to customer spending constraints and restrictions on procedure volumes given rising COVID cases. While our customers are much better- prepared than they were last spring to manage through local increases in COVID prevalence, we have seen a recent slowdown in some elective surgeries. On the bottom line, we expect EPS of $2.56 to $2.68 in the second quarter, with extraordinary growth rates that significantly outpace revenue even as we increase investments for future growth. To put this in perspective, we expect to earn more in the second quarter alone than we did in the full year of 2019. This second quarter guidance is based on a tax rate of 21.75%, and diluted shares outstanding of 262 to 263 million for the quarter. I'd also like to point out that we expect other expenses, net, to increase to close to $25 million in the second quarter, as we don't forecast gains or losses related to certain hedging activities like we saw in the first quarter. As you update your forecasts, let me remind you that macro uncertainty has increased in recent weeks due to the pandemic. While our visibility has improved compared to several months ago, we would still encourage you to model at the middle of our ranges, which incorporate both potential upsides and downsides. Before we open the call for questions, let me wrap up by saying that Hologic's financial performance in the first quarter was terrific. We continue to make a huge impact fighting the COVID-19 pandemic and on women's health globally. Further, I am confident that we have positioned ourselves to deliver exceptional long-term performance.  With that, I will ask the operator to open the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up, then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question. Thank you. Hi, this is Karleen, so let me just make a couple of comments in regards to capital allocation. Certainly we're focused on deploying our free cash flow, which has grown tremendously over the last several quarters. Our priority is going to be that tuck-in M&A growth accretive assets and I think to build on the comments that Steve made, capital - share repurchase is going to be part of that strategy, but I would say the $1 billion authorization is over a five year period. So we would expect to utilize that on some regular cadence over that period of time. Yes, the only thing I would add on that is that on the Brevera relaunch there was definitely some pent-up demand for capital for that relaunch and I think that really bodes well for that product moving forward and we think that will be a nice contributor to the Breast Health division."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Steve MacMillan",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. We are off to a very strong start to the year across all our businesses and major geographies.  Once again, our Diagnostics division delivered incredible performance by making a massive impact against COVID-19. And our Breast Health and Surgical businesses continue to strengthen, with each returning to growth in the United States, Europe and Asia-Pacific. So our performance was strong and broad-based across both divisions and geographies. As a result, our financial results were exceptional in the first quarter. Let's provide a quick overview. Total revenue was $1.61 billion, with non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.86. Organic revenue more than doubled, up 104%, while EPS increased more than four-fold, as higher production volumes in Diagnostics enabled us to leverage our fixed cost base. Both revenue and EPS came in well ahead of our expectations at the beginning of the quarter.  With that introduction, I'd like to cover three main topics in my remarks today, which will echo some of the themes from our presentation at the JPMorgan conference earlier this month. First, how our purpose-driven culture is contributing to, and we believe driving our excellent financial results; second, how we're making a huge difference in the fight against COVID-19; and third, why we'll be a stronger company on the other side of the pandemic. To begin, many of you will recall that Larry Fink, the CEO of Blackrock, wrote in early 2018 that companies both public and private, should serve a social purpose. Three years later, we would argue that Hologic is the epitome of such a company. We are an incredibly purpose-driven, highly engaged team that is waking up every day wanting to make a positive difference in the world. And we believe this culture is contributing to differentiated financial performance, both in terms of our COVID response and the faster-than-expected return to growth in our Breast Health and Surgical divisions. Our employees understand that the bigger our collective impact on the world, the more they and our shareholders benefit. What makes us tick is our strong purpose of enabling healthier lives everywhere, every day. Within this, we have a special passion to champion women's health. But we don't just help women. If, for example, you're one of the tens of millions of people who have had a Hologic COVID test in the last year, you can rest assured that you're getting a high-quality, highly accurate result. That's the promise we make to our customers, which we call The Science of Sure. Our purpose, passion and promise have shown up in countless ways since the pandemic began. Some are visible externally, like extraordinarily rapid EUAs or massive increases in production capacity. But many are behind the scenes, from how we rewarded our front-line employees for their heroic efforts during the pandemic, to how our board and management team found safe ways to meet in person, to how we always tried to under-promise and over-deliver on the COVID test commitments we made to customers and governments around the world.  We talk about many of these topics in our second annual sustainability report, titled the Power of Purpose, which we just published on our website last week. I'd encourage all our investors, but especially those interested in ESG issues to take a look. Now let us give you an update on our COVID testing efforts. As you can probably tell from our financial results, we continue to make good progress on our plans to expand manufacturing capacity for our two COVID assays out of our plants in San Diego and Manchester, UK.  Total output increased sequentially compared to the September quarter, which enabled us to provide about 30 million COVID assays to customers, generating revenue of about $745 million. As we have said, we are now selling more COVID tests each quarter than we had ever produced of all of our molecular tests before the pandemic. And we are on track to meet our goal to produce at least 75 million total molecular diagnostic tests a quarter globally by January of 2022. This would represent more than 3.5x our total capacity pre-COVID, a tremendous accomplishment. Thanks to our employees, our suppliers, and the U.S. government, which is providing financial support.  In the first quarter, about one-third of our COVID test revenue came outside the United States, mainly from Europe. COVID testing continues to strengthen our international business, our relationships with customers, our future prospects in Diagnostics, and even market access for our other franchises. These COVID sales contributed to total international revenue of $472 million in the quarter, which represented tremendous growth of 145% on an organic basis. At the same time, we are also encouraged that demand for new Panther instruments remains very strong. You might recall that last fiscal year, we placed more than 500 new Panther systems worldwide, more than double our usual run rate. And we are off to an excellent start in fiscal 2021, with another 150 shipments in the first quarter alone. We still have a long waiting list for instruments, which we believe reflects the longevity of COVID testing that our customers anticipate.  Overall, our global installed base now stands at roughly 2,400 instruments, giving us a robust platform for future growth as more customers come to appreciate our system's best-in-class capabilities. Now let us shift gears to our third major topic, why we believe our business will be much stronger on the other side of the pandemic. First, it's never been more clear to us that demand for highly accurate molecular COVID testing will remain robust for a while. While we may have become a little numb to infection rates that remain staggeringly high in the United States and globally. But as a reminder, the almost 2 million molecular tests that are being performed daily in the United States today would annualize to a market that's about 17x bigger than the single largest molecular market before COVID. So while demand will inevitably decline as vaccines roll out, nucleic acid testing is likely to have a long, meaningful tail that extends into fiscal \u201822 and beyond, with COVID likely remaining our biggest molecular product for years to come.  As we have seen, it will take time to manufacture and administer vaccines broadly, and many people will choose not to be vaccinated. The societal need for, and focus on, COVID testing far exceeds anything we have ever seen before, and the pandemic's emotional toll will last much longer, driving future demand. As public concern around COVID persists, the combination of our huge Panther installed base, at facilities close to the patient and our gold standard assay performance have us uniquely positioned to pursue many use cases that will be around for the long-term. These include testing before hospital admissions, asymptomatic screening for various purposes, and even confirmatory testing of other, less accurate modalities.  Studies have shown that these other tests can miss two-thirds of asymptomatic cases, and these false negative results can contribute to super-spreader events. Even as the market matures and our production capacity increases, we believe our combination of robust chemistry, innovative engineering on Panther, and differentiated labeling from the FDA will help us gain market share.  Moving on, the second reason Hologic will be stronger in the future is the significant non-COVID business we are gaining on our rapidly growing installed base of Panther instruments. I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that in the United States, Europe and Asia, every single Panther that our commercial teams have placed has been with an eye toward the future. They are doing a fantastic job of extending and broadening commercial contracts, winning key strategic accounts, and fueling our razor, razor blade business model. As an indicator of this, last quarter we discussed Tests of Record, or TORs, which represent contracted, year-one revenue from new assay customers. We said that we achieved a new record in TORs in fiscal 2020, with non-COVID business totaling $35 million in the United States, about 50% more than we had ever done before. This positive trend has actually accelerated in early 2021, with more than $20 million of additional TORs in the first quarter alone. That's one reason that momentum in our molecular business, which was already good before COVID, is improving further today, especially in Europe. For example, when we remove COVID assay sales from our molecular number as well as instruments and ancillaries, core assay sales grew roughly 10% globally in the first quarter, more than double the rate a quarter ago. The third reason we believe we will be stronger post-COVID is that thanks to the tremendous success of our Diagnostics business, we have been able to use the last several quarters to further bolster our Breast and Surgical franchises for the future. In Breast, we have continued to expand on our strategy to diversify the business across the patient continuum of care. Rather than just placing capital equipment, we are now selling a full portfolio of hardware and software upgrades, interventional tools and service.  While the world has been understandably focused on COVID, we have increased our direct presence with Breast Health customers, and developed and launched products such as Brevera, which is off to a very good start in its re-launch. And most recently, we acquired for $64 million the German company Somatex, a long-time partner of ours, to strengthen our portfolio of breast cancer markers, enhance our commercial presence in Europe, and improve our profitability. In Surgical, both our R&D and business development pipelines have been productive, broadening the portfolio of products that we sell through a high-performing, highly engaged sales force. New products such as our Fluent, fluid management system and new hysteroscopes are complementing our market- leading MyoSure and NovaSure devices, and helped that division return to growth in the first quarter, well ahead of schedule. On the business development front, in August we spent approximately $80 million, plus future contingent earn-outs to buy Acessa Health. Acessa's ProVu is a laparoscopic RF product that is used to treat fibroids that MyoSure can't reach, so it's very complementary to our Surgical business and a nice fit for our sales force. And so far, early feedback from our customers has been good. The acquisitions of Acessa and Somatex demonstrate the final reason we will be stronger after the pandemic, the ability to use the healthy cash flow that COVID tests are generating to step up our business development activities. The pending, $230 million acquisition of Biotheranostics, which we announced earlier this month, is another good example of this strategy. Biotheranostics, a leader in molecular tests for breast and metastatic cancers, enables us to expand into the adjacent growth market of oncology. More specifically, Biotheranostics has done a great job of developing a strong clinical and reimbursement foundation for their flagship Breast Cancer Index test, which plays an important role in a large but underpenetrated breast cancer market that we know a lot about.  In addition, Biotheranostics provides us clinical lab capabilities that we can use to develop markets for novel content down the road. From a financial perspective, Biotheranostics brings more than $30 million of annual revenue, growth rates in excess of 20%, and strong gross margins. We're excited that since we announced the deal, Biotheranostics has received some very good news that will benefit women with early-stage, hormone receptor positive breast cancer. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network, or NCCN, included the Breast Cancer Index test in its guidelines to predict the benefit of extended treatment with various endocrine therapies. This should help establish the test as the standard of care for this important clinical question, and contribute to increased patient access.  Before turning the call over to Karleen, let me conclude by saying that we are off to an excellent start in fiscal 2021. Our purpose-driven culture is driving excellent execution and performance, both in terms of our COVID tests and the recovery of our other businesses. And we are working hard to ensure that the financial success we are experiencing now will translate into a stronger company down the road. We are confident it will. Now we'll turn the call over to Karleen. Yes, Dan, thank you. First off, it's funny how things go in full circle. As you know, over the last few years, we've acquired a number of our dealers in Europe on the Breast Health side and that gave us much more of a direct presence in a lot of the key countries, the UK, Germany, Spain, Portugal, just to name a few, and it's really helped us strengthen our whole team in Europe. So we've been building relationships at a higher level. As COVID has hit, it's given us incredible access to a lot of the major governments. We've got contracts with just about every major government in Europe. And in so doing, we're now on their radar screen that they really \u2013 a lot of them didn't know about the Diagnostics business and how much of a leader we are in the sexually transmitted infections and other stuff. So we've been able, as we've been selling in COVID and giving them Panthers to really be booking new business that will come online as the Panthers go down, and really just being able to talk more about our cytology business, our HPV business, and really just a different level of relationship that we think is going to strengthen us significantly down the road. Great question, Dan. I think, we'd probably put it in a couple of different perspectives. First and foremost, I would say is as -- while we are obviously generating a ton of cash right now, we also have the luxury of being in an enormous position of strength and that our base businesses are performing. And I think the best way that you can be very disciplined on deals is when it's easy to walk away from anything because you don't need anything and you feel good about your underlying business. So then if we look at the market specifically, it's been fascinating to watch over the last eight months, right? First, everybody hunkered down back March, April, May, including ourselves. We had pushed things like the Acessa deal. We had even pushed out a few months and we'd had a relationship with Biotheranostics and kind of just wanted to see where our own cash flow was at that point in time. So now, obviously, there is a lot of companies that are fairly flushed with cash. There is also a fairly healthy IPO market right now. So there is a bit of froth out there I think and we want to be disciplined. So I would tell you, as excited as the deals we've done. I'm probably more proud of some deals we've gone pretty deep on over the last three, four months that we walked away from, really over valuation or other issues in diligence. And that's I think the maturing of our team here and that the fundamental strength. So I think we're in a position where if we can get the right assets at the right price with good ROICs, hey, that's great. And if we need to wait some things out or even miss some things, we're not going to get caught into bidding wars and overpay. So I do think it's a pretty vibrant market right now. We've had every banker beating us \u2013 beating our door down trying to sell us things as you can imagine, but staying very disciplined. Sure, Patrick. You're hitting on clearly one of \u2018the biggest questions. I believe very strongly that we will continue to improve our market share, right? In the beginning this was kind of the wild, wild west. The FDA granted a gazillion EUAs, everybody raced out to the market. At the end of the day, we have some very powerful and enduring assets that we believe will put us in a really good place over the long run. It starts frankly with Panther and the installed base. We know there is a ton of hospitals that in a bare minimum are going to want to continue to test everybody that comes in their doors for procedures. They have them on site, they'll be doing that.  As we seek to get more people back to work and back-to-school, there is going to be a need for high-level testing that's asymptomatic. And I think again, what's been happening in the short-term, because there wasn't enough molecular tests in the beginning and the long turnaround times, there is a big emphasis on a lot of the rapid tests, particularly some of the antigen stuff and they're going to have a place. But at the end of the day, they're not indicated, most of them for asymptomatic screening and we keep learning more and more by the day. How much of this is asymptomatically being passed along?  And when you look at a lot of these super spreader events, they are quite frankly being caused by using the wrong tests off label to try to determine whether people have something. And I think over time, what we always say to our team is the cream rises to the top. So you have Panther and it's where it's located. You have an assay that's got incredible sensitivity specificity and one of the best labels. We also have the pooling indication. And once you get back into screening, call it, next fall, right, think about simple things. We want to get everybody back to school in the fall. The vaccines still aren't indicated for people under 16. So as we keep talking about vaccinating the country, children are going to be excluded from that. We're going to want to be doing asymptomatic screening and a lot of the antigen tests that people may say are great right now, they're not going to be as effective at picking up particularly asymptomatic indications. So we have that and then you just have the pure workflow advantage that should never be forgotten and that is the workflow of Panther, the random access automation ability to just make this as easy. The lab techs around the world have been running a marathon at sprint speed, they are exhausted. You can't walk in any lab and not hear from the lab director that their techs are just tired and they would much rather be able to be using Panther.  And one of the fundamental realities is, we've been shipping so much, but not all of it has been with our full pen caps and that's part of the capacity we've been building up. And as we're able to provide more and more of our pen caps, it creates the full automation benefit that not everybody has even been fully getting yet.  So, we have no idea, truly exactly how this is going to play out, but all the discussions we've been having with the Biden transition team has been continued about, \u201cHey, are you still building up more capacity?\u201c And we certainly are. We'll see how it all plays out. But I think like every market we compete in, we think we're going to be there standing. Yes. Overall, I would say it's really on the margin. We \u2013 frankly I think we finished the last quarter better than most. The fact that Surgical and Breast Health both ended up growing, which we wouldn't have expected. Whether they grow or stay flattish, we're probably talking little pieces here. We're seeing little pockets right in certain geographies; certainly, we'll have a couple of slower days in the surgical business or in the Breast Health consumable business. So it's I'd call it, it's a little temporary outages, but fundamentally it's going to be tiny for us given that we've got the COVID offset and I think we just continue to focus on sharing it will, take care of itself here over time, but maybe slightly more muted this quarter on a couple of those businesses, but still overall good. Alright. Good job Chris remembering, alright. Yes. We continue to look at different areas and different technologies Chris. I mean I'll tell you, if we've been inundated we'd probably get five or 10 per day, little companies, different technologies coming our way. We're certainly looking at some. We're probably generally a little more focused in the labs that we're \u2013 you know in our existing customers. We're always looking on the fringe other ways to extend out from there. So we'll continue to look at everything and stay disciplined on where we can get a good return and where we can bring value to the market. Yes Tycho, thanks. I think in terms of the new variance, right now we feel very good that the way we've designed our test, you know we have basically designed ours with two targets to ensure there's a backup target in case the virus mutates. So we continue to watch that but feel very good, and this is part of many advantages of having an incredibly sensitive and specific test to begin with, it targets the genomic regions that are less likely to mutate. So I think we feel very good about our ability to continue to catch those very well. And the second part of that was what again the multiplex. I'm sorry. Yes, the multiplex, we figure come the fall \u2013 for this winter as we all know there's basically been no flu season demand for our product. It's virtually been entirely our single COVID test. I think come next fall, having a syndromic multi, multiple option is probably going to make more sense and you would expect that we'll typically be there. I think at least in the short term, we're probably still reasonable. I think over the long run we've got to assume both of those will eventually come down. But I think at this point, particularly with the Biden administration extending the public health emergency through the end of 2021, we don't see any real near-term pressure on reimbursement.  I'm sure again, that will probably start to evolve as we go forward and it may evolve at different paces with different governments around the world as well, but so that ultimately will be some downward pressure certainly probably on pricing, but feel pretty good about where we are right now. Yes. We certainly did an ASR in conjunction with the Cynosure divestiture. In general, not a huge fan of those short of an event. I think we've been pretty good buyers of our stock. When you look back over the last, really five fiscal years, I think we've bought back over 30 million shares and been fairly consistent last year even more so.  I think it continues to be an important part of our strategy, but probably more executed along the way, both offsetting dilution, as well as frankly we've been reducing our share count really now for a number of years. Great! Next. Hey, Jack. We think there was probably some catch-up. Again is it a few percentage points, is it saying \u2013 it's hard to completely quantify Jack in terms of both cytology, as well as surgical and plus you have the year-end, people trying to get them in who have exceeded their Caps for the year, so you tend to have a pretty good time at year-end.  In terms of capital a little hard to know; we saw a little bit of strength in pockets, certainly. I think the way we're thinking about it overall is there's still going to be some little puts and takes here as the markets settle back down in the coming quarters. Are we continuing to take market share? Are we continuing to get stronger? And none of it frankly is going to make a huge difference. Do we grow a 100% next quarter or 95%, it's \u2013 we're talking on the base business, what would be minor percentages in terms of the total. Yes, I think in terms of your \u2013 the first question, I think we've got you know consistently a lot of singles coming in new product development. Frankly we hit a Grand Slam in Diagnostics and put all of our energy and it's hard for people to fully understand how much R&D and manufacturing and quality assurance resources went into getting all of both the assays out for COVID, as well as the additional label indications, things like pooling and they involve a lot of software. So we're continuing even just on pathways to continue to strengthen there.  In Breast Health we've got a number of things coming out using AI. We've got follow-ups from the SSI acquisition on ultrasound. You know Brevera is really in the process of rolling out. So we've got a lot of additional software and smaller things there. Then we've got obviously Acessa, the Pro-View product rolling in within the surgical business. So I think we feel very good about the cadence of those things rolling out. And then on the M&A front, I'll probably go back to our \u2013 the comment I made in probably answering the first question or so, which is to me the best way to be disciplined in M&A is to have a great core business and all of our business's right now are good. We've also got just really good teams able to do some great due diligence. We've really walked away from a number of things actually even over the last few months and we continue to work others. So I think we're able to look a little bit bigger, certainly given the cash, but we don't necessarily have big eyes or big needs and I think if anything, we're probably likely to be building a little bit more of a cash position here in the near term as Karleen mentioned. We've generated a $1 billion [ph] of cash, just in the last two quarters. We certainly aren't spending at that rate and that's okay for right now, we'll be patient and disciplined. Sure, we're continuing to produce Panthers at a similar rate right now to what we just placed, given that we still have very strong demand. I think probably later into calendar year \u201821, does that start to back down a little bit, probably given the extreme ramp-up, but we are continuing to produce at a similar rate right now."

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute. I would now like to introduce Ryan Simon, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nRyan Simon: Thank you, Jennie. Good afternoon and thank you for joining Hologic\u2019s fourth quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. With me today are; Steve MacMillan, the company\u2019s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer. Our fourth quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We will also post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them as well as an updated corporate presentation and a replay of this call will be available through November 30th. Before we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements we make today will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the safe harbor statement included in our earnings release and SEC filings.  Also during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Two of these non-GAAP measures are: one, organic revenue, which we define as constant currency revenue excluding the divested Blood Screening business and revenue from acquired businesses owned by Hologic for less than one year.  And two, organic revenue, excluding COVID-19, which excludes COVID-19 assay revenue, revenue related to COVID-19 and discontinued product sales in Diagnostics. Finally, any percentage change we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis and revenue growth rates will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted.  Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO.\nStephen MacMillan: Thank you, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone. Happy Halloween. We're pleased to discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and provide guidance for fiscal 2023. It was another dynamic year for Hologic, delivering strong performance while navigating macro headwinds and we closed 2022 once again posting outstanding results for the quarter.  Total revenue was $953.3 million and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.82, exceeding both our base business and COVID guidance. We also deployed $175 million of capital to buy back 2.5 million shares in the quarter. For those of you keeping score, for the full year, we utilized $542 million of our exceptional cash flow to repurchase 7.7 million shares, reflecting great confidence in our future. For today's call, we'll first provide a high-level overview of our fourth quarter performance and then reflect on our full year results. In doing so, we'll also share insights into our future outlook as we look forward to 2023.  Overall, make no mistake, our consistent strong performance in these turbulent times is no coincidence. We are a fundamentally different company today than when we entered the COVID pandemic. We also understand that some of you are still trying to ascertain the strength of our core businesses. As we look ahead, each of our core franchises, listen closely here, diagnostics, breast and surgical are expected to produce low double-digit top line growth for fiscal 2023. As we set out to do just over two and half years ago, we are emerging from the pandemic a much stronger company we thoughtfully and strategically reinvested our upside earnings into both our business and into our passion to be champions for women's health. Our ability to step-up to the plate during the pandemic and address the global demand for COVID testing was an incredible achievement. But our real home run was the transformation of Hologic that cannot be ignored. Through organic and inorganic additions, we now have more growth drivers across our business in each of our divisions than ever before. These growth drivers layered on top of our market-leading core franchises form a solid foundation that anchors our business in these volatile and pivotal times. Under the intense pressures of the macroeconomic landscape we live in today, all companies will face adversity. That said, because Hologic is a much stronger company today, we will thrive. As we've said before, you can count on us to deliver on our commitments even in the face of volatility and uncertainty. It's equally important to recognize that our revenue is the least capital sensitive it has ever been in our 36-year history. For fiscal 2022, given COVID and the impact from chip shortages, only 12% of our revenue was from capital. A percentage we expect will settle well below pre-pandemic levels. A truly astounding change from where we were just a few years ago, and a transformation that makes Hologic a more durable company in the face of a potential recessionary environment. Our confidence and conviction in our business is underpinned by our unwavering commitment to our purpose-driven business strategy, a strategy that is centered around our purpose to enable healthier lives everywhere, every day. Our passion to become global champions for women's health and our promise the science of sure. We don't see our commitment to mission and ESG as a trend or fad. Instead, we know that in order to continue to achieve our strong financial results, we must continue on our path to elevate and improve women's health and well-being around the world. Now let's turn to the quarter results. As expected, our strong performance was driven primarily by both our molecular diagnostics and surgical businesses. To answer the question, we're sure many of you are wondering. Core Panther utilization is strong. Our Molecular Diagnostics business grew north of 17% in Q4, excluding COVID, driven primarily by more assays being run through our expanded Panther installed base. This exceptional growth was once again broad-based and fueled by a combination of legacy and newer assays in our robust molecular portfolio. Our legacy STI business contributed growth dollars while our newer assays, including our vaginitis panel, MGen and our virology portfolio lifted the growth rate. As for Panther placements, we now have nearly 3,250 Panthers placed around the world. A remarkable achievement considered we exited fiscal 2019 slightly north of 1,700 Panthers in the field. In Surgical, our business grew nearly 9% organically and over 11%, including the Bolder acquisition. As anticipated, the COVID pressure on our surgical business abated in the quarter, and we saw procedural volumes return as well as acceleration from our new business lines. Powering the strong performance in Surgical were the same growth drivers as in Q3, MyoSure, Fluent and solid contributions from Bolder and Acessa. In Breast Health, as expected, the business was down 16%, driven primarily by the chip shortage adversely impacting our gantry business. Having said that, we have confidence that the worst of the shortage is behind us and that the business will return and accelerate throughout 2023. We will go into more depth on Breast Health later in the call. Shifting gears. We will now reflect on our full year results and outlook for fiscal 2023. For 2022, Diagnostics grew 10.2% and Surgical grew 6.3% and Breast and Skeletal Health declined 7.7%, driven primarily by constrained gantry sales as a result of chip shortages. Net without the chip shortage, it is very clear that each of our businesses would have been solidly at or above our long-term guidance. As a reminder, each of these figures are in constant currency, exclude acquisitions until they annualize and also exclude COVID assays and as well as COVID-related and discontinued products revenue. We are extremely proud of where we landed in both Diagnostics and Surgical. And we have high confidence that the concentrated impact on Breast Health will rebound strongly in 2023. Looking forward by division, as mentioned at the onset of this call, each of our businesses, including international, is expected to achieve low double-digit growth in fiscal 2023. In Diagnostics, powered by our vastly expanded Panther installed base, we expect low double-digit growth from the division in 2023, bolstering growth for the division we expect continued strong sequential growth from Biotheranostics as well as incremental contribution from Mobidiag internationally. Focusing on molecular diagnostics, our growth thesis centers on more customers running more volume and more menu on our Panther systems. While we are still in the early days of ramping utilization, we are already seeing positive signs today. With our broad menu, we are well-positioned to continue double-digit growth in our core molecular Panther business in 2023. To provide additional color and shed more light on non-COVID Panther utilization, pre-COVID at the end of our fiscal 2019, about 20% of US customers we're running at least four assays on their Panther systems. Fast forward to the close of Q4, now over 33% of US customers are running at least four assays, nice improvement and still future opportunity ahead. Moreover, last quarter, we spoke to the fact that over 90% of all COVID customers were running at least one other non-COVID assay. Many of you asked, what about new customers acquired during COVID? As of the Q4 close, over 85% of new customers worldwide are running at least one other assay on their Panthers in addition to COVID. More impressive is that over 55% of these new to Hologic customers, are running at least two non-COVID assays on their Panthers, a strong signal of future utilization at new customer sites. While still early, we expect these positive utilization trends to continue in the quarters and years to come. Now turning to Surgical. We also expect Surgical to deliver low double-digit growth in 2023. Consistent with the last two quarters of 2022, we believe MyoSure and Fluent plus Acessa and Boulder will lead the way. We expect the division's revenue to accelerate as we continue to integrate our acquired laparoscopic assets into the business and into the bags of our strong surgical sales force. Increased physician access and payer coverage for our laparoscopic portfolio should continue to improve over time and be a tailwind for growth. Longer term, our goal is to build both Acessa and Boulder into $100 million plus surgical brands that will complement our market-leading NovaSure and MyoSure products. In Breast Health, we fully expect to exit 2023, achieving low double-digit top line growth from the supply constrained 2022 comps. We have confidence the worst of the chip shortage is behind us. As chip supply normalizes, as it should over the course of 2023. We expect our gantry business to return to strength. Frankly, as we work down the backlog, we have the opportunity to perform slightly above the historical gantry placement run rate, as we exit the fiscal year. Even with the shortage of gantries we faced in 2022, we maintained our market-leading position in the US grew our presence internationally and have no reason to believe we are giving any ground to the competition. In fact, the backlog for our best-in-class gantries continues to grow, and we continue to receive orders at a healthy rate. We also understand capital budgets may face increased pressure given the macro environment. Despite this challenge, we remain confident in our ability to place gantries even if we enter a recession. The reality is that gantries tend to be at the lower price point of hospital capital spend. Gantries also represent both a value-driving opportunity for our customers and more importantly, essential capital equipment for world-class patient care. Finally, our international business will continue to be a tailwind and a powerful lever of growth for each division. In 2022, our international business grew just north of 6% organically, excluding COVID, posting strong growth even with the chip headwind and constrained gantry supply. International is now nearly 30% of total revenue and poised to continue its growth trajectory. Looking forward to 2023, we are confident our international business, excluding the impact of COVID, will return to double-digit top line growth and sustain the momentum created by our strong response to COVID and from our groundbreaking initiatives like the Hologic Global Women's Health Index and our global access initiative. To conclude, at Hologic, we know we must center on our purpose to achieve our strong financial results. From our strong results, we will continue to drive patient education and access initiatives, and continue to invest in our business. From our strategic investments, we will continue to deliver innovative, life-changing technologies. These technologies will power our perpetual cycle of reaching and helping more patients, all while delivering value and strong financial results for our shareholders. Before turning the call over to Karleen, let me close by saying that we are incredibly excited about where we have been and even more excited about where we're headed. And finally, from me personally and the rest of our global leadership team, we would like to thank and congratulate each and every one of our nearly 7,000 employees around the world for their dedication to our purpose and another incredible year at Hologic. With that, let me hand the call over to Karleen.\nKarleen Oberton: Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to share our fourth quarter financial performance, capping off the end to an excellent fiscal year. These results highlight our current position of strength as well as tremendous opportunities that lie ahead. Growth in the period was powered by our core diagnostics and surgical businesses, as both franchises posted strong growth to close 2022. For a second quarter in a row, these businesses each showcased multiple growth catalysts. And as we look towards our fiscal 2023, we are excited to drive this momentum forward. In Breast Health, we are proud of the resilience of our teams. Although our chip allocations are still constrained, we believe that the worst of the vision supply chain problems are in the rare view. As I will highlight in more detail when discussing our guidance for next year, we should see continuous improvement in our chip supply and thus gantry revenue throughout fiscal 2023. Finally, before moving on to our divisional results, it is important to reiterate that our balance sheet is a key point of strength as we head into fiscal 2023. Our leverage rate remains far below our target range and our capital structure is pristine, providing our business incredible confidence and flexibility, given the increasingly uncertain macro environment. Moving on, I will now provide more color on our financial results. In the fourth quarter, revenue and profitability once again significantly exceeded our estimates, as total revenue came in at $953.3 million. This result was nearly $100 million higher than the midpoint of our guidance, despite a greater-than-expected FX headwind of approximately $27 million in the quarter. And non-GAAP EPS was $0.82, roughly $0.20 higher than the midpoint of our prior guide. Turning to our businesses results. In Diagnostics, global revenue of $520.9 million declined 35.6% compared to the prior year. However, it is important to note that COVID testing revenue was elevated in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2021 due to the onset of the Delta variant. Therefore, a more accurate depiction of the state of the Diagnostics business is to exclude COVID assay revenue, related ancillaries and a small amount of revenue from discontinued products. When making these adjustments, we see that worldwide organic diagnostics revenue increased 11% in the quarter, a fantastic result. Within Diagnostics, our molecular business was again extremely strong, growing more than 17% in the fourth quarter when excluding the impact of COVID-19. Growth in molecular was broad-based, driven by solid performance in our legacy STI portfolio, as well as continued success of both our vaginitis panel and our virology menu. These results in conjunction with the exceptional performance of our molecular business last quarter, highlights strong traction in our base Panther business. As it relates to our COVID results, we generated $151 million of COVID assay revenue in the quarter, well exceeding our previous guidance. In terms of COVID assay revenue split by geography, Domestic demand outpaced our expectations, with the US COVID assay revenue representing nearly 70% of total COVID testing revenue in the period. As expected, international demand continued to moderate. Rounding out Diagnostics, our Cytology and Perinatal businesses increased 1.5% compared to the prior year. In Breast Health, global revenue of $271.1 million was down 16% as expected, primarily driven by chip supply shortages. For Q4, the impact to revenue from the chip supply shortage was in line with our prior guidance. In Surgical, fourth quarter revenue of $133.3 million grew more than 11%. And excluding the Boulder acquisition, the business grew nearly 9%. We are very encouraged by another strong quarter from our surgical franchise as the momentum we saw in our fiscal third quarter continued into our fiscal fourth quarter. The division's results were again led by MyoSure and Fluent with contributions from recent acquisitions. Lastly, in our Skeletal business, revenue of $24 million increased approximately 4% and compared to the prior year period. Now, let's move on to the rest of the non-GAAP P&L for the fourth quarter. Gross margin of 62.5% was ahead of our forecast, driven by higher than expected COVID-19 testing volume and strong results in our base business in the period. Total operating expenses of $329.9 million in the fourth quarter decreased 6.6% compared to the prior year period. This decrease was driven by less spend within G&A and sales, partially offset by higher marketing and R&D expense. Below operating income, other income was an expense of $3.1 million, less than anticipated, primarily due to gains associated with our foreign exchange hedging activities. Finally, our tax rate in Q4 was 21% as expected. Putting these pieces together, operating margin for Q4 came in at 27.9% and net margin was 21.8%, both ahead of our previous estimates. Non-GAAP net income finished at $207.5 million and non-GAAP EPS was $0.82. Moving on from the P&L, cash flow from operations was $168.7 million in the fourth quarter. Based on a strong cash conversion, we had $2.3 billion of cash on our balance sheet our leverage ratio was 0.2 times. Our cash generation continues to be excellent and our balance sheet remains a pillar of strength. Both positive attributes in any environment, but are especially valuable in cares of macro instability like we face today. And although we have continued to build cash, our M&A teams in each division remain active and our funnel of potential tuck-in opportunities is robust. As it relates to share repurchases, they remain an integral part of our capital deployment strategy moving forward. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2.5 million shares for $175 million. Further, on September 22nd, our Board of Directors approved a new five-year share repurchase authorization for up to $1 billion. Now, let's move on to our updated non-GAAP financial guidance for the first quarter and full year fiscal 2023. As a reminder, our organic guidance excludes acquisition revenue until each deal annualizes. Therefore, our first quarter guidance only excludes Boulder revenues from our organic base. Boulder becomes organic in our fiscal second quarter of 2023. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect strong financial results again with total revenue in the range of $940 million to $990 million. For all of fiscal 2023, we expect total revenue in the range of $3.7 billion to $3.9 billion, significantly exceeding our pre-pandemic levels. This guidance assumes low double-digit organic revenue growth, excluding COVID in each division for the full year fiscal 2023. To help with the constant currency modeling, we are assuming significant foreign exchange headwinds of slightly more than $30 million in the first quarter of 2023, and approximately $90 million for the full year. Please note that while we have taken a conservative view when considering the strength of the US dollar, currency markets continue to be very unpredictable. In terms of our divisions, we expect Breast Health, Surgical and Core Diagnostics, excluding the impact of COVID to grow low double digits for 2023. In Diagnostics, we expect our molecular business to continue to drive growth. Our Panther continues to deliver incredible benefits for our customers through assay consolidation, scalability and automation. In this environment, where labor remains a scarce resource, our highly automated Panther is a tremendous value proposition. With nearly 20 assays on the menu, we are eager to capitalize on this great opportunity to increase utilization on our expanded installed base. Finally, as Steve mentioned, we now have approximately 3,250 Panthers placed globally, placing more than 350 Panthers in fiscal 2022 and 49 units in Q4. Going forward, we will return to reporting Panther placements on an annual cadence. Moving to Breast Health. We are excited for the year ahead. Our customer base is hungry for our best-in-class thermography instrumentation. We continue to expect chip supply to gradually improve throughout 2023, and therefore, the division's revenue should increase throughout the year. And while we only have line of sight to allocations impacting revenue about two quarters out, we remain optimistic that the gantry business will exit fiscal 2023 at or near normalized levels. As it relates to our guidance, we expect Breast Health revenue to be down low double digits in our first fiscal quarter of 2023 given that the prior year was not yet impacted by supply chain shortages. However, for the full year, our guidance assumes the Breast Health will grow low double digits, reflecting supply recovery as the year progresses. Finally, in Surgical, we expect more broad-based growth than ever before. We anticipate MyoSure will continue to drive growth, but also expect notable lift from our Fluent Fluid management system as well as our laparoscopic portfolio of Acessa and Bolder. In terms of COVID sales, consistent with prior messaging, we believe COVID could be one of our largest molecular assays over the long-term. Having said that, given how quickly we've seen the pandemic change course, we believe it is still too early to accurately forecast an endemic state. As a result, we expect COVID assay sales to be $75 million in the first quarter of 2023 and $150 million for the full year. COVID related items, inclusive of a small amount of discontinued product revenue are expected to be approximately $35 million in the first quarter and $130 million for the full year. Moving down the P&L. For the full year, we forecast our non-GAAP gross margin percentage in the low 60s, and our non-GAAP operating margin percentage to be approximately 30%. Please note that we anticipate or COVID revenue, which is margin accretive, will be front-end loaded to the first half of 2023 to coincide with the fall and winter seasons in the US. In addition, we have again incorporated elevated inflationary pressures into our guidance as it relates to input costs. We foresee these higher costs persisting throughout 2023. In terms of operating expenses, we expect spending to be down compared to the prior year. While we will continue to invest in our business Marketing spend will be lower in fiscal 2023, as our fiscal 2022 had several large onetime expense items, such as our Super Bowl commercial and higher spending for initiatives such as our WTA partnership. Below operating income, we expect other expenses net to be around $20 million a quarter. Our guidance is based on an effective tax rate of approximately 19% and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately $252 million for the full year. All this nets out to expected non-GAAP EPS of $0.80 to $0.90 in the first quarter, and $3.30 to $3.60 for the year. To conclude, let me wrap-up by saying that, our strong fourth quarter results once again exceeded our guidance despite the various macro headwinds. Performance was driven by exceptional growth in our molecular diagnostics and surgical businesses, which we expect to continue. And while the future macro outlook remains uncertain with a natural hedge to future COVID uncertainties, and a fortress balance sheet, we are well positioned to continue strong results in our fiscal 2023. With that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will go to our first question from Patrick Donnelly with Citi.\nPatrick Donnelly: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the questions.\nStephen MacMillan: Hey, Patrick.\nPatrick Donnelly: Steve, maybe one -- hey Steve, how are you? May one for you on the Breast Health side, it sounds like the gantry backlog continues to build, good order pace. Can you just talk, I guess, about the visibility into that chip improvement? Obviously, again, the guidance kind of implies as the year goes. You guys -- you talked about the exit rate. I think improvement kind of mid-year. But, yeah, maybe just talk about the visibility there, again, on the order side. Are you seeing any share shift or kind of customers staying with you guys through this? And then similarly, just on kind of sound on the gantries you mentioned even in a recession, we feel pretty good about what the order growth would look like. I guess, what gives you that confidence, a lot of questions about hospital CapEx, obviously. So maybe just focus on the gantries for the first one, I would appreciate.\nStephen MacMillan: Sure, Patrick. I think what we feel great about is over time, and we haven't built the market share in the installed base in the United States, and really around the world, but especially in the US without people really buying into the superiority of our products, from a labeling, from a workflow standpoint, from a clinical efficacy published data, everything else that we're doing to both detect earlier-stage cancers sooner, also reducing the false positives and avoiding needless callbacks. People have really seen that. So when it comes down to it of a hospital system, is looking to need a few new gantries for their system. They're not going to want to go away from us because they've made that decision to come into us. So they're much more willing to wait until we're back in business, plus the other reality is this is an across-the-board industry issue. So it's not like we are short and others can provide. So we really have two things going for us, which is call it, the micro, our products and the incredible products we're offering and the macro that what we're dealing with -- with the chip issue is being felt by everybody else. So I think our customers understand that. I think anybody who's in purchasing or works for a hospital, they all understand the supply chains and their own personalized, right? You need a dishwasher fixed and the parts taking months to get those kinds of things that are playing out in everybody's life. And I think everybody understands, okay, it's just going to be a little while. So we feel great about customers continuing to want our products and feeling better and better about our visibility into as we've been working with all the chip vendors right down to every single SKU and how many chips go into every one of our machines feeling better and better about where we'll go.\nPatrick Donnelly: Okay. That's helpful. And then, Karleen, maybe on the back of that, you mentioned in terms of the op margins, COVID going to be heavier in the first half, which is margin accretive. But at the same time, as we just talked through there with Steve, the Breast Health recovery is going to be more second half. That's been a drag on margins. So how should we think about the op margin cadence throughout the year? I know you talked about 30% for the year. But maybe just talk about how that rolls through given the moving pieces between COVID, Breast Health and some other things there? Thank you, guys.\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. I mean, I would think, the 30% is probably pretty consistent throughout the course of the year. As you said, the dynamics kind of change first half versus back half. So I think that 30%, if you're plus or minus in any quarter, a point or two, I think you're right on.\nOperator: And so we'll go to our next question from Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley.\nTejas Savant: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Karleen, just following up on that margin question here a little bit. Can you just call out specifically in terms of the COVID contribution assumptions you're baking in here? Remind us of what the gross and operating margin assumptions are for that piece versus the rest of the business?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes, Tejas, why don't I just say that what we've noted in the prepared remarks is that COVID is accretive to the corporate averages, but we haven't disclosed it specifically. And I'd also add on that when you think about in this macro environment in our initial guide for the full year to say that our margins -- operating margins are going to be at 30%, which are pretty rich compared to the industry is pretty strong results, and we're really proud of that. And actually, even if you look at our net margins prior to pre-pandemic levels, which were around 20%, our guide would imply that they're roughly 22% to 23%, really reinforcing our earnings power.\nTejas Savant: Got it. That's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up there in terms of the ranges you've baked into the guide, Karleen. Can you just walk us through what's assumed for the Breast Health recovery? At the high end of the guide, are you assuming essentially a return to normalcy by the fourth quarter or is there still some possibility of the recovery taking a little bit longer?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. I think the guide would imply that we're approaching normalized levels as we exit the year. I would also say that part of the recovery, even if we did get incremental gantry chips than anticipated with the resource limitations as our field service engineers, who maintains the installed base also do the actual installs in any quarter. So, there will be a balance through this recovery, but I would, in general, think about a gradual sequential recovery throughout the course of the year and exiting close to normal levels.\nTejas Savant: Got it Thank you.\nKarleen Oberton: Welcome.\nOperator: And we'll go to our next question from Anthony Petrone with Mizuho Group.\nAnthony Petrone: Thanks and congratulations on a strong finish to the year here and good to see at least some visibility into calendar 2023, just given the headwinds. I guess I'm going to start on COVID testing and just the guidance that was issued here and then a follow-up on broader diagnostics. The understanding that it's still tough to forecast pandemic ebbs and flows, but maybe perhaps one of the things that is sort of becoming evident here is the tender patterns whether it be from large lab entities or even governmental contracts.  And so when you think into 2023, is there any incremental visibility that you can point to as it relates to just larger tenders, whether it be US, OUS at the hospital level or at the government level? And then I'll have a follow-up on broader diagnostics. Thank you.\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. I wouldn't say we've got any more visibility. We've been very close to our customers all along, Anthony, in terms of both international from the Ministries of Health, deciding things right down to the regional parties within various countries and the same within every one of our customers in the US, both the main labs as well as the hospital. So, I think we continue to stay close and feel very good about our position and the way we continue to think about COVID is we're going to deliver whatever the marketplace needs, we're not going to get out of our skis in terms of forecasting it financially.\nAnthony Petrone: And then in terms of just a quick follow-up on COVID. I mean as we think of it as a consistent cash flow driver, if we even look ahead maybe beyond 2023, at what point do testing providers really look at this as a relatively consistent cash flow business that reliably again, is going to be a contributor going forward. So, just kind of the broader views on the consistency of COVID? And then lastly, diagnostics, when you think of testing intensity, a lot of new Panther users are -- how do you think that plays out just beyond the point we are here at the end of this fiscal year? Thanks again.\nStephen MacMillan: Thanks Andy. We didn't fully hear the second part of that question because you were cutting in and out on the first part as it relates to the first part of the follow-up in terms of consistency on COVID, I think the way we've approached this all along has been you can't predict this has never been consistent. It has been volatile by region and by timeframe.  And any eight-week period, people have been way off probably trying to predict what was about to happen. So again, what we have said at the beginning, however, was we thought that this long term would create a new assay for us that would be far more enduring then, I think anybody ever thought it would be back in 2020 back to what people thought when everybody thought this was going to go away in a hurry or it was going to go away as soon as vaccines arrived or molecular testing was going to go away as soon as antigen tests came along, right? What we've learned is this thing is going to be around. And frankly, as long as countries like China are still trying the zero COVID approach, and everything else and the fact that this thing we always said in the beginning, this is a respiratory virus that will mutate. Herd immunity was never going to be achieved. And we thought we would end up with an enduring business.  Whether that enduring business ends up being $50 million, $100 million, $150 million, $200 million, we really don't know, but we feel really good that we're in that business. So thank you.\nAnthony Petrone: Thank you. I\u2019ll hop back in.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Jack Meehan of Nephron Research.\nJack Meehan: Thank you. Good afternoon. Well, I have a couple of questions on molecular testing before I go trick or treating. The first is on the COVID sales. So I think based on your disclosures, it sounds like the US assay sales were about $105 million, which was pretty stable sequentially. And I look at the government PCR data, volumes were down 27% quarter-over-quarter. So I was just curious on the COVID side, if you could talk about either share dynamics? Or was there any end of quarter ordering into the respiratory season? Any color on that would be great.\nStephen MacMillan: Yeah. It's hard for us to fully know on the share stuff because of the various pieces. I would say there were no unusual ordering patterns at quarter end, so none of this was a stocking up for fourth quarter. We generally -- our business is very diversified. And I think one of the things we did, as you well know, early in the pandemic is we went out to a very broad customer base. And I think that has helped insulate and provide a little more enduring nature to our business. It's also helped our pricing hold up reasonably well. And so I think we feel pretty good. But we -- it just continues to go and regions and spikes and this and it does feel like US testing is settling in for the first time to a more normalized pattern and we're still -- we're starting to see that certainly in our own business, but no unusual spikes.\nJack Meehan: Excellent. And then as my second question, so I appreciate the commentary about the new customers, the 85% running more than 1%, 55% more than 2%. Is there anything you can share on what are they running? Is this beyond respiratory testing? And I don't know if you have these stats handy, but how large is the virology business? If I look at the full year, how large is the vaginitis business? Any updates on those would be great.\nKarleen Oberton: Yeah. I think we stopped disclosing the actual number on that, but very strong growth year-over-year and that business continues to have a nice trajectory. I would say that it's diverse on the other assays, but probably leaning towards the core women's health assays primarily.\nJack Meehan: Thank you, Karleen.\nStephen MacMillan: Enjoy trick or treat.\nJack Meehan: Appreciate it.\nOperator: And we'll move to our next question from Puneet Souda of SVB Securities.\nPuneet Souda: Yeah. Hi, Steve, Karleen. Thanks for taking the question. So just a bit on the longer term. I mean, you've talked about 5% to 7%. You're saying low double digits here. Obviously, businesses are recovering low capital expense, but more of recurring revenue that your customers are spending your way. So, just talk to us about how should we think about that? And is that now more of a conservative number? And just talk to us about how you're thinking about the 5% to 7% longer term?\nStephen MacMillan: Yeah. I think long-term, we're sticking with the 5% to 7%. But as we've said all along, what, sometimes you're going to be above, sometimes it will be a little bit below. I think for where we are right now, we feel very good about delivering certainly above that for next year, but we don't want to get caught up way ahead of ourselves either and saying, we're moving that guidance up by any stretch. It's just as that reminder. There might be some periods of time where we're a little bit below that. There'll be periods we're above it. But I think we feel solidly about every one of our businesses.\nKarleen Oberton: We only gave that range about 15 months ago. So, I feel like we're not -- don't need to change it at this point.\nPuneet Souda: Okay, got it. And then Steve, a broader question for you. Now, in the sort of the post-pandemic era, and again, you might have a long tail to it, but do you see heightened utilization for flu, RSV, other respiratory just continuing on because of the awareness of just overall these viruses and overall, the significance of just overall diagnostics in routine primary care settings is such that it's going to be sustained. Just help us understand, do you see higher utilization just sustaining here for the respiratory businesses for a long time?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes, it's a great question, Puneet, because I think we do see probably higher levels of testing going forth, right? The diagnostics industry has been elevated and people desire to know with more certainty what they have, even think about something as simple as RSV that we're talking about here in the last few weeks. I'd argue that 99.9% of the public have never heard of RSV even a month ago, right? So, now we're getting into these levels of granularity that people want to know more about and what they have. And we think that will be a positive. It's also both what we're able to offer on our Fusion platform, also a big piece that Mobidiag will bring to us in the future. And certainly, we're seeing that in our European business right now. So I think we're well poised also for the future.\nOperator: And we will move on to our next question from Liza Garcia of UBS.\nLiza Garcia: Hi guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Appreciate it. Maybe to start off on Gyno Surgical and kind of expectations there with MyoSure kind of leading the growth for fiscal 2023. Can you kind of talk about what kind of gives you confidence. It seems like you have a little bit more optimism about kind of growth expectations for MyoSure, in particular. So I'd love to hear kind of what's driving the optimism and also kind of -- well, let's start there.\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. I think with MyoSure, we just -- first off, we're biased because we just came back from our US sales meeting last week with that sales team. And it's hard not to be excited when you've been with them. But I think on a more serious and deeper basis, MyoSure has been an outsized grower now for seven or eight years, long beyond what anybody thought it could be. And I think what we continue to see is there's still significant opportunities in the fibroid space. There's still, to some degree, markets that are underdeveloped and MyoSure procedure is an amazingly positive procedure with great outcomes. And so, I think we just continue to -- we're not quite sure what the end market truly is there.\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. International continues to be a bigger piece of that performance as well, what gives us confidence in that outlook.\nLiza Garcia: Great. And then, can you just update us where you stand with the Biotheranostics CLIA lab going to San Diego headquarters and your automation and initiatives that you have underway and how we should think about time lines for those and maybe potential impact there?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes, sure. The build-out of the lab in our building here in San Diego has gone well, that will be happening in the next couple of quarters, and we're adding more automation that will really be kicking in, in terms of particularly the ordering system really early next calendar year. So that team just continues to crush it since they've been part of the Hologic team. We were just with all of their salespeople last week and they're feeling so supportive and excited to be a part of Hologic. And its part of that classic thing of what we're trying to do is we bring these technologies in and are then able to put additional investment in them to accelerate the growth rates. What we've done with Bolder, what we're doing with Acessa, what we're doing with the Biotheranostics team and just feeling great about these opportunities.\nOperator: And we hear next from Max Masucci with Cowen and Company.\nMax Masucci: Hey, good afternoon. Congrats on a very strong year. First one, if we just think about the Panther install base, nearly doubling since pre-pandemic times, we have an expanding adoption of non-COVID menu items. Is there a logical range or a level where the non-COVID tamper asset gross margins have settled? Or maybe even in broader terms, how the go-forward Molecular Diagnostics gross margins have evolved since prepaid out at times?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes, I mean the gross margins for -- on the molecular business, we've said all along are accretive to the corporate average. But the dynamics of this business is, as we add more of the newer assays, we typically get those at a higher price, higher margin, but we give some pricing on the legacy assays. So, we'll get -- as we produce more in our San Diego facility, we'll obviously naturally gain more absorption. But I think about those holding at higher than corporate averages, but I wouldn't see a significant upward trend anytime in those.\nMax Masucci: Okay, got it. And then final one. A $2.3 billion in cash, historically low net leverage ratio, we're seeing recalibrating valuations in the public arena. So could you just give us a peek into the Hologic capital allocation playbook, should we assume that buybacks will remain the priority in a choppy market environment with opportunistic M&A sort of sitting in that number two slot in terms of prioritization?\nKarleen Oberton: Max, I would actually reverse that. So our capital allocation has consistently been to deploy our free cash flow, which, as you've noted, has grown over the last couple of years. But the priority is the M&A and share repurchase is more of an ongoing activity at a minimum to manage dilution from our equity plans as we see opportunities, disconnects to jump in and we'll get a little more. But priority will be M&A, but we'll be disciplined in that strategy.\nStephen MacMillan: Yes, because Max, if I could build on that. Obviously, if you're looking in the last year, we didn't do as much on the M&A front. The previous year, we did a whole bunch. So sometimes the doctors don't look at any given couple of quarters to say that we've changed our strategy. It's really about the overlying opportunity. The other piece I would reiterate is, when you have a healthy base business, it's also given us the enormous ability to be very patient in doing deals. And I think that's the best part of it all is when your core business is healthy. There's no need to do deals and we can do the ones that make sense for us. So clearly, to reiterate, as Karleen said, number one is still on the acquisition front. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And we'll go to our next question from Tim Daley with Wells Fargo.\nTim Daley: Great. Thanks for the time here. So, my first one is around the kind of broader macro environment. So, thinking about the guidance range here, is there any specific non-COVID drivers that you did layout for us that maybe put you guys at the high end of the guidance range or the low end? Or is COVID that kind of the big delta there?\nStephen MacMillan: COVID is not. This is -- we're really talking about our base businesses being strong, all three of them.\nTim Daley: Great. And then following up to that, are there any concerns that you have around the European geographical footprint, particularly relating to some of your third-party OEM partners? Just is that contemplated in guidance? Any additional details around that would be helpful.\nStephen MacMillan: We certainly worry about the geopolitical and particularly the economic scenarios in Europe, and I think particularly as this winter comes in energy and everything else. I think having said that, that's all the macro. The micro is our teams and our businesses are just in great shape. And I think are poised regardless of the environment, to be able to power and deliver through that. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you We'll move next to Derik de Bruin with Bank of America.\nDerik de Bruin: Good evening. Hope you're doing well. Hey, how are you? So, two questions. First of all, the tax rate is going from 21% to 19%. So can you tell us what's driving that? And the second question is going to be, what are you assuming in pricing? I mean, how much of your sort of like double-digit organic revenue growth when you're looking at some of the targets or some of the businesses is sort of being driven by price? And are you diagnostic customers, in particular, starting to potentially push back on pricing as COVID reimbursement is likely to go away next year, the higher -- as a public health emergency goes away? Thanks.\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. So, certainly, on the tax rate, we continue to look for opportunities to more effectively leverage our supply chain and our operational footprint looking for our low-cost areas. And so a lot of that work has been happening over the last 24 months, which is driving that lower tax rate down to 19% for 2023. And I think from one aspect of COVID pricing, I think when the public health margin does go away, I do think the pricing will be certainly much more of a discussion with our customers than it has been.\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. So, net Derik, we have very little pricing baked into the numbers. We have puts and takes, frankly, across franchises across geographies. And just to give a plug for Karleen because she's too modest. Everybody's always admired our operating margin piece, but she have been very focused on the net side, and our tax team has been working very hard over the last few years. So I think do a great, great job to really kind of show up this year with another opportunity for us to continue to drive that net margin.\nDerik de Bruin: And would you use 19% of the go-forward rate?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. At this point, I would muster a change in the federal statutory rate, I think 19% is good to use.\nStephen MacMillan: Thank you, Derik.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Casey Woodring with JPMorgan.\nCasey Woodring: Hi guys. Thanks for chipping me in. I guess just -- so last time we spoke; I think you guys were pointing to a pre-COVID operating margin of 31.5% from 2Q 2020. That is just a good place to start to 2023 as COVID would maybe balance out some of the supply chain headwinds in breast. So, curious just on the 30% number here, can you maybe quantify what the basis point headwind is from the supply chain dynamics on the year? And then maybe could you also quantify how much lower the international business operating margin is in relation to the total company's number? Thank you.\nKarleen Oberton: Yeah. So I think from the supply chain from the higher cost, it's roughly 200 to 250 basis points on the operating margin that we have forecast would persist through 2023. We have talked about international margins being lower than the US, but we have not disclosed the difference. But I think certainly, there is discussions, our teams are focused on improving their leverage as we move forward.\nOperator: And thank you, everyone. That concludes today's question-and-answer session. And this now concludes Hologic's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Have a good evening.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Karleen Oberton",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to share our fourth quarter financial performance, capping off the end to an excellent fiscal year. These results highlight our current position of strength as well as tremendous opportunities that lie ahead. Growth in the period was powered by our core diagnostics and surgical businesses, as both franchises posted strong growth to close 2022. For a second quarter in a row, these businesses each showcased multiple growth catalysts. And as we look towards our fiscal 2023, we are excited to drive this momentum forward. In Breast Health, we are proud of the resilience of our teams. Although our chip allocations are still constrained, we believe that the worst of the vision supply chain problems are in the rare view. As I will highlight in more detail when discussing our guidance for next year, we should see continuous improvement in our chip supply and thus gantry revenue throughout fiscal 2023. Finally, before moving on to our divisional results, it is important to reiterate that our balance sheet is a key point of strength as we head into fiscal 2023. Our leverage rate remains far below our target range and our capital structure is pristine, providing our business incredible confidence and flexibility, given the increasingly uncertain macro environment. Moving on, I will now provide more color on our financial results. In the fourth quarter, revenue and profitability once again significantly exceeded our estimates, as total revenue came in at $953.3 million. This result was nearly $100 million higher than the midpoint of our guidance, despite a greater-than-expected FX headwind of approximately $27 million in the quarter. And non-GAAP EPS was $0.82, roughly $0.20 higher than the midpoint of our prior guide. Turning to our businesses results. In Diagnostics, global revenue of $520.9 million declined 35.6% compared to the prior year. However, it is important to note that COVID testing revenue was elevated in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2021 due to the onset of the Delta variant. Therefore, a more accurate depiction of the state of the Diagnostics business is to exclude COVID assay revenue, related ancillaries and a small amount of revenue from discontinued products. When making these adjustments, we see that worldwide organic diagnostics revenue increased 11% in the quarter, a fantastic result. Within Diagnostics, our molecular business was again extremely strong, growing more than 17% in the fourth quarter when excluding the impact of COVID-19. Growth in molecular was broad-based, driven by solid performance in our legacy STI portfolio, as well as continued success of both our vaginitis panel and our virology menu. These results in conjunction with the exceptional performance of our molecular business last quarter, highlights strong traction in our base Panther business. As it relates to our COVID results, we generated $151 million of COVID assay revenue in the quarter, well exceeding our previous guidance. In terms of COVID assay revenue split by geography, Domestic demand outpaced our expectations, with the US COVID assay revenue representing nearly 70% of total COVID testing revenue in the period. As expected, international demand continued to moderate. Rounding out Diagnostics, our Cytology and Perinatal businesses increased 1.5% compared to the prior year. In Breast Health, global revenue of $271.1 million was down 16% as expected, primarily driven by chip supply shortages. For Q4, the impact to revenue from the chip supply shortage was in line with our prior guidance. In Surgical, fourth quarter revenue of $133.3 million grew more than 11%. And excluding the Boulder acquisition, the business grew nearly 9%. We are very encouraged by another strong quarter from our surgical franchise as the momentum we saw in our fiscal third quarter continued into our fiscal fourth quarter. The division's results were again led by MyoSure and Fluent with contributions from recent acquisitions. Lastly, in our Skeletal business, revenue of $24 million increased approximately 4% and compared to the prior year period. Now, let's move on to the rest of the non-GAAP P&L for the fourth quarter. Gross margin of 62.5% was ahead of our forecast, driven by higher than expected COVID-19 testing volume and strong results in our base business in the period. Total operating expenses of $329.9 million in the fourth quarter decreased 6.6% compared to the prior year period. This decrease was driven by less spend within G&A and sales, partially offset by higher marketing and R&D expense. Below operating income, other income was an expense of $3.1 million, less than anticipated, primarily due to gains associated with our foreign exchange hedging activities. Finally, our tax rate in Q4 was 21% as expected. Putting these pieces together, operating margin for Q4 came in at 27.9% and net margin was 21.8%, both ahead of our previous estimates. Non-GAAP net income finished at $207.5 million and non-GAAP EPS was $0.82. Moving on from the P&L, cash flow from operations was $168.7 million in the fourth quarter. Based on a strong cash conversion, we had $2.3 billion of cash on our balance sheet our leverage ratio was 0.2 times. Our cash generation continues to be excellent and our balance sheet remains a pillar of strength. Both positive attributes in any environment, but are especially valuable in cares of macro instability like we face today. And although we have continued to build cash, our M&A teams in each division remain active and our funnel of potential tuck-in opportunities is robust. As it relates to share repurchases, they remain an integral part of our capital deployment strategy moving forward. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2.5 million shares for $175 million. Further, on September 22nd, our Board of Directors approved a new five-year share repurchase authorization for up to $1 billion. Now, let's move on to our updated non-GAAP financial guidance for the first quarter and full year fiscal 2023. As a reminder, our organic guidance excludes acquisition revenue until each deal annualizes. Therefore, our first quarter guidance only excludes Boulder revenues from our organic base. Boulder becomes organic in our fiscal second quarter of 2023. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect strong financial results again with total revenue in the range of $940 million to $990 million. For all of fiscal 2023, we expect total revenue in the range of $3.7 billion to $3.9 billion, significantly exceeding our pre-pandemic levels. This guidance assumes low double-digit organic revenue growth, excluding COVID in each division for the full year fiscal 2023. To help with the constant currency modeling, we are assuming significant foreign exchange headwinds of slightly more than $30 million in the first quarter of 2023, and approximately $90 million for the full year. Please note that while we have taken a conservative view when considering the strength of the US dollar, currency markets continue to be very unpredictable. In terms of our divisions, we expect Breast Health, Surgical and Core Diagnostics, excluding the impact of COVID to grow low double digits for 2023. In Diagnostics, we expect our molecular business to continue to drive growth. Our Panther continues to deliver incredible benefits for our customers through assay consolidation, scalability and automation. In this environment, where labor remains a scarce resource, our highly automated Panther is a tremendous value proposition. With nearly 20 assays on the menu, we are eager to capitalize on this great opportunity to increase utilization on our expanded installed base. Finally, as Steve mentioned, we now have approximately 3,250 Panthers placed globally, placing more than 350 Panthers in fiscal 2022 and 49 units in Q4. Going forward, we will return to reporting Panther placements on an annual cadence. Moving to Breast Health. We are excited for the year ahead. Our customer base is hungry for our best-in-class thermography instrumentation. We continue to expect chip supply to gradually improve throughout 2023, and therefore, the division's revenue should increase throughout the year. And while we only have line of sight to allocations impacting revenue about two quarters out, we remain optimistic that the gantry business will exit fiscal 2023 at or near normalized levels. As it relates to our guidance, we expect Breast Health revenue to be down low double digits in our first fiscal quarter of 2023 given that the prior year was not yet impacted by supply chain shortages. However, for the full year, our guidance assumes the Breast Health will grow low double digits, reflecting supply recovery as the year progresses. Finally, in Surgical, we expect more broad-based growth than ever before. We anticipate MyoSure will continue to drive growth, but also expect notable lift from our Fluent Fluid management system as well as our laparoscopic portfolio of Acessa and Bolder. In terms of COVID sales, consistent with prior messaging, we believe COVID could be one of our largest molecular assays over the long-term. Having said that, given how quickly we've seen the pandemic change course, we believe it is still too early to accurately forecast an endemic state. As a result, we expect COVID assay sales to be $75 million in the first quarter of 2023 and $150 million for the full year. COVID related items, inclusive of a small amount of discontinued product revenue are expected to be approximately $35 million in the first quarter and $130 million for the full year. Moving down the P&L. For the full year, we forecast our non-GAAP gross margin percentage in the low 60s, and our non-GAAP operating margin percentage to be approximately 30%. Please note that we anticipate or COVID revenue, which is margin accretive, will be front-end loaded to the first half of 2023 to coincide with the fall and winter seasons in the US. In addition, we have again incorporated elevated inflationary pressures into our guidance as it relates to input costs. We foresee these higher costs persisting throughout 2023. In terms of operating expenses, we expect spending to be down compared to the prior year. While we will continue to invest in our business Marketing spend will be lower in fiscal 2023, as our fiscal 2022 had several large onetime expense items, such as our Super Bowl commercial and higher spending for initiatives such as our WTA partnership. Below operating income, we expect other expenses net to be around $20 million a quarter. Our guidance is based on an effective tax rate of approximately 19% and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately $252 million for the full year. All this nets out to expected non-GAAP EPS of $0.80 to $0.90 in the first quarter, and $3.30 to $3.60 for the year. To conclude, let me wrap-up by saying that, our strong fourth quarter results once again exceeded our guidance despite the various macro headwinds. Performance was driven by exceptional growth in our molecular diagnostics and surgical businesses, which we expect to continue. And while the future macro outlook remains uncertain with a natural hedge to future COVID uncertainties, and a fortress balance sheet, we are well positioned to continue strong results in our fiscal 2023. With that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions. Yes. I mean, I would think, the 30% is probably pretty consistent throughout the course of the year. As you said, the dynamics kind of change first half versus back half. So I think that 30%, if you're plus or minus in any quarter, a point or two, I think you're right on. Yes, Tejas, why don't I just say that what we've noted in the prepared remarks is that COVID is accretive to the corporate averages, but we haven't disclosed it specifically. And I'd also add on that when you think about in this macro environment in our initial guide for the full year to say that our margins -- operating margins are going to be at 30%, which are pretty rich compared to the industry is pretty strong results, and we're really proud of that. And actually, even if you look at our net margins prior to pre-pandemic levels, which were around 20%, our guide would imply that they're roughly 22% to 23%, really reinforcing our earnings power. Yes. I think the guide would imply that we're approaching normalized levels as we exit the year. I would also say that part of the recovery, even if we did get incremental gantry chips than anticipated with the resource limitations as our field service engineers, who maintains the installed base also do the actual installs in any quarter. So, there will be a balance through this recovery, but I would, in general, think about a gradual sequential recovery throughout the course of the year and exiting close to normal levels. Welcome. Yeah. I think we stopped disclosing the actual number on that, but very strong growth year-over-year and that business continues to have a nice trajectory. I would say that it's diverse on the other assays, but probably leaning towards the core women's health assays primarily. We only gave that range about 15 months ago. So, I feel like we're not -- don't need to change it at this point. Yes. International continues to be a bigger piece of that performance as well, what gives us confidence in that outlook. Yes, I mean the gross margins for -- on the molecular business, we've said all along are accretive to the corporate average. But the dynamics of this business is, as we add more of the newer assays, we typically get those at a higher price, higher margin, but we give some pricing on the legacy assays. So, we'll get -- as we produce more in our San Diego facility, we'll obviously naturally gain more absorption. But I think about those holding at higher than corporate averages, but I wouldn't see a significant upward trend anytime in those. Max, I would actually reverse that. So our capital allocation has consistently been to deploy our free cash flow, which, as you've noted, has grown over the last couple of years. But the priority is the M&A and share repurchase is more of an ongoing activity at a minimum to manage dilution from our equity plans as we see opportunities, disconnects to jump in and we'll get a little more. But priority will be M&A, but we'll be disciplined in that strategy. Yes. So, certainly, on the tax rate, we continue to look for opportunities to more effectively leverage our supply chain and our operational footprint looking for our low-cost areas. And so a lot of that work has been happening over the last 24 months, which is driving that lower tax rate down to 19% for 2023. And I think from one aspect of COVID pricing, I think when the public health margin does go away, I do think the pricing will be certainly much more of a discussion with our customers than it has been. Yes. At this point, I would muster a change in the federal statutory rate, I think 19% is good to use. Yeah. So I think from the supply chain from the higher cost, it's roughly 200 to 250 basis points on the operating margin that we have forecast would persist through 2023. We have talked about international margins being lower than the US, but we have not disclosed the difference. But I think certainly, there is discussions, our teams are focused on improving their leverage as we move forward."

            "name": "Stephen MacMillan",
            "content": "Thank you, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone. Happy Halloween. We're pleased to discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and provide guidance for fiscal 2023. It was another dynamic year for Hologic, delivering strong performance while navigating macro headwinds and we closed 2022 once again posting outstanding results for the quarter.  Total revenue was $953.3 million and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.82, exceeding both our base business and COVID guidance. We also deployed $175 million of capital to buy back 2.5 million shares in the quarter. For those of you keeping score, for the full year, we utilized $542 million of our exceptional cash flow to repurchase 7.7 million shares, reflecting great confidence in our future. For today's call, we'll first provide a high-level overview of our fourth quarter performance and then reflect on our full year results. In doing so, we'll also share insights into our future outlook as we look forward to 2023.  Overall, make no mistake, our consistent strong performance in these turbulent times is no coincidence. We are a fundamentally different company today than when we entered the COVID pandemic. We also understand that some of you are still trying to ascertain the strength of our core businesses. As we look ahead, each of our core franchises, listen closely here, diagnostics, breast and surgical are expected to produce low double-digit top line growth for fiscal 2023. As we set out to do just over two and half years ago, we are emerging from the pandemic a much stronger company we thoughtfully and strategically reinvested our upside earnings into both our business and into our passion to be champions for women's health. Our ability to step-up to the plate during the pandemic and address the global demand for COVID testing was an incredible achievement. But our real home run was the transformation of Hologic that cannot be ignored. Through organic and inorganic additions, we now have more growth drivers across our business in each of our divisions than ever before. These growth drivers layered on top of our market-leading core franchises form a solid foundation that anchors our business in these volatile and pivotal times. Under the intense pressures of the macroeconomic landscape we live in today, all companies will face adversity. That said, because Hologic is a much stronger company today, we will thrive. As we've said before, you can count on us to deliver on our commitments even in the face of volatility and uncertainty. It's equally important to recognize that our revenue is the least capital sensitive it has ever been in our 36-year history. For fiscal 2022, given COVID and the impact from chip shortages, only 12% of our revenue was from capital. A percentage we expect will settle well below pre-pandemic levels. A truly astounding change from where we were just a few years ago, and a transformation that makes Hologic a more durable company in the face of a potential recessionary environment. Our confidence and conviction in our business is underpinned by our unwavering commitment to our purpose-driven business strategy, a strategy that is centered around our purpose to enable healthier lives everywhere, every day. Our passion to become global champions for women's health and our promise the science of sure. We don't see our commitment to mission and ESG as a trend or fad. Instead, we know that in order to continue to achieve our strong financial results, we must continue on our path to elevate and improve women's health and well-being around the world. Now let's turn to the quarter results. As expected, our strong performance was driven primarily by both our molecular diagnostics and surgical businesses. To answer the question, we're sure many of you are wondering. Core Panther utilization is strong. Our Molecular Diagnostics business grew north of 17% in Q4, excluding COVID, driven primarily by more assays being run through our expanded Panther installed base. This exceptional growth was once again broad-based and fueled by a combination of legacy and newer assays in our robust molecular portfolio. Our legacy STI business contributed growth dollars while our newer assays, including our vaginitis panel, MGen and our virology portfolio lifted the growth rate. As for Panther placements, we now have nearly 3,250 Panthers placed around the world. A remarkable achievement considered we exited fiscal 2019 slightly north of 1,700 Panthers in the field. In Surgical, our business grew nearly 9% organically and over 11%, including the Bolder acquisition. As anticipated, the COVID pressure on our surgical business abated in the quarter, and we saw procedural volumes return as well as acceleration from our new business lines. Powering the strong performance in Surgical were the same growth drivers as in Q3, MyoSure, Fluent and solid contributions from Bolder and Acessa. In Breast Health, as expected, the business was down 16%, driven primarily by the chip shortage adversely impacting our gantry business. Having said that, we have confidence that the worst of the shortage is behind us and that the business will return and accelerate throughout 2023. We will go into more depth on Breast Health later in the call. Shifting gears. We will now reflect on our full year results and outlook for fiscal 2023. For 2022, Diagnostics grew 10.2% and Surgical grew 6.3% and Breast and Skeletal Health declined 7.7%, driven primarily by constrained gantry sales as a result of chip shortages. Net without the chip shortage, it is very clear that each of our businesses would have been solidly at or above our long-term guidance. As a reminder, each of these figures are in constant currency, exclude acquisitions until they annualize and also exclude COVID assays and as well as COVID-related and discontinued products revenue. We are extremely proud of where we landed in both Diagnostics and Surgical. And we have high confidence that the concentrated impact on Breast Health will rebound strongly in 2023. Looking forward by division, as mentioned at the onset of this call, each of our businesses, including international, is expected to achieve low double-digit growth in fiscal 2023. In Diagnostics, powered by our vastly expanded Panther installed base, we expect low double-digit growth from the division in 2023, bolstering growth for the division we expect continued strong sequential growth from Biotheranostics as well as incremental contribution from Mobidiag internationally. Focusing on molecular diagnostics, our growth thesis centers on more customers running more volume and more menu on our Panther systems. While we are still in the early days of ramping utilization, we are already seeing positive signs today. With our broad menu, we are well-positioned to continue double-digit growth in our core molecular Panther business in 2023. To provide additional color and shed more light on non-COVID Panther utilization, pre-COVID at the end of our fiscal 2019, about 20% of US customers we're running at least four assays on their Panther systems. Fast forward to the close of Q4, now over 33% of US customers are running at least four assays, nice improvement and still future opportunity ahead. Moreover, last quarter, we spoke to the fact that over 90% of all COVID customers were running at least one other non-COVID assay. Many of you asked, what about new customers acquired during COVID? As of the Q4 close, over 85% of new customers worldwide are running at least one other assay on their Panthers in addition to COVID. More impressive is that over 55% of these new to Hologic customers, are running at least two non-COVID assays on their Panthers, a strong signal of future utilization at new customer sites. While still early, we expect these positive utilization trends to continue in the quarters and years to come. Now turning to Surgical. We also expect Surgical to deliver low double-digit growth in 2023. Consistent with the last two quarters of 2022, we believe MyoSure and Fluent plus Acessa and Boulder will lead the way. We expect the division's revenue to accelerate as we continue to integrate our acquired laparoscopic assets into the business and into the bags of our strong surgical sales force. Increased physician access and payer coverage for our laparoscopic portfolio should continue to improve over time and be a tailwind for growth. Longer term, our goal is to build both Acessa and Boulder into $100 million plus surgical brands that will complement our market-leading NovaSure and MyoSure products. In Breast Health, we fully expect to exit 2023, achieving low double-digit top line growth from the supply constrained 2022 comps. We have confidence the worst of the chip shortage is behind us. As chip supply normalizes, as it should over the course of 2023. We expect our gantry business to return to strength. Frankly, as we work down the backlog, we have the opportunity to perform slightly above the historical gantry placement run rate, as we exit the fiscal year. Even with the shortage of gantries we faced in 2022, we maintained our market-leading position in the US grew our presence internationally and have no reason to believe we are giving any ground to the competition. In fact, the backlog for our best-in-class gantries continues to grow, and we continue to receive orders at a healthy rate. We also understand capital budgets may face increased pressure given the macro environment. Despite this challenge, we remain confident in our ability to place gantries even if we enter a recession. The reality is that gantries tend to be at the lower price point of hospital capital spend. Gantries also represent both a value-driving opportunity for our customers and more importantly, essential capital equipment for world-class patient care. Finally, our international business will continue to be a tailwind and a powerful lever of growth for each division. In 2022, our international business grew just north of 6% organically, excluding COVID, posting strong growth even with the chip headwind and constrained gantry supply. International is now nearly 30% of total revenue and poised to continue its growth trajectory. Looking forward to 2023, we are confident our international business, excluding the impact of COVID, will return to double-digit top line growth and sustain the momentum created by our strong response to COVID and from our groundbreaking initiatives like the Hologic Global Women's Health Index and our global access initiative. To conclude, at Hologic, we know we must center on our purpose to achieve our strong financial results. From our strong results, we will continue to drive patient education and access initiatives, and continue to invest in our business. From our strategic investments, we will continue to deliver innovative, life-changing technologies. These technologies will power our perpetual cycle of reaching and helping more patients, all while delivering value and strong financial results for our shareholders. Before turning the call over to Karleen, let me close by saying that we are incredibly excited about where we have been and even more excited about where we're headed. And finally, from me personally and the rest of our global leadership team, we would like to thank and congratulate each and every one of our nearly 7,000 employees around the world for their dedication to our purpose and another incredible year at Hologic. With that, let me hand the call over to Karleen. Hey, Patrick. Sure, Patrick. I think what we feel great about is over time, and we haven't built the market share in the installed base in the United States, and really around the world, but especially in the US without people really buying into the superiority of our products, from a labeling, from a workflow standpoint, from a clinical efficacy published data, everything else that we're doing to both detect earlier-stage cancers sooner, also reducing the false positives and avoiding needless callbacks. People have really seen that. So when it comes down to it of a hospital system, is looking to need a few new gantries for their system. They're not going to want to go away from us because they've made that decision to come into us. So they're much more willing to wait until we're back in business, plus the other reality is this is an across-the-board industry issue. So it's not like we are short and others can provide. So we really have two things going for us, which is call it, the micro, our products and the incredible products we're offering and the macro that what we're dealing with -- with the chip issue is being felt by everybody else. So I think our customers understand that. I think anybody who's in purchasing or works for a hospital, they all understand the supply chains and their own personalized, right? You need a dishwasher fixed and the parts taking months to get those kinds of things that are playing out in everybody's life. And I think everybody understands, okay, it's just going to be a little while. So we feel great about customers continuing to want our products and feeling better and better about our visibility into as we've been working with all the chip vendors right down to every single SKU and how many chips go into every one of our machines feeling better and better about where we'll go. Yes. I wouldn't say we've got any more visibility. We've been very close to our customers all along, Anthony, in terms of both international from the Ministries of Health, deciding things right down to the regional parties within various countries and the same within every one of our customers in the US, both the main labs as well as the hospital. So, I think we continue to stay close and feel very good about our position and the way we continue to think about COVID is we're going to deliver whatever the marketplace needs, we're not going to get out of our skis in terms of forecasting it financially. Thanks Andy. We didn't fully hear the second part of that question because you were cutting in and out on the first part as it relates to the first part of the follow-up in terms of consistency on COVID, I think the way we've approached this all along has been you can't predict this has never been consistent. It has been volatile by region and by timeframe.  And any eight-week period, people have been way off probably trying to predict what was about to happen. So again, what we have said at the beginning, however, was we thought that this long term would create a new assay for us that would be far more enduring then, I think anybody ever thought it would be back in 2020 back to what people thought when everybody thought this was going to go away in a hurry or it was going to go away as soon as vaccines arrived or molecular testing was going to go away as soon as antigen tests came along, right? What we've learned is this thing is going to be around. And frankly, as long as countries like China are still trying the zero COVID approach, and everything else and the fact that this thing we always said in the beginning, this is a respiratory virus that will mutate. Herd immunity was never going to be achieved. And we thought we would end up with an enduring business.  Whether that enduring business ends up being $50 million, $100 million, $150 million, $200 million, we really don't know, but we feel really good that we're in that business. So thank you. Yeah. It's hard for us to fully know on the share stuff because of the various pieces. I would say there were no unusual ordering patterns at quarter end, so none of this was a stocking up for fourth quarter. We generally -- our business is very diversified. And I think one of the things we did, as you well know, early in the pandemic is we went out to a very broad customer base. And I think that has helped insulate and provide a little more enduring nature to our business. It's also helped our pricing hold up reasonably well. And so I think we feel pretty good. But we -- it just continues to go and regions and spikes and this and it does feel like US testing is settling in for the first time to a more normalized pattern and we're still -- we're starting to see that certainly in our own business, but no unusual spikes. Enjoy trick or treat. Yeah. I think long-term, we're sticking with the 5% to 7%. But as we've said all along, what, sometimes you're going to be above, sometimes it will be a little bit below. I think for where we are right now, we feel very good about delivering certainly above that for next year, but we don't want to get caught up way ahead of ourselves either and saying, we're moving that guidance up by any stretch. It's just as that reminder. There might be some periods of time where we're a little bit below that. There'll be periods we're above it. But I think we feel solidly about every one of our businesses. Yes, it's a great question, Puneet, because I think we do see probably higher levels of testing going forth, right? The diagnostics industry has been elevated and people desire to know with more certainty what they have, even think about something as simple as RSV that we're talking about here in the last few weeks. I'd argue that 99.9% of the public have never heard of RSV even a month ago, right? So, now we're getting into these levels of granularity that people want to know more about and what they have. And we think that will be a positive. It's also both what we're able to offer on our Fusion platform, also a big piece that Mobidiag will bring to us in the future. And certainly, we're seeing that in our European business right now. So I think we're well poised also for the future. Yes. I think with MyoSure, we just -- first off, we're biased because we just came back from our US sales meeting last week with that sales team. And it's hard not to be excited when you've been with them. But I think on a more serious and deeper basis, MyoSure has been an outsized grower now for seven or eight years, long beyond what anybody thought it could be. And I think what we continue to see is there's still significant opportunities in the fibroid space. There's still, to some degree, markets that are underdeveloped and MyoSure procedure is an amazingly positive procedure with great outcomes. And so, I think we just continue to -- we're not quite sure what the end market truly is there. Yes, sure. The build-out of the lab in our building here in San Diego has gone well, that will be happening in the next couple of quarters, and we're adding more automation that will really be kicking in, in terms of particularly the ordering system really early next calendar year. So that team just continues to crush it since they've been part of the Hologic team. We were just with all of their salespeople last week and they're feeling so supportive and excited to be a part of Hologic. And its part of that classic thing of what we're trying to do is we bring these technologies in and are then able to put additional investment in them to accelerate the growth rates. What we've done with Bolder, what we're doing with Acessa, what we're doing with the Biotheranostics team and just feeling great about these opportunities. Yes, because Max, if I could build on that. Obviously, if you're looking in the last year, we didn't do as much on the M&A front. The previous year, we did a whole bunch. So sometimes the doctors don't look at any given couple of quarters to say that we've changed our strategy. It's really about the overlying opportunity. The other piece I would reiterate is, when you have a healthy base business, it's also given us the enormous ability to be very patient in doing deals. And I think that's the best part of it all is when your core business is healthy. There's no need to do deals and we can do the ones that make sense for us. So clearly, to reiterate, as Karleen said, number one is still on the acquisition front. Thank you. COVID is not. This is -- we're really talking about our base businesses being strong, all three of them. We certainly worry about the geopolitical and particularly the economic scenarios in Europe, and I think particularly as this winter comes in energy and everything else. I think having said that, that's all the macro. The micro is our teams and our businesses are just in great shape. And I think are poised regardless of the environment, to be able to power and deliver through that. Thank you. Yes. So, net Derik, we have very little pricing baked into the numbers. We have puts and takes, frankly, across franchises across geographies. And just to give a plug for Karleen because she's too modest. Everybody's always admired our operating margin piece, but she have been very focused on the net side, and our tax team has been working very hard over the last few years. So I think do a great, great job to really kind of show up this year with another opportunity for us to continue to drive that net margin. Thank you, Derik."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon and welcome to the Hologic Third Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Cody and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute.  And I would now like to introduce Ryan Simon, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nRyan Simon: Thank you, Cody. Good afternoon and thank you for joining Hologic's third quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer.  Our third quarter press release is available now on the investors section of our website, along with an updated corporate presentation. We will also post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. And a replay of this call will be available through August 26th.  Before we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements we make today will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the safe harbor statement included in our earnings release and SEC filings.  Also during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Two of these non-GAAP measures are, one, organic revenue, which we define as constant currency revenue excluding the divested blood screening business and revenue from acquired businesses owned by Hologic for less than one year. And two, organic revenue excluding COVID- 19, which excludes COVID-19 assay revenue, revenue related to COVID-19, and discontinued product sales in Diagnostics.  Finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted.  Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO. \nStephen MacMillan: Thank you, Ryan. And good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to discuss our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Our results continue to showcase the strength, durability and diversity of our business.  Total revenue was just over $1 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.95. Both numbers exceeded the midpoint of our guidance on the top and bottom lines \u2013 the result of both enduring COVID revenue and also strong performances in our core Diagnostics and Surgical businesses.  In this dynamic and ever-changing world, we continue to live our purpose, passion and promise \u2013 to enable healthier lives everywhere, every day \u2013 and be global champions for women's health. In doing so, our industry-leading products continue to reach even more patients around the world, while our business delivers strong financial performance and value for our shareholders.  To put it simply, the durability and diversity of our business enables Hologic to succeed in this challenging macro environment. As we navigate a multitude of headwinds, our confidence in our business remains steady and remains high.  Looking longer term, our message is also unchanged. We are confident, despite the current turbulence, that our previously announced 5% to 7% annual organic revenue growth rate through 2025 remains an achievable target, provided the current chip headwind normalizes as we expect.  Ahead of turning the call over to Karleen to discuss our financial results in more detail, we'd like to highlight growth drivers and provide updates on each of our businesses \u2013 Diagnostics, Breast Health, and Surgical. And to close, we are excited to share our experience from the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in May, an experience that reaffirms the importance of our place and our voice on the world stage advocating for women's health, especially now.  Before jumping into each division, it is important to revisit the impact of COVID on our business. The reality is that whether the demand for COVID testing is high or low, we are poised to succeed either way. We have a natural COVID hedge. As we have seen over the past two years, COVID prevalence affects each of our base businesses. As COVID cases rise, elective well-woman exams, screenings, and surgical procedures are often postponed. Conversely, as COVID declines, our base business strengthens.  As we responded with unprecedented speed to answer the world's needs for highly reliable molecular COVID testing, we also dramatically strengthened our company for the future.  We also know that many of you are trying to gauge the longer-term impact and durability of our additional Panther placements, as well as the impact of our various acquisitions over the last couple of years in Diagnostics and Surgical.  The truth is, the various surges in COVID cases around the world through many of the last quarters have often created wide variability in the comps, as some quarters reflect times of significant non-COVID related hospital and doctor visit slowdowns, while others bounced back stronger in varying geographies in any given quarter.  When we last reported in April, for example, our core Diagnostic and Surgical businesses posted year-over-year growth rates of 4% and 3.5%, respectively, amidst the COVID surge at the time.  So, for anyone questioning these admittedly lower growth rates, we want to highlight two numbers from this quarter. The first number \u2013 22.4% \u2013 that was the growth in our global molecular diagnostic business, and the second number \u2013 9.7% \u2013 that was the growth in our Surgical business this quarter.  Now we'd encourage two simple takeaways from these results. One, these businesses have strong underlying growth; and two, the true growth rate is somewhere in between last quarter's results and this quarter's, underscoring the need to view how our strength evolves over time, and given the variability of COVID, that no single quarter result is going to match a linear model.  Now shifting gears to the businesses. First in Diagnostics, with COVID testing significantly down sequentially, our third quarter provided an opportunity for customers to validate and run more non-COVID assays on their Panther systems. As a result, our Diagnostic business grew 15% excluding COVID year-over-year worldwide, a truly phenomenal result and one that demonstrates the impact of women returning to their wellness exams and procedures.  Even more impressive, as mentioned earlier, our global molecular diagnostics business grew over 22% excluding COVID in the period. An early, yet clear sign that our expanded Panther installed base, is, A, being utilized, and, B, will prevail as an instrument of choice as customers consolidate their molecular testing menu to high- throughput, high-automation platforms.  For more color on the growth drivers within molecular diagnostics, performance was driven by a combination of both legacy and new assays, namely the BV/CV/TV vaginitis panel, M.gen, CT/NG and our respiratory menu on the Panther Fusion, to name a few. Our vaginitis panel continues to outperform and deliver impressive growth on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. As we have previously stated, the vaginitis panel is well positioned to become a top 3 assay in our molecular diagnostic portfolio over time.  International diagnostics was also a bright spot in the quarter. The business grew 16.5% excluding COVID, driven primarily by our virology portfolio.  As expected, Panther placements slowed to 59 new systems placed in the quarter, with nearly 70% of these placed internationally. While a decline from the 119 and 123 systems placed in our first two quarters, annualizing Q3's placements lands within our historic run rate of about 225 to 250 placements per year. As a reminder, Panther sales have minimal impact to the molecular diagnostic growth rate, as assays are the primary driver of growth, by far.  Further, placements at lower levels going forward is consistent with our expectations, given we have increased our Panther footprint by nearly 85% since the start of the pandemic. We now have roughly 3,200 Panthers installed worldwide.  To close out the Diagnostics update, our Biotheranostics business was again a highlight for the quarter, posting $18.9 million in sales, representing outstanding growth of 43%.  Moving on to Breast Health. First and foremost, as to chip supply, we reiterate our statement from last quarter \u2013 we believe the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal 2022 will prove to be the low water mark in terms of chip availability for our gantries. Working closely with our suppliers, we observed positive trends in Q3. These positive trends include stabilizing lead times, procurement through a combination of channels, and most importantly, narrowing the breadth and depth of tight supply. Although we remain optimistic these positive trends will maintain throughout the remainder of our fiscal year, the situation remains fluid.  As for gantries, demand remains strong. Our best-in-class technology, service, and customer satisfaction continues to differentiate and separate us from the competition. In addition, our sales force continues to place orders in line with quotas set prior to the chip headwind surfacing and there has been no meaningful change to the rate of cancelled orders.  On the chip supply chain recovery, while we are not providing fiscal 2023 guidance on this call, we do anticipate that chip supply, and thus gantry availability, will be recovering throughout fiscal 2023 and continue into 2024.  Next, in Surgical, the business returned to strong performance, posting 9.7% revenue growth in the third quarter. This growth was driven primarily by the combination of MyoSure, our Fluent Fluid Management System, and Bolder.  As a reminder, our MyoSure devices are used for fibroid and tissue removal and the Fluent system is complementary to MyoSure, assisting physicians with hysteroscopic procedures. The Fluent system simplifies and streamlines the historically complicated and cumbersome fluid management workflow used in these procedures.  While MyoSure and Fluent sales represent the lion's share of Surgical growth in the quarter, we are also very excited by the growth from our laparoscopic portfolio. Both the Acessa procedure and Bolder devices that we acquired to add growth and diversify the franchise performed well. Specifically, we are excited by the incremental progress in sales of the Acessa procedure. Smaller numbers but revenue growth of nearly 50% year-over-year, a meaningful step in increasing the utilization of this novel procedure.  Acessa's growth was driven primarily by two factors. First, excellent efforts from our team to increase patient covered lives to 84% compared to 26% when we first acquired the business about two years ago. With this critical mass of covered lives, which is often considered table stakes by many physicians, more doors were opened.  Second, growth was also driven by more physician access to conduct monitored cases. Access was both in-person and also via our innovative virtual case monitoring platform. This virtual system was implemented specifically to address physician access challenges created by COVID.  As the COVID pandemic moves gradually to an endemic state and physician access improves, we are confident that Acessa will be a meaningful growth contributor going forward.  And finally, as many of you know, in May we had the opportunity to participate at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting held in Davos, Switzerland. At the Forum, we met with world leaders and change makers to further our mission and champion women's health.  Our message was clear, putting women's health at the forefront was long overdue. The time to elevate women's health, with the help of science-backed data to guide decisions and policy making, is now.  As we have said before, women's health is the cornerstone of families, communities, societies and economies around the world. With insights from our Hologic Global Women's Health Index, Project Health Equality and decades of leadership in women's health, we came to the Forum to make a difference. We left the Forum knowing we had. We understand change does not move in a straight line, and we are committed to supporting women every step of the way.  Before we turn the call over to Karleen, to conclude, we want to repeat that our third quarter results give us even more confidence in the strength of our business. This confidence is rooted in our demonstrated ability to absorb and adapt to the pressures and headwinds of this dynamic macroenvironment. As the current pressures and headwinds subside over time, we are in strong position to continue our durable growth trajectory for quarters and years to come.  With that, let me turn the call over to Karleen.\nKarleen Oberton: Thank you, Steve. And good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to share third quarter results that once again significantly exceeded our guidance for both revenue and non-GAAP EPS.  Our third quarter financial performance highlights the strength of our core Diagnostics and Surgical businesses, both of which surpassed our long-term revenue target of 5% to 7% growth in the period.  And in our Breast Health business, although we continue to see headwinds related to semiconductor chip availability, as Steve mentioned, we remain optimistic that the supply environment will start to improve in our fiscal 2023.  In terms of COVID-19 testing, we continue to showcase our agility in responding to highly variable global demand. And while we continue to meet our customers' COVID testing needs, we also have delivered on robust demand for our non-COVID molecular diagnostics menu.  Finally, cash flow generation in the third quarter was very strong, again coming in above pre-pandemic levels. As a result, our balance sheet remains an exceptional pillar of strength.  Moving on, we will now provide more color on our financial results. In the third quarter, both top line performance and bottom line profitability were well ahead of our previous estimates.  Total revenue came in just over $1 billion, more than $100 million higher than the mid-point of our guidance, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.95, $0.25 higher than the mid-point of our prior guide.  Turning to our business results. In Diagnostics, global revenue of $560.1 million declined 13.6% compared to the prior year. However, excluding COVID assay revenue, related ancillaries, and a small amount of revenue from discontinued products, worldwide organic Diagnostics revenue increased 15%, a great result against a solid comp in the prior year.  As a reminder, our organic results for fiscal Q3 2022 include Biotheranostics and Diagenode revenue, as these transactions have now annualized.  Within Diagnostics, our molecular business was exceptionally strong in our fiscal third quarter. Excluding the impact of COVID-19, molecular revenue grew over 22% organically in the period. Underlying this excellent result was strong utilization across our base molecular menu.  As Steve highlighted, growth from our vaginitis panel led the way, while our virology portfolio also delivered strong performance. In addition, we saw stability in our core STI menu in the period, affirming our leadership position in women's health diagnostics.  While these Diagnostics results include a small amount of residual demand from the adverse impact of COVID felt in the second quarter, our molecular franchise continues to be a key catalyst of our future growth. We are very encouraged to see customers transition additional menu onto our Panther systems as COVID testing demand declines.  As it relates to our COVID results, we generated $173 million of COVID assay revenue in the quarter, exceeding our guidance of $100 million. We shipped about 8.1 million tests to customers, reflecting a global ASP of approximately $21. Although ASP held steady this quarter, we still believe that pricing will eventually fall as reimbursement declines.  In terms of COVID assay revenue split by geography, domestic demand was strong, while international demand declined throughout the quarter. The US COVID assay revenue represented approximately 60% of total COVID testing revenue in the period, a flip in geographic COVID demand versus the prior year, underscoring the variability of COVID revenue.  Rounding out Diagnostics, our cytology and perinatal businesses increased 3.5% compared to the prior year. This result is reflective of patients returning to their well- women's exams after postponing these important visits during periods of high COVID prevalence.  In Breast Health, global revenue of $282.8 million was down approximately 18%, as expected, primarily driven by the chip supply shortages we have discussed over the past six months.  Related to gantries, we performed slightly better than anticipated. While our acquisition of chips in the quarter met our expectations, we again delivered slight favorability through reclaiming, refurbishing and recertifying printed circuit boards from servicing our gantry installed base.  Moving to Interventional Breast, the segment grew over 4% in our fiscal third quarter. This performance was driven by growth in Brevera's disposable needles. Customers continue to see the benefit of Brevera's differentiated and efficient biopsy workflow, especially as their labor resources have become increasingly constrained.  In Surgical, third quarter revenue of $138.1 million grew almost 10%. We are very pleased with the strong rebound in the business during the period, as positive procedural trends exiting our fiscal second quarter continued through June. Powering this quarter's performance for Surgical was a nice lift from MyoSure and the related Fluent Fluid Management System, plus Bolder.  Lastly, in our Skeletal business, as expected, revenue of $21.7 million decreased approximately 14% compared to the prior-year period.  Now let's move on to the rest of the non-GAAP P&L for the third quarter. Gross margin of 63.3% was ahead of our forecast, driven by the higher-than-expected COVID-19 testing volume and strong results in our base businesses in the period.  Total operating expenses of $311.2 million in the third quarter increased less than 1% compared to the prior year. The increase in operating expense was driven by spend within marketing and R&D, partially offset by less G&A and sales expense.  However, when we normalize for spending from Mobidiag and Bolder, operating expenses decreased 3% compared to the prior year.  Finally, our tax rate in Q3 was 21%, as expected.  Putting these pieces together, operating margin for Q3 came in at 32.3%, and net margin was 24.1%, both above pre-pandemic levels.  Non-GAAP net income finished at $241.5 million and non-GAAP EPS was $0.95.  Moving on from the P&L, cash flow from operations was $330.6 million in the third quarter. These robust cash flows continue to provide tremendous financial and strategic flexibility.  Based on this strong operational performance, we had $2.4 billion of cash on our balance sheet and our leverage ratio was 0.2 times. As we have previously stated, we are comfortable building our cash balance during this challenging macro backdrop. That said, we continue to diligently pursue M&A opportunities in each one of our businesses.  Finally, while there were no share repurchases during the quarter, our share repurchase program remains an ongoing part of our capital deployment framework. So far this fiscal year, we have repurchased approximately 5.2 million shares for $367 million, a sizeable outlay of funds.  Now let's move on to our updated non-GAAP financial guidance for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2022. As a reminder, our organic guidance excludes acquisition revenue until each deal annualizes. Therefore, our fourth quarter guidance only excludes Bolder revenue from our organic base.  Given our strong third quarter performance, we are once again increasing our full-year revenue and EPS guidance. For the full year, we now see total revenue in the range of $4.75 to $4.78 billion and EPS of $5.79 to $5.84, representing an increase of $115 million on the top line and $0.26 on the bottom-line compared to the midpoint of our previous guidance.  With only one quarter remaining in our fiscal year, this annual guidance implies revenue of $840 million to $870 million and EPS of $0.60 to $0.65 for our fiscal fourth quarter.  With respect to foreign exchange, given the unabated strength of the US dollar, we are assuming an FX headwind of slightly more than $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, nearly $10 million higher than our prior guidance incorporated for the quarter.  In terms of COVID sales, we expect COVID assay sales to be at least $70 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and $1.35 billion for the full year. COVID-related items, inclusive of a small amount of discontinued product revenue, are expected to be slightly less than $35 million in the fourth quarter and $215 million for the full year.  As it relates to the Breast Health chip shortage, although we had marginal improvement versus expectations in Q3, guidance on the gantry revenue shortfall for the fourth quarter remains unchanged from our prior messaging.  Moving down the P&L, for the full year we forecast our non-GAAP gross margin percentage in the high 60s and our non-GAAP operating margin percentage in the high 30s to approximately 40%. Both estimates are well above pre-pandemic levels.  Further, our Q4 guidance incorporates the margin impact from our Breast Health supply chain revenue shortfall. As a reminder, gantry gross margins are accretive to consolidated averages, and we have maintained operating spend to be in position to move quickly once we receive chips. In addition, we have again incorporated elevated costs into our Q4 guidance as it relates to electronics, plastics and logistics.  In terms of operating expenses, we expect spending to be down a few million dollars sequentially. Below operating income, we expect other expenses, net, to be around $20 million in our fiscal fourth quarter.  Our guidance is based on an effective tax rate of 21% and diluted shares outstanding of around 250 million for the full year.  Finally, although we will update everyone on our fiscal 2023 guidance during our Q4 call next quarter, I would remind you that the headwinds related to higher input costs, the stronger US dollar, and increasing interest rates are unlikely to subside in the near-term. Like many other companies, we expect these headwinds to continue into the fourth quarter and into our fiscal 2023.  To help offset these pressures, as we do every quarter, we seek out efficiencies in our business and strategically manage pricing where we have the opportunity. Although these temporary challenges are not unique to Hologic, they are important to consider for modeling purposes.  To conclude, let me wrap up by saying that Hologic posted very strong third quarter results, underpinned by exceptional growth in molecular diagnostics and a healthy rebound in our Surgical business. We are also once again raising our financial guidance for the year.  And although the future macro-outlook remains cloudy, with a natural hedge to future COVID uncertainties, as well as an increasingly strong balance sheet and best-in-class cash flow, we are well positioned to continue to deliver strong results for our shareholders.  With that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research.\nJack Meehan: I wanted to go into the molecular results and the 22% organic growth ex COVID. If you look at the Panthers you've installed over the last couple of years for COVID, is it possible to call out now what portion are running something beyond COVID now as well? And also within that result, can you just break out how much the vaginitis revenue was in the quarter?\nKarleen Oberton: So I think from a \u2013 certainly in the US, the majority of our Panthers are running more than COVID, for sure. I think we are really pleased with the vaginitis growth, but I don't think we're going to give the absolute number at this time.\nJack Meehan: On the COVID-19 side, would just be great to hear from you what you're hearing from customers and the government around demand as we head into the fall and the winter. Just you're going to be heading into guidance next quarter. Just any early thoughts around how you approach setting guidance for the first time for 2023 as it relates to COVID?\nStephen MacMillan: I think when we get to that point, Jack, we'll probably continue to be conservative on the COVID side. It's been such a roller coaster for the last 27, 28 months or whatever that \u2013 it's almost been hard to predict within a quarter. We've watched a quarter start strong and then it dries up. And conversely, almost like this quarter, last year, it looked like everything was gone in July and August and then Omicron thing hit in \u2013 or Delta hit in September and things started to spike up. So we've had so many ups and downs that I think we'll be cautious as we forecast it.  Having said that, I think a lot of what we've said at the very beginning continues to play out. And for those who thought the business was going to be dead when vaccines came in, 18, 19 months ago, we continue to say that we always thought this was going to leave a residual business that was probably going to be around for quite some time and might be one of our top three or four assays.  And as we sit here today in the world with Japan and a whole bunch of other countries, very high and the US, as you know, is still running fairly rampant, and we said all along, the goal of herd immunity was not going to be achieved in a mutating virus, that this thing would become more endemic and probably create an opportunity for us to have a more ongoing business. I think we would see that and full expectations as we go into next fall and winter. This thing is not burned away from the world. So there will be some business. But I think we'll certainly model it on the lower side as we go in because it's just \u2013 we can count on our base businesses. This one truly is, call it, opportunistic or it's subject \u2013 we can't put a linear forecast on it.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley.\nTejas Savant: Steve, one on the CapEx environment here. I know you mentioned demand for gantries is pretty strong. You don't see an elevated cancellation rate, et cetera. What's your sort of line of sight into the order book here? We've had some sort of messaging from some of your medtech peers. Some of them not seeing any impact, others kind of like pointing to a softened CapEx environment here. So just curious as to get your take.\nStephen MacMillan: Yeah, we're not really seeing or hearing it from our customers. And I think to a large degree, it's probably dependent on what products you're offering. Ours in the grand scheme are not a huge capital outlay for the hospital systems. We're also a both revenue and patient generating \u2013 top line generating procedure for the hospitals. So I think they will certainly find it. So, I think we're not hearing it. But I would say, as always, we're going to plan a little more cautiously and would expect that somewhere over the next couple of years does \u2013 is there a little bit of contraction here or there in all likelihood if we go into a recessionary environment. The flip side is, I think we've got pent-up demand. And I think even if there's a macro slowdown, we actually believe we've got some micro benefits working that will help us power right through that.\nTejas Savant: Just a follow-up on your commentary around the slope of the recovery here on the gantry chips. I know in the past, you've talked about sort of having to figure out sort of construction timelines and installation timelines with your customers. Have you started to work on any of that here as you look to fiscal 2023? And your comments around perhaps the full recovery having to wait until FY 2024 here, are we on the margin a little bit more cautious than what you had shared earlier?\nStephen MacMillan: I wouldn't say it's any more cautious. I think for anybody that's listened to the leaders of the semiconductor industry speak over the last six months plus, they've all been saying, look, recovery is not going to even happen throughout 2023, and it's going to go into 2024. And we're largely operating on kind of a quarter-to-quarter allocation right now. So we're at a cadence that is at least better than where it was, but I do think it's important for us to indicate this doesn't come bouncing back miraculously on the day you flip a calendar to a new fiscal year.\nKarleen Oberton: I'd just add that our field service engineers who want to maintain the gantries and the installed base are the ones that also do the install. So there is the balancing of our own resources to that recovery as well as hospital schedules.\nOperator: We'll now take our next question from Patrick Donnelly with Citi.\nPatrick Donnelly: Steve, maybe one on the 2023 setup. Again, I know you guys aren't going to give guidance. But in terms of the costs, and I know Karleen touched on it a little bit there at the end, what's the right way to think about some of those, whether it's higher input costs, the dollar, obviously, the supply chain on the chips, is the expectation that kind of lingers throughout most of 2023 and it's going to slowly work its way back? Just in terms of thinking about the margin cadence, it seems like most models would have it flipping pretty normal almost day one of 2023. So, I'm just trying to wrap our heads around the right way to think about that cadence and some of that cost pressure lingering into 2023. Again, not surprising that year 2023 obviously starts pretty soon here. But just trying to get a handle on the right way to think about that piece.\nKarleen Oberton: Patrick, it's Karleen. Let me try to give you some insight there. So when you look at our Q4, the Breast Health revenue headwind is probably roughly 400 to 450 basis points of a headwind on operating margins. Now that \u2013 I think as that business recovers over 2023, that will come back over the course of 2023. As far as costs, higher costs are probably about 200 to 250 basis points headwind on Q4. Now that we think might persist a little longer as inflationary pressures continue. So we think we've got good line of sight to how we get improvement from where we end Q4.\nPatrick Donnelly: Just on the molecular growth rates, another question \u2013 obviously, the number jumps off the page a little bit. Can you just talk through, Steve, I guess, what goes into that? Again, obviously, the acquisitions rolling into it, they flipped organic. Obviously, Mobidiag. Maybe just talk through kind of the different components where the real drivers of strength were because, again, I think that will be a focus coming out of it. It's obviously a big number.\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. Clearly, our new product launches and especially BV/CV/TV, as we've talked to the vaginitis panel, is off to a very nice start. But it's kind of across the board. It's also still more customers that we sold more Panthers to during the pandemic that are now able to start to take on our core women's health assays. So, I think what's remarkable is it's fairly dispersed growth, which I think both geographically and across product lines. So, there's no one that completely dominates it. And I think that's what gives us a lot of confidence for the future.\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. I would say, of the acquisitions, Biotheranostics is probably the most significant component of growth in the quarter, as we would expect that one to be\u2026\nStephen MacMillan: Which we called out.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.\nNisarg Shah: This is Nisarg on for Derik. So I want to start off on the margins. Do you guys still think the 32% to 33% range is the right way to think about fiscal year 2023 margins?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. So what I would say is when we have a normalized chip supply, that is exactly the way to think about them in the low 30s. I'd point to our Q2 of 2020, which was 31.5% operating margin. We believe that is a normalized baseline, if you will. But, again, that recovery on the chip is going to occur over the course of 2023. We're still in that planning stages of how and when. So it won't be kind of Q1 out of the gate likely.\nNisarg Shah: One more. Like have you seen any changes on the order book for Breast Health, how much catch-up do you think we could see there as the chip shortage issues gradually go away in.\nKarleen Oberton: I think as we said in our prepared remarks, the sales teams are hitting quota that were set prior to the chip shortage. So we haven't seen any deviation in the booking rate. And again, as Steve mentioned, no increase in the cancellation rate. So we think the business is still solid. We're not losing any share, and then it will just be, again, availability of chips in the scheduling of the installs that we'll be working on to manage through the recovery.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore.\nVijay Kumar: Karleen, I have two on the guidance. One on breast imaging. I think the prior guidance had $250 million of headwind for fiscal 2022. I think that number changed. Looks like 3Q came in better. What is that updated number? And what is the implied breast imaging headwind for Q4? Shouldn't Q4 be improving based on 3Q trends?\nKarleen Oberton: So you're right, we did guide to $250 million. It was $50 million in Q2, $100 million in Q3 and $100 million in Q4. We did slightly better, like you said, about $10 million better here in Q3. I think we're holding to the $100 million in Q4, again, because that favorability, Vijay, was done by kind of blood, sweat and tears of reclaiming and recertifying circuit boards and just don't know if we'll continue to have those yields in this quarter. So we just \u2013 it's best to be conservative and that's the $100 million for Q4.\nVijay Kumar: I did have an OpEx question. If we look at the Q4 guidance at the high end, $870 million of revenues, $0.65 EPS, I think the guide implies OpEx on a dollar basis as sequentially flattish. If we annualize that Q4 number, I think the implied OpEx for next year, somewhere north of $1.2 billion. Is that math correct just based on, I think, your commentary on \u2013 you'd hold the OpEx line on the assumption that the chip shortage will resolve eventually?\nKarleen Oberton: Again, Vijay, for 2023, we're still in the planning process, budgeting process. So, not going to comment. But I would just \u2013 the only insight I would give you is that, with our partnership with the WTA, is that the expense of that is loaded into calendar 2022. So most of that then expenses \u2013 disproportionate amount of expenses in our fiscal 2022, which will be a tailwind as we get into 2023 and 2024.\nOperator: We'll move on to our next question from Mike Matson with Needham.\nJoseph Conway: This is Joseph on for Mike. So, I guess there in the pandemic, STI rates seem to have spiked and, currently, they still seem to be at or near record highs. Maybe just to start off, can you talk about maybe some of the barriers that are currently in place in the industry that if removed could increase screening rates?  And then maybe similar question. As we saw with COVID testing moving to the at-home testing, do you see this as a potential market for STI testing? And then, if that were to introduce, I guess, what will the Hologic's solution there for staying competitive and if that includes looking at at-home testing options?\nStephen MacMillan: On the first part of that, in terms of barriers to STIs, we did see a lot of, call it, intercity clinics and everything that either shut down or got their resources redeployed during COVID time from serving STIs and just serving their community folks really focusing on COVID. So as some of those come back, I think we feel good about hopefully the ability to get back to more screening. And as you say, there's probably been an increase, certainly, we've seen in many pockets of STIs during this time. So, hopefully, the ability to pick those up.  On the idea of home testing, there's a lot more complications to women testing themselves at home in terms of administering the test and in terms of shipping it in a proper container and everything else. So, candidly, we were approached by lots of companies in COVID time who all were convinced that they were going to be the next great savior of home testing for COVID as well as home testing for STIs that don't \u2013 we're not as sure that market is going to move nearly as quickly to home testing when you actually think about the pragmatic realities of it. And so, I think we continue to feel very good.  We continue to broaden out our own portfolios, our partnerships to be able to try to capture them. But I would not expect that market to move nearly as quickly as some companies might be hoping.  By the way, I'd also say, if it were, it's where our cash balance puts us in a really good position.\nJoseph Conway: I did happen to see \u2013 I don't know if you guys already got a chance to look at it, but it seems that NCCN posted new guidelines for breast cancer screening and diagnosis. Just like a quick look at it. It didn't seem like anything really changed, more or less just solidifying diagnosis pathways based on your risk. But can you maybe talk about anything that was seen in that update?  And then maybe just a similar question on that. What's maybe been the reception of some of the mobile mammogram screening that Hologic has put out? How has that been received during the pandemic and recently?\nStephen MacMillan: I think as it relates to guidelines, we continue to push for the proper guidelines. I think sometimes USPSTF and some other folks have gone too far. But in general, most of the folks, I think, are adhering to pretty sensible guidelines. And candidly, I think there's still a lot of pent-up demand. There's still a lot of women that put off their screenings during COVID time and are running behind. So I think we'll still catch up.  In terms of the mobile, we made those available here and there. It's de minimis in terms of any real impact on the business.\nKarleen Oberton: Right. We've been doing mobile mammograms well before the pandemic really to reach underserved communities, is really the intent there.\nOperator: We'll now take our next question from Puneet Souda with SVB Securities.\nPuneet Souda: First one, maybe for Karleen. How much of an offset are you getting today from repurposing of these prior boards and chips? And how much of that do you expect will happen in FY 2023 versus new chips?\nKarleen Oberton: It's pretty de minimis. And if I look at Q3, we did better than the original forecasted $100 million of headwind by roughly $10 million. So it's in the millions of dollars. And again, I wouldn't think that it's going to be the most significant solution to the challenges of supply. It's going to be getting higher allocations.\nPuneet Souda: Steve, on the first fiscal quarter call, you said corrections do create opportunities for Hologic at the right time, but valuations hadn't settled back at that time in your view. So, obviously, macro backdrop hasn't improved, but valuations have come down here meaningfully. So wondering if you have updated thoughts and views on how you're viewing the market and valuations now given your sort of vantage point and the growing cash position and still strong cash flow.\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. We like seeing some of the valuations start to truly settle in. The fascinating part always becomes \u2013 people are always still looking at the past 52 months \u2013 past 52-week high and wanting premiums off of that, even though it's long since history. So the more time that goes by, we believe, puts us in a better position and really puts the potential sellers in a more realistic position. We feel great right now being patient and feel like \u2013 we don't see something that's going to snap a lot of these, especially earlier stage or smaller companies back. And we're looking both early stage, and we're also looking at things that bring some legitimate EBITDA in this time, but really like our position. And we're in no urgent need, given the strength of our base business, to act, which I think also just puts us in a much better place while these companies come to grips with their true realities.\nOperator: We'll now take our next question from Casey Woodring with J.P. Morgan.\nCasey Woodring: I guess the first one, so on the Diagnostics growth rate here, wondering how much of that was pent-up demand from the last quarter or two. So last quarter, you guys made the comment that women's wellness business have softened given COVID impact. So curious to hear if there's a catch-up in visits this quarter and if there's some more pent-up demand to your left in 4Q and maybe even the beginning of fiscal 2023?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. It's probably a little bit. It's so hard for us to say that these things just keep ebbing and flowing by geography. Both within the US, you see regions that move to different paces in COVID time, and certainly on a global basis, different countries. So it feels like a little bit of pent-up, but I wouldn't say that created a big bolus. I think it just more allowed a lot of the visits to come through that weren't happening before. So, I think it's a pop, but it's not like it was necessarily restrained. And again, hard to exactly know. We don't have that information from our customers or anything else. But I think it's where we just keep saying, let's keep watching these trends over time.\nCasey Woodring: Just on the international diagnostics piece, you called out 16.5% ex COVID growth was driven by virology. You did mention women's health there. So I guess can you just sort of remind us how much of that diagnostics business you have is outside the US and if there's material greenfield opportunity on the molecular side with women's health, especially given all the Panthers you've placed?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. Our molecular business outside the US has been underdeveloped. And I think that's been one of the magical pieces of the \u2013 being able to place so many Panthers during the pandemic that we're very excited about the opportunity, really in the core women's health business, which has also been underdeveloped. So it's a combination of both the virals and the core women's health as we start to transition from some of those Panthers internationally that we used for COVID into our core business. And I think that's something we expect to be generating certainly double-digit growth internationally for quite some time in that molecular business.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Max Masucci with Cowen and Company.\nMax Masucci: First one, I think you're nearly done integrating Biotheranostics lab operations into the San Diego headquarters, if not finished. The growth is tracking nicely there. So, once Biotheranostics has fully settled into the San Diego headquarters, how motivated will you be to pursue additional M&A deals for, say, a breast-focused specialty lab that you would be able to serve with Biotheranostics, the new lab operations and the commercial team that's in place?\nStephen MacMillan: We're continuing to look at all options. I think what we do feel good about, and as you say, Matt, we did a whole bunch of acquisitions in a relatively compressed period of time. and then really had to digest those. And I think between Biotheranostics, which is not fully integrated, we're probably slightly behind exactly your rosy synopsis here. We're integrating it into the San Diego facility and moving the CLIA lab in and all of that, but we still have a little bit of work to be done.  The same with Diagenode and Mobidiag getting integrated nicely. Boulder, Acessa, those have all been being integrated to where I would say we're getting to the point where we can certainly handle more integrations, but we're casting the net fairly broadly within our existing state of business, the existing three businesses.\nMax Masucci: Just sort of following up there, if you look at all of the companies and the products that you have integrated over the past 18 to 24 months, which of the recently acquired products or services, whether it's Acessa or some of the expanded interventional breast offerings, which of them have benefited the most under Hologic's ownership or when they started being marketed alongside some of your cornerstone and marquee products.\nStephen MacMillan: I think they're all benefiting very nicely. If you think about what we've been able to do from a covered live standpoint within Acessa, early stages even for Boulder, our surgical sales force is dying to get their hands on it. It's been more a supply issue that we've been holding them back a little bit while we ramp up. Biotheranostics, that team, when you talk to the commercial leader of that team, very excited by what the Hologic team and breadth and marketing capabilities and everything have brought to that business as well. The Diagenode, Mobidiag teams, I think, also in Europe, very excited, particularly having to just have gone through the whole IVDR process, which was a hugely labor-intensive business now to get that behind us and really focus to the future. So I think they're all looking at us and saying, you know what, nice part is they're proud to be a part of us. I was talking to a CEO of another company recently who actually been involved in ones we bought, and he was still close to one of the members of the team at the company we bought, and he said, 'you know what, that team loves being a part of Hologic.' And that's exactly what we always want to strive for. So I feel pretty good that each of them are really fitting that bill.\nOperator: We will now take the next question from Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG.\nRyan Zimmerman: And I wanted to just ask one, Karleen. It's already been asked a lot about op margins for next year. And I appreciate the color there. I think you had said maybe 400, 450 basis point headwind on op margins and that will come back over 2023 in a normalized environment. But if I look at the fourth quarter number next quarter, op margins are kind of sitting at 26%. And so, you add back kind of that 400 basis point dynamic. And it puts it closer \u2013 and maybe I'm splitting hairs here, but closer to 30%. And I just want to know if I'm thinking about it the right way versus \u2013 and, again, in a normalized environment, 32-ish percent, 31.5%. Are we still maybe 100, 150 basis points off of kind of that normalized margin as we enter 2023? And then I have a follow-up.\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. So I think beyond, as I talked about the 400 to 450 basis points is this, the higher cost of roughly 200 basis points to 250 basis points, which from a planning perspective, we don't have line of sight to that resolving, but eventually, that will resolve. And I think the other piece was some higher marketing expenses, which is probably about another 200 basis points headwind to op margin that will also abate over 2023. So we have clear line of sight back to those normalized margin levels.\nRyan Zimmerman: I think Mobidiag laps next quarter in terms of the time of acquisition becomes organic. The disclosure today for both Mobidiag and Boulder was about $8 million. If I go back to the revenue contribution from Mobidiag, I think it was something in the 40s. I just want to understand kind of how that's tracking relative to maybe its previous disclosures. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\nKarleen Oberton: It's tracking a little bit below that, and there's two reasons. One, that 4 handle would have had COVID revenue in there that has come down. That COVID revenue was on their legacy Amplidiag platform, not the Novodiag platform. And as well as there's been some supply chain challenges. We've worked through those. And we're ramping up inventory to kind of go hard commercially at the beginning of 2023. So, a couple of choppiness here in the year, but feel still really good about what that's going to do.\nOperator: We'll take the next question from Andrew Cooper with Raymond James.\nAndrew Cooper: A lot has already been asked. So maybe I'll just give one quick one and let everybody go on. So, on Mobidiag, maybe just an update on Novodiag potentially coming to the US and sort of what's the latest and greatest thinking on the pathway there and what we should be looking for for that product?\nKarleen Oberton: I think to Steve's earlier comments about the benefits of these acquisitions in Hologic's hand, I think our R&D teams have spent a lot of time in Finland and Mobidiag's teams have come to San Diego to really work through what that clinical road map is for approval in the US. And I think we're in a much better position of understanding of what is required for approval in the US, in that understanding based on our expertise has pushed out the time line a little. So looking now more like early 2025. But we still feel really good about that acquisition. We feel good about what's going to happen with the EU approvals that we already have here in 2023.\nOperator: Thank you. And this now concludes Hologic's third quarter fiscal 2022 earnings conference call. Have a good evening.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Karleen Oberton",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve. And good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to share third quarter results that once again significantly exceeded our guidance for both revenue and non-GAAP EPS.  Our third quarter financial performance highlights the strength of our core Diagnostics and Surgical businesses, both of which surpassed our long-term revenue target of 5% to 7% growth in the period.  And in our Breast Health business, although we continue to see headwinds related to semiconductor chip availability, as Steve mentioned, we remain optimistic that the supply environment will start to improve in our fiscal 2023.  In terms of COVID-19 testing, we continue to showcase our agility in responding to highly variable global demand. And while we continue to meet our customers' COVID testing needs, we also have delivered on robust demand for our non-COVID molecular diagnostics menu.  Finally, cash flow generation in the third quarter was very strong, again coming in above pre-pandemic levels. As a result, our balance sheet remains an exceptional pillar of strength.  Moving on, we will now provide more color on our financial results. In the third quarter, both top line performance and bottom line profitability were well ahead of our previous estimates.  Total revenue came in just over $1 billion, more than $100 million higher than the mid-point of our guidance, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.95, $0.25 higher than the mid-point of our prior guide.  Turning to our business results. In Diagnostics, global revenue of $560.1 million declined 13.6% compared to the prior year. However, excluding COVID assay revenue, related ancillaries, and a small amount of revenue from discontinued products, worldwide organic Diagnostics revenue increased 15%, a great result against a solid comp in the prior year.  As a reminder, our organic results for fiscal Q3 2022 include Biotheranostics and Diagenode revenue, as these transactions have now annualized.  Within Diagnostics, our molecular business was exceptionally strong in our fiscal third quarter. Excluding the impact of COVID-19, molecular revenue grew over 22% organically in the period. Underlying this excellent result was strong utilization across our base molecular menu.  As Steve highlighted, growth from our vaginitis panel led the way, while our virology portfolio also delivered strong performance. In addition, we saw stability in our core STI menu in the period, affirming our leadership position in women's health diagnostics.  While these Diagnostics results include a small amount of residual demand from the adverse impact of COVID felt in the second quarter, our molecular franchise continues to be a key catalyst of our future growth. We are very encouraged to see customers transition additional menu onto our Panther systems as COVID testing demand declines.  As it relates to our COVID results, we generated $173 million of COVID assay revenue in the quarter, exceeding our guidance of $100 million. We shipped about 8.1 million tests to customers, reflecting a global ASP of approximately $21. Although ASP held steady this quarter, we still believe that pricing will eventually fall as reimbursement declines.  In terms of COVID assay revenue split by geography, domestic demand was strong, while international demand declined throughout the quarter. The US COVID assay revenue represented approximately 60% of total COVID testing revenue in the period, a flip in geographic COVID demand versus the prior year, underscoring the variability of COVID revenue.  Rounding out Diagnostics, our cytology and perinatal businesses increased 3.5% compared to the prior year. This result is reflective of patients returning to their well- women's exams after postponing these important visits during periods of high COVID prevalence.  In Breast Health, global revenue of $282.8 million was down approximately 18%, as expected, primarily driven by the chip supply shortages we have discussed over the past six months.  Related to gantries, we performed slightly better than anticipated. While our acquisition of chips in the quarter met our expectations, we again delivered slight favorability through reclaiming, refurbishing and recertifying printed circuit boards from servicing our gantry installed base.  Moving to Interventional Breast, the segment grew over 4% in our fiscal third quarter. This performance was driven by growth in Brevera's disposable needles. Customers continue to see the benefit of Brevera's differentiated and efficient biopsy workflow, especially as their labor resources have become increasingly constrained.  In Surgical, third quarter revenue of $138.1 million grew almost 10%. We are very pleased with the strong rebound in the business during the period, as positive procedural trends exiting our fiscal second quarter continued through June. Powering this quarter's performance for Surgical was a nice lift from MyoSure and the related Fluent Fluid Management System, plus Bolder.  Lastly, in our Skeletal business, as expected, revenue of $21.7 million decreased approximately 14% compared to the prior-year period.  Now let's move on to the rest of the non-GAAP P&L for the third quarter. Gross margin of 63.3% was ahead of our forecast, driven by the higher-than-expected COVID-19 testing volume and strong results in our base businesses in the period.  Total operating expenses of $311.2 million in the third quarter increased less than 1% compared to the prior year. The increase in operating expense was driven by spend within marketing and R&D, partially offset by less G&A and sales expense.  However, when we normalize for spending from Mobidiag and Bolder, operating expenses decreased 3% compared to the prior year.  Finally, our tax rate in Q3 was 21%, as expected.  Putting these pieces together, operating margin for Q3 came in at 32.3%, and net margin was 24.1%, both above pre-pandemic levels.  Non-GAAP net income finished at $241.5 million and non-GAAP EPS was $0.95.  Moving on from the P&L, cash flow from operations was $330.6 million in the third quarter. These robust cash flows continue to provide tremendous financial and strategic flexibility.  Based on this strong operational performance, we had $2.4 billion of cash on our balance sheet and our leverage ratio was 0.2 times. As we have previously stated, we are comfortable building our cash balance during this challenging macro backdrop. That said, we continue to diligently pursue M&A opportunities in each one of our businesses.  Finally, while there were no share repurchases during the quarter, our share repurchase program remains an ongoing part of our capital deployment framework. So far this fiscal year, we have repurchased approximately 5.2 million shares for $367 million, a sizeable outlay of funds.  Now let's move on to our updated non-GAAP financial guidance for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2022. As a reminder, our organic guidance excludes acquisition revenue until each deal annualizes. Therefore, our fourth quarter guidance only excludes Bolder revenue from our organic base.  Given our strong third quarter performance, we are once again increasing our full-year revenue and EPS guidance. For the full year, we now see total revenue in the range of $4.75 to $4.78 billion and EPS of $5.79 to $5.84, representing an increase of $115 million on the top line and $0.26 on the bottom-line compared to the midpoint of our previous guidance.  With only one quarter remaining in our fiscal year, this annual guidance implies revenue of $840 million to $870 million and EPS of $0.60 to $0.65 for our fiscal fourth quarter.  With respect to foreign exchange, given the unabated strength of the US dollar, we are assuming an FX headwind of slightly more than $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, nearly $10 million higher than our prior guidance incorporated for the quarter.  In terms of COVID sales, we expect COVID assay sales to be at least $70 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and $1.35 billion for the full year. COVID-related items, inclusive of a small amount of discontinued product revenue, are expected to be slightly less than $35 million in the fourth quarter and $215 million for the full year.  As it relates to the Breast Health chip shortage, although we had marginal improvement versus expectations in Q3, guidance on the gantry revenue shortfall for the fourth quarter remains unchanged from our prior messaging.  Moving down the P&L, for the full year we forecast our non-GAAP gross margin percentage in the high 60s and our non-GAAP operating margin percentage in the high 30s to approximately 40%. Both estimates are well above pre-pandemic levels.  Further, our Q4 guidance incorporates the margin impact from our Breast Health supply chain revenue shortfall. As a reminder, gantry gross margins are accretive to consolidated averages, and we have maintained operating spend to be in position to move quickly once we receive chips. In addition, we have again incorporated elevated costs into our Q4 guidance as it relates to electronics, plastics and logistics.  In terms of operating expenses, we expect spending to be down a few million dollars sequentially. Below operating income, we expect other expenses, net, to be around $20 million in our fiscal fourth quarter.  Our guidance is based on an effective tax rate of 21% and diluted shares outstanding of around 250 million for the full year.  Finally, although we will update everyone on our fiscal 2023 guidance during our Q4 call next quarter, I would remind you that the headwinds related to higher input costs, the stronger US dollar, and increasing interest rates are unlikely to subside in the near-term. Like many other companies, we expect these headwinds to continue into the fourth quarter and into our fiscal 2023.  To help offset these pressures, as we do every quarter, we seek out efficiencies in our business and strategically manage pricing where we have the opportunity. Although these temporary challenges are not unique to Hologic, they are important to consider for modeling purposes.  To conclude, let me wrap up by saying that Hologic posted very strong third quarter results, underpinned by exceptional growth in molecular diagnostics and a healthy rebound in our Surgical business. We are also once again raising our financial guidance for the year.  And although the future macro-outlook remains cloudy, with a natural hedge to future COVID uncertainties, as well as an increasingly strong balance sheet and best-in-class cash flow, we are well positioned to continue to deliver strong results for our shareholders.  With that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions. So I think from a \u2013 certainly in the US, the majority of our Panthers are running more than COVID, for sure. I think we are really pleased with the vaginitis growth, but I don't think we're going to give the absolute number at this time. I'd just add that our field service engineers who want to maintain the gantries and the installed base are the ones that also do the install. So there is the balancing of our own resources to that recovery as well as hospital schedules. Patrick, it's Karleen. Let me try to give you some insight there. So when you look at our Q4, the Breast Health revenue headwind is probably roughly 400 to 450 basis points of a headwind on operating margins. Now that \u2013 I think as that business recovers over 2023, that will come back over the course of 2023. As far as costs, higher costs are probably about 200 to 250 basis points headwind on Q4. Now that we think might persist a little longer as inflationary pressures continue. So we think we've got good line of sight to how we get improvement from where we end Q4. Yes. I would say, of the acquisitions, Biotheranostics is probably the most significant component of growth in the quarter, as we would expect that one to be... Yes. So what I would say is when we have a normalized chip supply, that is exactly the way to think about them in the low 30s. I'd point to our Q2 of 2020, which was 31.5% operating margin. We believe that is a normalized baseline, if you will. But, again, that recovery on the chip is going to occur over the course of 2023. We're still in that planning stages of how and when. So it won't be kind of Q1 out of the gate likely. I think as we said in our prepared remarks, the sales teams are hitting quota that were set prior to the chip shortage. So we haven't seen any deviation in the booking rate. And again, as Steve mentioned, no increase in the cancellation rate. So we think the business is still solid. We're not losing any share, and then it will just be, again, availability of chips in the scheduling of the installs that we'll be working on to manage through the recovery. So you're right, we did guide to $250 million. It was $50 million in Q2, $100 million in Q3 and $100 million in Q4. We did slightly better, like you said, about $10 million better here in Q3. I think we're holding to the $100 million in Q4, again, because that favorability, Vijay, was done by kind of blood, sweat and tears of reclaiming and recertifying circuit boards and just don't know if we'll continue to have those yields in this quarter. So we just \u2013 it's best to be conservative and that's the $100 million for Q4. Again, Vijay, for 2023, we're still in the planning process, budgeting process. So, not going to comment. But I would just \u2013 the only insight I would give you is that, with our partnership with the WTA, is that the expense of that is loaded into calendar 2022. So most of that then expenses \u2013 disproportionate amount of expenses in our fiscal 2022, which will be a tailwind as we get into 2023 and 2024. Right. We've been doing mobile mammograms well before the pandemic really to reach underserved communities, is really the intent there. It's pretty de minimis. And if I look at Q3, we did better than the original forecasted $100 million of headwind by roughly $10 million. So it's in the millions of dollars. And again, I wouldn't think that it's going to be the most significant solution to the challenges of supply. It's going to be getting higher allocations. Yes. So I think beyond, as I talked about the 400 to 450 basis points is this, the higher cost of roughly 200 basis points to 250 basis points, which from a planning perspective, we don't have line of sight to that resolving, but eventually, that will resolve. And I think the other piece was some higher marketing expenses, which is probably about another 200 basis points headwind to op margin that will also abate over 2023. So we have clear line of sight back to those normalized margin levels. It's tracking a little bit below that, and there's two reasons. One, that 4 handle would have had COVID revenue in there that has come down. That COVID revenue was on their legacy Amplidiag platform, not the Novodiag platform. And as well as there's been some supply chain challenges. We've worked through those. And we're ramping up inventory to kind of go hard commercially at the beginning of 2023. So, a couple of choppiness here in the year, but feel still really good about what that's going to do. I think to Steve's earlier comments about the benefits of these acquisitions in Hologic's hand, I think our R&D teams have spent a lot of time in Finland and Mobidiag's teams have come to San Diego to really work through what that clinical road map is for approval in the US. And I think we're in a much better position of understanding of what is required for approval in the US, in that understanding based on our expertise has pushed out the time line a little. So looking now more like early 2025. But we still feel really good about that acquisition. We feel good about what's going to happen with the EU approvals that we already have here in 2023."

            "name": "Stephen MacMillan",
            "content": "Thank you, Ryan. And good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to discuss our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Our results continue to showcase the strength, durability and diversity of our business.  Total revenue was just over $1 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.95. Both numbers exceeded the midpoint of our guidance on the top and bottom lines \u2013 the result of both enduring COVID revenue and also strong performances in our core Diagnostics and Surgical businesses.  In this dynamic and ever-changing world, we continue to live our purpose, passion and promise \u2013 to enable healthier lives everywhere, every day \u2013 and be global champions for women's health. In doing so, our industry-leading products continue to reach even more patients around the world, while our business delivers strong financial performance and value for our shareholders.  To put it simply, the durability and diversity of our business enables Hologic to succeed in this challenging macro environment. As we navigate a multitude of headwinds, our confidence in our business remains steady and remains high.  Looking longer term, our message is also unchanged. We are confident, despite the current turbulence, that our previously announced 5% to 7% annual organic revenue growth rate through 2025 remains an achievable target, provided the current chip headwind normalizes as we expect.  Ahead of turning the call over to Karleen to discuss our financial results in more detail, we'd like to highlight growth drivers and provide updates on each of our businesses \u2013 Diagnostics, Breast Health, and Surgical. And to close, we are excited to share our experience from the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in May, an experience that reaffirms the importance of our place and our voice on the world stage advocating for women's health, especially now.  Before jumping into each division, it is important to revisit the impact of COVID on our business. The reality is that whether the demand for COVID testing is high or low, we are poised to succeed either way. We have a natural COVID hedge. As we have seen over the past two years, COVID prevalence affects each of our base businesses. As COVID cases rise, elective well-woman exams, screenings, and surgical procedures are often postponed. Conversely, as COVID declines, our base business strengthens.  As we responded with unprecedented speed to answer the world's needs for highly reliable molecular COVID testing, we also dramatically strengthened our company for the future.  We also know that many of you are trying to gauge the longer-term impact and durability of our additional Panther placements, as well as the impact of our various acquisitions over the last couple of years in Diagnostics and Surgical.  The truth is, the various surges in COVID cases around the world through many of the last quarters have often created wide variability in the comps, as some quarters reflect times of significant non-COVID related hospital and doctor visit slowdowns, while others bounced back stronger in varying geographies in any given quarter.  When we last reported in April, for example, our core Diagnostic and Surgical businesses posted year-over-year growth rates of 4% and 3.5%, respectively, amidst the COVID surge at the time.  So, for anyone questioning these admittedly lower growth rates, we want to highlight two numbers from this quarter. The first number \u2013 22.4% \u2013 that was the growth in our global molecular diagnostic business, and the second number \u2013 9.7% \u2013 that was the growth in our Surgical business this quarter.  Now we'd encourage two simple takeaways from these results. One, these businesses have strong underlying growth; and two, the true growth rate is somewhere in between last quarter's results and this quarter's, underscoring the need to view how our strength evolves over time, and given the variability of COVID, that no single quarter result is going to match a linear model.  Now shifting gears to the businesses. First in Diagnostics, with COVID testing significantly down sequentially, our third quarter provided an opportunity for customers to validate and run more non-COVID assays on their Panther systems. As a result, our Diagnostic business grew 15% excluding COVID year-over-year worldwide, a truly phenomenal result and one that demonstrates the impact of women returning to their wellness exams and procedures.  Even more impressive, as mentioned earlier, our global molecular diagnostics business grew over 22% excluding COVID in the period. An early, yet clear sign that our expanded Panther installed base, is, A, being utilized, and, B, will prevail as an instrument of choice as customers consolidate their molecular testing menu to high- throughput, high-automation platforms.  For more color on the growth drivers within molecular diagnostics, performance was driven by a combination of both legacy and new assays, namely the BV/CV/TV vaginitis panel, M.gen, CT/NG and our respiratory menu on the Panther Fusion, to name a few. Our vaginitis panel continues to outperform and deliver impressive growth on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. As we have previously stated, the vaginitis panel is well positioned to become a top 3 assay in our molecular diagnostic portfolio over time.  International diagnostics was also a bright spot in the quarter. The business grew 16.5% excluding COVID, driven primarily by our virology portfolio.  As expected, Panther placements slowed to 59 new systems placed in the quarter, with nearly 70% of these placed internationally. While a decline from the 119 and 123 systems placed in our first two quarters, annualizing Q3's placements lands within our historic run rate of about 225 to 250 placements per year. As a reminder, Panther sales have minimal impact to the molecular diagnostic growth rate, as assays are the primary driver of growth, by far.  Further, placements at lower levels going forward is consistent with our expectations, given we have increased our Panther footprint by nearly 85% since the start of the pandemic. We now have roughly 3,200 Panthers installed worldwide.  To close out the Diagnostics update, our Biotheranostics business was again a highlight for the quarter, posting $18.9 million in sales, representing outstanding growth of 43%.  Moving on to Breast Health. First and foremost, as to chip supply, we reiterate our statement from last quarter \u2013 we believe the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal 2022 will prove to be the low water mark in terms of chip availability for our gantries. Working closely with our suppliers, we observed positive trends in Q3. These positive trends include stabilizing lead times, procurement through a combination of channels, and most importantly, narrowing the breadth and depth of tight supply. Although we remain optimistic these positive trends will maintain throughout the remainder of our fiscal year, the situation remains fluid.  As for gantries, demand remains strong. Our best-in-class technology, service, and customer satisfaction continues to differentiate and separate us from the competition. In addition, our sales force continues to place orders in line with quotas set prior to the chip headwind surfacing and there has been no meaningful change to the rate of cancelled orders.  On the chip supply chain recovery, while we are not providing fiscal 2023 guidance on this call, we do anticipate that chip supply, and thus gantry availability, will be recovering throughout fiscal 2023 and continue into 2024.  Next, in Surgical, the business returned to strong performance, posting 9.7% revenue growth in the third quarter. This growth was driven primarily by the combination of MyoSure, our Fluent Fluid Management System, and Bolder.  As a reminder, our MyoSure devices are used for fibroid and tissue removal and the Fluent system is complementary to MyoSure, assisting physicians with hysteroscopic procedures. The Fluent system simplifies and streamlines the historically complicated and cumbersome fluid management workflow used in these procedures.  While MyoSure and Fluent sales represent the lion's share of Surgical growth in the quarter, we are also very excited by the growth from our laparoscopic portfolio. Both the Acessa procedure and Bolder devices that we acquired to add growth and diversify the franchise performed well. Specifically, we are excited by the incremental progress in sales of the Acessa procedure. Smaller numbers but revenue growth of nearly 50% year-over-year, a meaningful step in increasing the utilization of this novel procedure.  Acessa's growth was driven primarily by two factors. First, excellent efforts from our team to increase patient covered lives to 84% compared to 26% when we first acquired the business about two years ago. With this critical mass of covered lives, which is often considered table stakes by many physicians, more doors were opened.  Second, growth was also driven by more physician access to conduct monitored cases. Access was both in-person and also via our innovative virtual case monitoring platform. This virtual system was implemented specifically to address physician access challenges created by COVID.  As the COVID pandemic moves gradually to an endemic state and physician access improves, we are confident that Acessa will be a meaningful growth contributor going forward.  And finally, as many of you know, in May we had the opportunity to participate at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting held in Davos, Switzerland. At the Forum, we met with world leaders and change makers to further our mission and champion women's health.  Our message was clear, putting women's health at the forefront was long overdue. The time to elevate women's health, with the help of science-backed data to guide decisions and policy making, is now.  As we have said before, women's health is the cornerstone of families, communities, societies and economies around the world. With insights from our Hologic Global Women's Health Index, Project Health Equality and decades of leadership in women's health, we came to the Forum to make a difference. We left the Forum knowing we had. We understand change does not move in a straight line, and we are committed to supporting women every step of the way.  Before we turn the call over to Karleen, to conclude, we want to repeat that our third quarter results give us even more confidence in the strength of our business. This confidence is rooted in our demonstrated ability to absorb and adapt to the pressures and headwinds of this dynamic macroenvironment. As the current pressures and headwinds subside over time, we are in strong position to continue our durable growth trajectory for quarters and years to come.  With that, let me turn the call over to Karleen. I think when we get to that point, Jack, we'll probably continue to be conservative on the COVID side. It's been such a roller coaster for the last 27, 28 months or whatever that \u2013 it's almost been hard to predict within a quarter. We've watched a quarter start strong and then it dries up. And conversely, almost like this quarter, last year, it looked like everything was gone in July and August and then Omicron thing hit in \u2013 or Delta hit in September and things started to spike up. So we've had so many ups and downs that I think we'll be cautious as we forecast it.  Having said that, I think a lot of what we've said at the very beginning continues to play out. And for those who thought the business was going to be dead when vaccines came in, 18, 19 months ago, we continue to say that we always thought this was going to leave a residual business that was probably going to be around for quite some time and might be one of our top three or four assays.  And as we sit here today in the world with Japan and a whole bunch of other countries, very high and the US, as you know, is still running fairly rampant, and we said all along, the goal of herd immunity was not going to be achieved in a mutating virus, that this thing would become more endemic and probably create an opportunity for us to have a more ongoing business. I think we would see that and full expectations as we go into next fall and winter. This thing is not burned away from the world. So there will be some business. But I think we'll certainly model it on the lower side as we go in because it's just \u2013 we can count on our base businesses. This one truly is, call it, opportunistic or it's subject \u2013 we can't put a linear forecast on it. Yeah, we're not really seeing or hearing it from our customers. And I think to a large degree, it's probably dependent on what products you're offering. Ours in the grand scheme are not a huge capital outlay for the hospital systems. We're also a both revenue and patient generating \u2013 top line generating procedure for the hospitals. So I think they will certainly find it. So, I think we're not hearing it. But I would say, as always, we're going to plan a little more cautiously and would expect that somewhere over the next couple of years does \u2013 is there a little bit of contraction here or there in all likelihood if we go into a recessionary environment. The flip side is, I think we've got pent-up demand. And I think even if there's a macro slowdown, we actually believe we've got some micro benefits working that will help us power right through that. I wouldn't say it's any more cautious. I think for anybody that's listened to the leaders of the semiconductor industry speak over the last six months plus, they've all been saying, look, recovery is not going to even happen throughout 2023, and it's going to go into 2024. And we're largely operating on kind of a quarter-to-quarter allocation right now. So we're at a cadence that is at least better than where it was, but I do think it's important for us to indicate this doesn't come bouncing back miraculously on the day you flip a calendar to a new fiscal year. Yes. Clearly, our new product launches and especially BV/CV/TV, as we've talked to the vaginitis panel, is off to a very nice start. But it's kind of across the board. It's also still more customers that we sold more Panthers to during the pandemic that are now able to start to take on our core women's health assays. So, I think what's remarkable is it's fairly dispersed growth, which I think both geographically and across product lines. So, there's no one that completely dominates it. And I think that's what gives us a lot of confidence for the future. Which we called out. On the first part of that, in terms of barriers to STIs, we did see a lot of, call it, intercity clinics and everything that either shut down or got their resources redeployed during COVID time from serving STIs and just serving their community folks really focusing on COVID. So as some of those come back, I think we feel good about hopefully the ability to get back to more screening. And as you say, there's probably been an increase, certainly, we've seen in many pockets of STIs during this time. So, hopefully, the ability to pick those up.  On the idea of home testing, there's a lot more complications to women testing themselves at home in terms of administering the test and in terms of shipping it in a proper container and everything else. So, candidly, we were approached by lots of companies in COVID time who all were convinced that they were going to be the next great savior of home testing for COVID as well as home testing for STIs that don't \u2013 we're not as sure that market is going to move nearly as quickly to home testing when you actually think about the pragmatic realities of it. And so, I think we continue to feel very good.  We continue to broaden out our own portfolios, our partnerships to be able to try to capture them. But I would not expect that market to move nearly as quickly as some companies might be hoping.  By the way, I'd also say, if it were, it's where our cash balance puts us in a really good position. I think as it relates to guidelines, we continue to push for the proper guidelines. I think sometimes USPSTF and some other folks have gone too far. But in general, most of the folks, I think, are adhering to pretty sensible guidelines. And candidly, I think there's still a lot of pent-up demand. There's still a lot of women that put off their screenings during COVID time and are running behind. So I think we'll still catch up.  In terms of the mobile, we made those available here and there. It's de minimis in terms of any real impact on the business. Yes. We like seeing some of the valuations start to truly settle in. The fascinating part always becomes \u2013 people are always still looking at the past 52 months \u2013 past 52-week high and wanting premiums off of that, even though it's long since history. So the more time that goes by, we believe, puts us in a better position and really puts the potential sellers in a more realistic position. We feel great right now being patient and feel like \u2013 we don't see something that's going to snap a lot of these, especially earlier stage or smaller companies back. And we're looking both early stage, and we're also looking at things that bring some legitimate EBITDA in this time, but really like our position. And we're in no urgent need, given the strength of our base business, to act, which I think also just puts us in a much better place while these companies come to grips with their true realities. Yes. It's probably a little bit. It's so hard for us to say that these things just keep ebbing and flowing by geography. Both within the US, you see regions that move to different paces in COVID time, and certainly on a global basis, different countries. So it feels like a little bit of pent-up, but I wouldn't say that created a big bolus. I think it just more allowed a lot of the visits to come through that weren't happening before. So, I think it's a pop, but it's not like it was necessarily restrained. And again, hard to exactly know. We don't have that information from our customers or anything else. But I think it's where we just keep saying, let's keep watching these trends over time. Yes. Our molecular business outside the US has been underdeveloped. And I think that's been one of the magical pieces of the \u2013 being able to place so many Panthers during the pandemic that we're very excited about the opportunity, really in the core women's health business, which has also been underdeveloped. So it's a combination of both the virals and the core women's health as we start to transition from some of those Panthers internationally that we used for COVID into our core business. And I think that's something we expect to be generating certainly double-digit growth internationally for quite some time in that molecular business. We're continuing to look at all options. I think what we do feel good about, and as you say, Matt, we did a whole bunch of acquisitions in a relatively compressed period of time. and then really had to digest those. And I think between Biotheranostics, which is not fully integrated, we're probably slightly behind exactly your rosy synopsis here. We're integrating it into the San Diego facility and moving the CLIA lab in and all of that, but we still have a little bit of work to be done.  The same with Diagenode and Mobidiag getting integrated nicely. Boulder, Acessa, those have all been being integrated to where I would say we're getting to the point where we can certainly handle more integrations, but we're casting the net fairly broadly within our existing state of business, the existing three businesses. I think they're all benefiting very nicely. If you think about what we've been able to do from a covered live standpoint within Acessa, early stages even for Boulder, our surgical sales force is dying to get their hands on it. It's been more a supply issue that we've been holding them back a little bit while we ramp up. Biotheranostics, that team, when you talk to the commercial leader of that team, very excited by what the Hologic team and breadth and marketing capabilities and everything have brought to that business as well. The Diagenode, Mobidiag teams, I think, also in Europe, very excited, particularly having to just have gone through the whole IVDR process, which was a hugely labor-intensive business now to get that behind us and really focus to the future. So I think they're all looking at us and saying, you know what, nice part is they're proud to be a part of us. I was talking to a CEO of another company recently who actually been involved in ones we bought, and he was still close to one of the members of the team at the company we bought, and he said, 'you know what, that team loves being a part of Hologic.' And that's exactly what we always want to strive for. So I feel pretty good that each of them are really fitting that bill."

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Ryan Simon, Vice President, Investor Relations to begin the call.\nRyan Simon: Thank you, Lauren. Good afternoon and thank you for joining Hologic\u2019s second quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company\u2019s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer. Our second quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website, along with an updated corporate presentation. We will also post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we delivered them. And a replay of this call will be available through May 27. Before we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements we make today will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor statement included in our earnings release and SEC filings. Also during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Two of these non-GAAP measures are: one, organic revenue, which we define as constant currency revenue, excluding the divested blood screening business and revenue from acquired businesses owned by Hologic for less than 1 year; and two, organic revenue, excluding COVID-19, which excludes COVID-19 assay revenue, revenue related to COVID-19 and discontinued product sales in Diagnostics. Finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis and revenue growth rates will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic\u2019s CEO.\nSteve MacMillan: Thank you, Ryan and good afternoon everyone. We are pleased to discuss our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. We posted solid results overall and continued our excellent performance. Total revenue was $1.44 billion, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.07, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by over 12% on the top line and over 33% on the bottom. As we stated last quarter, we continued to deliver in an uncertain business environment. For example, in January, we saw COVID cases spike once again, putting pressure on healthcare utilization and certain elective procedures. Through February and March, the ripple effects of the war in Ukraine added additional uncertainty to a world already facing headwinds from COVID, rising inflation and interest rates as well as ongoing global supply chain disruptions. In these challenging times, we continue to deliver. Our performance is a direct result of the planning and investments we made throughout the pandemic to strategically strengthen our business. We are a stronger Hologic through portfolio diversification, the addition of multiple growth drivers into our franchises and continued growth in our international businesses. Today, we would like to provide additional color in three areas. First, we will discuss Q2 growth in light of the macro environment, including updates on the breast health chip shortage we spoke to in Q1; second, provide progress on acquisitions turning organic in our third quarter; and third, highlight our additional efforts to lean into ESG and how our purpose, passion and promise are elevating women\u2019s health around the world. In our second quarter, both our diagnostics and surgical divisions delivered organic growth, excluding COVID, while as expected, our breast and skeletal health division declined. In breast, as we discussed in our last call, the semiconductor chip shortage was the primary driver of the division\u2019s temporary decline. Encouragingly, underlying demand remains strong as measured by healthy orders and a growing backlog. As we have seen during the last 2 years, as COVID testing rises, elective annual exams, screenings and GYN surgical procedures are often postponed. And as COVID testing declines, we see the opposite and our base business returns. We believe what the latest rebound also makes clear is that demand for our products remains strong despite the unpredictability of COVID surges. We are confident in our business, confident in our people, and excited about our positioning heading into the third quarter. For example, in Diagnostics, we placed an additional 123 Panthers in the second quarter, surpassing first quarter placements of 119. Only halfway through the year, we have again exceeded our pre-pandemic average of roughly 225 Panther placements per year. This is a phenomenal result given the rapid global expansion of our Panther installed base during the pandemic. Our Panther installed base is now over 3,100 instruments worldwide with over 45% placed internationally. Also in Diagnostics, our vaginitis panel, BV CV/TV continues its growth trajectory. In our Q2 of 2021, this assay generated about $7 million for the quarter. 1 year later, the panel contributed almost $14 million in worldwide sales, nearly double the year before. And BV CV/TV is now on pace to become a top three women\u2019s health assay in our molecular diagnostics portfolio. Now, let\u2019s provide an update on chip supply and Breast Health. Our supply chain service and commercial organizations have been working hard to gain greater visibility and mitigate the impact of the shortage. In Q2, the impact is slightly less than estimated driven by favorable availability and precise management of chips and circulation within our service inventory. While our teams continue to do a great job navigating the unpredictable supply challenges on chips, the ongoing volatility of supply makes it possible that up to $50 million an additional headwind could surface in the back half of the year. Despite this, we are still materially increasing guidance for the full company, which Karleen will speak to later on. To finish the chip discussion on an upbeat note, we recently received notice of an increased allocation of chips for late in fiscal 2022. While this is very encouraging, given production and delivery timing, the benefit from this increase is unlikely to help revenue until early 2023. Said another way, we are optimistic the back half of our fiscal \u201822 will prove to be the low watermark in terms of available gantries. Moving on to an update on acquisitions, turning organic. In our fiscal third quarter, contributions from both Biotheranostics and Diagenode will be included in the organic growth of our Diagnostics division. We will provide an update on both today. First, Biotheranostics. As a reminder, we completed this acquisition in February of 2021. The goal of this acquisition was to enter the high growth lab-based oncology market, an adjacent longtime area of interest and bring our resources and expertise to create an even stronger business. Based on Breast Cancer Index\u2019s earlier than anticipated inclusion in NCCN guidelines in January of 2021, the deal is off to a great start. Last year in its first full quarter post-acquisition, Biotheranostics posted $13 million of revenue, which was more than 30% higher than their best quarter prior to the pandemic. Fast-forward to our most recent quarter, Biotheranostics generated $16.4 million in revenue. This early success comes as a result of outstanding engagement in a successful cross-functional cross-enterprise integration. As planned, we deployed Hologic resources and expertise and paired this with legacy Biotheranostics capabilities, to refine operational efficiency, and most importantly, set a solid foundation for scalable growth. To accelerate Biotheranostics already strong growth, as an example, we are streamlining the businesses ordering process, which we believe will simplify things for the customer. We expect this enhancement will greatly improve the customer experience and ultimately result in more orders. We are also excited to share that we are in the process of transferring Biotheranostics operations to our diagnostics headquarters in San Diego. While maintaining required division between CLIA and IVD activities, we believe the move will lead to an even more unified culture, stronger relationships between counterparts and more collaborative efforts. Finally and even more encouraging, just last week, the Biotheranostics BCI test was included in the American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, another major step towards increasing utilization and recognition of BCI as the standard of care. BCI is now the only genomic test in both NCCN and ASCO guidelines, for predicting benefit of extended endocrine therapy. Moving on. Shortly after we closed the Biotheranostics transaction, we acquired Diagenode based in Belgium. The goal of the acquisition was to accelerate PCR-based assay development for our Panther Fusion and leverage additional R&D capabilities in Europe. So far, we have checked both boxes. Since the close of the acquisition, as planned, we have integrated the Diagenode organization to optimize the speed and efficiency of our global R&D organization, enabling more effective and more efficient cross-border innovation. To-date, teams from San Diego and Belgium have worked together closely to improve processes and clearly define a robust product development pipeline. The team is already making meaningful progress towards approval of two viral load assays, which will expand our urology portfolio in the transplant testing space. Overall, for both Biotheranostics and Diagenode, we are pleased with the integration and progress of these two businesses. As we look forward, we are excited by the opportunity to unlock more synergies from both and in turn, create more value for our shareholders. Shifting gears, I\u2019d like to close by highlighting two very meaningful and opportunistic marketing efforts from our second quarter. The first being our Super Bowl commercial, which also ran during the Winter Olympics and the second, our title sponsorship of the Women\u2019s Tennis Association Tour. As many of you may have seen, our television commercial titled, Her Health is Her Wealth, featured Mary J. Blige. The commercial highlighted that despite her busy life, she makes time in her schedule for her annual health exams. The campaign came at a critical time as an alarming number of women, missed annual breast and cervical cancer screenings during the COVID-19 pandemic. In January, the inaugural results of our Hologic Global Women\u2019s Health Index found that nearly 50% of women ages 16 to 54 had not seen a medical professional in the prior year. The purpose of our message was to encourage women to schedule their annual exams and prioritize their health. Detecting cancer early is critical and can often make the difference between a curable and non-curable prognosis. After 2 years of the pandemic, with too many women not being screened and our unique relationship with Mary J. Blige, there was no better time and no better stage for us to encourage more women to see their doctors. Our second effort is our landmark title sponsorship of the WTA Tour announced in early March. This alliance was forced to make significant progress on our shared vision of greater wellness and equality for women. The partnership has global reach and will emphasize the importance of preventive care through well-woman visits. We are proud to stand with the WTA as we work together to jointly raise the profile of women and share the importance of early detection and treatment. Before turning the call over to Karleen, let me conclude by saying that the results of this quarter demonstrate our business is both durable and resilient and the demand for our products is exceptionally strong. Despite multiple macro headwinds, we continue to deliver strong results. We are both excited and confident in our business and see great opportunity to be even stronger in the years ahead. With that, let me turn the call over to Karleen.\nKarleen Oberton: Thank you, Steve and good afternoon everyone. We are very pleased to share second quarter results that significantly exceeded our guidance for both revenue and EPS. Our second quarter performance once again highlights the strength of our diverse business. While the Omicron variant negatively impacted our base businesses early in the quarter, our COVID testing upside more than offset this headwind. It\u2019s also important to understand that our balance sheet is stronger than ever, providing key strategic flexibility in this uncertain macro environment. Further, we continue to generate very healthy free cash flow, funding our capital deployment priorities. In the second quarter, we generated significant operating cash flow and executed $200 million of share repurchase, both of which I will touch on in more detail shortly. Before we do that, we will provide color on our consolidated and divisional results for the second quarter. As a reminder, revenue in our fiscal second quarter is typically seasonally lower compared to our first quarter, which benefits from increased patient activity before calendar year end. In the quarter, total revenue of over $1.4 billion was very strong and came in more than $150 million higher than the midpoint of our previous guidance. In addition, EPS of $2.07 in the second quarter far exceeded our guidance range of $1.50 to $1.60. Turning to our divisional results. In Diagnostics, global revenue of $987.1 million declined 5.6% compared to the prior year. However, excluding COVID, worldwide organic diagnostics revenue increased 4%. As discussed, the division\u2019s results early in Q2 were negatively impacted by the Omicron COVID-19 variant. Our base diagnostics business is inversely correlated to spikes in the pandemic as women tend to postpone office visits when COVID cases surge. However, we were encouraged by improving trends throughout March as COVID cases declined. This gives us great confidence in the underlying health of our base diagnostics franchise. Moving specifically to our molecular diagnostics business, we will again exclude the impact of COVID. Making these adjustments, base molecular revenue grew about 7% organically in the second quarter. This growth was driven by strong uptake in newer assays such as our vaginitis panel and menu within our virology product line. As it relates to our COVID results, we generated $584 million of COVID assay revenue, far exceeding our guidance of $400 million. We shipped about 28.5 million tests to customers as ASPs held steady around $20 per test globally. The United States represented about 60% of total COVID assay revenue. However, testing demand was strong in international markets as well. Rounding out Diagnostics, our cytology and perinatal businesses were essentially flat compared to the prior year as these segments were also impacted by COVID-19\u2019s influence on women\u2019s wellness visits. In Breast Health, global revenue of $310.4 million was down approximately 7% as expected, primarily driven by the chip shortages that we have discussed. In our interventional business, incremental supply chain pressure of a few million dollars surfaced during the quarter, specific to our disposable biopsy needles. As a result, our interventional business was down slightly less than 1% in the period. While supply chain challenges persist, demand for our best-in-class Breast Health products remain strong. And as Steve commented, we expect to see improvement in 2023. In Surgical, second quarter revenue of $117.3 million grew 3.5%. As we foreshadowed during our first quarter call, the Omicron variant caused a pullback in elective procedures in the first half of the quarter. But this trend improved later in the period as COVID cases declined. Furthermore, we saw a nice resilience from several of our newer products such as the Fluent fluid management system and solid contributions from Bolder\u2019s cool sale devices. Lastly, our skeletal business, revenue of $20.9 million decreased 6% compared to the prior year period. Now let\u2019s move on to the rest of the non-GAAP P&L for the second quarter. Gross margin of 71% was well ahead of our forecast, driven by higher-than-expected COVID-19 testing volumes in the period. Total operating expenses of $338.2 million increased 22% in the second quarter. As we have done throughout the pandemic, given the benefit from COVID-19 profitability, we took the opportunity to reinvest in our base businesses. We also allocated spend to key marketing initiatives to help drive awareness for women\u2019s health. For example, second quarter operating expenses included our Super Bowl and Olympic commercials as well as expenses associated with our WTA partnership. The combined total of these initiatives contribute slightly more than $25 million to operating expenses in the quarter. In addition, within operating expenses, recent acquisitions added slightly less than $35 million in the quarter, about $25 million higher than the prior year period. Finally, our tax rate in Q2 was 20.5%, marginally lower than our expectations given the higher COVID-19 revenue outside the United States. Putting these pieces together, operating margin for Q2 came in well above our forecast at 47.4% and net margin was very strong at 36.5%. Non-GAAP net income finished at $524.2 million and non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.07, nearly 35% above the midpoint of our prior guidance. Moving on to the P&L. Cash flow from operations was $1.06 billion in the second quarter, inclusive of tax refunds totaling approximately $418 million related to the sale of our previously held Medical Aesthetics business in 2020. When normalizing for these refunds, cash generation for the quarter was still exceptional. These robust cash flows continue to provide tremendous financial and strategic flexibility. For example, as referred to earlier, we repurchased 2.9 million shares of our stock for $200 million in the quarter. We continue to view our ongoing share repurchase program as a lever to drive value for our shareholders. Further, we continue to diligently pursue M&A opportunities in each one of our divisions. Based on our strong operational performance, we had $2.3 billion of cash on our balance sheet at the end of the second quarter, and our leverage ratio was 0.3x. Our capital structure is fortified. And while we ended the quarter with an elevated cash balance, we continue to be thorough in exercise discipline as we evaluate opportunities. Given the macro environment, we have comfort with our elevated cash balance in the ability to be patient as we identify high-quality opportunities. Now let\u2019s move on to our updated guidance for the third quarter and full year fiscal 2022. In the third quarter, we expect to continue our track record of delivering strong financial results with total revenue in the range of $875 million to $915 million. For the full year fiscal 2022, we expect total revenue in the range of $4.6 billion to $4.7 billion, significantly exceeding our prior full year guidance by $175 million at the midpoint. We are raising guidance once again in the face of an uncertain macro backdrop, highlighting our confidence in our business. Given the continued strength of the U.S. dollar and to aid with constant currency modeling, we are assuming foreign exchange headwinds of approximately $20 million in the third quarter of 2022 and $65 million for the full year. This FX unfavorability to revenue is higher than our guidance from last quarter. In Diagnostics, we expect molecular to continue to drive growth based on our Panther installed base of over 3,100 instruments globally, over 80% larger than the start of the pandemic. We are also seeing encouraging uptake of our newer assays like our vaginitis panel, virals and Amgen as well as the tremendous international expansion opportunities. In terms of COVID sales, we expect COVID assay sales to be at least $100 million in the third quarter of 2022 and approximately $1.25 billion for the full year. COVID related items, inclusive of a small amount of discontinued product revenue are expected to be approximately $35 million in the third quarter and $215 million for the full year. In Breast Health, our organic and inorganic investments continue to perform well and highlight the diversity of the division\u2019s revenue streams. For example, Brevera had another great result, growing mid-teens in the last quarter. In addition, recurring service revenue represented more than 40% of total sales in Q2. In terms of the Breast Health chip shortage announced last quarter, given significant uncertainties still exist in the chip market the possibility of an incremental $50 million headwind in the back half of 2022 exists, and we have incorporated this into our guidance. While we are seeing early signs of improvement in chip supply, we are forecasting conservatively. To reemphasize this headwind is purely a supply issue and not one of underlying demand, which remains strong. Finally, in Surgical, we feel great about the trajectory of our business as COVID trends improve. MyoSure and related organic products such as Fluent continue to drive near-term growth and we expect meaningful contribution from both Acessa and Boulder over the next several years. As a reminder, our organic guidance backs out of revenue from acquisitions until the first full quarter after a deal annualizes as well as revenue from our divested blood screening business. In terms of the deal, Biotheranostics and Diagenode will become part of our organic revenue in Q3 \u201822. Therefore, the organic revenue adjustments for Q3 includes Mobidiag and Boulder and for Q4 Boulder only. Moving down the P&L. For the full year, we forecast our non-GAAP gross margin percentage to be in the mid- to high 60s and our non-GAAP operating margin percentage to be in the high 30s. Both estimates are higher than our guidance last quarter. Further, our second half guidance incorporates the margin impact from our Breast Health supply chain revenue shortfall. As a reminder, Gantry gross margin is accretive to the consolidated averages, and we have maintained operating spend in order to be in a position to move quickly once we receive chips. In addition, we have again incorporated inflationary supply chain costs into our guidance as it relates to electronics, plastics and logistics. Despite these headwinds, for the full year, we expect both gross and operating margins to be above pre-pandemic levels. In terms of operating expenses, we expect spending to be up compared to 2021, but be lower in the second half of 2022 compared to the first half. As we have continued to highlight, in quarters with higher COVID testing revenue, we will take the opportunity to invest for future growth. Below operating income, we expect other expenses net to be a little less than $25 million a quarter for the remainder of the year. Our guidance is based on effective tax rate of 21% and diluted shares outstanding of around $255 million for the full year. All this net add to expected EPS of $0.67 to $0.72 in the third quarter and $5.45 to $5.65 for the full year, 10% above our prior guidance at the midpoint. As you update your forecast, let me remind you that macro uncertainty due to the pandemic related supply chain challenges and geopolitical conflicts remain high. We would therefore encourage you to model at the middle of our ranges, which incorporates both potential upsides and downsides. Let me wrap up by saying that Hologic posted very strong second quarter results that far exceeded expectations and guidance. We are also raising our financial guidance for the year. Even as we are increasing anticipated supply chain headwinds, highlighting the multiple growth drivers we have added to each of our franchises and benefits from COVID testing. With a strong balance sheet and best-in-class cash flow generation, we are well positioned. With that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research.\nJack Meehan: Thank you and good afternoon.\nSteve MacMillan: Hi, Jack.\nJack Meehan: My first question is on Breast Health and the semiconductors. So last quarter, the \u2013 up to $200 million you talked about, I thought it was fully de-risking the gantry exposure. And then the quarter actually came in a little better than you were thinking. So I\u2019m just trying to square this commentary with the additional $50 million you\u2019re building in from here. Can you just maybe help me through that? And kind of second off that, just can you give us a little bit more color on the order book and just your confidence that you\u2019re not losing share given some of the supply chain shortages there?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. So Jack, it\u2019s Karleen. I\u2019ll start off on kind of the evolution of the numbers. So first, let\u2019s recognize in this quarter, we did a little better, and that was really a lot of efforts between our service and supply chain folks really prioritizing in remanufacturing chips for the service needs, which allowed us to sell more new gantries. So great effort there. I think when we think about the additional possibility of an additional $50 million, it has a little more to do with timing. And so we are pleased that we got a higher allocation of chips than we had thought than we had originally expected, but the timing of that is such that it won\u2019t come in until 2023. I think we thought if there was an additional allocation, we might get that benefit in \u201822, but it\u2019s looking like it\u2019s 2023. And I think just on the second part of your question on demand, again, we see our backlog growing in our Breast Health business. It\u2019s strong. We\u2019re working really strategically with customers to make sure that we\u2019re not losing any business because of this. And I think our intelligence would be that our competitors are probably in likely the same position as us.\nSteve MacMillan: And I think the reps feel that.\nJack Meehan: It is. Okay. Yes, that makes sense on the timing, very helpful. As an unrelated follow-up, obviously, in molecular, big focus on kind of share shifts in the diagnostics industry with COVID I was wondering if you could talk about your relationship with the National Labs and just with the larger customers, whether you think you\u2019re gaining or losing share as we transition eventually into an endemic environment?\nSteve MacMillan: Yes, Jack. And by the way, I\u2019d also clarify that we\u2019re not going to use the cash on the balance sheet to buy the Eagles. I know you, but\u2026\nJack Meehan: Hopefully, they make some good picks tomorrow.\nSteve MacMillan: Yes, exactly. So in terms of our relationship with the National Labs, I probably couldn\u2019t be more proud of our teams. And even we\u2019ve always had good relationships, but when you think about the way we responded. And particularly, if you look at the two big major labs in the United States, but even a number of the other big ones right below the top two. When they were really under the gun and you think back to the April, May, June time frame of 2020, when the evening news around the world \u2013 around the country was always about the 8-day turnaround times for PCR tests and all of the problems with molecular testing. And that\u2019s when we dispatched and our team went around the clock to put Panthers in all over the place. And we really worked so well to help those \u2013 both of those customers dramatically reduce the turnaround times. And I think we\u2019ve used both the relationship in coming to their aid during that time as well as, frankly, I think they increasingly understand that we\u2019re building markets. When it comes to how we approach the women\u2019s health market, we\u2019re also working the reimbursements. We\u2019re working the physician recommendations. We\u2019re working the guideline developments. And all of that is helping to grow the market, which, by definition, is growing them. So I would tell you, I feel like it\u2019s more of a partnership that is valued than just a traditional vendor/vendee relationship. And I think our teams have worked so hard to have many good relationships throughout all levels, both operationally within the marketing teams, and we like where we\u2019re positioned. We really do.\nJack Meehan: Thank you, Steve.\nSteve MacMillan: Great. Thanks, Jack. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.\nVijay Kumar: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Steve, maybe one big picture for you. I\u2019m looking at the base business here, the segments, it looks like was light across the board. Breast imaging, perhaps it\u2019s understandable given the chip shortage. It looks like underlying diagnostics came in below Street models. GYN, a similar trend. How much of this was a utilization impact due to Omicron? And the reason I asked is we\u2019re seeing other device companies coming up with improved procedure trends. I\u2019m curious, was there any one-off items that impacted the Hologic in the Q?\nSteve MacMillan: I think, Vijay, part of it on the Surgical business is probably as some of the hospitals came back up post Omicron. They tended to prioritize some of the cardiovascular procedures and some of the more immediate procedures, whereas our GYN surge is viewed as a little more elective. So I think there was a little bit of that probably in the quarter that we think shakes out completely over time as the women\u2019s health issues come back. And I think our base molecular diagnostics business was up 7%, not too shabby in a period where a lot of our machines ended up running a lot of additional COVID tests, so nothing that we are concerned about. And I think as we continue to look all of these quarters, there is variability in the puts and takes, and we keep managing our business overall that as one part goes up. The reality is we do see trade-offs we did sell $584 million of COVID in the quarter. There is a bit of a trade-off on our base business with that. So as that goes back, I think we\u2019re very optimistic about where the base business comes here as that COVID testing really does probably really some side here.\nVijay Kumar: That\u2019s helpful perspective, Steve. And maybe one related. There is been a lot of debate on the Street on what is the underlying base margins, base earnings power for Hologic. Not what the Street is trying to do. We\u2019re trying to do a cohort P&L and a base business P&L. And in reality, that may not be have corporates think about their businesses. How much of reinvestment is going on in the business? Do you \u2013 and the reason I ask is, if I look at the implied Q4 EPS guide, I think it\u2019s $0.60, $0.65. So that\u2019s annualizing at $250 million, I\u2019m assuming Q4 has very minimal COVID testing, but also it has some impact from breast imaging, the chip shortage, right? So what is the underlying earnings power here for Hologic that we should be thinking about?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. Vijay, it\u2019s Karleen. I\u2019ll take you through it. So if we look at the second half of 2022, you\u2019re right. That is the worst impact of the breast health chip shortage. And so don\u2019t think of the back half earnings power and the math you just did on the Q4 as what we call our base business earnings power. There is definitely an impact there, significant impact with pretty minimal COVID revenue in the fourth quarter. The other thing I would point to is that if we look at the back half, we have a higher operating expenses and simply dilutive operating margins from our acquisitions, which actually be a tailwind as we move forward into 2023 and beyond. And we do have some incremental investments in both Q3 and Q4. Those investments will either not occur in 2023 or be significantly lower. So to reiterate, the back half earnings power is not reflective of the base business because of the one-time items, I\u2019ll call them, that we have there.\nSteve MacMillan: And Vijay, back to even building on the comment on the base business, I\u2019d remind you in a couple of simple things here. We\u2019ve not only passed through the full beat on top line and bottom line through the balance of the year. So the second half is every bit as intact as what it was prior, despite more headwinds. All of which should underscore the confidence that we have in our base business. And to Karleen\u2019s point, that is \u2013 the fourth quarter is not the ongoing run rate.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Patrick Donnelly with Citi.\nPatrick Donnelly: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe a similar follow-up on that, I mean, just in terms of the Breast Health ramp back up as we get into the beginning of \u201823, what\u2019s the visibility into the supply chain normalizing there? I mean the confidence level that kind of corrects itself as we get into \u201823. Should we think of it as more kind of slowly ramping back up and being a bit of a drag on revenue margins to start \u201823%? Is the expenses kind of to Karleen\u2019s point, those are untapped? Growth is going to catch up. What\u2019s the right way to think about that as we look out to start of \u201823?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. I would say that I would expect it not to be compared to \u2013 as we will see benefits from increased supply early in \u201823. But I think we will see, to your point, a normalization throughout the year is what I would think would happen because, even though we have a building backlog, it\u2019s going to take multiple quarters to work through it. As these installs of this equipment is highly scheduled with the hospitals and breast centers because typically have to take rooms down, its construction as well as the install takes almost a week. So, it\u2019s going to take several quarters to work through that. So, I would say, a normalization over the course of the year.\nPatrick Donnelly: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then Steve, on the capital allocation side, what\u2019s the right way to think about? Obviously, you guys have done some share repos, you have done some deals. How do you balance the priority there? Obviously, the market is volatile and presents opportunities here and there. But what\u2019s the internal thinking? How large will you go on the deal side? What\u2019s the pipeline look like? Just an update there would be helpful.\nSteve MacMillan: Yes. I think the biggest thought we should leave you with is we are comfortable being patient right now. Just because we have a very strong amount of cash on the balance sheet doesn\u2019t mean we feel pressure to go do it in the next quarter or two quarters. We know that deals will present themselves in the quarters or years ahead. And I was showing Karleen our old headline from the late \u201808 timeframe at Stryker, where we were sitting on a pile of cash. And at the time, I was being criticized for being too conservative, and opportunities presented themselves over the next few years. And I think we feel very confident and frankly, should feel great in an uncertain world to be sitting with the balance sheet that we have relative to what we had 8 years or 10 years ago in this company. And it just gives us the ability to be patient and therefore, make great deals and continue to do a combination, some buybacks, but we still ultimately are looking and think there will be some good deals that will present themselves. And we are not going to get into the specific size. But obviously, we have got a fair amount on the balance sheet right now, and it doesn\u2019t mean we are ready to go below it all at once or anything else. I think we have been showing over the last 5 years or so, we are being very disciplined in and rigorous.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Puneet Souda with SVB Securities.\nPuneet Souda: Yes. Hi Steve, Karleen. Thanks for taking the question. So, maybe just the first one on the \u2013 some of the Panthers that you highlighted, the recent sales. Are those still going into a demand for COVID, or was that still a function of demand pull-through in January from COVID, or are customers now looking at the broader menu and saying \u2013 looking at Panther purchases from a broader menu perspective. And could you update us on any utilization trends? I know this is a major question in terms of the utilization of COVID conversion into other test. Maybe just walk us through sort of what\u2019s happening as we somewhat emerge out of pandemic into this and the mix situation?\nSteve MacMillan: Yes. The placements are really going for both COVID and new business. I think the magic for us is we have been able to expose Panther to so many new customers around the world. And they have seen the benefits both in COVID and it\u2019s also given us the chance to talk about the menu and the expanded menu. So, we are really getting them on both fronts. And I think every time we start to see customers getting ready to port some of the newer assays onto their machines, we have yet another spike. And candidly, we would have expected more base business growth this quarter. And then low and behold, we did another 28.5 million COVID tests. As a reminder, that\u2019s as much as we were doing practically globally, more than what we were doing globally pre-pandemic on all of our businesses combined. So, it\u2019s \u2013 I think people have become old to the numbers, but that has an impact in terms of our customers being able to adopt the other parts of the menu when again, they just got thrown back into huge testing. Now, I think as it plays out here in the coming quarters, we are assuming a much stronger and prolonged ramp down here in the COVID testing. That\u2019s going to really, we believe, allow the underlying strength of our core menu to start to shine through, and you will start to see it in these quarters.\nPuneet Souda: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just a one-off question that we have been getting from investors given the China shutdowns, anything that you are baking from that side into the guide? And maybe just could you \u2013 if you could remind us your exposure there, both in terms of the revenue and impact to the supply chain? Thank you.\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. It\u2019s Karleen. I will tell onto that. So, less than 3% of our revenue comes from China. So, we have pretty minimal exposure. We do think there is some impact that is factored into our guide and we really don\u2019t have any manufacturing presence within China. I think what we are dealing with is the kind of global supply chain chip issue related to China. But from a revenue perspective, it\u2019s pretty immaterial.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Brian Weinstein with William Blair.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good afternoon. This is Griffin on for Brian. Thanks for the questions. Just continuing to talk about that OUS strength, I guess specifically in diagnostics, historically, those markets have had some less favorable reimbursement and just lower testing volumes with less screenings. And are you seeing any change in either of those dynamics as you think about the OUS outlook?\nSteve MacMillan: I think we see opportunities again over time to more directly influence the size of those markets and everything else. So, I think what we do see in the near-term is the ability with a lot of the additional Panthers we have placed to have more menu running through them. And then the second piece would be really helping to grow those markets more significantly over time. So, I think we feel very encouraged short-term from all the placements and longer term because of the strength that we have put in our teams. And frankly, the additional access we have gotten to a lot of the health ministers of the world through both COVID time as well as the Hologic Global Women\u2019s Health Index to, I think start to get women\u2019s health moved up the priority list, where we will be able to get more screening guidelines and things to put in place in the coming years, particularly in Western Europe.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. And then on the CT/NG, you noted we are back to pre-pandemic levels. Any notable changes in how you think about the basis of competition here, pre-pandemic versus endemic state or post-pandemic, particularly with some of the point-of-care molecular entrants in the STI market?\nSteve MacMillan: Yes. We will see where that all plays out. We are always very, very cognizant. But I think as we continue to think about how women are going to get these tests and the doctors and the reimbursements and everything else, I think we continue to feel very good about our position.\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. I would just emphasize that most of the CTMG testing is asymptomatic. So, when you think about at-home testing, it would be generated by a symptom, most \u2013 vast majority of the testing is asymptomatic and again, part of that well women\u2019s visit.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley.\nTejas Savant: Hey guys. Good evening. Just a follow-up on some of your earlier comments on the chip shortages on the breast health side. Steve and Karleen, you spoke about that new allocation that you are expecting to see come through at the end of the second quarter, how \u2013 can you quantify that relative to that 20% number that you had spoken of earlier. And in terms of seeing the benefit in fiscal \u201823, is this largely sort of outside your control, or are there things you can do to accelerate those timelines, perhaps looking into different suppliers, etcetera?\nKarleen Oberton: So, in rough numbers, I think the increased allocation increased our expected unit production by about 20% to 25% in 2023. And I think from that initial, hopefully, we will get \u2013 we just don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t have that visibility to \u2013 with that allocation gets any higher, but that\u2019s what we are planning on right now.\nTejas Savant: Got it. And any comments Karleen, on the possibility of new suppliers coming in here, or is that sort of all incorporated into your fiscal \u201823 recovery commentary?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. What we know is kind of incorporated into the guide in our commentary, I think to try to bring on new suppliers would take multiple quarters. And I think the issue, the supply issue is not just our supplies, it\u2019s all the suppliers. So, it doesn\u2019t really solve the problem.\nOperator: Next question comes from Casey Woodring with JPMorgan.\nCasey Woodring: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. Can you talk a little bit about breast service? And if there is maybe any kind of pull forward you could do there to offset some of the near-term gantry cell headwinds?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. No. So, breast service, we love our breast service revenue. It\u2019s \u2013 I think the comment was about 40% of the breast revenue in the quarter. But that \u2013 most of that revenue, the majority is tied to long-term service contracts. So, it\u2019s contracts that are over multiple years where the revenue is basically amortized over the contract period. And really it\u2019s tied to our installed base. So, we are not putting up more gantries, it\u2019s hard to do more service contracts. So, that\u2019s really \u2013 that\u2019s more of a stabilizing fact in that division versus the limited to pull forward.\nSteve MacMillan: Yes. Nor would we want to pull it forward quite harshly. I think what we love about that business is, it\u2019s stable and candidly we have got all the additional COVID revenue this year. What we are really looking forward to is, people will start to see the underlying strength of our base businesses in 2023. And the last thing we would want to do is mortgage some of that.\nCasey Woodring: Got it. And then just how should we think about the Panther competitive environment in the hospital setting as it relates to some of the smaller bench-top platforms when you think about and some of the other instruments out there with menu. Do hospital customers have both the Panther and the bench-top instrument and sort of how should we think about this dynamic moving forward given all the COVID placements?\nSteve MacMillan: Yes. Many do, but they are still largely used differently. A lot of the bench-top stuff is really for symptomatic and especially respiratory or other symptomatic stuff, whereas ours is largely asymptomatic and ongoing screening. So, I think this is going to be a question of and not or. And there is going to be meaningful opportunities on all fronts. I do think we are very well positioned and feel great about where we are with the Panther placements. So, I think we are very confident you are going to continue to see that, and that will unfold even more as the COVID revenue goes away.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Matson with Needham.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi guys. This is Joseph on for Mike. I guess maybe one around gross margin. I guess given the capacity expansion to really meet COVID testing during the surges. And as we start seeing that declines, we see the volumes decline, should we expect some type of gross margin headwind in these next couple of quarters?\nKarleen Oberton: Well, certainly, as COVID revenue comes down, the gross margins will come down from where they have been. But from an absorption perspective, our manufacturing of COVID is fungible with all of our molecular diagnostics manufacturing. It\u2019s not a separate COVID line where we will have to mothball, if you will. I think the other piece of what has happened over the last 2 years is we have expanded our manufacturing, but that\u2019s been substantially funded by the Department of Defense and our contracts with them. So, there is really no big hit, if you will, for idle capacity. That was the question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes. Yes, absolutely. That\u2019s very helpful. And then I guess maybe one more around the Panther systems. I know you guys have touched on that a lot. But as we are kind of looking towards that capacity utilization and non-COVID assays really going into these systems. I guess maybe there has been a lot of surges up and down. Obviously, hospitals are very flush. But I guess, what are you guys looking for to really push these forward, whether it be trainings that you guys have to schedule or whether it\u2019s just kind of waiting for total COVID cases to really reach a manageable level?\nSteve MacMillan: Yes. In terms of the base business, that\u2019s the \u2013 Joe, it\u2019s really around having the time to get the new assays up and running on the Panther within each hospital in each lab. But I would tell you, just from having \u2013 we are in our strategic plan process right now where we have been sitting down both with the U.S. diagnostics team, but also our international teams. And as we look at the optimism that they have for the underlying growth rates of our molecular business for the next few years, it gets pretty exciting. So, we are not ready to give guidance or anything on that front. But I think there is just the additional placements and the additional opportunities. And don\u2019t underestimate in a world where labor constraints and labor costs have become a huge issue. I think people are forgetting one of the massive benefits of the Panther is the workflow automation, the random batch access. This is the pen caps that we have. This is a remarkably efficient system that we think is only \u2013 and that\u2019s part of what the customers are seeing and looking forward to the future. So, I think it\u2019s going to bode very well for us.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America.\nDerik de Bruin: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Steve, how do you feel about the long-term guide that you set out? You put out that 5% to 7% core growth CAGR through \u201825 on the 3Q \u201821 call. And I am just wondering, given the ship shortages, given what that is, I mean how do you \u2013 how is your confidence in that? I mean looking at the results this quarter I think some people are a little bit nervous. But are you still comfortable with that 5% to 7% number?\nSteve MacMillan: Very. It\u2019s a long-term thing. Obviously, we did not anticipate the chip shortage. And having said that, you know what, think about what those growth rates are going to be when we index against these quarters, next year. But even on a long-term basis, I think we feel very, very good about what the growth rates of our base businesses will probably be doing over the next couple of years. We have got a couple of punky quarters here right ahead of us to finish a year that\u2019s already a very strong year. And its growth rates as we start to look into \u201823, probably looking pretty good.\nDerik de Bruin: Okay. And as a placeholder for COVID for next year, that fourth quarter number, that $40 million to $50 million implied for COVID testing in Q4, is that a good way to sort of think about it just for now?\nSteve MacMillan: Yes. I almost don\u2019t even want to go there, Derik, is the quarterly swing who knows where it all goes, and I think we are poised either way. But I would put in a de minimis number for 2024, and yet I think we will certainly expect some volumes to continue to be there. So, probably not a horrible estimate, but we are nowhere near being able to give guidance.\nOperator: And we will take our final question from Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG.\nRyan Zimmerman: Thanks for squeezing me in. And I will just keep it to one in the interest of time. So, on the breast health business, Steve or Kerleen, we have seen from some of your peers on the equipment side, certainly, commentary around softer demand, cost of debt is rising. You had alluded to the fact that the order book is pretty healthy or the backlog is healthy on the breast side. What do you attribute that to in terms of your capital equipment? Is it a site of service? Is it price points relative to maybe some of the $1 million-plus robots that are out there? I would just be curious to understand kind of how you think about the capital equipment demand market at the hospital level.\nSteve MacMillan: Yes. I think it starts with always having a superior product. And we have not gotten where we have gotten from a market share standpoint, particularly in mammography and especially in 3D without having a superior product. And I think \u2013 and also superior workflow throughout the whole gamut. And I think hospitals are seeing what we bring to them in a critically important area. To your second point, I will say, we are not of the high ticket items in a grand scheme, a hospital recapitalizing a few rooms in mammography or even several suites is nowhere near the magnitude of some of the bigger iron, the massive, whether it\u2019s robots or MRIs and those kinds of things. So, I think it does allow us to kind of be in a sweet spot where even if there is a little bit of capital contraction that we think we will be fine there. And I think our team is feeling very, very good.\nRyan Zimmerman: Thank you.\nSteve MacMillan: Alright. Thank you. It sounds like it, operator. Lauren?\nOperator: Yes, sir. That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. This now concludes Hologic\u2019s 2Q 2022 earnings conference call. Have a good evening.",

            "name": "Karleen Oberton",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve and good afternoon everyone. We are very pleased to share second quarter results that significantly exceeded our guidance for both revenue and EPS. Our second quarter performance once again highlights the strength of our diverse business. While the Omicron variant negatively impacted our base businesses early in the quarter, our COVID testing upside more than offset this headwind. It's also important to understand that our balance sheet is stronger than ever, providing key strategic flexibility in this uncertain macro environment. Further, we continue to generate very healthy free cash flow, funding our capital deployment priorities. In the second quarter, we generated significant operating cash flow and executed $200 million of share repurchase, both of which I will touch on in more detail shortly. Before we do that, we will provide color on our consolidated and divisional results for the second quarter. As a reminder, revenue in our fiscal second quarter is typically seasonally lower compared to our first quarter, which benefits from increased patient activity before calendar year end. In the quarter, total revenue of over $1.4 billion was very strong and came in more than $150 million higher than the midpoint of our previous guidance. In addition, EPS of $2.07 in the second quarter far exceeded our guidance range of $1.50 to $1.60. Turning to our divisional results. In Diagnostics, global revenue of $987.1 million declined 5.6% compared to the prior year. However, excluding COVID, worldwide organic diagnostics revenue increased 4%. As discussed, the division's results early in Q2 were negatively impacted by the Omicron COVID-19 variant. Our base diagnostics business is inversely correlated to spikes in the pandemic as women tend to postpone office visits when COVID cases surge. However, we were encouraged by improving trends throughout March as COVID cases declined. This gives us great confidence in the underlying health of our base diagnostics franchise. Moving specifically to our molecular diagnostics business, we will again exclude the impact of COVID. Making these adjustments, base molecular revenue grew about 7% organically in the second quarter. This growth was driven by strong uptake in newer assays such as our vaginitis panel and menu within our virology product line. As it relates to our COVID results, we generated $584 million of COVID assay revenue, far exceeding our guidance of $400 million. We shipped about 28.5 million tests to customers as ASPs held steady around $20 per test globally. The United States represented about 60% of total COVID assay revenue. However, testing demand was strong in international markets as well. Rounding out Diagnostics, our cytology and perinatal businesses were essentially flat compared to the prior year as these segments were also impacted by COVID-19's influence on women's wellness visits. In Breast Health, global revenue of $310.4 million was down approximately 7% as expected, primarily driven by the chip shortages that we have discussed. In our interventional business, incremental supply chain pressure of a few million dollars surfaced during the quarter, specific to our disposable biopsy needles. As a result, our interventional business was down slightly less than 1% in the period. While supply chain challenges persist, demand for our best-in-class Breast Health products remain strong. And as Steve commented, we expect to see improvement in 2023. In Surgical, second quarter revenue of $117.3 million grew 3.5%. As we foreshadowed during our first quarter call, the Omicron variant caused a pullback in elective procedures in the first half of the quarter. But this trend improved later in the period as COVID cases declined. Furthermore, we saw a nice resilience from several of our newer products such as the Fluent fluid management system and solid contributions from Bolder's cool sale devices. Lastly, our skeletal business, revenue of $20.9 million decreased 6% compared to the prior year period. Now let's move on to the rest of the non-GAAP P&L for the second quarter. Gross margin of 71% was well ahead of our forecast, driven by higher-than-expected COVID-19 testing volumes in the period. Total operating expenses of $338.2 million increased 22% in the second quarter. As we have done throughout the pandemic, given the benefit from COVID-19 profitability, we took the opportunity to reinvest in our base businesses. We also allocated spend to key marketing initiatives to help drive awareness for women's health. For example, second quarter operating expenses included our Super Bowl and Olympic commercials as well as expenses associated with our WTA partnership. The combined total of these initiatives contribute slightly more than $25 million to operating expenses in the quarter. In addition, within operating expenses, recent acquisitions added slightly less than $35 million in the quarter, about $25 million higher than the prior year period. Finally, our tax rate in Q2 was 20.5%, marginally lower than our expectations given the higher COVID-19 revenue outside the United States. Putting these pieces together, operating margin for Q2 came in well above our forecast at 47.4% and net margin was very strong at 36.5%. Non-GAAP net income finished at $524.2 million and non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.07, nearly 35% above the midpoint of our prior guidance. Moving on to the P&L. Cash flow from operations was $1.06 billion in the second quarter, inclusive of tax refunds totaling approximately $418 million related to the sale of our previously held Medical Aesthetics business in 2020. When normalizing for these refunds, cash generation for the quarter was still exceptional. These robust cash flows continue to provide tremendous financial and strategic flexibility. For example, as referred to earlier, we repurchased 2.9 million shares of our stock for $200 million in the quarter. We continue to view our ongoing share repurchase program as a lever to drive value for our shareholders. Further, we continue to diligently pursue M&A opportunities in each one of our divisions. Based on our strong operational performance, we had $2.3 billion of cash on our balance sheet at the end of the second quarter, and our leverage ratio was 0.3x. Our capital structure is fortified. And while we ended the quarter with an elevated cash balance, we continue to be thorough in exercise discipline as we evaluate opportunities. Given the macro environment, we have comfort with our elevated cash balance in the ability to be patient as we identify high-quality opportunities. Now let's move on to our updated guidance for the third quarter and full year fiscal 2022. In the third quarter, we expect to continue our track record of delivering strong financial results with total revenue in the range of $875 million to $915 million. For the full year fiscal 2022, we expect total revenue in the range of $4.6 billion to $4.7 billion, significantly exceeding our prior full year guidance by $175 million at the midpoint. We are raising guidance once again in the face of an uncertain macro backdrop, highlighting our confidence in our business. Given the continued strength of the U.S. dollar and to aid with constant currency modeling, we are assuming foreign exchange headwinds of approximately $20 million in the third quarter of 2022 and $65 million for the full year. This FX unfavorability to revenue is higher than our guidance from last quarter. In Diagnostics, we expect molecular to continue to drive growth based on our Panther installed base of over 3,100 instruments globally, over 80% larger than the start of the pandemic. We are also seeing encouraging uptake of our newer assays like our vaginitis panel, virals and Amgen as well as the tremendous international expansion opportunities. In terms of COVID sales, we expect COVID assay sales to be at least $100 million in the third quarter of 2022 and approximately $1.25 billion for the full year. COVID related items, inclusive of a small amount of discontinued product revenue are expected to be approximately $35 million in the third quarter and $215 million for the full year. In Breast Health, our organic and inorganic investments continue to perform well and highlight the diversity of the division's revenue streams. For example, Brevera had another great result, growing mid-teens in the last quarter. In addition, recurring service revenue represented more than 40% of total sales in Q2. In terms of the Breast Health chip shortage announced last quarter, given significant uncertainties still exist in the chip market the possibility of an incremental $50 million headwind in the back half of 2022 exists, and we have incorporated this into our guidance. While we are seeing early signs of improvement in chip supply, we are forecasting conservatively. To reemphasize this headwind is purely a supply issue and not one of underlying demand, which remains strong. Finally, in Surgical, we feel great about the trajectory of our business as COVID trends improve. MyoSure and related organic products such as Fluent continue to drive near-term growth and we expect meaningful contribution from both Acessa and Boulder over the next several years. As a reminder, our organic guidance backs out of revenue from acquisitions until the first full quarter after a deal annualizes as well as revenue from our divested blood screening business. In terms of the deal, Biotheranostics and Diagenode will become part of our organic revenue in Q3 \u201822. Therefore, the organic revenue adjustments for Q3 includes Mobidiag and Boulder and for Q4 Boulder only. Moving down the P&L. For the full year, we forecast our non-GAAP gross margin percentage to be in the mid- to high 60s and our non-GAAP operating margin percentage to be in the high 30s. Both estimates are higher than our guidance last quarter. Further, our second half guidance incorporates the margin impact from our Breast Health supply chain revenue shortfall. As a reminder, Gantry gross margin is accretive to the consolidated averages, and we have maintained operating spend in order to be in a position to move quickly once we receive chips. In addition, we have again incorporated inflationary supply chain costs into our guidance as it relates to electronics, plastics and logistics. Despite these headwinds, for the full year, we expect both gross and operating margins to be above pre-pandemic levels. In terms of operating expenses, we expect spending to be up compared to 2021, but be lower in the second half of 2022 compared to the first half. As we have continued to highlight, in quarters with higher COVID testing revenue, we will take the opportunity to invest for future growth. Below operating income, we expect other expenses net to be a little less than $25 million a quarter for the remainder of the year. Our guidance is based on effective tax rate of 21% and diluted shares outstanding of around $255 million for the full year. All this net add to expected EPS of $0.67 to $0.72 in the third quarter and $5.45 to $5.65 for the full year, 10% above our prior guidance at the midpoint. As you update your forecast, let me remind you that macro uncertainty due to the pandemic related supply chain challenges and geopolitical conflicts remain high. We would therefore encourage you to model at the middle of our ranges, which incorporates both potential upsides and downsides. Let me wrap up by saying that Hologic posted very strong second quarter results that far exceeded expectations and guidance. We are also raising our financial guidance for the year. Even as we are increasing anticipated supply chain headwinds, highlighting the multiple growth drivers we have added to each of our franchises and benefits from COVID testing. With a strong balance sheet and best-in-class cash flow generation, we are well positioned. With that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions. Yes. So Jack, it's Karleen. I'll start off on kind of the evolution of the numbers. So first, let's recognize in this quarter, we did a little better, and that was really a lot of efforts between our service and supply chain folks really prioritizing in remanufacturing chips for the service needs, which allowed us to sell more new gantries. So great effort there. I think when we think about the additional possibility of an additional $50 million, it has a little more to do with timing. And so we are pleased that we got a higher allocation of chips than we had thought than we had originally expected, but the timing of that is such that it won't come in until 2023. I think we thought if there was an additional allocation, we might get that benefit in \u201822, but it's looking like it's 2023. And I think just on the second part of your question on demand, again, we see our backlog growing in our Breast Health business. It's strong. We're working really strategically with customers to make sure that we're not losing any business because of this. And I think our intelligence would be that our competitors are probably in likely the same position as us. Yes. Vijay, it's Karleen. I'll take you through it. So if we look at the second half of 2022, you're right. That is the worst impact of the breast health chip shortage. And so don't think of the back half earnings power and the math you just did on the Q4 as what we call our base business earnings power. There is definitely an impact there, significant impact with pretty minimal COVID revenue in the fourth quarter. The other thing I would point to is that if we look at the back half, we have a higher operating expenses and simply dilutive operating margins from our acquisitions, which actually be a tailwind as we move forward into 2023 and beyond. And we do have some incremental investments in both Q3 and Q4. Those investments will either not occur in 2023 or be significantly lower. So to reiterate, the back half earnings power is not reflective of the base business because of the one-time items, I'll call them, that we have there. Yes. I would say that I would expect it not to be compared to \u2013 as we will see benefits from increased supply early in \u201823. But I think we will see, to your point, a normalization throughout the year is what I would think would happen because, even though we have a building backlog, it's going to take multiple quarters to work through it. As these installs of this equipment is highly scheduled with the hospitals and breast centers because typically have to take rooms down, its construction as well as the install takes almost a week. So, it's going to take several quarters to work through that. So, I would say, a normalization over the course of the year. Yes. It's Karleen. I will tell onto that. So, less than 3% of our revenue comes from China. So, we have pretty minimal exposure. We do think there is some impact that is factored into our guide and we really don't have any manufacturing presence within China. I think what we are dealing with is the kind of global supply chain chip issue related to China. But from a revenue perspective, it's pretty immaterial. Yes. I would just emphasize that most of the CTMG testing is asymptomatic. So, when you think about at-home testing, it would be generated by a symptom, most \u2013 vast majority of the testing is asymptomatic and again, part of that well women's visit. So, in rough numbers, I think the increased allocation increased our expected unit production by about 20% to 25% in 2023. And I think from that initial, hopefully, we will get \u2013 we just don't know. We don't have that visibility to \u2013 with that allocation gets any higher, but that's what we are planning on right now. Yes. What we know is kind of incorporated into the guide in our commentary, I think to try to bring on new suppliers would take multiple quarters. And I think the issue, the supply issue is not just our supplies, it's all the suppliers. So, it doesn't really solve the problem. Yes. No. So, breast service, we love our breast service revenue. It's \u2013 I think the comment was about 40% of the breast revenue in the quarter. But that \u2013 most of that revenue, the majority is tied to long-term service contracts. So, it's contracts that are over multiple years where the revenue is basically amortized over the contract period. And really it's tied to our installed base. So, we are not putting up more gantries, it's hard to do more service contracts. So, that's really \u2013 that's more of a stabilizing fact in that division versus the limited to pull forward. Well, certainly, as COVID revenue comes down, the gross margins will come down from where they have been. But from an absorption perspective, our manufacturing of COVID is fungible with all of our molecular diagnostics manufacturing. It's not a separate COVID line where we will have to mothball, if you will. I think the other piece of what has happened over the last 2 years is we have expanded our manufacturing, but that's been substantially funded by the Department of Defense and our contracts with them. So, there is really no big hit, if you will, for idle capacity. That was the question."

            "name": "Steve MacMillan",
            "content": "Thank you, Ryan and good afternoon everyone. We are pleased to discuss our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. We posted solid results overall and continued our excellent performance. Total revenue was $1.44 billion, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.07, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by over 12% on the top line and over 33% on the bottom. As we stated last quarter, we continued to deliver in an uncertain business environment. For example, in January, we saw COVID cases spike once again, putting pressure on healthcare utilization and certain elective procedures. Through February and March, the ripple effects of the war in Ukraine added additional uncertainty to a world already facing headwinds from COVID, rising inflation and interest rates as well as ongoing global supply chain disruptions. In these challenging times, we continue to deliver. Our performance is a direct result of the planning and investments we made throughout the pandemic to strategically strengthen our business. We are a stronger Hologic through portfolio diversification, the addition of multiple growth drivers into our franchises and continued growth in our international businesses. Today, we would like to provide additional color in three areas. First, we will discuss Q2 growth in light of the macro environment, including updates on the breast health chip shortage we spoke to in Q1; second, provide progress on acquisitions turning organic in our third quarter; and third, highlight our additional efforts to lean into ESG and how our purpose, passion and promise are elevating women's health around the world. In our second quarter, both our diagnostics and surgical divisions delivered organic growth, excluding COVID, while as expected, our breast and skeletal health division declined. In breast, as we discussed in our last call, the semiconductor chip shortage was the primary driver of the division's temporary decline. Encouragingly, underlying demand remains strong as measured by healthy orders and a growing backlog. As we have seen during the last 2 years, as COVID testing rises, elective annual exams, screenings and GYN surgical procedures are often postponed. And as COVID testing declines, we see the opposite and our base business returns. We believe what the latest rebound also makes clear is that demand for our products remains strong despite the unpredictability of COVID surges. We are confident in our business, confident in our people, and excited about our positioning heading into the third quarter. For example, in Diagnostics, we placed an additional 123 Panthers in the second quarter, surpassing first quarter placements of 119. Only halfway through the year, we have again exceeded our pre-pandemic average of roughly 225 Panther placements per year. This is a phenomenal result given the rapid global expansion of our Panther installed base during the pandemic. Our Panther installed base is now over 3,100 instruments worldwide with over 45% placed internationally. Also in Diagnostics, our vaginitis panel, BV CV/TV continues its growth trajectory. In our Q2 of 2021, this assay generated about $7 million for the quarter. 1 year later, the panel contributed almost $14 million in worldwide sales, nearly double the year before. And BV CV/TV is now on pace to become a top three women's health assay in our molecular diagnostics portfolio. Now, let's provide an update on chip supply and Breast Health. Our supply chain service and commercial organizations have been working hard to gain greater visibility and mitigate the impact of the shortage. In Q2, the impact is slightly less than estimated driven by favorable availability and precise management of chips and circulation within our service inventory. While our teams continue to do a great job navigating the unpredictable supply challenges on chips, the ongoing volatility of supply makes it possible that up to $50 million an additional headwind could surface in the back half of the year. Despite this, we are still materially increasing guidance for the full company, which Karleen will speak to later on. To finish the chip discussion on an upbeat note, we recently received notice of an increased allocation of chips for late in fiscal 2022. While this is very encouraging, given production and delivery timing, the benefit from this increase is unlikely to help revenue until early 2023. Said another way, we are optimistic the back half of our fiscal \u201822 will prove to be the low watermark in terms of available gantries. Moving on to an update on acquisitions, turning organic. In our fiscal third quarter, contributions from both Biotheranostics and Diagenode will be included in the organic growth of our Diagnostics division. We will provide an update on both today. First, Biotheranostics. As a reminder, we completed this acquisition in February of 2021. The goal of this acquisition was to enter the high growth lab-based oncology market, an adjacent longtime area of interest and bring our resources and expertise to create an even stronger business. Based on Breast Cancer Index's earlier than anticipated inclusion in NCCN guidelines in January of 2021, the deal is off to a great start. Last year in its first full quarter post-acquisition, Biotheranostics posted $13 million of revenue, which was more than 30% higher than their best quarter prior to the pandemic. Fast-forward to our most recent quarter, Biotheranostics generated $16.4 million in revenue. This early success comes as a result of outstanding engagement in a successful cross-functional cross-enterprise integration. As planned, we deployed Hologic resources and expertise and paired this with legacy Biotheranostics capabilities, to refine operational efficiency, and most importantly, set a solid foundation for scalable growth. To accelerate Biotheranostics already strong growth, as an example, we are streamlining the businesses ordering process, which we believe will simplify things for the customer. We expect this enhancement will greatly improve the customer experience and ultimately result in more orders. We are also excited to share that we are in the process of transferring Biotheranostics operations to our diagnostics headquarters in San Diego. While maintaining required division between CLIA and IVD activities, we believe the move will lead to an even more unified culture, stronger relationships between counterparts and more collaborative efforts. Finally and even more encouraging, just last week, the Biotheranostics BCI test was included in the American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, another major step towards increasing utilization and recognition of BCI as the standard of care. BCI is now the only genomic test in both NCCN and ASCO guidelines, for predicting benefit of extended endocrine therapy. Moving on. Shortly after we closed the Biotheranostics transaction, we acquired Diagenode based in Belgium. The goal of the acquisition was to accelerate PCR-based assay development for our Panther Fusion and leverage additional R&D capabilities in Europe. So far, we have checked both boxes. Since the close of the acquisition, as planned, we have integrated the Diagenode organization to optimize the speed and efficiency of our global R&D organization, enabling more effective and more efficient cross-border innovation. To-date, teams from San Diego and Belgium have worked together closely to improve processes and clearly define a robust product development pipeline. The team is already making meaningful progress towards approval of two viral load assays, which will expand our urology portfolio in the transplant testing space. Overall, for both Biotheranostics and Diagenode, we are pleased with the integration and progress of these two businesses. As we look forward, we are excited by the opportunity to unlock more synergies from both and in turn, create more value for our shareholders. Shifting gears, I'd like to close by highlighting two very meaningful and opportunistic marketing efforts from our second quarter. The first being our Super Bowl commercial, which also ran during the Winter Olympics and the second, our title sponsorship of the Women's Tennis Association Tour. As many of you may have seen, our television commercial titled, Her Health is Her Wealth, featured Mary J. Blige. The commercial highlighted that despite her busy life, she makes time in her schedule for her annual health exams. The campaign came at a critical time as an alarming number of women, missed annual breast and cervical cancer screenings during the COVID-19 pandemic. In January, the inaugural results of our Hologic Global Women's Health Index found that nearly 50% of women ages 16 to 54 had not seen a medical professional in the prior year. The purpose of our message was to encourage women to schedule their annual exams and prioritize their health. Detecting cancer early is critical and can often make the difference between a curable and non-curable prognosis. After 2 years of the pandemic, with too many women not being screened and our unique relationship with Mary J. Blige, there was no better time and no better stage for us to encourage more women to see their doctors. Our second effort is our landmark title sponsorship of the WTA Tour announced in early March. This alliance was forced to make significant progress on our shared vision of greater wellness and equality for women. The partnership has global reach and will emphasize the importance of preventive care through well-woman visits. We are proud to stand with the WTA as we work together to jointly raise the profile of women and share the importance of early detection and treatment. Before turning the call over to Karleen, let me conclude by saying that the results of this quarter demonstrate our business is both durable and resilient and the demand for our products is exceptionally strong. Despite multiple macro headwinds, we continue to deliver strong results. We are both excited and confident in our business and see great opportunity to be even stronger in the years ahead. With that, let me turn the call over to Karleen. Hi, Jack. And I think the reps feel that. Yes, Jack. And by the way, I'd also clarify that we're not going to use the cash on the balance sheet to buy the Eagles. I know you, but... Yes, exactly. So in terms of our relationship with the National Labs, I probably couldn't be more proud of our teams. And even we've always had good relationships, but when you think about the way we responded. And particularly, if you look at the two big major labs in the United States, but even a number of the other big ones right below the top two. When they were really under the gun and you think back to the April, May, June time frame of 2020, when the evening news around the world \u2013 around the country was always about the 8-day turnaround times for PCR tests and all of the problems with molecular testing. And that's when we dispatched and our team went around the clock to put Panthers in all over the place. And we really worked so well to help those \u2013 both of those customers dramatically reduce the turnaround times. And I think we've used both the relationship in coming to their aid during that time as well as, frankly, I think they increasingly understand that we're building markets. When it comes to how we approach the women's health market, we're also working the reimbursements. We're working the physician recommendations. We're working the guideline developments. And all of that is helping to grow the market, which, by definition, is growing them. So I would tell you, I feel like it's more of a partnership that is valued than just a traditional vendor/vendee relationship. And I think our teams have worked so hard to have many good relationships throughout all levels, both operationally within the marketing teams, and we like where we're positioned. We really do. Great. Thanks, Jack. I think, Vijay, part of it on the Surgical business is probably as some of the hospitals came back up post Omicron. They tended to prioritize some of the cardiovascular procedures and some of the more immediate procedures, whereas our GYN surge is viewed as a little more elective. So I think there was a little bit of that probably in the quarter that we think shakes out completely over time as the women's health issues come back. And I think our base molecular diagnostics business was up 7%, not too shabby in a period where a lot of our machines ended up running a lot of additional COVID tests, so nothing that we are concerned about. And I think as we continue to look all of these quarters, there is variability in the puts and takes, and we keep managing our business overall that as one part goes up. The reality is we do see trade-offs we did sell $584 million of COVID in the quarter. There is a bit of a trade-off on our base business with that. So as that goes back, I think we're very optimistic about where the base business comes here as that COVID testing really does probably really some side here. And Vijay, back to even building on the comment on the base business, I'd remind you in a couple of simple things here. We've not only passed through the full beat on top line and bottom line through the balance of the year. So the second half is every bit as intact as what it was prior, despite more headwinds. All of which should underscore the confidence that we have in our base business. And to Karleen's point, that is \u2013 the fourth quarter is not the ongoing run rate. Yes. I think the biggest thought we should leave you with is we are comfortable being patient right now. Just because we have a very strong amount of cash on the balance sheet doesn't mean we feel pressure to go do it in the next quarter or two quarters. We know that deals will present themselves in the quarters or years ahead. And I was showing Karleen our old headline from the late \u201808 timeframe at Stryker, where we were sitting on a pile of cash. And at the time, I was being criticized for being too conservative, and opportunities presented themselves over the next few years. And I think we feel very confident and frankly, should feel great in an uncertain world to be sitting with the balance sheet that we have relative to what we had 8 years or 10 years ago in this company. And it just gives us the ability to be patient and therefore, make great deals and continue to do a combination, some buybacks, but we still ultimately are looking and think there will be some good deals that will present themselves. And we are not going to get into the specific size. But obviously, we have got a fair amount on the balance sheet right now, and it doesn't mean we are ready to go below it all at once or anything else. I think we have been showing over the last 5 years or so, we are being very disciplined in and rigorous. Yes. The placements are really going for both COVID and new business. I think the magic for us is we have been able to expose Panther to so many new customers around the world. And they have seen the benefits both in COVID and it's also given us the chance to talk about the menu and the expanded menu. So, we are really getting them on both fronts. And I think every time we start to see customers getting ready to port some of the newer assays onto their machines, we have yet another spike. And candidly, we would have expected more base business growth this quarter. And then low and behold, we did another 28.5 million COVID tests. As a reminder, that's as much as we were doing practically globally, more than what we were doing globally pre-pandemic on all of our businesses combined. So, it's \u2013 I think people have become old to the numbers, but that has an impact in terms of our customers being able to adopt the other parts of the menu when again, they just got thrown back into huge testing. Now, I think as it plays out here in the coming quarters, we are assuming a much stronger and prolonged ramp down here in the COVID testing. That's going to really, we believe, allow the underlying strength of our core menu to start to shine through, and you will start to see it in these quarters. I think we see opportunities again over time to more directly influence the size of those markets and everything else. So, I think what we do see in the near-term is the ability with a lot of the additional Panthers we have placed to have more menu running through them. And then the second piece would be really helping to grow those markets more significantly over time. So, I think we feel very encouraged short-term from all the placements and longer term because of the strength that we have put in our teams. And frankly, the additional access we have gotten to a lot of the health ministers of the world through both COVID time as well as the Hologic Global Women's Health Index to, I think start to get women's health moved up the priority list, where we will be able to get more screening guidelines and things to put in place in the coming years, particularly in Western Europe. Yes. We will see where that all plays out. We are always very, very cognizant. But I think as we continue to think about how women are going to get these tests and the doctors and the reimbursements and everything else, I think we continue to feel very good about our position. Yes. Nor would we want to pull it forward quite harshly. I think what we love about that business is, it's stable and candidly we have got all the additional COVID revenue this year. What we are really looking forward to is, people will start to see the underlying strength of our base businesses in 2023. And the last thing we would want to do is mortgage some of that. Yes. Many do, but they are still largely used differently. A lot of the bench-top stuff is really for symptomatic and especially respiratory or other symptomatic stuff, whereas ours is largely asymptomatic and ongoing screening. So, I think this is going to be a question of and not or. And there is going to be meaningful opportunities on all fronts. I do think we are very well positioned and feel great about where we are with the Panther placements. So, I think we are very confident you are going to continue to see that, and that will unfold even more as the COVID revenue goes away. Yes. In terms of the base business, that's the \u2013 Joe, it's really around having the time to get the new assays up and running on the Panther within each hospital in each lab. But I would tell you, just from having \u2013 we are in our strategic plan process right now where we have been sitting down both with the U.S. diagnostics team, but also our international teams. And as we look at the optimism that they have for the underlying growth rates of our molecular business for the next few years, it gets pretty exciting. So, we are not ready to give guidance or anything on that front. But I think there is just the additional placements and the additional opportunities. And don't underestimate in a world where labor constraints and labor costs have become a huge issue. I think people are forgetting one of the massive benefits of the Panther is the workflow automation, the random batch access. This is the pen caps that we have. This is a remarkably efficient system that we think is only \u2013 and that's part of what the customers are seeing and looking forward to the future. So, I think it's going to bode very well for us. Very. It's a long-term thing. Obviously, we did not anticipate the chip shortage. And having said that, you know what, think about what those growth rates are going to be when we index against these quarters, next year. But even on a long-term basis, I think we feel very, very good about what the growth rates of our base businesses will probably be doing over the next couple of years. We have got a couple of punky quarters here right ahead of us to finish a year that's already a very strong year. And its growth rates as we start to look into \u201823, probably looking pretty good. Yes. I almost don't even want to go there, Derik, is the quarterly swing who knows where it all goes, and I think we are poised either way. But I would put in a de minimis number for 2024, and yet I think we will certainly expect some volumes to continue to be there. So, probably not a horrible estimate, but we are nowhere near being able to give guidance. Yes. I think it starts with always having a superior product. And we have not gotten where we have gotten from a market share standpoint, particularly in mammography and especially in 3D without having a superior product. And I think \u2013 and also superior workflow throughout the whole gamut. And I think hospitals are seeing what we bring to them in a critically important area. To your second point, I will say, we are not of the high ticket items in a grand scheme, a hospital recapitalizing a few rooms in mammography or even several suites is nowhere near the magnitude of some of the bigger iron, the massive, whether it's robots or MRIs and those kinds of things. So, I think it does allow us to kind of be in a sweet spot where even if there is a little bit of capital contraction that we think we will be fine there. And I think our team is feeling very, very good. Alright. Thank you. It sounds like it, operator. Lauren?"

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon and welcome to the Hologic's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Ron and I am your operator for today's call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute. I would now like to introduce Ryan Simon, Vice President, Investor Relations to begin the call.\nRyan Simon: Thank you, Ron. Good afternoon and thank you for joining Hologic's first quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer. Our first quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website along with an updated corporate presentation. We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. And a replay of this call will be available through March 4. Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that certain statements we make today will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor statement included in our earnings release and SEC filings. Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. One of these non-GAAP measures is organic revenue, which we define as constant currency revenue excluding the divested Blood Screening business and revenue from acquired businesses owned by Hologic for less than one year. Finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis and revenue growth rates will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO.\nStephen MacMillan: Thank you, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Once again, our results are strong. We are off to a great start in all divisions with diagnostics, breast and skeletal health and surgical each delivering more than 8% global organic growth, excluding COVID revenue. For the quarter, revenue was $1.47 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.17. Both numbers significantly exceeded the high-end of our guidance by 28% on the top-line, and 74% on the bottom. Over the last several quarters. And most recently at the JPMorgan conference, we've been communicating three major themes. First, our base business is stronger, with more diverse growth drivers than ever before. Second, as the COVID pandemic remains, we continue to help meet the world's testing needs and generate financial upside. And third, because of the first two points, we are well positioned to generate strong results regardless of how various uncertainties evolve from the pandemic, to supply chain challenges to health care utilization. In other words, you can count on us to deliver in today's uncertain business environment. These themes are certainly playing out as we look at our first quarter results and our dramatically improved outlook for the fiscal year. Our base businesses are performing well. And we are making a massive difference against COVID. As a result, we are raising our revenue and earnings guidance significantly as we expect upside from COVID-19 testing, along with strength in our diagnostics and surgical businesses to more than compensate for temporary supply chain challenges that have emerged in our breast health business. As we shared at JPMorgan, we are a fundamentally different company than eight years ago. Now more than ever before, Hologic has more diverse and higher margin recurring revenue across each division in each geography around the world. Our strong performance is result of execution against our strategic plan and has been accelerated by our financial success during the pandemic. As evidenced by our Q1 results, we are well positioned for long term sustainable growth, regardless of the direction the pandemic may turn. While we can't predict the future path of COVID, we'd like to expand today on what we do know that Hologic is emerging from this pandemic a much stronger company. More specifically, we will focus on what we know in each division. It gives us clear confidence in our ability to maintain sustained growth over the long-term. First, in our diagnostics division, we know that our huge industry leading installed base of automated high throughput Panther systems, along with our robust menu of 19 assays across Panther and Panther fusion, will drive strong growth well into the future. Today, our Panther installed base is over 3000 units 75% larger than prior to the pandemic, with almost half of these placed internationally. Of note, demand for our Panthers is still strong globally. We placed well over 100 Panthers in the first quarter alone, more than double our pace prior to the pandemic. At this stage in the pandemic, this clearly indicates the customers expect to use these systems for non-COVID testing. Utilization of our Panther systems is also strong. We are seeing clear signs that customers are leveraging our menu of 19 assays on our significantly expanded Panther footprint. First and foremost, the growth of molecular diagnostic sales reflect this growing utilization. For Q1, our core molecular diagnostics franchise grew 14% worldwide, excluding COVID revenues, product discontinuations, as well as recent M&A activity. Now, we know a question on some people's minds is, will these Panthers be used post pandemic? The answer is an emphatic yes, based on the following. First, nearly 90% of U.S. COVID customers are already running at least one other assay. This speaks to our customers being bonafide molecular diagnostics players who are invested in molecular testing for the long haul, and who we expect will adopt more of our assays over time. And second, the incredible automation and workflow simplicity of the Panther, which dramatically minimizes labor activity and costs. In a labor restricted world, our customers realize the enormous advantage of our Panther system. Extending and broadening the adoption of our portfolio of assays is a fundamental element of the diagnostic growth strategy. Our sales teams have done a tremendous job winning strategic accounts, strengthening our relationship with customers, and fueling our razor, razor blade business model with both legacy women's health tests and new assays. As an example, leveraging our leadership in women's health, our vaginitis panel is off to a great start with $13 million of revenue in the first quarter, roughly 2.5x the first quarter of 2021. We are extremely proud of the panel success and believe this will be our most successful diagnostic launch ever COVID aside. In Q1, we also once again responded to our customers COVID testing needs and generated significant financial upside. We posted $523 million in COVID assay sales, over $300 million more than our outlook and consensus. Clearly COVID is sticking around longer than anyone would like. And just as clearly, highly accurate molecular testing continues to play a major role in fighting the pandemic. We continue to believe COVID testing will contribute materially to our business for the foreseeable future. And we remain prepared to meet ongoing demand globally. Second, shifting to our breast and skeletal health business. We know that broadening across the continuum of breast health care from screening and diagnosis through surgery and treatment has transformed this franchise from a once capital dependent business to a division with more diverse, higher growth recurring revenue. In the first quarter, the breast health business grew 8.4% As we've maintained our high market share, and continued to grow our installed base of Genius 3D Mammography systems. The attachment rate of service on this gantry base continues to remain strong at more than 80%, making service one of our largest top line contributors company wide. And we continue to upgrade our installed base with high margin software and AI. So mammography capital business is and will continue to be a meaningful and foundational part of our breast business going forward. In addition, we built a solid adjacent portfolio of more recurring interventional breast surgery products that is driving the growth of the division. These interventional products include markers, needles, including those used in our Brevera biopsy system, and handheld devices. Sales are more recurring in nature, with higher projected growth compared to the legacy capital business As points of reference, today, the gantry business is only 23% of breast health revenue compared to 29% in 2014, and interventional sales have grown to roughly the same size as gantry revenue. We expect the interventional business to continue its growth and further transform our breast and skeletal division going forward. The increasing diversity of our breast business will help us offset supply chain challenges that have emerged recently, specifically shortages of computer chips in our mammography and other imaging systems. Our updated guidance incorporates a temporary but meaningful revenue headwind for the balance of our fiscal year. Despite this, as Karleen will discuss, we are raising our revenue and EPS guidance significantly based on outperformance in COVID, core molecular and surgical. Now, shifting gears to surgical, we know that the diversification of the business will drive growth. Despite pandemic headwinds, the division grew 8.2% In the first quarter, and we continue to solidify our market leading positions for NovaSure and MyoSure. With the addition of the Acessa procedure and the close of the Bolder acquisition in late November, our surgical business has a very different profile today, with more growth engines than ever. Acessa of revenue in Q1 was nearly three times a year ago and the Bolder integration is off to a great start. As we are already seeing Bolder sales through the Hologic surgical sales team. The recent launch of NovaSure version five, developed in-house is also seeing good traction. It's early days, but we are seeing a lot of excitement in the field around this product. We are committed to maintaining our leadership position in this space with best-in-class products. Further, the Fluent Fluid Management System, also developed in-house is used to streamline the complexities of fluid management in hysteroscopic procedures. Fluent is another great example of organic innovation, driving future growth. Fourth and finally, we know that our international business will be a consistent contributor of growth for years to come. We are no longer the export business of prior years. Through organic growth, and M&A, we are direct in more regions than ever before, especially in breast health, with our feet firmly on the street and engaged with customers. In Q1, the international business achieved nearly 13% organic growth, excluding COVID. And we expect strong growth to continue. With the leaders we have in place today. We are confident the foundation we've laid and the progress we've made will yield strong results for many years to come. To add additional perspective, there are over 3.9 billion women in the world with only about 170 million of them in the United States, which is our largest market today. Clearly, we have an opportunity to impact more lives and more women around the world. Through our groundbreaking initiatives, like the Hologic Global Women's Health Index, in conjunction with the opportunity we've earned as leaders in the fight against COVID, we are connecting with world leaders and changemakers to elevate Women's Health around the world. In summary, our first quarter results and improved outlook demonstrate the Hologic is a much different and much stronger business than ever before. Stronger through diversification and stronger from our leadership in COVID molecular testing. These factors are generating exceptional cash flows and a pristine balance sheet that are especially valuable in the midst of uncertain market conditions. As we've done for the duration of this pandemic, we are confident in our ability to manage our business through various uncertainties and continue to deliver strong growth regardless of how external conditions evolve. What is clear to us at Hologic is that we are poised to continue our strong growth, whether COVID wanes or continues, we have fundamentally changed our business into one with more growth drivers and more recurring revenue across all geographies. This gives us the clear confidence that we can navigate change and continue to generate exceptional financial results. With that, let me turn the call over to Karleen.\nKarleen Oberton: Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to share first quarter results that are significantly exceeded our guidance on both the top-line and bottom-line. Our first quarter highlights an improving based business that grew 9% organically excluding COVID-19 revenues. As Steve mentioned, our diversified business model is paying off. Each of our franchises excluding COVID grew more than 8% in the quarter, broadly exceeding our long-term revenue growth target of 5% to 7%. It is also important to note that our base business strength occurred in a quarter that started with the Delta wave and ended with COVID cases surging due to Omicron. Total revenues for the quarter of 1.47 billion showcased strength in every business and was significantly ahead of our previous guidance. EPS of $2.17 in the first quarter, far surpassed our initial guidance range of $1.15 to $1.25. We also continued to generate healthy free cash flow, funding our capital deployment priorities of tuck in M&A and share repurchases. We believe our balance sheet is a significant advantage in times of market uncertainty, which I'll touch on shortly. Before I do that, let me provide some detail on our divisional revenue results. Like clarity on our performance, I will exclude the impact of COVID-19 where applicable. In diagnostics, global revenue of $950.4 million declined 15.2% compared to the prior year. However, excluding COVID assay sales related ancillary items in a small level of discontinued products, worldwide diagnostics revenue increased just over 10%. To better understand the underlying performance of our non-COVID molecular business, I will again exclude COVID-19 benefits. By doing this base molecular revenue grew about 14% organically in the first quarter. The growth was run by strong execution across our global portfolio as our largest non-COVID assay. chlamydia, gonorrhea was above pre-pandemic levels. Our newer vaginitis panel contributed well ahead of last year's run rate. And internationally, we continued to see strong demand for our Panther instrumentation, Our perspective, our annual molecular business excluding COVID, is now more than $100 million larger than before the pandemic. As it relates to our COVID-19 results, we continue to forecast conservatively, but act aggressively behind the scenes to meet demand for our customers. In the quarter, we generated $523 million of COVID assay revenue and shipped about 26 million tests to our customers. The United States represented about 60% of total COVID assay revenue, although demand was high around the world. Rounding out diagnostics, cytology and perinatal grew 5% compared to the prior year, a nice result that was also above 2019 levels. In breast health, global revenue of $359.3 million grew more than 8%. This growth was driven by our interventional business. As Steve highlighted which was up nearly 20% in the quarter. Breast imaging and service also increased mid-single digits in the period, underscoring resilience in the face of COVID headwinds. Our strategy to diversify and increase recurring revenue continues to pay off. In surgical, first quarter revenue of 134.3 million grew 8%. This solid performance was driven by a nice rebound in NovaSure from the launch of our next generation B5 system as well as momentum from new products such as Fluent and Acessa. While our surgical business was impacted by pullbacks in elective procedures, the impact was minimal in the quarter. We continued to stay close to our customers monitoring the Omicron surge in related staffing issues, which we do expect to be a headwind in Q2. Lastly, our skeletal business had revenue of $27.1 million increased 10% compared to the prior year period. Now let's move on to the rest of the P&L for the first quarter. Gross margin of 72.1% significantly beat our forecast, driven by higher than expected COVID-19 test volumes in the period. Total operating expenses of 333.9 million increased 22% in the first quarter, but we're down 5% sequentially compared to Q4. We continue to reinvest for future growth with incremental spending and R&D and marketing, pulling forward initiatives given the benefit from COVID-19. Further within our operating expenses, the inclusion of recent acquisitions accounted for a spend of approximately $30 million in Q1. And we also made additional charitable donations in the quarter. Finally, our non-GAAP tax rate in Q1 is 21.5% as expected. Putting these pieces together operating margin came in well above our forecast at 49.4% and net margin was a very strong 37.7%. Non-GAAP net income finished at 554.7 million and non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.17, nearly 75% above the top end of our prior guidance. Moving on cash flow from operations was $564 million in the first quarter, a very strong result, which was more than 100% of non-GAAP net income. These robust cash flows continue to give us tremendous financial and strategic flexibility. For example, in the quarter we repurchased 2.3 million shares of our stock for $167 million and closed the acquisition of Bolder Surgical for $160 million. We continued to evaluate M&A that strategically fits well within our existing sales channels, or the narrow adjacency. Based on our strong operational performance, we had 1.4 billion of cash on our balance sheet at the end of the first quarter. And our leverage ratio was 0.6x. Our capital structure is as strong as it has ever been. And we intend to deploy our excess cash on division led acquisitions, as well as share repurchases that improved our top and bottom-line growth rates. For example, we have been buying shares under our 10b5-1 plan within our second fiscal quarter to take advantages of market volatility. Finally, ROIC was 29.4% on a trailing 12-month basis, an increase of 270 basis points compared to the prior year. Before we discuss our increased guidance for the second quarter and full year fiscal 2022, I want to mention a few key points. Although the pandemic remains highly uncertain, we believe we are well positioned either way it may turn. To there be future outbreaks, we will meet our customers need and generate additional COVID testing revenue. Or should the pandemic subside, we expect strong performance in our base businesses. We believe we are nicely hedged against macro and market volatility. As it relates to supply chain headwinds, these challenges have become more specific in recent weeks. Due to the lack of available chips, we expect a temporary shortage of supply that will lengthen delivery timelines for mammography capital in our breast health division. While we hope to mitigate these effects, for conservatism we are estimating around $200 million of revenue will be pushed out of fiscal 2022. This includes up to $50 million headwind in our second quarter, as we are proactively beginning to extend lead times of new units to preserve inventory and maintain service continuity for gantries already in the field. This headwind is purely a supply issue and not one of underlying demand which remain strong. Despite the supply shortage, we are significantly increasing our full year revenue outlook underscoring the evolution of our diversified business model. We expect our diagnostics and surgical businesses along with COVID contributions to more than offset mammography headwinds. Now, let me move on to our specific guidance. In the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect very strong financial results again, with total revenue in the range of 1.25 billion to 1.3 billion. As a reminder, our Q2 revenue is usually seasonally lower than Q1. For all of fiscal 2022, we expect total revenue in the range of 4.4 billion to 4.55 billion, significantly exceeding our prior full year guidance by $600 million at the midpoint. Given the recent strength of the U.S. dollar into aid with constant currency modeling, we are assuming foreign exchange headwinds of approximately $23 million in the second quarter of 2022 and $56 million for the full year. In diagnostics and molecular continues to be the growth engine based on our larger Panther installed base of over 3000 instruments globally. Further, we are seeing encouraging uptake of new assays like our Vaginitis panel, as well as tremendous international expansion opportunities and a rebound in our core STI assays. As a result for fiscal 2022, we expect our base diagnostics franchise inclusive of cytology and perinatal to grow high single digits. In breast health, our organic and inorganic investments continued to perform well. For example, Brevera is off to a great start in 2022, growing in the high teens for the quarter. Further, recurring service revenue represents approximately 40% of total sales in Q1. Finally, in surgical we expect MyoSure to continue to drive growth, with help from better NovaSure performance. In addition, we expect new products and the recent acquisitions of Acessa and Bolder to add momentum to an already fast growing franchise. Like base diagnostics, we expect surgical to grow above our long-term organic guidance for fiscal 2022. In terms of COVID assay sales, the only certainty is that no one really knows how demand will progress for the rest of the year. Therefore, as we have done for the past several quarters, we are forecasting conservatively and will act aggressively. With that in mind, we expect COVID assay sales to be at least $400 million in the second quarter of 2022. And at least $1 billion for the full year. COVID-related items, including revenue from discontinued products and diagnostics, are expected to be approximately $50 million in the second quarter and $190 million for the full year. As a reminder, our organic guidance backs out of revenue from acquisitions until the first full quarter after the deals annualize as well as revenue from our divested blood screening business. We expect blood screening revenue of $5 million to $6 million in Q2, and $20 million to $25 million for the full year. In total, we are backing out roughly $110 million of inorganic revenues for the year. To appreciate the underlying growth of our business, it is important to back out of organic revenue COVID assay sales, related ancillary items and a small amount of discontinued product revenue and diagnostics. On this measure and excluding the previously mentioned supply chain headwinds in breast health, we expect the rest of Hologic to grow at least at the high-end of our 5% to 7% long-term guidance. Moving down the P&L, for the full year we forecast our gross margin percentages in the mid 60s and our operating margin percentage to be in the mid to high 30s. Both estimates are higher than our guidance last quarter. We expect both percentages to decline sequentially throughout the year, consistent with our conservative planning that most COVID demand will occur in the first half. In addition, we have incorporated additional inflationary supply chain costs into our guidance as it relates to electronics, plastics and logistics. Despite this, for the full year, both gross and operating margin should be well above pre-pandemic levels. In terms of operating expenses, we expect spending to be up compared to 2021, but declined sequentially in the back half of the year. As we've continued to highlight in quarters with higher COVID testing revenue, we will take the opportunity to invest more for future growth. Below operating income, we expect other expenses net to be a little less than $25 million a quarter for the remainder of the year. Our guidance is based on an effective tax rate of 21.5% and diluted shares outstanding of around 256 million for the full year. All this nets out to expected EPS of $1.50 to $1.60 in the second quarter well above current consensus estimates and $4.90 to $5.20 for the full year, 36% above our prior guidance at the midpoint. As you update your forecast, let me remind you that macro uncertainty due to the pandemic and related supply chain challenge is still high. We would therefore encourage you to model at the middle of our ranges, which incorporate both potential upsides and downsides. Let me wrap up by saying that Hologic posted very strong first quarter results that far exceeded expectations and guidance. We are also significantly raising our financial guidance for the year, highlighting the multiple growth drivers we have added to each of our franchises in the upside to our business from capturing demand for COVID testing. With organic investments, multiple acquisitions and additional financial flexibility for capital deployment, we are a much stronger company than two years ago, and well positioned to prosper in the face of various uncertainties. With that, I will ask the operator to open the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow up, then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take the first question from the line of Dan Leonard with Wells Fargo.\nDan Leonard: My first question on capital deployment. Could you elaborate or offer a bit more color on how aggressive you plan to be on the capital deployment front as cash builds on the balance sheet?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. I think what we've talked about is, managing our free cash flow that we want to fully deploy our annual free cash flow between tuck in M&A and share repurchase. But having said that, Dan, we obviously will continue to be disciplined as it relates to tuck in M&A that would be the priority. So we might let some cash build on the balance sheet while again, disciplined and looking for the right deal.\nDan Leonard: And then, an unrelated follow up, have your views on endemic COVID testing needs evolved at all?\nStephen Macmillan: We believe COVID will be endemic. And we believe there will be ongoing molecular testing and probably feel even stronger about it than ever. Right? If you go back two years ago, none of us would have imagined we'd be having the amount of testing going on now. And at the end of the day, I think most governments and most people around the world have realized while there's antigen testing out there for true population health and frankly, to truly capture what's going on molecular is the answer. And I think we feel better and better. That's going to be an ongoing part of our business for many, many years. It's a virus, it mutates. And Omicron is not the last mutation of this thing. And I think we feel that we're well poised.\nOperator: We'll take the next question from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.\nVijay Kumar: Just one on the supply chain that you brought up, Steve. What I guess is this on the breast health segment or which segment is this impacting? I'm curious what, we've been hearing this from other companies. I feel like when we had the guidance three months ago, right, things weren't as bad and now the things changed in the last three months. And what's been the base guidance reduction because of the supply chain impact, because I do feel like other parts of the base business are coming in better. So maybe if you could just talk about if the gross impact from supply chain was 200 million of revenue push out? How much of that was offset by better base performance?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. Certainly, some of it is, as we've highlighted with both surgical and diagnostics-based businesses, strengthening. Just as we've forecasted, COVID, conservatively, we want to put that out there. You don't have to anybody that's looked around at supply chain issues, the semiconductor and chip issues have not gotten better. And we're not totally sure exactly when that will fully work its way out. We're lengthening lead times, for our deliveries, and it's all in the breast health primarily in the gantry business. And we've got obviously maintained some chips for service. So, we're being conservative and taking care of our existing customers. And we'll lengthen and, frankly, it'll make next year probably look better. And it's great, we can absorb this, what I call annoyance right now, when the rest of the businesses are firing.\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. I would just build on that, Vijay is that, I think what we have here in Q2 is, we have inventory to cover that 50 million of revenue shortfall. But we're actively allocating to Steve's point to service because that's the most important thing is that we've got Inventory to keep that installed base up and running so that women can get back to screening.\nVijay Kumar: Understood. And then maybe one follow-up, I think the prior guidance had 150 million contribution from M&A, did that change Karlene and Steve, I think you mentioned something about 90% of U.S. Panther customers, are they using an additional assay. Maybe talk about what kind of assays are they using? Are these CTGC high volume? What kind of revenue pull through can we expect in a post pandemic given the higher install base?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes, yes. So I think on the total revenue from acquisitions in 2022, is roughly 170 million. And then we talked about the inorganic piece that we're pulling out $110 million. And I think you went to another question there on the assays, I think, certainly, the STI assays are our biggest asset. So I would say that a lot of customers, that would be primarily what they're running.\nOperator: And we'll now take the next question from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron Research.\nJack Meehan: Wanted to maybe continue on that path. Steve, your comment around the vaginitis panel feel like it's a pretty big statement to say, you think it could become your most successful launch outside of COVID? If memory serves me, right, I'm pretty sure chlamydia, gonorrhea is over $300 million business for you. So maybe just talk about the adoption you're seeing, like, what you think the ramp looks like for revenue?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. I think clearly, it's taken us a long time to get chlamydia, gonorrhea up into that into that multi 100 million range. But I think we feel really, this is going to be over years. But I think we're feeling pretty good about that ramp, you figure if we just did 13 million in the first quarter, multiply that by four and you've got the very bare minimum of, I think what we expect to do this year. So they'll probably continue to build through the quarters. And I think if we fast forward a few years from now, certainly goes north of 100 now its way to 200.\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. And I think, again, when we talk about the launch, I think for comparison, Jack and think about the [trick] [ph] assay took about five to six years to get to that 70 million, and we're getting close to that here, only a couple years out. So that's kind of the success of the launch that I want to highlight.\nStephen MacMillan: It's a very meaningful indication, it's been completely under diagnosed and I think it's part of the rapid uptake. And it's really a great reason to go to the doctor. \nJack Meehan: Great. And then, also wanted to follow up just on the supply chain point. I'm looking at the -- in my model, the breast imaging product sales didn't look like you really had much of an impact in the fiscal first quarter. So is this something that really is just kind of picking up in the last few weeks, and 200 million in context seems pretty significant in light of that line item, so maybe just help put a little bit more color around that would be helpful.\nStephen MacMillan: Yes, it clearly has emerged here, we kept hoping we would find solutions. I've watched our operations team over the last couple of years. They've just been a Herculean first on MTUs and Tecan tips, swabs on, glass tubes on everything, we did the scale during COVID time to getting more Panthers out the door. And we were hearing a lot of the issues from our chip suppliers, but kept thinking we would find some alternatives and some solutions, and really is it's come down. At the end of the day, as you can see where we were able to call it manufacture additional plastic or find other things. In the COVID piece, we haven't been able to manufacture semiconductor chips and we're at the beck and call of the global supply chain here, where everybody's been tugging on it.  So as we've gotten into -- so yes, clearly, it didn't impact last quarter at all, it\u2019s technically not even hurting us in the very moment right now but it's as we go forth. And then, there's two pieces of right, one is, we could sell a lot more of the chips that we will have on allocation into new gantries. So we want to make sure that we keep every gantry that's out there up and running. So we're keeping a good chunk of the chips that will be coming for ongoing service. And if we were just trying to maximize short-term revenue, the hit wouldn't be nearly as big, but we want to make sure we're taking care of the service side. So definitely an annoyance, it's one and to your point, it's a fairly big number that we want to call out right now, in the midst of an overall thing. I think it does underscore how far we've come as a company, right? You think about that kind of a hit eight years ago would have been a big deal, even three or four years ago would have been a very sizable knockdown punch. And now it's kind of annoying little body blow that we know will work right through and set ourselves up to continue to win.\nOperator: We\u2019ll now take the next question from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi.\nPatrick Donnelly: Hey, thanks for taking the questions, guys. Steve, you touched a little bit on kind of the Panther outlook beyond COVID. Certainly the question we get most as well, kind of stretching beyond that is utilization is going to be the right number to look at anymore beyond this. How are you framing the right way to look at this business beyond COVID? Because, again, obviously, the installed base is far bigger. I think everyone tries to put a utilization number on it, how do you frame that view, kind of setting it up and looking at that business beyond COVID, or at least when COVID is endemic that's why?\nStephen MacMillan: Why we kind of think about in a real simplistic term Patrick, which is our total revenue that comes from it. And so, to that point, right, we're going to have over 3000 Panthers, clearly, the pure dollar volume will likely come down from what it was pre pandemic on a global basis, in the near term, because we've placed a whole bunch more internationally where we don't have quite as much revenue for Panther. And we've also gone to some smaller customers, where it will clearly pay off over time. So the way we think about it, I mean, ultimately comes down to number of Panthers, times the amount of revenue generated per Panther. And we see enormous upside to where that's going to go here over time. So many of the folks that have brought bought Panthers in the last year plus, or where we've installed Panthers, they keep wanting, they keep getting ready to put the regular assays on. And then, COVID spikes yet again, and so it's still out there. So we have so much pent-up volume, all those [torques] [ph] that were generated largely in 2020, 2021, are all still delayed, and it comes down to we just generated 14% growth in this quarter, even while COVID was surging. So I think it's hard to exactly model it, per se, but it's just going to come down to we're going to be selling a lot more assays on a lot more machines. And that's going to generate clearly accretive growth rates above the company average for a long time.\nKarleen Oberton: And just to add maybe a finer point to that even versus Q1 \u201819. That's basically like your business is up over 40% I mean, that's a tremendous growth over the past couple years.\nPatrick Donnelly: Sure. That's helpful, hard number to peck down for sure on the [go] [ph] through. Karleen, maybe one for you just on the margin setup. Obviously, you talked a bit about the supply chain stuff, I imagine that you're adding to some of the inflationary pressures. Can you just talk through kind of that core margin as we as we try to back COVID out a bit? How that sets up for the rest of the year? And again, any impact from some of the supply chain noise you're seeing there on breast?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes, certainly. Yes, the supply chain is both the revenue on breast and some of the higher cost as well, though, that we mentioned. I think absent of the revenue headwind, certainly that base business operating margins, if we had minimal COVID are still in that low 30%, that we were prior to the pandemic. So we continue to keep an eye on that. And I think, again, some of the strengths that we talked about are continue to contribute to that base business is still healthy on the operating margin line.\nOperator: We'll now take the next question from the line of Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley.\nTejas Savant: Just sort of following up on Patrick's second question there. Karleen, can you just give us your updated views on what is a good sort of blended ASP to use, given the U.S. versus OUS mix in the COVID testing side? And to what degree do you expect some of the investments you've made in commercial capabilities and operating leverage as well, to cushion the COVID testing margin over time as the mix evolves?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes, from an ASP perspective, certainly, pricing has held pretty nicely here, I think, roughly $20, with the overall average in the quarter, I think as we look forward, we do expect that pricing will come down, one as we renew international contracts, which are lower ASP, as well as in the U.S., when the higher -- when the public health emergency ends in this higher lower payment for the testing will probably come down. But still, we have a way to go on that pricing to come down to still have that revenue be accretive to the overall corporate average. And think about the overall business and margins, certainly our supply chain, folks, you annually have improvement targets that they go after that some of them even in this year of buffering some of the higher costs that we're seeing. We have network optimization opportunities that we're focused on. And certainly we've talked about investing internationally, intentionally, over the past several years, that we believe that international revenue continues to grow, we'll have more margin accretion from the international business.\nTejas Savant: Got it. And one for you, Steve, on the launch of the Panther tracks here in December. Can you sort of quantify the cost savings that some of your high throughput customers could see from the added automation here? And overtime do you expect us to drive an uptick in Panther sales in new accounts? Or is this more of a convenience for your current high throughput customers given some of the labor issues everybody's seeing at the moment?\nKarleenOberton: Yes, absolutely. We do think this would be a labor efficiency for our labs. This is something that there's a really long lead time to the track system, so 18 to 24 months. So we won't have any kind of data on actual cost savings for a couple of years. But this is something that we actually have partnered with our customers on, on the development of how it will work in the lab. And we're excited to officially launch it here.\nOperator: We will now take the next questions from the line of Brian Weinstein with William Blair.\nBrian Weinstein: So I guess let's talk a little bit about geographic performance. Did you continue to lean into that, and maybe you can be a little bit more specific about territories and products and kind of run through where you're seeing the strings? I recognize it's kind of across the board. But if there's anything that you would kind of call out there? And then, what maybe I missed a bit. Can you talk also about what the U.S. growth rate was? And I'll have a follow up after that. Thanks.\nStephen MacMillan: Yes, I think, overall, international, obviously, we said is a double-digit grower. And I think, we'd said years ago, we expected that international would become probably a double-digit grower for many, many years. And I think we're exactly into that. A lot of it candidly, Brian is really coming out of Western Europe, because that's where our biggest footprint is. And it's where we've placed a ton of the Panthers. We're starting to get certainly more of it out of out of Asia Pac as well. But the bigger chunk is really Western Europe, a little bit of Africa and I think continue to feel good. And overall, that the international growth rate is above the U.S rate.\nBrian Weinstein: Yes. Is there anything on kind of a product side? I mean, obviously diagnostics is, I'm guessing, driving that, but are any of the other kinds of businesses seeing significant acceleration OUS? That you'd want to call out there?\nStephen MacMillan: I think the magic is, it's actually largely across the board. Even our psychology business is actually doing well, particularly in a few key markets in Western Europe, the overall diagnostics as we've been placing those Panthers, I think you can go back really over three, four -- three or four years now, where the molecular business outside the U.S. is oftentimes been at 20-ish percent growth rate, and if anything, it's just going to be turbocharged here. Going forward, breast health has been very solid as well and even things like the SOMATEX acquisition we did in breast health, 15 months ago, whatever, a German-based company with some of the markers, it's helped put us on the on the map there. Surgicals picking up a little bit. So, there's no one -- I think the magic of it that makes us feel actually even better is, it's not like a one hit wonder. It's not one country, one geography, one product line, even one franchise is doing it. It's really a whole bunch of incremental things, just inexorably getting stronger. And then, that's what gives us more confidence for the future.\nOperator: We will now take the next question from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.\nCasey Woodring: This is Casey on for Tycho. Thanks for taking my questions. First one is on breast health. So how should we think about breast health margins given the shift towards recurring revenue now, the 23% of the business is gantries? How's that margin profile change alongside this mixed shift? And I guess in the near term, what sort of impact to margins is embedded in the 2022 numbers with lower gantry sales?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. So I think on the breast health business, if we think about operating margins, certainly the service business is accretive to the operating margins, which is the biggest part of revenue for that division, Then I would say, then there's probably equal contribution from gantries and interventional from an operating module perspective. Certainly, the headwind, the $200 million headwind is significant to that division. But, fortunately here, we were able to raise our full year guidance based on the performance of the rest of the business and the COVID contributions. So we can well manage this headwind and not have to do things like -- manage headcount or the other things. So preserve our great salesforce that we have our service engineers and still feel good about managing through this headwind.\nCasey Woodring: Got it. That's helpful. I was wondering if you can give us some updated test of record metrics in the molecular side. How did those trends in the last few quarters and how much of this x-COVID growth is coming from existing customers that are just reporting more of them menu over to Panther versus new customers? Thank you.\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. Casey, we think of the test record as an annual number. So to put it in perspective, prior to the pandemic, our largest year was 20 million, we did about 34 million in 2020, and about 40 million in 2021. And we expect that 2022 will be another number in that $30 million to $40 million range.\nOperator: We'll now take the next question from Derik De Bruin with BofA.\nDerik De Bruin: So actually, I just wanted to follow up on that last question. And just, look, you're placing enormously impressive number of Panthers at 100, this quarter, that was certainly more than I thought you would have. Just a little bit color on where your installs are, add-on servicing customers, greenfields, competitive replacements. And I guess where is, if you go back and look pre-pandemic and you look at the number of labs that were not doing molecular diagnostics, how is that sort of like overall -- in step of that overall market expanded, just try to get some script, this idea and just the continued pace of Panther placements in the market opportunity.\nStephen MacMillan: In terms of where they're going Derek. It's really again, it's very broad based, some are to existing customers and some might have three and they add a fourth. We've definitely got new customers as well, they're going into -- the hospitals are going into small labs, they're going into the big labs, they're going into some -- certainly some are new customers for us. And, therefore, whether it's a competitive win or just an expansion of that, labs business, we're certainly seeing that. And we do think, the overall focus on high throughput instruments is going to be a very good thing for us going forth. And we feel like that's where we've got a real winning edge, as you you've known Panther well.\nDerik De Bruin: Great. And then just one other question. As you're sort of like, the geographic mix shifts, how should we sort of think about the tax rate on the out years is there sort of [indiscernible], or it's still up in the air because of all the potential changes in tax laws that are being contemplated? Thank you.\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. Certainly hard to comment on the future tax rate when there's no real legislation really in place. And, as you know, the devils in the details on something like that. But certainly if the federal headline rate went up, our overall non-GAAP tax rate would go up. But I would tell you that, we certainly have an active tax department that is partnering with our operations team to put in efficiency strategies.\nOperator: We'll now take the next question from the line of Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG.\nRyan Zimmerman: Karleen, just on the COVID guidance, if I think back to your four number, originally, I think was around 200 million. We kind of assumed about 50 million a quarter. And now you guys are at a billion you did 500 and change this quarter? The pacing of that number, is it fair to assume, given the line and say you have that 300 million to 400 million can be done in this upcoming quarter? And we should think 50 and 50 in the back half of the year? Or are you thinking about the pace into those COVID sales a little differently than what I laid out?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes, Ryan. So as I said in my prepared remarks, we are assuming about a minimum of 400 million here in the second quarter. So that would lead to your mass of roughly 50 and 50 in the Q3 and Q4.\nRyan Zimmerman: Okay. I must have missed that. [Indiscernible]. And then, Steve, just on breast, you guys have moved downstream. And you're in much more surgery now than you were before. Obviously, mammography was kind of your beachhead when you think about the surgical options. And where you could go beyond your existing procedure categories. Is there room to go deeper? Is there room to go broader in surgery and breast? Curious kind of how you think about how rounded of a portfolio you have today, relative to where you want to take that?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. We're looking both ways actually, as we think about it, whether we -- obviously, we've done smaller build-ons in terms of the markers and Faxitron Focal, kind of the breast conserving surgery stuff. I think we see various different ways we can go and are really assessing what else we can be doing across the broad continuum of care. And particularly on the treatment side of breast, so more of that would be potential in organic, some of its organic and we continue to look at things that way. We have time for one more question.\nOperator: We'll take the next question from line of Puneet Souda with SVB Leerink.\nPuneet Souda: So maybe just one for me, obviously, great cash flow position that you have and existing cash position as well. So just, a frequent question in these times happens to be around valuation. And what appears to be somewhat of a disconnect between sort of the buyers and the sellers, given the sudden pullback in the public markets. So it seems like expectations have been normalized, so to speak in the public markets, but wondering if you're seeing anything different in the private market? Or if you're seeing just overall broadly, this disconnect to sort of normalize and how do you look at the -- sort of the current timing and evaluations out there? Thank you.\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. It's great question. Certainly when valuation is correct, you always have the sellers, kind of remembering the good old days that might have been and I think right now we feel we're in a great position. There's a lot of stuff that, we had every banker and we had a bunch of both privates and companies went public last year in our face that wanted us to buy them then. And we said to a lot of them, why don't you go ahead and go public? And we'll keep our eyes on you and look at you later. So I think a lot of the corrections may create opportunities for us at the right time, they've got to settle in themselves. And candidly, when you have a really successful business, which we have right now, there's no urgency. So I think we were in that magical spot where our core businesses are so strong and growing, that we don't need to do anything. Meanwhile, we keep racking up cash, that puts us in a great position when we do want to act. And, we think whether it's this year or whether it's next year, opportunities will present themselves that we'll be able to take advantage of but absolutely no urgency from our standpoint, while people readjust to what might be that the true realities, not what they want to believe the realities could be\nOperator: And that's all the time we have for questions. This now concludes Hologic\u2019s first quarter fiscal 2022 earnings conference call. Have a good evening.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Karleen Oberton",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to share first quarter results that are significantly exceeded our guidance on both the top-line and bottom-line. Our first quarter highlights an improving based business that grew 9% organically excluding COVID-19 revenues. As Steve mentioned, our diversified business model is paying off. Each of our franchises excluding COVID grew more than 8% in the quarter, broadly exceeding our long-term revenue growth target of 5% to 7%. It is also important to note that our base business strength occurred in a quarter that started with the Delta wave and ended with COVID cases surging due to Omicron. Total revenues for the quarter of 1.47 billion showcased strength in every business and was significantly ahead of our previous guidance. EPS of $2.17 in the first quarter, far surpassed our initial guidance range of $1.15 to $1.25. We also continued to generate healthy free cash flow, funding our capital deployment priorities of tuck in M&A and share repurchases. We believe our balance sheet is a significant advantage in times of market uncertainty, which I'll touch on shortly. Before I do that, let me provide some detail on our divisional revenue results. Like clarity on our performance, I will exclude the impact of COVID-19 where applicable. In diagnostics, global revenue of $950.4 million declined 15.2% compared to the prior year. However, excluding COVID assay sales related ancillary items in a small level of discontinued products, worldwide diagnostics revenue increased just over 10%. To better understand the underlying performance of our non-COVID molecular business, I will again exclude COVID-19 benefits. By doing this base molecular revenue grew about 14% organically in the first quarter. The growth was run by strong execution across our global portfolio as our largest non-COVID assay. chlamydia, gonorrhea was above pre-pandemic levels. Our newer vaginitis panel contributed well ahead of last year's run rate. And internationally, we continued to see strong demand for our Panther instrumentation, Our perspective, our annual molecular business excluding COVID, is now more than $100 million larger than before the pandemic. As it relates to our COVID-19 results, we continue to forecast conservatively, but act aggressively behind the scenes to meet demand for our customers. In the quarter, we generated $523 million of COVID assay revenue and shipped about 26 million tests to our customers. The United States represented about 60% of total COVID assay revenue, although demand was high around the world. Rounding out diagnostics, cytology and perinatal grew 5% compared to the prior year, a nice result that was also above 2019 levels. In breast health, global revenue of $359.3 million grew more than 8%. This growth was driven by our interventional business. As Steve highlighted which was up nearly 20% in the quarter. Breast imaging and service also increased mid-single digits in the period, underscoring resilience in the face of COVID headwinds. Our strategy to diversify and increase recurring revenue continues to pay off. In surgical, first quarter revenue of 134.3 million grew 8%. This solid performance was driven by a nice rebound in NovaSure from the launch of our next generation B5 system as well as momentum from new products such as Fluent and Acessa. While our surgical business was impacted by pullbacks in elective procedures, the impact was minimal in the quarter. We continued to stay close to our customers monitoring the Omicron surge in related staffing issues, which we do expect to be a headwind in Q2. Lastly, our skeletal business had revenue of $27.1 million increased 10% compared to the prior year period. Now let's move on to the rest of the P&L for the first quarter. Gross margin of 72.1% significantly beat our forecast, driven by higher than expected COVID-19 test volumes in the period. Total operating expenses of 333.9 million increased 22% in the first quarter, but we're down 5% sequentially compared to Q4. We continue to reinvest for future growth with incremental spending and R&D and marketing, pulling forward initiatives given the benefit from COVID-19. Further within our operating expenses, the inclusion of recent acquisitions accounted for a spend of approximately $30 million in Q1. And we also made additional charitable donations in the quarter. Finally, our non-GAAP tax rate in Q1 is 21.5% as expected. Putting these pieces together operating margin came in well above our forecast at 49.4% and net margin was a very strong 37.7%. Non-GAAP net income finished at 554.7 million and non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.17, nearly 75% above the top end of our prior guidance. Moving on cash flow from operations was $564 million in the first quarter, a very strong result, which was more than 100% of non-GAAP net income. These robust cash flows continue to give us tremendous financial and strategic flexibility. For example, in the quarter we repurchased 2.3 million shares of our stock for $167 million and closed the acquisition of Bolder Surgical for $160 million. We continued to evaluate M&A that strategically fits well within our existing sales channels, or the narrow adjacency. Based on our strong operational performance, we had 1.4 billion of cash on our balance sheet at the end of the first quarter. And our leverage ratio was 0.6x. Our capital structure is as strong as it has ever been. And we intend to deploy our excess cash on division led acquisitions, as well as share repurchases that improved our top and bottom-line growth rates. For example, we have been buying shares under our 10b5-1 plan within our second fiscal quarter to take advantages of market volatility. Finally, ROIC was 29.4% on a trailing 12-month basis, an increase of 270 basis points compared to the prior year. Before we discuss our increased guidance for the second quarter and full year fiscal 2022, I want to mention a few key points. Although the pandemic remains highly uncertain, we believe we are well positioned either way it may turn. To there be future outbreaks, we will meet our customers need and generate additional COVID testing revenue. Or should the pandemic subside, we expect strong performance in our base businesses. We believe we are nicely hedged against macro and market volatility. As it relates to supply chain headwinds, these challenges have become more specific in recent weeks. Due to the lack of available chips, we expect a temporary shortage of supply that will lengthen delivery timelines for mammography capital in our breast health division. While we hope to mitigate these effects, for conservatism we are estimating around $200 million of revenue will be pushed out of fiscal 2022. This includes up to $50 million headwind in our second quarter, as we are proactively beginning to extend lead times of new units to preserve inventory and maintain service continuity for gantries already in the field. This headwind is purely a supply issue and not one of underlying demand which remain strong. Despite the supply shortage, we are significantly increasing our full year revenue outlook underscoring the evolution of our diversified business model. We expect our diagnostics and surgical businesses along with COVID contributions to more than offset mammography headwinds. Now, let me move on to our specific guidance. In the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect very strong financial results again, with total revenue in the range of 1.25 billion to 1.3 billion. As a reminder, our Q2 revenue is usually seasonally lower than Q1. For all of fiscal 2022, we expect total revenue in the range of 4.4 billion to 4.55 billion, significantly exceeding our prior full year guidance by $600 million at the midpoint. Given the recent strength of the U.S. dollar into aid with constant currency modeling, we are assuming foreign exchange headwinds of approximately $23 million in the second quarter of 2022 and $56 million for the full year. In diagnostics and molecular continues to be the growth engine based on our larger Panther installed base of over 3000 instruments globally. Further, we are seeing encouraging uptake of new assays like our Vaginitis panel, as well as tremendous international expansion opportunities and a rebound in our core STI assays. As a result for fiscal 2022, we expect our base diagnostics franchise inclusive of cytology and perinatal to grow high single digits. In breast health, our organic and inorganic investments continued to perform well. For example, Brevera is off to a great start in 2022, growing in the high teens for the quarter. Further, recurring service revenue represents approximately 40% of total sales in Q1. Finally, in surgical we expect MyoSure to continue to drive growth, with help from better NovaSure performance. In addition, we expect new products and the recent acquisitions of Acessa and Bolder to add momentum to an already fast growing franchise. Like base diagnostics, we expect surgical to grow above our long-term organic guidance for fiscal 2022. In terms of COVID assay sales, the only certainty is that no one really knows how demand will progress for the rest of the year. Therefore, as we have done for the past several quarters, we are forecasting conservatively and will act aggressively. With that in mind, we expect COVID assay sales to be at least $400 million in the second quarter of 2022. And at least $1 billion for the full year. COVID-related items, including revenue from discontinued products and diagnostics, are expected to be approximately $50 million in the second quarter and $190 million for the full year. As a reminder, our organic guidance backs out of revenue from acquisitions until the first full quarter after the deals annualize as well as revenue from our divested blood screening business. We expect blood screening revenue of $5 million to $6 million in Q2, and $20 million to $25 million for the full year. In total, we are backing out roughly $110 million of inorganic revenues for the year. To appreciate the underlying growth of our business, it is important to back out of organic revenue COVID assay sales, related ancillary items and a small amount of discontinued product revenue and diagnostics. On this measure and excluding the previously mentioned supply chain headwinds in breast health, we expect the rest of Hologic to grow at least at the high-end of our 5% to 7% long-term guidance. Moving down the P&L, for the full year we forecast our gross margin percentages in the mid 60s and our operating margin percentage to be in the mid to high 30s. Both estimates are higher than our guidance last quarter. We expect both percentages to decline sequentially throughout the year, consistent with our conservative planning that most COVID demand will occur in the first half. In addition, we have incorporated additional inflationary supply chain costs into our guidance as it relates to electronics, plastics and logistics. Despite this, for the full year, both gross and operating margin should be well above pre-pandemic levels. In terms of operating expenses, we expect spending to be up compared to 2021, but declined sequentially in the back half of the year. As we've continued to highlight in quarters with higher COVID testing revenue, we will take the opportunity to invest more for future growth. Below operating income, we expect other expenses net to be a little less than $25 million a quarter for the remainder of the year. Our guidance is based on an effective tax rate of 21.5% and diluted shares outstanding of around 256 million for the full year. All this nets out to expected EPS of $1.50 to $1.60 in the second quarter well above current consensus estimates and $4.90 to $5.20 for the full year, 36% above our prior guidance at the midpoint. As you update your forecast, let me remind you that macro uncertainty due to the pandemic and related supply chain challenge is still high. We would therefore encourage you to model at the middle of our ranges, which incorporate both potential upsides and downsides. Let me wrap up by saying that Hologic posted very strong first quarter results that far exceeded expectations and guidance. We are also significantly raising our financial guidance for the year, highlighting the multiple growth drivers we have added to each of our franchises in the upside to our business from capturing demand for COVID testing. With organic investments, multiple acquisitions and additional financial flexibility for capital deployment, we are a much stronger company than two years ago, and well positioned to prosper in the face of various uncertainties. With that, I will ask the operator to open the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow up, then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question. Yes. I think what we've talked about is, managing our free cash flow that we want to fully deploy our annual free cash flow between tuck in M&A and share repurchase. But having said that, Dan, we obviously will continue to be disciplined as it relates to tuck in M&A that would be the priority. So we might let some cash build on the balance sheet while again, disciplined and looking for the right deal. Yes. I would just build on that, Vijay is that, I think what we have here in Q2 is, we have inventory to cover that 50 million of revenue shortfall. But we're actively allocating to Steve's point to service because that's the most important thing is that we've got Inventory to keep that installed base up and running so that women can get back to screening. Yes, yes. So I think on the total revenue from acquisitions in 2022, is roughly 170 million. And then we talked about the inorganic piece that we're pulling out $110 million. And I think you went to another question there on the assays, I think, certainly, the STI assays are our biggest asset. So I would say that a lot of customers, that would be primarily what they're running. Yes. And I think, again, when we talk about the launch, I think for comparison, Jack and think about the [trick] [ph] assay took about five to six years to get to that 70 million, and we're getting close to that here, only a couple years out. So that's kind of the success of the launch that I want to highlight. And just to add maybe a finer point to that even versus Q1 \u201819. That's basically like your business is up over 40% I mean, that's a tremendous growth over the past couple years. Yes, certainly. Yes, the supply chain is both the revenue on breast and some of the higher cost as well, though, that we mentioned. I think absent of the revenue headwind, certainly that base business operating margins, if we had minimal COVID are still in that low 30%, that we were prior to the pandemic. So we continue to keep an eye on that. And I think, again, some of the strengths that we talked about are continue to contribute to that base business is still healthy on the operating margin line. Yes, from an ASP perspective, certainly, pricing has held pretty nicely here, I think, roughly $20, with the overall average in the quarter, I think as we look forward, we do expect that pricing will come down, one as we renew international contracts, which are lower ASP, as well as in the U.S., when the higher -- when the public health emergency ends in this higher lower payment for the testing will probably come down. But still, we have a way to go on that pricing to come down to still have that revenue be accretive to the overall corporate average. And think about the overall business and margins, certainly our supply chain, folks, you annually have improvement targets that they go after that some of them even in this year of buffering some of the higher costs that we're seeing. We have network optimization opportunities that we're focused on. And certainly we've talked about investing internationally, intentionally, over the past several years, that we believe that international revenue continues to grow, we'll have more margin accretion from the international business. Yes, absolutely. We do think this would be a labor efficiency for our labs. This is something that there's a really long lead time to the track system, so 18 to 24 months. So we won't have any kind of data on actual cost savings for a couple of years. But this is something that we actually have partnered with our customers on, on the development of how it will work in the lab. And we're excited to officially launch it here. Yes. So I think on the breast health business, if we think about operating margins, certainly the service business is accretive to the operating margins, which is the biggest part of revenue for that division, Then I would say, then there's probably equal contribution from gantries and interventional from an operating module perspective. Certainly, the headwind, the $200 million headwind is significant to that division. But, fortunately here, we were able to raise our full year guidance based on the performance of the rest of the business and the COVID contributions. So we can well manage this headwind and not have to do things like -- manage headcount or the other things. So preserve our great salesforce that we have our service engineers and still feel good about managing through this headwind. Yes. Casey, we think of the test record as an annual number. So to put it in perspective, prior to the pandemic, our largest year was 20 million, we did about 34 million in 2020, and about 40 million in 2021. And we expect that 2022 will be another number in that $30 million to $40 million range. Yes. Certainly hard to comment on the future tax rate when there's no real legislation really in place. And, as you know, the devils in the details on something like that. But certainly if the federal headline rate went up, our overall non-GAAP tax rate would go up. But I would tell you that, we certainly have an active tax department that is partnering with our operations team to put in efficiency strategies. Yes, Ryan. So as I said in my prepared remarks, we are assuming about a minimum of 400 million here in the second quarter. So that would lead to your mass of roughly 50 and 50 in the Q3 and Q4."

            "name": "Stephen MacMillan",
            "content": "Thank you, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Once again, our results are strong. We are off to a great start in all divisions with diagnostics, breast and skeletal health and surgical each delivering more than 8% global organic growth, excluding COVID revenue. For the quarter, revenue was $1.47 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.17. Both numbers significantly exceeded the high-end of our guidance by 28% on the top-line, and 74% on the bottom. Over the last several quarters. And most recently at the JPMorgan conference, we've been communicating three major themes. First, our base business is stronger, with more diverse growth drivers than ever before. Second, as the COVID pandemic remains, we continue to help meet the world's testing needs and generate financial upside. And third, because of the first two points, we are well positioned to generate strong results regardless of how various uncertainties evolve from the pandemic, to supply chain challenges to health care utilization. In other words, you can count on us to deliver in today's uncertain business environment. These themes are certainly playing out as we look at our first quarter results and our dramatically improved outlook for the fiscal year. Our base businesses are performing well. And we are making a massive difference against COVID. As a result, we are raising our revenue and earnings guidance significantly as we expect upside from COVID-19 testing, along with strength in our diagnostics and surgical businesses to more than compensate for temporary supply chain challenges that have emerged in our breast health business. As we shared at JPMorgan, we are a fundamentally different company than eight years ago. Now more than ever before, Hologic has more diverse and higher margin recurring revenue across each division in each geography around the world. Our strong performance is result of execution against our strategic plan and has been accelerated by our financial success during the pandemic. As evidenced by our Q1 results, we are well positioned for long term sustainable growth, regardless of the direction the pandemic may turn. While we can't predict the future path of COVID, we'd like to expand today on what we do know that Hologic is emerging from this pandemic a much stronger company. More specifically, we will focus on what we know in each division. It gives us clear confidence in our ability to maintain sustained growth over the long-term. First, in our diagnostics division, we know that our huge industry leading installed base of automated high throughput Panther systems, along with our robust menu of 19 assays across Panther and Panther fusion, will drive strong growth well into the future. Today, our Panther installed base is over 3000 units 75% larger than prior to the pandemic, with almost half of these placed internationally. Of note, demand for our Panthers is still strong globally. We placed well over 100 Panthers in the first quarter alone, more than double our pace prior to the pandemic. At this stage in the pandemic, this clearly indicates the customers expect to use these systems for non-COVID testing. Utilization of our Panther systems is also strong. We are seeing clear signs that customers are leveraging our menu of 19 assays on our significantly expanded Panther footprint. First and foremost, the growth of molecular diagnostic sales reflect this growing utilization. For Q1, our core molecular diagnostics franchise grew 14% worldwide, excluding COVID revenues, product discontinuations, as well as recent M&A activity. Now, we know a question on some people's minds is, will these Panthers be used post pandemic? The answer is an emphatic yes, based on the following. First, nearly 90% of U.S. COVID customers are already running at least one other assay. This speaks to our customers being bonafide molecular diagnostics players who are invested in molecular testing for the long haul, and who we expect will adopt more of our assays over time. And second, the incredible automation and workflow simplicity of the Panther, which dramatically minimizes labor activity and costs. In a labor restricted world, our customers realize the enormous advantage of our Panther system. Extending and broadening the adoption of our portfolio of assays is a fundamental element of the diagnostic growth strategy. Our sales teams have done a tremendous job winning strategic accounts, strengthening our relationship with customers, and fueling our razor, razor blade business model with both legacy women's health tests and new assays. As an example, leveraging our leadership in women's health, our vaginitis panel is off to a great start with $13 million of revenue in the first quarter, roughly 2.5x the first quarter of 2021. We are extremely proud of the panel success and believe this will be our most successful diagnostic launch ever COVID aside. In Q1, we also once again responded to our customers COVID testing needs and generated significant financial upside. We posted $523 million in COVID assay sales, over $300 million more than our outlook and consensus. Clearly COVID is sticking around longer than anyone would like. And just as clearly, highly accurate molecular testing continues to play a major role in fighting the pandemic. We continue to believe COVID testing will contribute materially to our business for the foreseeable future. And we remain prepared to meet ongoing demand globally. Second, shifting to our breast and skeletal health business. We know that broadening across the continuum of breast health care from screening and diagnosis through surgery and treatment has transformed this franchise from a once capital dependent business to a division with more diverse, higher growth recurring revenue. In the first quarter, the breast health business grew 8.4% As we've maintained our high market share, and continued to grow our installed base of Genius 3D Mammography systems. The attachment rate of service on this gantry base continues to remain strong at more than 80%, making service one of our largest top line contributors company wide. And we continue to upgrade our installed base with high margin software and AI. So mammography capital business is and will continue to be a meaningful and foundational part of our breast business going forward. In addition, we built a solid adjacent portfolio of more recurring interventional breast surgery products that is driving the growth of the division. These interventional products include markers, needles, including those used in our Brevera biopsy system, and handheld devices. Sales are more recurring in nature, with higher projected growth compared to the legacy capital business As points of reference, today, the gantry business is only 23% of breast health revenue compared to 29% in 2014, and interventional sales have grown to roughly the same size as gantry revenue. We expect the interventional business to continue its growth and further transform our breast and skeletal division going forward. The increasing diversity of our breast business will help us offset supply chain challenges that have emerged recently, specifically shortages of computer chips in our mammography and other imaging systems. Our updated guidance incorporates a temporary but meaningful revenue headwind for the balance of our fiscal year. Despite this, as Karleen will discuss, we are raising our revenue and EPS guidance significantly based on outperformance in COVID, core molecular and surgical. Now, shifting gears to surgical, we know that the diversification of the business will drive growth. Despite pandemic headwinds, the division grew 8.2% In the first quarter, and we continue to solidify our market leading positions for NovaSure and MyoSure. With the addition of the Acessa procedure and the close of the Bolder acquisition in late November, our surgical business has a very different profile today, with more growth engines than ever. Acessa of revenue in Q1 was nearly three times a year ago and the Bolder integration is off to a great start. As we are already seeing Bolder sales through the Hologic surgical sales team. The recent launch of NovaSure version five, developed in-house is also seeing good traction. It's early days, but we are seeing a lot of excitement in the field around this product. We are committed to maintaining our leadership position in this space with best-in-class products. Further, the Fluent Fluid Management System, also developed in-house is used to streamline the complexities of fluid management in hysteroscopic procedures. Fluent is another great example of organic innovation, driving future growth. Fourth and finally, we know that our international business will be a consistent contributor of growth for years to come. We are no longer the export business of prior years. Through organic growth, and M&A, we are direct in more regions than ever before, especially in breast health, with our feet firmly on the street and engaged with customers. In Q1, the international business achieved nearly 13% organic growth, excluding COVID. And we expect strong growth to continue. With the leaders we have in place today. We are confident the foundation we've laid and the progress we've made will yield strong results for many years to come. To add additional perspective, there are over 3.9 billion women in the world with only about 170 million of them in the United States, which is our largest market today. Clearly, we have an opportunity to impact more lives and more women around the world. Through our groundbreaking initiatives, like the Hologic Global Women's Health Index, in conjunction with the opportunity we've earned as leaders in the fight against COVID, we are connecting with world leaders and changemakers to elevate Women's Health around the world. In summary, our first quarter results and improved outlook demonstrate the Hologic is a much different and much stronger business than ever before. Stronger through diversification and stronger from our leadership in COVID molecular testing. These factors are generating exceptional cash flows and a pristine balance sheet that are especially valuable in the midst of uncertain market conditions. As we've done for the duration of this pandemic, we are confident in our ability to manage our business through various uncertainties and continue to deliver strong growth regardless of how external conditions evolve. What is clear to us at Hologic is that we are poised to continue our strong growth, whether COVID wanes or continues, we have fundamentally changed our business into one with more growth drivers and more recurring revenue across all geographies. This gives us the clear confidence that we can navigate change and continue to generate exceptional financial results. With that, let me turn the call over to Karleen. We believe COVID will be endemic. And we believe there will be ongoing molecular testing and probably feel even stronger about it than ever. Right? If you go back two years ago, none of us would have imagined we'd be having the amount of testing going on now. And at the end of the day, I think most governments and most people around the world have realized while there's antigen testing out there for true population health and frankly, to truly capture what's going on molecular is the answer. And I think we feel better and better. That's going to be an ongoing part of our business for many, many years. It's a virus, it mutates. And Omicron is not the last mutation of this thing. And I think we feel that we're well poised. Yes. Certainly, some of it is, as we've highlighted with both surgical and diagnostics-based businesses, strengthening. Just as we've forecasted, COVID, conservatively, we want to put that out there. You don't have to anybody that's looked around at supply chain issues, the semiconductor and chip issues have not gotten better. And we're not totally sure exactly when that will fully work its way out. We're lengthening lead times, for our deliveries, and it's all in the breast health primarily in the gantry business. And we've got obviously maintained some chips for service. So, we're being conservative and taking care of our existing customers. And we'll lengthen and, frankly, it'll make next year probably look better. And it's great, we can absorb this, what I call annoyance right now, when the rest of the businesses are firing. Yes. I think clearly, it's taken us a long time to get chlamydia, gonorrhea up into that into that multi 100 million range. But I think we feel really, this is going to be over years. But I think we're feeling pretty good about that ramp, you figure if we just did 13 million in the first quarter, multiply that by four and you've got the very bare minimum of, I think what we expect to do this year. So they'll probably continue to build through the quarters. And I think if we fast forward a few years from now, certainly goes north of 100 now its way to 200. It's a very meaningful indication, it's been completely under diagnosed and I think it's part of the rapid uptake. And it's really a great reason to go to the doctor. Yes, it clearly has emerged here, we kept hoping we would find solutions. I've watched our operations team over the last couple of years. They've just been a Herculean first on MTUs and Tecan tips, swabs on, glass tubes on everything, we did the scale during COVID time to getting more Panthers out the door. And we were hearing a lot of the issues from our chip suppliers, but kept thinking we would find some alternatives and some solutions, and really is it's come down. At the end of the day, as you can see where we were able to call it manufacture additional plastic or find other things. In the COVID piece, we haven't been able to manufacture semiconductor chips and we're at the beck and call of the global supply chain here, where everybody's been tugging on it.  So as we've gotten into -- so yes, clearly, it didn't impact last quarter at all, it's technically not even hurting us in the very moment right now but it's as we go forth. And then, there's two pieces of right, one is, we could sell a lot more of the chips that we will have on allocation into new gantries. So we want to make sure that we keep every gantry that's out there up and running. So we're keeping a good chunk of the chips that will be coming for ongoing service. And if we were just trying to maximize short-term revenue, the hit wouldn't be nearly as big, but we want to make sure we're taking care of the service side. So definitely an annoyance, it's one and to your point, it's a fairly big number that we want to call out right now, in the midst of an overall thing. I think it does underscore how far we've come as a company, right? You think about that kind of a hit eight years ago would have been a big deal, even three or four years ago would have been a very sizable knockdown punch. And now it's kind of annoying little body blow that we know will work right through and set ourselves up to continue to win. Why we kind of think about in a real simplistic term Patrick, which is our total revenue that comes from it. And so, to that point, right, we're going to have over 3000 Panthers, clearly, the pure dollar volume will likely come down from what it was pre pandemic on a global basis, in the near term, because we've placed a whole bunch more internationally where we don't have quite as much revenue for Panther. And we've also gone to some smaller customers, where it will clearly pay off over time. So the way we think about it, I mean, ultimately comes down to number of Panthers, times the amount of revenue generated per Panther. And we see enormous upside to where that's going to go here over time. So many of the folks that have brought bought Panthers in the last year plus, or where we've installed Panthers, they keep wanting, they keep getting ready to put the regular assays on. And then, COVID spikes yet again, and so it's still out there. So we have so much pent-up volume, all those [torques] [ph] that were generated largely in 2020, 2021, are all still delayed, and it comes down to we just generated 14% growth in this quarter, even while COVID was surging. So I think it's hard to exactly model it, per se, but it's just going to come down to we're going to be selling a lot more assays on a lot more machines. And that's going to generate clearly accretive growth rates above the company average for a long time. Yes, I think, overall, international, obviously, we said is a double-digit grower. And I think, we'd said years ago, we expected that international would become probably a double-digit grower for many, many years. And I think we're exactly into that. A lot of it candidly, Brian is really coming out of Western Europe, because that's where our biggest footprint is. And it's where we've placed a ton of the Panthers. We're starting to get certainly more of it out of out of Asia Pac as well. But the bigger chunk is really Western Europe, a little bit of Africa and I think continue to feel good. And overall, that the international growth rate is above the U.S rate. I think the magic is, it's actually largely across the board. Even our psychology business is actually doing well, particularly in a few key markets in Western Europe, the overall diagnostics as we've been placing those Panthers, I think you can go back really over three, four -- three or four years now, where the molecular business outside the U.S. is oftentimes been at 20-ish percent growth rate, and if anything, it's just going to be turbocharged here. Going forward, breast health has been very solid as well and even things like the SOMATEX acquisition we did in breast health, 15 months ago, whatever, a German-based company with some of the markers, it's helped put us on the on the map there. Surgicals picking up a little bit. So, there's no one -- I think the magic of it that makes us feel actually even better is, it's not like a one hit wonder. It's not one country, one geography, one product line, even one franchise is doing it. It's really a whole bunch of incremental things, just inexorably getting stronger. And then, that's what gives us more confidence for the future. In terms of where they're going Derek. It's really again, it's very broad based, some are to existing customers and some might have three and they add a fourth. We've definitely got new customers as well, they're going into -- the hospitals are going into small labs, they're going into the big labs, they're going into some -- certainly some are new customers for us. And, therefore, whether it's a competitive win or just an expansion of that, labs business, we're certainly seeing that. And we do think, the overall focus on high throughput instruments is going to be a very good thing for us going forth. And we feel like that's where we've got a real winning edge, as you you've known Panther well. Yes. We're looking both ways actually, as we think about it, whether we -- obviously, we've done smaller build-ons in terms of the markers and Faxitron Focal, kind of the breast conserving surgery stuff. I think we see various different ways we can go and are really assessing what else we can be doing across the broad continuum of care. And particularly on the treatment side of breast, so more of that would be potential in organic, some of its organic and we continue to look at things that way. We have time for one more question. Yes. It's great question. Certainly when valuation is correct, you always have the sellers, kind of remembering the good old days that might have been and I think right now we feel we're in a great position. There's a lot of stuff that, we had every banker and we had a bunch of both privates and companies went public last year in our face that wanted us to buy them then. And we said to a lot of them, why don't you go ahead and go public? And we'll keep our eyes on you and look at you later. So I think a lot of the corrections may create opportunities for us at the right time, they've got to settle in themselves. And candidly, when you have a really successful business, which we have right now, there's no urgency. So I think we were in that magical spot where our core businesses are so strong and growing, that we don't need to do anything. Meanwhile, we keep racking up cash, that puts us in a great position when we do want to act. And, we think whether it's this year or whether it's next year, opportunities will present themselves that we'll be able to take advantage of but absolutely no urgency from our standpoint, while people readjust to what might be that the true realities, not what they want to believe the realities could be"

Today's conference is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute. I would now like to introduce Ryan Simon, Vice President, Investor Relations to begin the call. Please go ahead, sir.\nRyan Simon: Thank you, Cynthia. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Hologic's fourth quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call. With me Today is Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Pfficer; Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer, is currently on bereavement and will not be joining us today. Karleen is with family and I will be covering for her on our call. Please join me in wishing Karleen and her family well. Our fourth quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We will also post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them, as well as an updated corporate presentation. And a replay of this call will be available on our website for the next 30 days. Before we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements we make today will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor Statement included in our earnings release and SEC filing. Also during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Two of these non-GAAP measures are: one, organic revenue, which we define as revenue excluding divested businesses and revenue from acquired businesses owned by Hologic for less than one year; and two, organic revenue excluding COVID-19, which excludes COVID-19 assay revenue, revenue related to COVID-19, and sales from discontinued products in diagnostics. Finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis and revenue growth rates will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic CEO.\nStephen MacMillan: Thank you, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone. And before I get started, I just want to do a quick shout out to Karleen and her family and let everybody know our thoughts and prayers are with her today. We are pleased to discuss Hologic's financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Total revenue was $945.3 million and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.89. It was another strong quarter overall with revenue finishing at the high end of our range and EPS exceeding our guidance. Our fourth quarter capped off a tremendous year where we continued our track record of success, strengthened our business, and delivered on our commitments. For the full year, we posted $4.03 billion in revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $3.96. In 2023, quite frankly, we delivered some pretty exceptional organic growth rates, which were far above our longer-term targets. At the start of the year, we committed to deliver low double-digit growth across each division. In the end, we delivered more, growing annual organic revenue ex-COVID in the mid-teens at 15.6%, with every division growing north of 13% and international growth just above 20%. Despite various macro challenges, like clockwork, we continued to deliver, raising our financial guidance throughout the year and living up to our commitments. At the same time, our balance sheet remains incredibly strong and we have the financial flexibility to grow our business for the long term. For fiscal 2024, we are confident in our ability to deliver against our 5% to 7% ex-COVID long-term organic growth target, even against significant comps, one less selling week, and a challenging macro environment. In fact, if we look at 2024 on an adjusted daily sales basis, our annual organic revenue growth rate, excluding COVID, is projected to be in the 6% to 8% range. Whether adjusting for selling days or not, we believe our results will truly stand out from the crowd as we progress throughout fiscal 2024, particularly following a year of almost 16% growth ex-COVID in 2023. Before sharing more of our excitement for 2024, we will first reflect on our Q4 results. In Q4, we grew total organic revenue, excluding COVID, 16.7%, with double-digit growth in every division. We again delivered on our promises. At the division level, breast health grew 27.4%, driven primarily by the recovery in our gantry business. Interventional breast also posted a strong quarter, growing in the low double digits. We are pleased the division's gantry recovery is tracking to our expectations, following the industry's chip supply challenges. Moving on to diagnostics. Organic growth ex-COVID was 10.2%, again driven by our strong molecular business. Organic molecular diagnostics ex-COVID grew 15% for the quarter. Driven once again by strong contributions from BV, CV/TV, Amgen, and Biotheranostics. With fiscal 2023 revenue ex-COVID at $1.48 billion, our diagnostics business is over 40% larger than it was in 2019. Even more impressive, our base molecular business is now nearly 80%, eight zero percent larger than it was pre-pandemic. Molecular has grown through a combination of more than doubling our Panther installed base, adding new menu, gaining new customers, as well as acquisitions into adjacent markets. This transformation and durable performance speaks to the ongoing success of our growth strategy. Rounding out the divisions, surgical revenue at over $600 million in fiscal 2023 is now nearly 40% larger than what it was in 2019. In Q4, surgical grew 10.6%, driven primarily by MyoSure and Fluent, both growing double digits. In addition, our laparoscopic portfolio also grew double digits, albeit smaller in dollars compared to MyoSure and Fluent. More importantly, we are pleased our laparoscopic portfolio continues to gain traction. To close the overview of our quarterly results and fiscal 2023 highlights, our international business continue to be accretive to overall growth rates, growing north of 28% on an organic ex-COVID basis in Q4. We expect international to continue to be a key part of our growth story. Before moving on, I'd like to revisit and reinforce our capital allocation strategy. In short, our capital allocation strategy remains the same. We continue to prioritize M&A opportunities; and second, we consistently look to utilize cash towards share repurchases. And we continue to be patient. Having said that, we have recently seen the opportunity to deploy our cash balance more significantly, taking the following four actions. One, in Q4 2023 we deployed $238 million of capital to buy back 3.2 million shares. Second, in our current fiscal Q1 2024, we have already repurchased another 2.2 million shares for $150 million. Three, today we announced an additional $500 million accelerated share repurchase program. And four, we recently paid down $250 million of higher variable interest rate debt. Ryan will expand on both the ASR and debt repayment in his remarks. Looking back four plus years since the start of the pandemic, the biggest acquisition we have made is of ourselves. During this period, we deployed over $1.4 billion on M&A opportunities and nearly $2.3 billion on share repurchases, including our recent repurchases in Q1 2024. And today's ASR announcement will make that $2.8 billion. As you can see, we are very confident in our position for the years ahead. Rounding out our capital allocation discussion. To ensure we are optimized for the future, we carefully evaluate our portfolio on an ongoing basis. As a result, as mentioned in our release, we have recently divested our small SSI ultrasound business. Shifting gears, as we have shared on prior calls, we have broadly transformed our business and strengthened our fundamentals. Quarter-by-quarter, year-by-year, with macro hurdles ever present, we continue to prove our strength. Today, we are effectively a new Hologic, retooled and recapitalized with strong brands, wide modes, industry-leading margins, and the strongest, deepest leadership team we've ever had. Hologic is a differentiated and more competitive company than at any time in our 38-year history. At our core, we are fundamentally guided by our purpose, passion, and promise. Our purpose, to enable healthier lives everywhere, every day. Our passion, to champion women's health globally. And our promise, the science of sure, to provide health care professionals with clinically differentiated, high quality products. Across each division, we have distinct advantages created by our unique focus on elevating women's health through innovative products and trailblazing social initiatives like the Hologic Global Women's Health Index. We ultimately develop our leading positions by leaning into our purpose and proactively meeting our customers' and patients' needs. We will highlight three examples today. First, we are not only leaders in women's health, but we are also sector leaders in workflow automation. Our customers continue to deal with challenges, sourcing technicians, and the persistent pressure to efficiently manage costs. As a result, user-friendly systems and efficient workflow solutions are at the top of our customers' expectations. From our Panther instrument to our Brevera breast biopsy and Fluent systems, to name only a few, each product is designed to transform manual, labor-intensive, cumbersome processes into easy to use, dependable, and efficient workflows. Second, the massive footprint and sheer size of our installed bases in diagnostics and breast health provide a strong foundation in today's world. With more than 3,260 Panther instruments installed worldwide and over 10,000 mammography systems installed across the US, we have the opportunity to be integral partners with the laboratories, hospitals, and screening centers we support. For Panther, as customers add more menu and drive incremental volume, our molecular diagnostics business continues to grow, while also becoming more valuable to our customers and more deeply rooted in their operations. The same can be said for our breast health business. Hologic is unique in our ability to support our customers and their patients at each step along the breast care continuum. We differentiate ourselves with our ecosystem of technologies that integrate across a patient's journey, creating a more comfortable patient experience, greater clinical confidence for practitioners, and increased operational efficiencies for our customers. Moving on to our third example, our longstanding brand leadership across multiple product lines in each division, which yields strong, stable margins and steady cash flow generation. We are innovators and leaders in breast and cervical cancer screening, STI testing, abnormal uterine bleeding treatment, and fibroid removal. This is a significant statement given the strong competitors we face in each respective business. Our diversified leadership and scale across our business lines support industry leading margins and cash flow and in turn, we have the ability to further invest and grow our business. Altogether, we are emerging as a premier growth company, differentiated and more competitive, delivering strong growth across each division and international. As the new much stronger Hologic we are today, we consistently deliver and aim to continue to do so. Turning our attention to 2024, I will touch on some of the high-level growth drivers in each business, and Ryan will finish the call with further detail related to next year's guidance. First, in breast health, we expect 2024 to be another strong year of growth. With our gantry backlog remaining elevated compared to historic levels, we have greater visibility into our pipeline, translating to higher confidence in future gantry sales, creating another exciting year for breast health. In diagnostics, as in recent years, molecular will continue to drive growth for the division. We expect our large global Panther install base to continue to add new menu, while also increasing volume for existing assays. In addition, our Biotheranostics business, which we acquired in 2021, is expected to continue delivering double-digit growth, being accretive even to our molecular growth rate. In 2023, Biotheraenostics grew over 30%, and we are still in early innings growing the breast cancer index test. BCI is still the only test recognized by NCCN guidelines and the American Society of Clinical Oncology to predict which patients are likely to benefit from extended adjuvant therapy beyond five years, yet another example of an innovative and differentiated product. In surgical, MyoSure, our Fluent system, and our newer laparoscopic products that we acquired via Boulder and Acessa are projected to continue to drive growth. Internationally, surgical also continues to shine. In 2023, our international surgical growth rate was more than double the US growth rate. Surgical is clearly emerging as a strong and profitable growth driver. To conclude, entering 2024, we are a new and differentiated Hologic. We are bigger, stronger, and more competitive than ever. Our leadership brands, growth drivers across all three divisions, durable margin profile, and strong balance sheet will continue to power us forward. As we look ahead to 2024, we are poised to continue to grow and make an even bigger impact on women's health around the world. With that, let me hand the call over to Ryan.\nRyan Simon: Thank you, Steve. And again, good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will touch on our fourth quarter financial results, recap our annual performance for certain items, and end with our fiscal 2024 guidance for Q1 and the full year. We are pleased to close out fiscal 2023 with yet another strong quarter of growth and profitability. In our fourth quarter, total revenue was $945.3 million, and again, we delivered double-digit organic revenue growth, growing 16.7% excluding the impact of COVID. In addition, our Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.89, growing 8.5% compared to the prior year despite significantly less COVID testing revenue. For the full year 2023, total revenue was $4.03 billion. Organic ex-COVID revenue grew 15.6% and non-GAAP earnings per share were $3.96. These are exceptional results in what has been an unpredictable operating environment. Now moving to a brief discussion of our divisional revenue. In diagnostics, global revenue of $416.4 million declined 20.6%. However, excluding COVID assay and COVID-related revenues, the division grew 10.2% in the quarter. Performance was again led by molecular diagnostics, growing 15% in the period ex-COVID. For the year, molecular posted very strong global growth of 18.9% ex-COVID. As Steve highlighted, growth continues to be driven by increasing Panther utilization, turbocharged by a much larger install base, and strong performance from biotherapeutics. Moving next to our COVID results, which exceeded our previous guidance. COVID assay revenue in our fourth quarter was $21 million, and COVID-related revenue, inclusive of a small amount of revenue from discontinued products and diagnostics, was $24 million. Staying in diagnostics, our cytology and perinatal business increased 1.3% in our fourth quarter, a solid result following outsized growth in our preceding third quarter due to the timing of certain larger orders. Moving to breast health, total fourth quarter breast health revenue of $352.8 million increased 27.4%. The division's healthy bookings and elevated backlogs provides us excellent visibility to meet customer needs and financial targets in fiscal 2024 and beyond. Continuing next to surgical, fourth quarter revenue of $148 million increased 10.6% compared to the prior year. Surgical's fourth quarter closes out a year in which the business grew a tremendous 15.8% organically, excluding the impact of Boulder in Q1. And finally, in our skeletal business, fourth quarter revenue of $28 million was also strong, increasing 15.9%. Now let's move on to the rest of the non-GAAP P&L for the fourth quarter. Gross margin of 60.4% was driven by strong performance in our base business. However, this result was partially depressed by certain elevated costs, including higher cost inventory from previously procured semiconductor chips. Moving down the P&L, fourth quarter operating expenses of $303.7 million decreased approximately 8%. This decrease was driven by lower marketing spend in the period compared to the prior year, primarily due to the timing of expenses associated with our WTA partnership. The low operating income, other income represented a gain in our fiscal fourth quarter. We benefited from higher interest rates on our cash balance, driving elevated levels of interest income. In addition, we realized gains on our interest rate hedge, helping to lower interest expense for our floating rate debt. Finally, our tax rate in Q4 was 19.75% as expected. Putting these pieces together, operating margin for Q4 came in at 28.3% and net margin was 23.2%. As we have previously discussed, we expect operating margin to improve from this level throughout fiscal 2024. Finally, non-GAAP net income finished at $219.3 million, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.89 cents. Moving on from the P&L, cash flow from operations was $258.7 million in the fourth quarter, capping off a year in which we generated over $1 billion in operating cash flow. As Steve outlined, we were actively repurchasing our shares in Q4 2023, as well as the start of Q1 2024. For the full year 2023, we spent $500 million to repurchase 6.8 million shares. Even so, we ended the fourth quarter with $2.7 billion of cash on our balance sheet and a net leverage ratio of 0.1 times. Lastly, after the end of our fiscal fourth quarter, we completed one important capital market transaction and intend to enter into another. First, we repaid $250 million of floating rate debt associated with our credit agreement. This debt pay down helps to further protect our balance sheet against the risk of rising interest rates. And second, as Steve mentioned, we continue to bet on ourselves and announce a $500 million ASR, showcasing our resolute belief in the value of our business as we look to benefit from the stock market's underappreciation of our intrinsic value. Now let's move on to our non-GAAP financial guidance for the first quarter and full fiscal year. For our Q1, we are expecting total revenue in the range of $960 million to $985 million and EPS of $0.92 to $0.97. For the full year 2024, our guidance assumes revenue of $3.92 to $4.02 billion and EPS of $3.90 to $4.10. As you reconcile our guidance to your models, we would like to call out three specific items pertaining to full-year total revenue. One, the headwind of four less selling days in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023, which is about $40 million. Two, the divestiture of the SSI ultrasound business, about a $20 million headwind. And three, the impact of FX, also about a $20 million headwind. First, with respect to selling days, our fiscal 2023 was a 53 week year. In fiscal 2024, we have four less selling days compared to 2023, specifically within Q1. We estimate the impact of the four less selling days to be a headwind of about 400 basis points to our Q1 results and more than 100 basis points for the full year. Second, regarding the divestiture of the SSI ultrasound business, in the same way we treat revenue from our divested blood screening business, we will be removing ultrasound revenue from both the current and prior year when calculating our organic growth rates in fiscal 2024. This ultrasound revenue was approximately $4.5 million in Q1 2023 and about $20 million for the full fiscal year. For fiscal 2024, we expect immaterial remaining ultrasound revenue of less than $1 million per quarter. And third, in terms of foreign exchange, we are assuming an FX tailwind of approximately $3 million for Q1 and a headwind of about $20 million for the full year. We anticipate the impact of the recently stronger US dollar to be more acutely felt in the back half of our fiscal 2024. Now turning to our divisional guidance. We expect that each base business will grow within our 5% to 7% framework for the full fiscal year at the midpoint. However, this may not be every division, every quarter, due to strong 2023 comps for certain businesses. Starting with core diagnostics, we expect the business to grow within our 5% to 7% long-term targets for the full fiscal year 2024, but likely below this level in Q1. Our first quarter growth rates will be impacted not only by the four extra selling days in the prior year period, but also strong non-COVID respiratory comps. As we plan for fiscal 2024, we are forecasting conservatively for menu items related to flu and RSV. At this point, we do not foresee a respiratory season in the first half of fiscal 2024 that mirrors last year. Closing out our non-COVID diagnostics business, we expect blood revenue of about $8 million in Q1 and about $30 million for the full year. In terms of COVID revenue, we expect COVID assay sales to be about $15 million in the first quarter of 2024 and about $40 million for the full year. COVID-related items are expected to be about $30 million in the first quarter and about $105 million for the full year. Moving to breast health, we expect fiscal 2024 to showcase strong demand for our product portfolio as supply chain challenges abate. As a reminder, due to supply chain challenges in the prior year, our growth rate in fiscal Q1 will likely be above trend. Therefore, as we move throughout the year and comps normalize, growth rates may recede. However, total revenue should increase as we begin to work through our elevated backlog. Finally, in surgical, we expect growth rates within our long-term target of 5% to 7% for the full year, but below this level for Q1. In our first quarter of fiscal 2024, surgical will be impacted by the four less selling days as well as the fact that we are lapping a pricing benefit from NovaSure's V5 product line extension. Moving next to margins, we expect a cadence of improvement throughout fiscal 2024 for both gross margin and operating margin as we work through higher costs during the year. For gross margin, we anticipate Q1 levels at approximately 60%, exiting the fiscal year in the low 60s. Similarly, our guidance assumes Q1 operating margins in the high 20s with a Q4 2024 exit rate in the low 30s. Continuing to work down the P&L, we expect Q1 to represent our highest quarter of operating expense in fiscal 2024. This is due to normal seasonal expenses associated with internal global sales meetings to kick off our fiscal year. For the balance of the year, we anticipate quarterly operating expense to be in line with the back half of our fiscal 2023. Below operating income, we estimate fiscal 2024 other income net to be approximately neutral in Q1 and an expense of between $40 million to $60 million for the full year. Our guidance is based on an annual effective tax rate of approximately 19.75% and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately $239 million for the full year. To conclude, our strong fourth quarter wrapped up a remarkable year for Hologic. As we move to our fiscal 2024, we remain focused on advancing women's health around the world while delivering on our promises and commitments to shareholders, employees, customers, and patients. With that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.\nPuneet Souda: Hi, Steve. Thanks for taking the questions. And thanks, Ryan, for the details there on financials. If I could ask two of my questions together. We've been getting a number of questions around USPSTF, it's right around the corner. Could you update us on your thoughts for co-testing versus primary at this point. Any change in how it could turn out to be grade A versus grade B? And if you're wondering -- if you're incorporating any of that impact in your 2024 guide. And then second part, Steve, is just with the FDA LDT regulation, do you think it changes the competitive landscape for Panther or for your approved diagnostic platforms? Thank you.\nStephen MacMillan: Sure, Puneet, let me take those first. USPSTF, we continue to think there's so much focus on this that's quite frankly a very little impact to our business. I'd remind you back in 2018 when the first guidelines were being updated at that point in time. They came out, they were against co-testing. By the time ultimately they came out as official, co-testing was put back in. We continue to feel very good about our business regardless of how they go. They also, obviously people have been focused on them for months and months, thinking they're coming every other day. We think it's a big do about nothing, to be quite candid. I feel great about our business, feel great about the data on co-testing, and feel great that regardless of how they go, the clinicians are going to stick with our business and there's going to be no change to our forecasts. So regarding the LBT thing, I think again, great question. It's part of where I view the strength of our business. First off, I think again that there's so much focus on what I call headline risks. To be clear, the LBT stuff won't come into effect probably until at least 2028. And there's going be issues that are going be battled between now and then, legislatively, everything else, so nothing that's going to impact the business over the next three years, probably the next five. At a bare minimum, however, we love where we're positioned in that most of us with our kidding and as you well know, from a Panther standpoint, it could create more opportunities. So the LBT thing probably creates more opportunity for us than it does risk. Having said that, we really just don't think much is going to happen on that over the next few years. So thanks. We know you probably have another call you want to get to too, Puneet.\nPuneet Souda: Right.\nStephen MacMillan: All right.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Jack Meehan with Nephron. Please go ahead.\nJack Meehan: Thank you. Good afternoon. And first, I hope Karleen and family are doing all right. And also Steve, appreciate the commitment to the capital return here to shareholders. I think that's great. I was wondering if you just on the business. [Multiple Speakers] I appreciate it. Okay can we talk about Panther, now that we're at the end of the year, are there any updated utilization stats you can share for the system? And second, the recent placement rates have slowed. I know there was some pull forward on placements that during the pandemic. I was just curious like how long you think this kind of lasts before hospitals and labs start expanding their fleets again. Thanks.\nStephen MacMillan: Yeah, great. I think the simplest thing on utilization is that our molecular business grew 18.9% last year, which is virtually all increased utilization on the Panthers. And we just love what we've done there. Clearly, as we said even at the start of last year, Panther placements for the next few years may be very small and frankly are almost immaterial to us growing the business, because at this point there were so many machines put out there as you know from everybody, but I think especially from us. Now it's really ramping up the menu with our existing customers. And an increased focus on expanding the Fusion. So I think the magic for us is now that we have so many Panthers installed, we're increasingly going back and getting the fusion sidecar put on, which opens up the PCR assays. And I think we continue to see years and years of growth, just even from the existing installed base, as we're expanding the menu and putting more fusions out there. So, Ryan, did you have anything you wanted to add?\nRyan Simon: Yeah, Jack, I'll add to that that our growth as we look forward is not predicated so much on placing additional panthers. This is really what Steve mentioned is, placing more assays on the system, expanding the Fusion footprint, as well as growing the volumes of the assays adopted so far.\nStephen MacMillan: And go Eagles.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nStephen MacMillan: Hey, Derik.\nDerik De Bruin: Hi, thanks for taking the call. Appreciate it. Just some, you commented on the pricing environment. Can you thought to what your sort of expectations are for pricing this year? And Ryan, just I know you said negative $40 million and negative $60 million expense for other all-in, But what's the interest expense on that, just to help preempt the model?\nStephen MacMillan: I'll take the first part and then kick it over to Ryan. In terms of pricing, overall, we're assuming very modest pricing. Most of our gains really are volume, given that a lot of our contracts are already set with very little pricing increase. And I think it's where we're very proud of the fiscal discipline that we've been able to exert. And then getting opportunistic pricing or pricing really as much mix as we launch new products, Derik, but very little of our growth is based on pricing at this point.\nRyan Simon: Yeah, and on that second piece, Derik, it's approximately $50 million in expense in that number. When you're looking at it from a high level, like looking at 2023 compared to 2024, the biggest difference there is, we're assuming less cash on the balance sheet going forward. And -- but to answer your question, it's going to be $50 million on that interest expense.\nDerik De Bruin: Great. I just want to clarify, if I can, the full ASR is embedded into the current guide for EPS?\nRyan Simon: Correct. Correct. Correct.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Donnelly: Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. Steve, maybe one on the breast health side. Obviously, you guys -- you had a bit of a backlog with the supply chain issues last year. Can you just talk about how you're working that down, what goes into the guide this year there? And then a second one, just on the margin piece. Yeah, I know we don't have Karlene, but maybe Ryan, just in terms of the moving pieces, as you think about the 2024 margin build, obviously COVID coming down, some high margin stuff, can you just talk about what you guys are doing to offset that and keep margins moving in the right direction? Thank you, guys.\nStephen MacMillan: Great, thanks. First in terms of the breast health business, I think we see clearly placing at least a double-digit increase in gantries this year, both domestically and internationally. We really got going more in our second fiscal quarter last year. So especially this first quarter we'll show much bigger growth for the breast health business. But I think we feel great about being able to continue to place the gantries and just based on the backlog alone, let alone the additional customers were winning. Quick first crack at the margin piece. The way I think about it is before Ryan comes in is, I think they will basically be lower in our first fiscal quarter and then growing through the year as we continue to bleed through the higher cost, especially chips in gantries. And we're also in the midst of relocating some of our manufacturing -- basically our manufacturing for our breast health business from Connecticut down to Delaware. So at the current time, we've got double costs as we do that. And I think we've got great visibility that those gross and operating margins will be improving throughout the year. I don\u2019t know if you want to add more to that.\nRyan Simon: Yeah, sure, Steve. So as we previously called out Q3, Q4, our expectation is that would be the trough with respect to operating margins. And as Steve mentioned, our expectation is to work up from there to the low 30s as an exit rate in 2024. Steve pointed to the fact that we're working past and farther away from the highest cost chips. Our breast business is also recovering, which is going to be a tailwind to margins as well. We did mention that we divested the SSI business, and that will also be a tailwind to margins as we go into 2024.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, team. This is Madison on for Tejas. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just firstly, I was wondering if you could elaborate on how you're thinking about international growth for 2024? I know you flagged the under-indexation to China as an advantage in the near term, but what's your combined exposure to China and the Middle East. And should any of that ongoing conflict weigh on the demand throughout the latter part of the Middle East region?\nStephen MacMillan: Sure, we have very little in the Middle East, and China is 2%. So between the two, it's call it 2% to 3%, really. So I think we love that from the current environment. And as it relates to international overall, I think we've continued to see our international business as being clearly accretive to the growth rates of the company. And really over the last number of years, it's been a double-digit grower and wouldn't count out that it couldn't do that again this year. So we've strengthened our international businesses significantly over time. Our breast health business getting stronger. Diagnostics has benefited hugely from all the additional Panther placements. So that's been growing tremendously internationally. And our surgical business after years of trying to work on reimbursement and getting products approved is really also starting to take off internationally as we said, a real nice grower here over last year. So I think we see all three franchises being in very good shape to grow here in 2024.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, this is Kevin on for Vijay. Just a clarifying question on the 4% to 7% base organic guidance for the full year. Does this include or exclude the four selling days impact, meaning excluding the impact would guide the 5% to 8%?\nStephen MacMillan: You got it exactly. Yes, we factored that in. So that's why it's actually -- yes, it's 5% to a little north of 8%.\nRyan Simon: And just a reminder that is ex-COVID.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. So just to follow up, if the guide excludes day's impact, why is the lower end of \u2013\nStephen MacMillan: No, it includes the day. The 4 to 7 is including, just to clarify.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, got it. And just to follow up then, you also highlighted new share repurchasing in fiscal first quarter and an accelerated repurchase program. Is this a change in your capital allocation priorities? It seems like M&A was a focus in previous quarters.\nStephen MacMillan: Yeah, as we reiterated, we continue to focus on M&A. Right now we're just having to think that one of the great acquisition opportunities is our own stock where it's priced and we're trying to send that signal very strongly, but we're continuing to look for external M&A as well. But we just love the position we're in. So it's not a change. It's just an extra opportunistic based on where the valuation of ourselves sits right now. Thanks, Kevin.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Tim Daley with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nTimothy Daley: Great, thanks. So, Steve, following up on the Fusion comments you made to Jack\u2019s question. Could you update us on the percent of the Panther install base currently Fusion enabled at the end of fiscal year 2023? And I guess, or similarly, what were the Fusion sidecar placements in 2023?\nStephen MacMillan: What I'll comment on is the current attachment rate and it's about 20% to the Panther install base.\nRyan Simon: Yes, and which is growing, but the way we look at it, it doesn't have to be a 100% because the key is we think about it per customer and so that each customer needs enough fusions to be able to deliver what they need for their products, so we've seen very nice growth We're not necessarily disclosing the exact numbers, but I really like the growth there. Okay, got it. Then, breast, just talk about healthy bookings, elevated backlog, great visibility in the 2024. Just, if you're going to help us, how much of the 2024 breast revenue expectations are currently covered in your backlog? Or direct visibility via hard orders? Just curious on the coverage rate for the year versus [Multiple Speakers].\nStephen MacMillan : Think about all of it, actually. If you look at it -- as you'll see in the 10-K, that basically we've got the orders in place for the year. Now we're going to continue to add orders to that for further out periods, but we're in great shape coming into the year.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Anthony Petrone with Mizuho Group. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Petrone: Thanks. Good afternoon. I also send condolences to Karleen and her family. Maybe the first one on Biotheranostics, just up 30% for the full year, and obviously still in the early days, as you mentioned, Steve, in your prepared comments, I'm just wondering when you think about, I guess, the synergy to the breast health business, you have 10,000 gantries out there, and I think there's two call points really for Biotheranostics, OBGYN and then possibly a little bit in radiology specifically. But how should we be thinking about how many of your breast health install base users are currently using biotherapeutics and how long will it take to sort of extract that entire synergy. And then specifically on margins for Ryan, just when we -- that trajectory from high 20s in the first quarter to low 30s, is that linear? Are there certain inflection points throughout the year? If so, what are they? Is it operating leverage or more in pricing at the gross margin line? Thanks.\nStephen MacMillan: Sure, Anthony. On the first one, it's a great question and I don't have the specifics. I think our Biotheranostics sales team has been out there really focusing on a number of key docs. And so as they're building it up, I do think we back to the early innings, still lots of opportunity to more broaden it with both our breast health as well as even our diagnostics, OBGYN salesforce. So still a lot of opportunity ahead to your point.\nRyan Simon: Yes, and Anthony, on the margins as we've stated in the commentary, looking to work up from the high 20s to the low 30s through the course of the year, it should be a relatively consistent trajectory up to that range. As I mentioned on the prior question, breast health recovery is a tailwind to the margins. The farther we get away from the higher-cost chips that are in our gantries as we progress throughout the year, that should be helpful as well. And again, the savings from SSI should be felt in the back half of the year as well.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Casey Woodring with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nCasey Woodring: Great. Thank you for taking our questions and my condolences to Karleen and her family. So I just wanted to talk about the surgical business. So growth this year is going to be within the LRP range coming off of 16% organic comp in 2023. Can you just talk about some of the growth drivers there? It sounds like international is a big piece of it. It sounds like pricing drove out performance this year as well. So can you just talk about how that business performed this year and the sustainability into next year? And then just one more quickly on the margins. So I think in 2023 you have baked in something around 200 basis points to 250 basis points of inflationary headwinds outside of that higher semi-chip costs. How should we think about that dynamic here in 2024? Thank you.\nStephen MacMillan: Sure. On the [indiscernible] business, I'd say we had everything working for us in 2023, including the NovaSure V5 launch that did have some pricing associated, really. It showed up more as mixed, but it was a higher priced product. And then I think, frankly, procedures were pretty good. But we fired across all cylinders. NovaSure, MyoSure, Fluent, and then also Boulder and Acessa, and did it both domestically and internationally. I think as we go into next year, MyoSure, Fluent and Boulder and Acessa all continue to look as very good growth. NovaSure will probably be back to flatish to possibly down a touch, but internationally, I think again, we see international being a solid double-digit grower in the year so feeling very good about our positions. I would tell you one of the biggest surprises to me probably over my almost decade now at Hologic has been the continued growth and the sheer scale of MyoSure as it continues to really grow the category. If we think about TAMs, the total available markets, never realized how big it would be and I think we're continuing to expand that market. So feeling very, very good about that. I'll let Ryan take the second part of that. Everybody's decided I can't handle margin questions. So I'll go ahead and let Ryan go ahead and take them.\nRyan Simon: Yeah, so I do want to clarify one comment that we made to Derik's question earlier. It is actually $50 million in income and $130 million in expense. So I had flip-flopped that in the prior question. And again, with respect to margins, kind of just reiterating the comments that we've made here, it is an expectation that we are going from, again, the high 20s to the low 30s. The biggest impacting driver, again, is the breast recovery and moving, again, farther away from the higher price chips.\nStephen MacMillan: Yeah, I think that's what gives us such confidence in the gross margin expansion to clarify that is, it is looking at the current inventory that's sitting on our balance sheet that is just going to flow through here on a effectively a first in first out basis so we can see those super high-priced chips that we got early and mid in the chip crisis bleeding through the product lines here in the first quarter. Really, by the first two quarters, most of that will be done. And it gives us great confidence as we continue to work through the year.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Navann Ty with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nNavann Ty: Hi, good afternoon. I just had a follow up on the M&A. Curious to know whether Hologic came across interesting deals since August, and do you see a healthy amount of sub-1 billion deals? Thank you.\nStephen MacMillan: Thanks, Navann. We continue to scour the landscape. You know, the bankers have been all over the place with lots of ideas. We frankly are in that great position where we can be patient. You know, if I still look at the landscape today, you've got a whole bunch of very smaller companies that went public in COVID time that are hemorrhaging cash and in bad shape. And a lot of those still don't fit our criteria. So then we're looking at other things that may be a little bit more established but the magic that we have for us right now is given our growth rates, given our profitability, we've got a pretty tight hurdle rate that not a lot of things are making it to the top. So I wouldn't expect anything super imminent as we continue to look at the landscape.\nNavann Ty: Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Mike Matson with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.\nMichael Matson: Yeah, thanks. So I want to ask one about the breast business, specifically the gantries. I guess, during -- when you had all the kind of supply chain issues, you talked about the orders were coming in and remaining strong. And so, and I know you've got a backlog now, but I guess what I'm wondering is, what is the ordering looking like? Because we have seen some kind of mixed signals out there about capital spending at the hospital level.\nStephen MacMillan: Yeah, we continue to feel good about it. You know, having been in this chair in a different company in the 2008, 2009 downturn. I'm always particularly attuned to trying to pay attention to concerns about capital freezes or capital tightening. I think we just feel great about where we are both in terms of the products we've already got the orders in, as well as continuing to get new orders. So we're booking candidly out beyond the current year at this stage, and just a lot of excitement still in our breast health business. I think what's hard for people to grasp is how much we've dramatically expanded our installed base to where we're so strong in the US and so many people just still coming to us. So really feeling very good about it.\nMichael Matson: Okay, got it. And then just on the international business, I mean, it's good to see that the growth is being so strong there. You sound pretty optimistic about the outlook. But, you know, I was wondering if you could maybe just talk about what's really driving the growth there. Is it expanding into new countries? Is it getting new products approved in your existing markets? Is it gaining share in existing markets? Is it maybe all of the above?\nStephen MacMillan: Yeah, I'm glad you asked it. I think the magic for us is it is all of the above. It's this incredible diverse growth that in very simple terms, if we actually do look almost country by country and franchise by franchise, and we were just with literally that the sales leaders of each country for each franchise in Dubai a couple of weeks ago. So I'm coming fresh off looking at all the plans. If I look at the UK, we have growth plans for diagnostics, not just diagnostics, but psychology as well as molecular in the UK. We've got plans for the breast health business and we have plans for surgical. And it is, it's bringing -- in the case of surgical, it's bringing those products into these markets. It's getting the reimbursement. And it's just been a lot of nothing sexy and no one big driver, which I actually think creates the excitement. And even as places like China have gotten a lot wonkier for most companies because we're small there, we're not counting on that for our growth. We're getting it everywhere else. But it's not sexy, But it's incredibly effective that it's literally every -- almost every franchise in every geography. And these hundreds of thousands here and there, as you keep adding them up, they become millions and millions and then tens of millions all through it. And I think it's creating this inexorable growth as we're bringing on new customers in each franchise. Thank you, Mike.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Andrew Brackmann with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Brackmann: Hi, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions and certainly sending condolences to Karleen here. I'll just stick to one on the innovation engine here. You guys have obviously done well sort of advancing the platforms through R&D and new launches, but how should we be thinking about major upgrades within the core franchises here over the next couple of years. Anything to call out there? So we'd be expecting, I guess, more singles and doubles moving forward. Thanks.\nStephen MacMillan: Sure, Andrew. I think we never want to over-hype anything, but we've got some neat things coming both, particularly organically in the breast health business, you know, diagnostics obviously, BV/CVs off to a tremendous start and, we're excited by that organic thing. And then working it out, but probably more in the continued singles doubles category that, hopefully over time, those singles and doubles turn into triples. I think if you look at Acessa and Boulder, they're growing very nicely, they're still very small. And so over time, I think the magic from where we sit today is we can see those franchises growing at above our company rate for the next five plus years at least. And I think that's the magic of what we have going here. So again, no one kind of back to Mike's question a little bit, no one product driving the growth, it's systematically coming across the product lines. And I think it creates a lot more durability.\nAndrew Brackmann: Okay. Thanks, guys.\nStephen MacMillan: Thanks, Andrew.\nRyan Simon: We have time for one more question.\nOperator: And we will take our final question from Andrew Cooper with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Cooper: Hey, thanks guys for squeezing me in. A lot's already been asked. So maybe just one, you mentioned booking out already into next year on the gantry business. Just what is the typical kind of visibility you have at this point looking into the year relative to maybe where you sit now with this big backlog? In other words, how much bigger is that backlog than it typically would be?\nStephen MacMillan: Yeah, it's clearly peaked. I think we've peaked up here in the last year, and now we will start to bleed that down. But we typically have reasonable visibility. By the way, it doesn't mean that an order can't be placed now, that we wouldn't ship sometime in the next quarter or so. It all depends on how they're scheduled and everything else. But I think we feel really good about where we sit.\nOperator: That concludes today's question and answer session. And this now concludes the Hologic fourth quarter fiscal 2023 earnings conference call. Have a good evening.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Stephen MacMillan",
            "content": "Thank you, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone. And before I get started, I just want to do a quick shout out to Karleen and her family and let everybody know our thoughts and prayers are with her today. We are pleased to discuss Hologic's financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Total revenue was $945.3 million and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.89. It was another strong quarter overall with revenue finishing at the high end of our range and EPS exceeding our guidance. Our fourth quarter capped off a tremendous year where we continued our track record of success, strengthened our business, and delivered on our commitments. For the full year, we posted $4.03 billion in revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $3.96. In 2023, quite frankly, we delivered some pretty exceptional organic growth rates, which were far above our longer-term targets. At the start of the year, we committed to deliver low double-digit growth across each division. In the end, we delivered more, growing annual organic revenue ex-COVID in the mid-teens at 15.6%, with every division growing north of 13% and international growth just above 20%. Despite various macro challenges, like clockwork, we continued to deliver, raising our financial guidance throughout the year and living up to our commitments. At the same time, our balance sheet remains incredibly strong and we have the financial flexibility to grow our business for the long term. For fiscal 2024, we are confident in our ability to deliver against our 5% to 7% ex-COVID long-term organic growth target, even against significant comps, one less selling week, and a challenging macro environment. In fact, if we look at 2024 on an adjusted daily sales basis, our annual organic revenue growth rate, excluding COVID, is projected to be in the 6% to 8% range. Whether adjusting for selling days or not, we believe our results will truly stand out from the crowd as we progress throughout fiscal 2024, particularly following a year of almost 16% growth ex-COVID in 2023. Before sharing more of our excitement for 2024, we will first reflect on our Q4 results. In Q4, we grew total organic revenue, excluding COVID, 16.7%, with double-digit growth in every division. We again delivered on our promises. At the division level, breast health grew 27.4%, driven primarily by the recovery in our gantry business. Interventional breast also posted a strong quarter, growing in the low double digits. We are pleased the division's gantry recovery is tracking to our expectations, following the industry's chip supply challenges. Moving on to diagnostics. Organic growth ex-COVID was 10.2%, again driven by our strong molecular business. Organic molecular diagnostics ex-COVID grew 15% for the quarter. Driven once again by strong contributions from BV, CV/TV, Amgen, and Biotheranostics. With fiscal 2023 revenue ex-COVID at $1.48 billion, our diagnostics business is over 40% larger than it was in 2019. Even more impressive, our base molecular business is now nearly 80%, eight zero percent larger than it was pre-pandemic. Molecular has grown through a combination of more than doubling our Panther installed base, adding new menu, gaining new customers, as well as acquisitions into adjacent markets. This transformation and durable performance speaks to the ongoing success of our growth strategy. Rounding out the divisions, surgical revenue at over $600 million in fiscal 2023 is now nearly 40% larger than what it was in 2019. In Q4, surgical grew 10.6%, driven primarily by MyoSure and Fluent, both growing double digits. In addition, our laparoscopic portfolio also grew double digits, albeit smaller in dollars compared to MyoSure and Fluent. More importantly, we are pleased our laparoscopic portfolio continues to gain traction. To close the overview of our quarterly results and fiscal 2023 highlights, our international business continue to be accretive to overall growth rates, growing north of 28% on an organic ex-COVID basis in Q4. We expect international to continue to be a key part of our growth story. Before moving on, I'd like to revisit and reinforce our capital allocation strategy. In short, our capital allocation strategy remains the same. We continue to prioritize M&A opportunities; and second, we consistently look to utilize cash towards share repurchases. And we continue to be patient. Having said that, we have recently seen the opportunity to deploy our cash balance more significantly, taking the following four actions. One, in Q4 2023 we deployed $238 million of capital to buy back 3.2 million shares. Second, in our current fiscal Q1 2024, we have already repurchased another 2.2 million shares for $150 million. Three, today we announced an additional $500 million accelerated share repurchase program. And four, we recently paid down $250 million of higher variable interest rate debt. Ryan will expand on both the ASR and debt repayment in his remarks. Looking back four plus years since the start of the pandemic, the biggest acquisition we have made is of ourselves. During this period, we deployed over $1.4 billion on M&A opportunities and nearly $2.3 billion on share repurchases, including our recent repurchases in Q1 2024. And today's ASR announcement will make that $2.8 billion. As you can see, we are very confident in our position for the years ahead. Rounding out our capital allocation discussion. To ensure we are optimized for the future, we carefully evaluate our portfolio on an ongoing basis. As a result, as mentioned in our release, we have recently divested our small SSI ultrasound business. Shifting gears, as we have shared on prior calls, we have broadly transformed our business and strengthened our fundamentals. Quarter-by-quarter, year-by-year, with macro hurdles ever present, we continue to prove our strength. Today, we are effectively a new Hologic, retooled and recapitalized with strong brands, wide modes, industry-leading margins, and the strongest, deepest leadership team we've ever had. Hologic is a differentiated and more competitive company than at any time in our 38-year history. At our core, we are fundamentally guided by our purpose, passion, and promise. Our purpose, to enable healthier lives everywhere, every day. Our passion, to champion women's health globally. And our promise, the science of sure, to provide health care professionals with clinically differentiated, high quality products. Across each division, we have distinct advantages created by our unique focus on elevating women's health through innovative products and trailblazing social initiatives like the Hologic Global Women's Health Index. We ultimately develop our leading positions by leaning into our purpose and proactively meeting our customers' and patients' needs. We will highlight three examples today. First, we are not only leaders in women's health, but we are also sector leaders in workflow automation. Our customers continue to deal with challenges, sourcing technicians, and the persistent pressure to efficiently manage costs. As a result, user-friendly systems and efficient workflow solutions are at the top of our customers' expectations. From our Panther instrument to our Brevera breast biopsy and Fluent systems, to name only a few, each product is designed to transform manual, labor-intensive, cumbersome processes into easy to use, dependable, and efficient workflows. Second, the massive footprint and sheer size of our installed bases in diagnostics and breast health provide a strong foundation in today's world. With more than 3,260 Panther instruments installed worldwide and over 10,000 mammography systems installed across the US, we have the opportunity to be integral partners with the laboratories, hospitals, and screening centers we support. For Panther, as customers add more menu and drive incremental volume, our molecular diagnostics business continues to grow, while also becoming more valuable to our customers and more deeply rooted in their operations. The same can be said for our breast health business. Hologic is unique in our ability to support our customers and their patients at each step along the breast care continuum. We differentiate ourselves with our ecosystem of technologies that integrate across a patient's journey, creating a more comfortable patient experience, greater clinical confidence for practitioners, and increased operational efficiencies for our customers. Moving on to our third example, our longstanding brand leadership across multiple product lines in each division, which yields strong, stable margins and steady cash flow generation. We are innovators and leaders in breast and cervical cancer screening, STI testing, abnormal uterine bleeding treatment, and fibroid removal. This is a significant statement given the strong competitors we face in each respective business. Our diversified leadership and scale across our business lines support industry leading margins and cash flow and in turn, we have the ability to further invest and grow our business. Altogether, we are emerging as a premier growth company, differentiated and more competitive, delivering strong growth across each division and international. As the new much stronger Hologic we are today, we consistently deliver and aim to continue to do so. Turning our attention to 2024, I will touch on some of the high-level growth drivers in each business, and Ryan will finish the call with further detail related to next year's guidance. First, in breast health, we expect 2024 to be another strong year of growth. With our gantry backlog remaining elevated compared to historic levels, we have greater visibility into our pipeline, translating to higher confidence in future gantry sales, creating another exciting year for breast health. In diagnostics, as in recent years, molecular will continue to drive growth for the division. We expect our large global Panther install base to continue to add new menu, while also increasing volume for existing assays. In addition, our Biotheranostics business, which we acquired in 2021, is expected to continue delivering double-digit growth, being accretive even to our molecular growth rate. In 2023, Biotheraenostics grew over 30%, and we are still in early innings growing the breast cancer index test. BCI is still the only test recognized by NCCN guidelines and the American Society of Clinical Oncology to predict which patients are likely to benefit from extended adjuvant therapy beyond five years, yet another example of an innovative and differentiated product. In surgical, MyoSure, our Fluent system, and our newer laparoscopic products that we acquired via Boulder and Acessa are projected to continue to drive growth. Internationally, surgical also continues to shine. In 2023, our international surgical growth rate was more than double the US growth rate. Surgical is clearly emerging as a strong and profitable growth driver. To conclude, entering 2024, we are a new and differentiated Hologic. We are bigger, stronger, and more competitive than ever. Our leadership brands, growth drivers across all three divisions, durable margin profile, and strong balance sheet will continue to power us forward. As we look ahead to 2024, we are poised to continue to grow and make an even bigger impact on women's health around the world. With that, let me hand the call over to Ryan. Sure, Puneet, let me take those first. USPSTF, we continue to think there's so much focus on this that's quite frankly a very little impact to our business. I'd remind you back in 2018 when the first guidelines were being updated at that point in time. They came out, they were against co-testing. By the time ultimately they came out as official, co-testing was put back in. We continue to feel very good about our business regardless of how they go. They also, obviously people have been focused on them for months and months, thinking they're coming every other day. We think it's a big do about nothing, to be quite candid. I feel great about our business, feel great about the data on co-testing, and feel great that regardless of how they go, the clinicians are going to stick with our business and there's going to be no change to our forecasts. So regarding the LBT thing, I think again, great question. It's part of where I view the strength of our business. First off, I think again that there's so much focus on what I call headline risks. To be clear, the LBT stuff won't come into effect probably until at least 2028. And there's going be issues that are going be battled between now and then, legislatively, everything else, so nothing that's going to impact the business over the next three years, probably the next five. At a bare minimum, however, we love where we're positioned in that most of us with our kidding and as you well know, from a Panther standpoint, it could create more opportunities. So the LBT thing probably creates more opportunity for us than it does risk. Having said that, we really just don't think much is going to happen on that over the next few years. So thanks. We know you probably have another call you want to get to too, Puneet. All right. Yeah, great. I think the simplest thing on utilization is that our molecular business grew 18.9% last year, which is virtually all increased utilization on the Panthers. And we just love what we've done there. Clearly, as we said even at the start of last year, Panther placements for the next few years may be very small and frankly are almost immaterial to us growing the business, because at this point there were so many machines put out there as you know from everybody, but I think especially from us. Now it's really ramping up the menu with our existing customers. And an increased focus on expanding the Fusion. So I think the magic for us is now that we have so many Panthers installed, we're increasingly going back and getting the fusion sidecar put on, which opens up the PCR assays. And I think we continue to see years and years of growth, just even from the existing installed base, as we're expanding the menu and putting more fusions out there. So, Ryan, did you have anything you wanted to add? And go Eagles. Hey, Derik. I'll take the first part and then kick it over to Ryan. In terms of pricing, overall, we're assuming very modest pricing. Most of our gains really are volume, given that a lot of our contracts are already set with very little pricing increase. And I think it's where we're very proud of the fiscal discipline that we've been able to exert. And then getting opportunistic pricing or pricing really as much mix as we launch new products, Derik, but very little of our growth is based on pricing at this point. Great, thanks. First in terms of the breast health business, I think we see clearly placing at least a double-digit increase in gantries this year, both domestically and internationally. We really got going more in our second fiscal quarter last year. So especially this first quarter we'll show much bigger growth for the breast health business. But I think we feel great about being able to continue to place the gantries and just based on the backlog alone, let alone the additional customers were winning. Quick first crack at the margin piece. The way I think about it is before Ryan comes in is, I think they will basically be lower in our first fiscal quarter and then growing through the year as we continue to bleed through the higher cost, especially chips in gantries. And we're also in the midst of relocating some of our manufacturing -- basically our manufacturing for our breast health business from Connecticut down to Delaware. So at the current time, we've got double costs as we do that. And I think we've got great visibility that those gross and operating margins will be improving throughout the year. I don't know if you want to add more to that. Sure, we have very little in the Middle East, and China is 2%. So between the two, it's call it 2% to 3%, really. So I think we love that from the current environment. And as it relates to international overall, I think we've continued to see our international business as being clearly accretive to the growth rates of the company. And really over the last number of years, it's been a double-digit grower and wouldn't count out that it couldn't do that again this year. So we've strengthened our international businesses significantly over time. Our breast health business getting stronger. Diagnostics has benefited hugely from all the additional Panther placements. So that's been growing tremendously internationally. And our surgical business after years of trying to work on reimbursement and getting products approved is really also starting to take off internationally as we said, a real nice grower here over last year. So I think we see all three franchises being in very good shape to grow here in 2024. You got it exactly. Yes, we factored that in. So that's why it's actually -- yes, it's 5% to a little north of 8%. No, it includes the day. The 4 to 7 is including, just to clarify. Yeah, as we reiterated, we continue to focus on M&A. Right now we're just having to think that one of the great acquisition opportunities is our own stock where it's priced and we're trying to send that signal very strongly, but we're continuing to look for external M&A as well. But we just love the position we're in. So it's not a change. It's just an extra opportunistic based on where the valuation of ourselves sits right now. Thanks, Kevin. What I'll comment on is the current attachment rate and it's about 20% to the Panther install base. Think about all of it, actually. If you look at it -- as you'll see in the 10-K, that basically we've got the orders in place for the year. Now we're going to continue to add orders to that for further out periods, but we're in great shape coming into the year. Sure, Anthony. On the first one, it's a great question and I don't have the specifics. I think our Biotheranostics sales team has been out there really focusing on a number of key docs. And so as they're building it up, I do think we back to the early innings, still lots of opportunity to more broaden it with both our breast health as well as even our diagnostics, OBGYN salesforce. So still a lot of opportunity ahead to your point. Sure. On the [indiscernible] business, I'd say we had everything working for us in 2023, including the NovaSure V5 launch that did have some pricing associated, really. It showed up more as mixed, but it was a higher priced product. And then I think, frankly, procedures were pretty good. But we fired across all cylinders. NovaSure, MyoSure, Fluent, and then also Boulder and Acessa, and did it both domestically and internationally. I think as we go into next year, MyoSure, Fluent and Boulder and Acessa all continue to look as very good growth. NovaSure will probably be back to flatish to possibly down a touch, but internationally, I think again, we see international being a solid double-digit grower in the year so feeling very good about our positions. I would tell you one of the biggest surprises to me probably over my almost decade now at Hologic has been the continued growth and the sheer scale of MyoSure as it continues to really grow the category. If we think about TAMs, the total available markets, never realized how big it would be and I think we're continuing to expand that market. So feeling very, very good about that. I'll let Ryan take the second part of that. Everybody's decided I can't handle margin questions. So I'll go ahead and let Ryan go ahead and take them. Yeah, I think that's what gives us such confidence in the gross margin expansion to clarify that is, it is looking at the current inventory that's sitting on our balance sheet that is just going to flow through here on a effectively a first in first out basis so we can see those super high-priced chips that we got early and mid in the chip crisis bleeding through the product lines here in the first quarter. Really, by the first two quarters, most of that will be done. And it gives us great confidence as we continue to work through the year. Thanks, Navann. We continue to scour the landscape. You know, the bankers have been all over the place with lots of ideas. We frankly are in that great position where we can be patient. You know, if I still look at the landscape today, you've got a whole bunch of very smaller companies that went public in COVID time that are hemorrhaging cash and in bad shape. And a lot of those still don't fit our criteria. So then we're looking at other things that may be a little bit more established but the magic that we have for us right now is given our growth rates, given our profitability, we've got a pretty tight hurdle rate that not a lot of things are making it to the top. So I wouldn't expect anything super imminent as we continue to look at the landscape. Yeah, we continue to feel good about it. You know, having been in this chair in a different company in the 2008, 2009 downturn. I'm always particularly attuned to trying to pay attention to concerns about capital freezes or capital tightening. I think we just feel great about where we are both in terms of the products we've already got the orders in, as well as continuing to get new orders.

And these hundreds of thousands here and there, as you keep adding them up, they become millions and millions and then tens of millions all through it. And I think it's creating this inexorable growth as we're bringing on new customers in each franchise. Thank you, Mike. Sure, Andrew. I think we never want to over-hype anything, but we've got some neat things coming both, particularly organically in the breast health business, you know, diagnostics obviously, BV/CVs off to a tremendous start and, we're excited by that organic thing. And then working it out, but probably more in the continued singles doubles category that, hopefully over time, those singles and doubles turn into triples.

            "name": "Ryan Simon",
            "content": "Thank you, Cynthia. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Hologic's fourth quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call. With me Today is Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Pfficer; Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer, is currently on bereavement and will not be joining us today. Karleen is with family and I will be covering for her on our call. Please join me in wishing Karleen and her family well. Our fourth quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We will also post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them, as well as an updated corporate presentation. And a replay of this call will be available on our website for the next 30 days. Before we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements we make today will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor Statement included in our earnings release and SEC filing. Also during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Two of these non-GAAP measures are: one, organic revenue, which we define as revenue excluding divested businesses and revenue from acquired businesses owned by Hologic for less than one year; and two, organic revenue excluding COVID-19, which excludes COVID-19 assay revenue, revenue related to COVID-19, and sales from discontinued products in diagnostics. Finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis and revenue growth rates will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic CEO. Thank you, Steve. And again, good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will touch on our fourth quarter financial results, recap our annual performance for certain items, and end with our fiscal 2024 guidance for Q1 and the full year. We are pleased to close out fiscal 2023 with yet another strong quarter of growth and profitability. In our fourth quarter, total revenue was $945.3 million, and again, we delivered double-digit organic revenue growth, growing 16.7% excluding the impact of COVID. In addition, our Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.89, growing 8.5% compared to the prior year despite significantly less COVID testing revenue. For the full year 2023, total revenue was $4.03 billion. Organic ex-COVID revenue grew 15.6% and non-GAAP earnings per share were $3.96. These are exceptional results in what has been an unpredictable operating environment. Now moving to a brief discussion of our divisional revenue. In diagnostics, global revenue of $416.4 million declined 20.6%. However, excluding COVID assay and COVID-related revenues, the division grew 10.2% in the quarter. Performance was again led by molecular diagnostics, growing 15% in the period ex-COVID. For the year, molecular posted very strong global growth of 18.9% ex-COVID. As Steve highlighted, growth continues to be driven by increasing Panther utilization, turbocharged by a much larger install base, and strong performance from biotherapeutics. Moving next to our COVID results, which exceeded our previous guidance. COVID assay revenue in our fourth quarter was $21 million, and COVID-related revenue, inclusive of a small amount of revenue from discontinued products and diagnostics, was $24 million. Staying in diagnostics, our cytology and perinatal business increased 1.3% in our fourth quarter, a solid result following outsized growth in our preceding third quarter due to the timing of certain larger orders. Moving to breast health, total fourth quarter breast health revenue of $352.8 million increased 27.4%. The division's healthy bookings and elevated backlogs provides us excellent visibility to meet customer needs and financial targets in fiscal 2024 and beyond. Continuing next to surgical, fourth quarter revenue of $148 million increased 10.6% compared to the prior year. Surgical's fourth quarter closes out a year in which the business grew a tremendous 15.8% organically, excluding the impact of Boulder in Q1. And finally, in our skeletal business, fourth quarter revenue of $28 million was also strong, increasing 15.9%. Now let's move on to the rest of the non-GAAP P&L for the fourth quarter. Gross margin of 60.4% was driven by strong performance in our base business. However, this result was partially depressed by certain elevated costs, including higher cost inventory from previously procured semiconductor chips. Moving down the P&L, fourth quarter operating expenses of $303.7 million decreased approximately 8%. This decrease was driven by lower marketing spend in the period compared to the prior year, primarily due to the timing of expenses associated with our WTA partnership. The low operating income, other income represented a gain in our fiscal fourth quarter. We benefited from higher interest rates on our cash balance, driving elevated levels of interest income. In addition, we realized gains on our interest rate hedge, helping to lower interest expense for our floating rate debt. Finally, our tax rate in Q4 was 19.75% as expected. Putting these pieces together, operating margin for Q4 came in at 28.3% and net margin was 23.2%. As we have previously discussed, we expect operating margin to improve from this level throughout fiscal 2024. Finally, non-GAAP net income finished at $219.3 million, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.89 cents. Moving on from the P&L, cash flow from operations was $258.7 million in the fourth quarter, capping off a year in which we generated over $1 billion in operating cash flow. As Steve outlined, we were actively repurchasing our shares in Q4 2023, as well as the start of Q1 2024. For the full year 2023, we spent $500 million to repurchase 6.8 million shares. Even so, we ended the fourth quarter with $2.7 billion of cash on our balance sheet and a net leverage ratio of 0.1 times. Lastly, after the end of our fiscal fourth quarter, we completed one important capital market transaction and intend to enter into another. First, we repaid $250 million of floating rate debt associated with our credit agreement. This debt pay down helps to further protect our balance sheet against the risk of rising interest rates. And second, as Steve mentioned, we continue to bet on ourselves and announce a $500 million ASR, showcasing our resolute belief in the value of our business as we look to benefit from the stock market's underappreciation of our intrinsic value. Now let's move on to our non-GAAP financial guidance for the first quarter and full fiscal year. For our Q1, we are expecting total revenue in the range of $960 million to $985 million and EPS of $0.92 to $0.97. For the full year 2024, our guidance assumes revenue of $3.92 to $4.02 billion and EPS of $3.90 to $4.10. As you reconcile our guidance to your models, we would like to call out three specific items pertaining to full-year total revenue. One, the headwind of four less selling days in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023, which is about $40 million. Two, the divestiture of the SSI ultrasound business, about a $20 million headwind. And three, the impact of FX, also about a $20 million headwind. First, with respect to selling days, our fiscal 2023 was a 53 week year. In fiscal 2024, we have four less selling days compared to 2023, specifically within Q1. We estimate the impact of the four less selling days to be a headwind of about 400 basis points to our Q1 results and more than 100 basis points for the full year. Second, regarding the divestiture of the SSI ultrasound business, in the same way we treat revenue from our divested blood screening business, we will be removing ultrasound revenue from both the current and prior year when calculating our organic growth rates in fiscal 2024. This ultrasound revenue was approximately $4.5 million in Q1 2023 and about $20 million for the full fiscal year. For fiscal 2024, we expect immaterial remaining ultrasound revenue of less than $1 million per quarter. And third, in terms of foreign exchange, we are assuming an FX tailwind of approximately $3 million for Q1 and a headwind of about $20 million for the full year. We anticipate the impact of the recently stronger US dollar to be more acutely felt in the back half of our fiscal 2024. Now turning to our divisional guidance. We expect that each base business will grow within our 5% to 7% framework for the full fiscal year at the midpoint. However, this may not be every division, every quarter, due to strong 2023 comps for certain businesses. Starting with core diagnostics, we expect the business to grow within our 5% to 7% long-term targets for the full fiscal year 2024, but likely below this level in Q1. Our first quarter growth rates will be impacted not only by the four extra selling days in the prior year period, but also strong non-COVID respiratory comps. As we plan for fiscal 2024, we are forecasting conservatively for menu items related to flu and RSV. At this point, we do not foresee a respiratory season in the first half of fiscal 2024 that mirrors last year. Closing out our non-COVID diagnostics business, we expect blood revenue of about $8 million in Q1 and about $30 million for the full year. In terms of COVID revenue, we expect COVID assay sales to be about $15 million in the first quarter of 2024 and about $40 million for the full year. COVID-related items are expected to be about $30 million in the first quarter and about $105 million for the full year. Moving to breast health, we expect fiscal 2024 to showcase strong demand for our product portfolio as supply chain challenges abate. As a reminder, due to supply chain challenges in the prior year, our growth rate in fiscal Q1 will likely be above trend. Therefore, as we move throughout the year and comps normalize, growth rates may recede. However, total revenue should increase as we begin to work through our elevated backlog. Finally, in surgical, we expect growth rates within our long-term target of 5% to 7% for the full year, but below this level for Q1. In our first quarter of fiscal 2024, surgical will be impacted by the four less selling days as well as the fact that we are lapping a pricing benefit from NovaSure's V5 product line extension. Moving next to margins, we expect a cadence of improvement throughout fiscal 2024 for both gross margin and operating margin as we work through higher costs during the year. For gross margin, we anticipate Q1 levels at approximately 60%, exiting the fiscal year in the low 60s. Similarly, our guidance assumes Q1 operating margins in the high 20s with a Q4 2024 exit rate in the low 30s. Continuing to work down the P&L, we expect Q1 to represent our highest quarter of operating expense in fiscal 2024. This is due to normal seasonal expenses associated with internal global sales meetings to kick off our fiscal year. For the balance of the year, we anticipate quarterly operating expense to be in line with the back half of our fiscal 2023. Below operating income, we estimate fiscal 2024 other income net to be approximately neutral in Q1 and an expense of between $40 million to $60 million for the full year. Our guidance is based on an annual effective tax rate of approximately 19.75% and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately $239 million for the full year. To conclude, our strong fourth quarter wrapped up a remarkable year for Hologic. As we move to our fiscal 2024, we remain focused on advancing women's health around the world while delivering on our promises and commitments to shareholders, employees, customers, and patients. With that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions. Yeah, Jack, I'll add to that that our growth as we look forward is not predicated so much on placing additional panthers. This is really what Steve mentioned is, placing more assays on the system, expanding the Fusion footprint, as well as growing the volumes of the assays adopted so far. Yeah, and on that second piece, Derik, it's approximately $50 million in expense in that number. When you're looking at it from a high level, like looking at 2023 compared to 2024, the biggest difference there is, we're assuming less cash on the balance sheet going forward. And -- but to answer your question, it's going to be $50 million on that interest expense. Correct. Correct. Correct. Yeah, sure, Steve. So as we previously called out Q3, Q4, our expectation is that would be the trough with respect to operating margins. And as Steve mentioned, our expectation is to work up from there to the low 30s as an exit rate in 2024. Steve pointed to the fact that we're working past and farther away from the highest cost chips. Our breast business is also recovering, which is going to be a tailwind to margins as well. We did mention that we divested the SSI business, and that will also be a tailwind to margins as we go into 2024. And just a reminder that is ex-COVID. Yes, and which is growing, but the way we look at it, it doesn't have to be a 100% because the key is we think about it per customer and so that each customer needs enough fusions to be able to deliver what they need for their products, so we've seen very nice growth We're not necessarily disclosing the exact numbers, but I really like the growth there. Okay, got it. Then, breast, just talk about healthy bookings, elevated backlog, great visibility in the 2024. Just, if you're going to help us, how much of the 2024 breast revenue expectations are currently covered in your backlog? Or direct visibility via hard orders? Just curious on the coverage rate for the year versus [Multiple Speakers]. Yes, and Anthony, on the margins as we've stated in the commentary, looking to work up from the high 20s to the low 30s through the course of the year, it should be a relatively consistent trajectory up to that range. As I mentioned on the prior question, breast health recovery is a tailwind to the margins. The farther we get away from the higher-cost chips that are in our gantries as we progress throughout the year, that should be helpful as well. And again, the savings from SSI should be felt in the back half of the year as well. Yeah, so I do want to clarify one comment that we made to Derik's question earlier. It is actually $50 million in income and $130 million in expense. So I had flip-flopped that in the prior question. And again, with respect to margins, kind of just reiterating the comments that we've made here, it is an expectation that we are going from, again, the high 20s to the low 30s. The biggest impacting driver, again, is the breast recovery and moving, again, farther away from the higher price chips. We have time for one more question."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Hologic's Third Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Cynthia, and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute. I would now like to introduce Ryan Simon, Vice President, Investor Relations, to begin the call. Please go ahead.\nRyan Simon: Thank you, Cynthia. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Hologic's third quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer. Our third quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We will also post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them, as well as an updated corporate presentation. And a replay of this call will be available on our website for the next 30 days. Before we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements we make today will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the safe harbor statement included in our earnings release and SEC filings. Also during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Two of these non-GAAP measures are one, organic revenue which we define as revenue excluding the divested blood screening business and revenue from acquired businesses owned by Hologic for less than one year; and two, organic revenue, excluding COVID-19, which excludes COVID-19 assay revenue, revenue related to COVID-19 and sales from discontinued products in Diagnostics. Finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis and revenue growth rates will be in constant currency, unless otherwise noted. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO.\nStephen MacMillan: Thank you, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to discuss our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Our results were solid. Total revenue was $984 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.93. Revenue exceeded our prior guidance and EPS finished at the high end of our range. These results showcase the power of our transformed business and demonstrate that Hologic is built for the long-term with the broadest, strongest foundation we've ever had. On top of this transformation, with our strong cash flow and outstanding balance sheet, we continue to operate from a position of strength, with strong operational discipline as we forge ahead. Once again, the proof is in the numbers. Total company organic growth, excluding COVID was rather remarkable at 18.4%. By division, we posted 11.8% organic diagnostics growth ex-COVID and 14.5% growth in Surgical. Standing alone, these growth rates are impressive. Given a wider context, we view these performances as exceptionally strong, because we delivered these results on top of 15% growth in Diagnostics and 9.7% growth in Surgical in Q3 of 2022, both very high bars from a year ago. And in Breast Health, as expected, we delivered another strong quarter of 27.5% growth as chip supply and gantry availability continue to improve and track to our expectations. For this fiscal year, we remain on pace to achieve or exceed our 2023 low double-digit organic growth targets, excluding COVID. In fact, our expected growth rate for fiscal '23 is now more than double our 5% to 7% long-term growth target. Based on our strong performance for a number of quarters now, combined with our continued confidence in our growth ahead, we've recently given serious consideration to raising our long-term target. But given the uncertain macro environment we face, 5% to 7% is still very much a solid long-term outlook. Put simply, there are two reasons why. First, as you all well know, growing 5% to 7% on top of double-digit growth is clearly more challenging than growing 5% to 7% against single-digit comps. For example, in fiscal 2024, we will lap several prior periods of double-digit growth throughout the year. Net, we'll be entering 2024 already much bigger and stronger than when we first set the goal. And second, there are macro business and geopolitical challenges that persist today, which did not exist back in 2021 when we first set our guide. We will expand on this aspect later in today's call. Taken together, overcoming this combination of challenges, while maintaining 5% to 7% growth is in some ways an even last year goal than when we first established it. On that note, let's move on to our focus for today. First, we will highlight the strengths of our business that underpin our strong Q3 results. Our strengths are diverse and durable. And second, with a discussion of the unique advantages we provide our customers, we hope you'll share our confidence that Hologic is built for the long-term. Moving forward to our Q3 growth drivers. As mentioned, excluding COVID, each division posted double-digit organic growth for the quarter. Equally impressive is the year-over-year consistency of our growth drivers, a direct result of execution against our business strategy. In Diagnostics, the division's overall 11.8% organic growth rate, excluding COVID, was again driven by strong performance in molecular. For the quarter, Molecular Diagnostics posted approximately 13% growth ex-COVID, on top of growing over 20% a year ago. Growth in molecular was driven by a combination of both newer assays like BV, CV/TV and contributions from Amgen and HSV, each growing well into the double digits as well as strong growth from our longstanding women's health menu. Rounding out Molecular Diagnostics, our Biotheranostics acquisition continues to shine, being both accretive to our top and bottom lines. Cytology and Perinatal led by cytology, also contributed strong growth this quarter, growing nearly 10%. Cytology's elevated growth for Q3 was driven by the timing of a few large orders placed in the last week of the quarter before the extended July 4 holiday. We view this as a one-time lift as opposed to a shift in the trajectory of the business. That said, co-testing, which includes the Pap+HPV continues to be the preferred cervical cancer screening method for medical practitioners. These are the same practitioners who are on the front lines who know the science and who have seen the overwhelmingly positive impact of the Pap and co-testing firsthand. By our estimates, nearly 99% of cervical cancer screening today in the United States is performed using a combination of the Pap alone or co-testing. Why? The reason is clear. The Pap test has been the most successful cancer screening test in history. Since the Pap was introduced over 80 years ago, the rate of cervical cancer, which was the leading cause of death among women, has fallen by more than 70%. As an advocate of women's health for over 35 years, we continue to support best-in-class care for women, and for cervical cancer screening, the gold standard is co-testing with ThinPrep, the Pap+HPV. Shifting to Breast Health. As expected, we posted another exceptional quarter, growing revenue 27.5%. This strong performance was driven primarily by the ongoing return of our Mammography business as well as solid contributions from service. In Mammography, as we guided in May, we delivered more gantries in Q3 than Q1 and slightly less than in Q2. Demand for our clinically differentiated gantries remains high. In addition, our backlog is still at historically elevated levels. We are in great shape to work down this backlog to more normal levels throughout our fiscal 2024 and possibly beyond. In breast service, our business continues to grow and is becoming an even larger part of the division's mix. Our strong service performance represents stable contracted recurring revenue and demonstrates deepening relationships with our customers. Now moving on to Surgical and our International business. The newer pillars of growth for our company that may not be fully appreciated. In Surgical, the business continues to grow stronger for longer, growing 14.5% in Q3. Revenue growth was again driven by MyoSure and the Fluent Fluid Management System. With contributions from NovaSure V5 and our newer laparoscopic portfolio. Specifically, while still early days in smaller dollars, Bolder continues its strong growth as we leverage our relationships with our GYN customers and explore adjacent surgical channels. The transformation of our Surgical business over recent years has been phenomenal. It underscores the value of both internal innovation plus product line additions through M&A, a winning formula across Hologic. In Surgical, the sum of both strategies has injected new life into the business and transformed it into a meaningful growth driver for the company. Our international business also continues to impress, growing 20.9% in the quarter, excluding COVID. In May, our global leadership team traveled to our Brussels office as part of our annual strategic planning process, spending a week in Brussels reinforced a sense of pride within our leadership team. We are proud of the strides we've made expanding our global footprint and even more important, we are proud of the energy and culture we've built around the world. Coupled with a strong base of talent we have developed over the past few years. We firmly believe our highly engaged workforce and purpose-driven culture truly set us apart. As we've said before, the revenue growth rate for our international business is accretive to our overall growth rate. We expect this trend to continue throughout our long-term horizon. Related, earlier in today's call, we referenced persistent macro challenges in the context of our long-term guide. When we first announced our 5% to 7% guide, we were expecting tailwinds in places like China and Russia, rather than the headwinds they have become. Despite these challenges, we remain committed to our targets and with strong performance in other geographies where we operate, our international growth remains on track. This is a testament to the commitment, grit, and determination of all our employees that support and drive our efforts around the world. Now shifting gears to discuss the advantage we provide to our customers and how we are poised for long-term success. To fully appreciate where we're going, we must reflect on where we've been. From there, we will shed light on our unwavering patient and customer focus, which sets the stage for our bright future. Our transformation has been years in the making. It started even before COVID and as we know, accelerated during the pandemic. In the early days of COVID, when fear and uncertainty led to closures and shutdowns, we delivered our highly accurate COVID molecular diagnostic tests around the globe, playing a pivotal role in helping get the world back on its feet. With COVID surges and high testing volumes now further in the rearview mirror, our ongoing performance shows that we are much more than a great pandemic story. Without a doubt, we are a bigger, stronger company with more durable and diverse growth drivers and positioned well for the long haul. On top of this transformation, with our strong cash flow and exceptional balance sheet, we operate today from a position of strength and continue to exercise operational discipline. As we look ahead, we are laser focused on our purpose, passion and promise and never lose sight of the needs of our patients and our customers. This is the magic within our business. Today, our customers face the challenge of navigating this new operating environment. They seek vendors who can help them operate as efficiently as possible. For labs and hospitals, pressures from inflation and labor shortages remain despite recent improvement. With efficiency a priority, when our customers think of Hologic, they see opportunity. The opportunity to consolidate around our portfolio of products in Diagnostics, Breast Health and Surgical that offer innovative solutions to dramatically improve their operational efficiency. Seconds can turn to minutes and days of time and labor savings throughout the course of a year. In each of our businesses, we feature products that streamline workflows and create real advantages that our customers not only love, but need. From our sophisticated automation with Panther and advances in AI with digital cytology and Diagnostics to our industry-leading gantry scan speed, and streamlined biopsy process with Brevera in Breast Health. And finally, our efficient fluid management approach with Fluent in Surgical. Workflow efficiency is in the DNA of our entire portfolio. In addition, the fact that we have specialized service teams to focus on the unique needs of our customers adds to our competitive advantage. Our customers know that when they choose Hologic, they not only receive world-class products but also world-class service. Between our robust portfolio of industry-leading products and specialized service capabilities, we create a very attractive opportunity for our customers. We offer real and measurable efficiencies that improve their bottom lines. And more importantly, improve the standard of care for patients. This combination sets us up well to meet our customers' needs, both today and into the future. and creates an incredible pathway for Hologic's success. In closing, there are many companies that can sell products. There are fewer who can consistently deliver so many leadership brands and sector-leading margins over the long-term and there are even fewer who can succeed financially, while also helping the world. At Hologic, we do all three. We are tremendously proud to continue our journey, delivering outstanding top-line growth and profitability. Driving value for all our stakeholders and further enabling our ability to make a profound impact on patients' lives and women's health around the world. With that, I will now turn the call over to Karleen.\nKarleen Oberton: Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my statements today, we will briefly revisit our divisional revenue results, walk down our income statement, and speak to a few balance sheet and cash flow items. We will wrap up with our guidance for the full-year and fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. As Steve highlighted, our third quarter financial results were strong, showcasing the durability of our business and the diversified contributions to our growth. Total revenue came in at $984 million, exceeding our estimates, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.93, meeting the high end of our previous guidance range. Now starting with our divisional revenue performance. In Diagnostics, global revenue of $439.7 million declined 21.3%. However, excluding COVID assay and related ancillary revenues, the division grew 11.8% in the quarter. We are once again thrilled by the solid performance, which reinforces the underlying strength of our Diagnostics business. As Steve shared, Molecular Diagnostics grew approximately 13% during our third quarter, excluding the impact of COVID. Additionally, the Cytology and Perinatal business posted nearly 10% growth in our fiscal third quarter. For reasons previously discussed, when modeling, we would advise not to extrapolate this level of growth going forward to our Cytology and Perinatal segment. Moving to Breast Health. Total third quarter revenue of $360.3 million increased 27.5%. In conjunction with our Q2 performance, these results provide further evidence of strong demand for the division's portfolio of products and services. While the current cares revenue growth rate was assisted by supply chain headwinds in the prior year, we are encouraged by the trajectory of the business and the increasing predictability of our semiconductor chip supply. Moving next to Surgical. Third quarter revenue of $157.3 million increased nearly 15% compared to the prior year. Our internal R&D efforts, international execution, and recent laparoscopic acquisitions are contributed to an increasingly diverse and robust business. And finally, in our Skeletal business, revenue of $27.1 million was also very strong, increasing 25%. Now let's move on to the rest of the non-GAAP P&L for the third quarter. Gross margin of 60.8% was driven by strong performance in our base business, and COVID-19 testing revenues, which came in slightly above our expectations. Total operating expenses of $313.9 million in the third quarter increased nominally by 0.9%. This increase was driven by higher sales and R&D expenses, but partially offset by lower marketing spend. Below operating income, other income once again represented a gain in our fiscal third quarter. We continue to benefit from higher interest rates as interest income from our cash balance of nearly $2.8 billion, and the favorable impact of our interest rate hedge has more than offset higher interest expense on our floating rate debt. Our tax rate in Q3 was 21.4%, higher than previously anticipated. The increase in this quarter's effective tax rate represents a cumulative catch-up in the current period to increase our annual tax rate from 19% to 19.75%. The increase in our tax rate for fiscal 2023 is driven by stronger than forecasted domestic performance and losses outside the U.S., which we cannot claim benefit from at this time. Putting these pieces together, operating margin for Q3 came in at 28.9% and net margin was 23.5%. Non-GAAP net income finished at $231.3 million and non-GAAP EPS was $0.93. Finally, while up to this point, we have discussed non-GAAP financial metrics, we feel it's important to call out a non-cash impairment charge related to Mobidiag, which is excluded from our non-GAAP results. To be clear, we continue to be excited about Mobidiag and its long-term potential. As we've previously shared, due to various challenges our entry to the U.S. market will be materially beyond our initial deal model expectations. During our annual strategic planning process in Q3 the need to lower the carrying value of primarily Mobidiag's intangible assets became evident. As a result, we booked a GAAP write-down of $197 million in the quarter specific to Mobidiag, which primarily impacts cost, but also operating expenses. Moving on from the P&L. Cash flow from operations was $332.7 million in our third quarter. We ended the quarter with $2.77 billion of cash on our balance sheet and a net leverage ratio of 0.1x. In addition, we repurchased 1.4 million shares of $114 million in the period. Year-to-date, we have purchased 3.6 million shares of $264 million. As it relates to our longer-term capital allocation strategy, we continue to operate from a position of strength with underlying strong organic growth in each of our businesses. With the growth and margin profile we have today, our hurdle rate to achieve accretion is notably higher than in years past. In addition, we want to make clear that while we are now open to looking at transactions that could be slightly larger, these are by no means the only targets in our funnel. We are prioritizing the right deals not necessarily larger deals and continue to be active, diligent, and patient. Now let's move on to our updated non-GAAP financial guidance for the fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2023. For the full-year fiscal 2023, we are again increasing our guidance at midpoints and expect total revenue in the range of $3.995 billion to $4.035 billion and EPS of $3.87 to $3.94. With only one quarter remaining in our fiscal year, this annual guidance implies revenue of $910 million to $950 million and EPS of $0.80 to $0.87 for our fiscal fourth quarter. With respect to foreign exchange, we are assuming an FX headwind of slightly less than $40 million for the full-year, a marginal improvement compared to our previous guidance. Turning to our divisions. We want to reiterate that each business should grow double-digits in our fiscal 2023, excluding the impact of COVID. However, it is important to remember that 2023 is a unique fiscal year. As a reminder, part of our elevated growth this year has been due to weak comps from supply chain headwinds and COVID's impact on procedural volumes in fiscal 2022. In addition, 2023 is a 53-week fiscal year. Therefore, as we move closer to our fiscal 2024, as Steve discussed, it is appropriate to model our base business revenue growth within our previously outlined 5% to 7% long-term range. Reinforce Steve's comments, this growth is even more impressive than when we introduced the target given our recent base business outperformance and headwinds from the macro environment. Starting with Diagnostics. We expect to close out the year with another strong quarter led by molecular. Our growth continues to be driven by improving utilization and menu expansion on Panther, coupled with increasing contribution from Biotheranostics. Closing out non-COVID diagnostics, we expect blood revenue approximately $35 million for the year. In terms of COVID revenue, we expect COVID assay sales to be approximately $10 million in our fourth quarter of 2023 and slightly more than $235 million for the full-year. COVID related items are expected to be slightly more than $25 million in the fourth quarter and slightly less than $120 million for the full-year. As we look forward with COVID testing revenue, demand and public concern for the disease continue to abate. Therefore, although we plan financially conservative in our COVID estimates, areas of significant upside to our COVID guidance are likely in the rearview mirror. It is also key to recognize that COVID is an accretive product and therefore, as COVID testing revenue shift lower in the next several quarters, this will represent a headwind to margins. Moving to Breast Health. In Q4, we anticipate similar performance to Q3, delivering double-digit revenue growth aided by strong demand as weak comps in the prior period, as well as weak comps in prior periods. Finally, in Surgical, we expect healthy double-digit growth for the full-year, but assume growth rates will start to moderate in Q4 given the elevated comparable period revenue we generated in the prior year. Moving down to P&L. For the full-year, we expect our non-GAAP gross margin percentage to be in the low 60s and our non-GAAP operating margin percentage to be approximately 30%. Within this operating margin profile, we have again incorporated temporary elevated cost pressures in our guidance. On this point, we remind everyone that our elevated cost profile is less related to current movements in spot prices, which have been receiving. For example, one of the primary drivers of our higher assumed costs is semiconductor chips, we have previously procured at higher prices. As we work down our backlog in Breast Health, we'll see this higher cost amortized through the P&L over the next several quarters and persist into our fiscal 2024. We continue to work down the P&L. We expect operating expenses in Q4 to be relatively flat compared to Q3. Below operating income, we assume that other income net to be an expense of slightly more than $10 million in Q4. Our guidance is based on an annual effective tax rate of approximately 19.75%, and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately $249 million for the full-year. To conclude, our strong third quarter results highlights a durable business that is poised to sustainably grow over the long-term. Our growth in the quarter was diverse, with each business again growing double-digits organically, excluding COVID. As we close out our fiscal 2023 and look to 2024, we are excited about the unique growth drivers in each of our franchises and the optionality provided by our pristine balance sheet. Our stakeholders can count on Hologic to deliver against our financial commitments, while also advancing the global state of women's health. With that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Donnelly: Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. Steve, maybe we can start on the molecular side, obviously, started to come up against some more difficult comps here. You guys have put up some good numbers. Can you just talk about the underlying performance here? I know you've called out a few growth assays, the Panther usage on non-COVID assays a bit. Any metrics? I know you guys don't want to talk utilization anymore, but any metrics you can point to just in terms of the future growth, obviously a big contributor to that 5% to 7% next year as well, I'm sure. I just wanted to dive into that a little bit?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. I think the big piece. We've got, obviously the core women's health menu continues to do well. And I think what keeps getting not fully appreciated, Patrick, is all those additional Panthers we placed during COVID. We kept saying many of those are going to be adopting our new menu, and that's exactly what we're seeing playing out. So the core women's health menu, frankly, some of the virals especially outside the United States, and then the new products, the organic growth of BV/CV, which has really just been off to a tremendous start. And while that's not going to exactly replace COVID, certainly not at its peak, it rapidly will become one of the largest assays we've ever developed organically. So I think we just keep seeing tremendous growth for really years to come as they keep ramping up. Karleen?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. And I would just add that, Biotheranostics continues to be a strong double-digit grower contributing to the molecular performance.\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. [indiscernible].\nPatrick Donnelly: Okay, that's helpful. Yes. And then, Karleen, maybe one on the margins. You talked a little bit about some of the headwinds, whether it's pandemic COVID or the chip cost. Second half, I think the second half is 28% and change in terms of the op margins. I believe the Street is almost 31% next year. So what's the right way to think about just the cadence as we work our way into next year. You obviously talked a little bit about the growth, but on that margin side, do some of those headwinds alleviate or should we be resetting next year a little closer to what we're seeing the exit rate at here on the margin side?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. So a couple of comments. First, we haven't provided guidance for fiscal '24, and we're not doing that on this call. I would say that what we're seeing here in Q3 and Q4 for operating margins in that 29% range are probably the trough of the low, and we do expect margins to improve over the course of '24. Again, we haven't given that exact percentage, but would expect them to improve from here as some of the inflationary pressures do abate over time.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Mike Matson with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.\nMichael Matson: Yes. Thanks. Let's see here. So I guess just starting with the comments on China and Russia, maybe you can provide a little more detail there. Can you talk about, I guess Russia exposure? How much is that? Is that going to zero because of the latest sanctions? And then China, do you think there's kind of a longer-term slowdown in your business there?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes, Mike, I think Russia for us was really opportunistic. When we developed our strat plan, we went to the 5% to 7%. We were virtually nonexistent in Russia, but we had big plans to expand. So the good part is we're not losing business. It's really the lack of the opportunity and the upside. China, frankly, we're pretty happy that only 2% to 3% of our revenue comes from China right now given all of the issues going on there. So again, I think we've been able to weather that storm reasonably well. And again, it's just not going to be the growth that we would have expected. So I think that the higher way to think about this is when we put out the 5% to 7%, we saw China and Russia becoming clearly accretive to that. They're now -- Russia is effectively flatlined at zero, and China is not the headwind or the tailwind that we had hoped. So what it really means is our core businesses and our core geographies are growing even faster than what we had originally modeled at that time.\nMichael Matson: Okay. And just in terms of your operating margin, I have to go back pretty far because of the Aesthetics deal, but I think it was like '20 -- fiscal 2016, it was kind of in the 33% to 34% range. Is there any reason in the longer term that you can't get back to those levels and that decline from the kind of low 30s to the high 20s that you're at now. Obviously, we have COVID in between, but I mean, is that decline for the kind of non-COVID business really all due to inflation? Or are there other factors? Because the business mix didn't really look that different back then.\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. So I'll tackle this with a couple of points. So one, from earnings growth. If we talk about the 5% to 7% top line, we ground ourselves in growing EPS faster than that and likely in that double-digit, low double-digit range. If we want to ground ourselves in operating margins, we point you to Q2 '20, which was 31.5%. I think compared -- going back to 2016, I think the business is a little more diversified and probably a growing business outside the U.S. compared to 2016. So as we know, OUS has been growing double digits on the top line, but there is kind of diluted from the total margin perspective. And then as we kind of move out of 2030 into '24, as I talked about, it looks like this back half of '23 is kind of the low point of the 29%. We would expect continuing improvement into '24 as higher costs on the semiconductor as well as other higher inflationary pressures such as freight continue to abate over the course of the year. So I think what we try to manage, again, growing EPS low double-digit and still investing in things like R&D and marketing initiatives to grow the top line, not exactly driving to that historical operating margin percentage.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nJack Meehan: Thank you. Good afternoon.\nStephen MacMillan: Hi, Jack.\nJack Meehan: Steve, so the number one question I've been getting on Hologic is actually related to Illumina. So I was wondering if you could just share some brief thoughts on your decision to join as Chairman there and just comment on your ongoing commitment to Hologic as Chairman and CEO?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes, sure. Let's be really clear. I'm at Hologic through the end of my useful life in terms of what I've worked for, built for. And as a reminder to everybody, I am personally a top 15 shareholder in Hologic. So this is my day job. This is my passion. This is my love. What I have to see is the company five minutes away, that's troubled that I thought, frankly, I could also help out in a different role, which is as Chairman of the Board. And I'm very proud that I think I can do both. If I didn't have the great team around me at Hologic wouldn't be able to. Frankly, over there, it's going to be about also just getting a great CEO in place. And we're making a couple of key decisions there, which are probably pretty obvious. And then it's going to be a normal Chairmanship from there. So this is my love and my passion and frankly, where I'm fully engaged sometimes more than my teams would like.\nKarleen Oberton: I would add. Jack, that last week, we had all the teams together for our quarterly business reviews and Steve was as engaged as ever.\nStephen MacMillan: I want to add\u2026\nJack Meehan: I love it. That's what I want to hear. Sounds good. Okay. And then another question, I think get a lot from investors is just on guidelines as it pertains to co-testing. So it was good to see the strong cytology quarter, but I was just hoping you could share your latest thinking on the USPSTF. If you have a sense for when some update might come on cervical cancer screening and how -- just latest thinking on how that may or may not impact the business? Thank you.\nStephen MacMillan: Yes, Jack, I think the interesting stuff on the USPSTF guidelines, as they relook at cervical cancer screening, is we don't have an exact time line. It could be months from now. It could be any time, could be late this year, early next. You're never quite sure where that plays out. I think the biggest piece, the way I look at all of this is there's the headline the day any of those guidelines, whether it's breast cancer or cervical cancer screening guidelines get tweaked. And then there's the reality of how it plays out in the marketplace with the physicians. And I think just as when USPSTF raised the age of Mammography years ago and said, women should really wait until they're 50 instead of 40 and you have those kind of shifts, medical practice didn't change that much. And now when they reversed it and came back to 40 just like that, it's not going to dramatically change because it never changed that much in the first place. We think that is very true as well in cervical cancer. The Pap test has truly been one of the gold standards, as we've said, probably has had more impact on women's health and changing cervical cancer from one of the number one killers of women to going way down the food chain in terms of that because of how well it's been -- how well it's performed over time. And so while not necessarily the greatest procedure for somebody to have to have. It has worked out incredibly well over time, and we think it's going to continue to be strong. So it will be a little headline stuff. We still hope that, frankly, patient groups and the medical community's opinions will properly be listened to. And then frankly, the guideline shouldn't change much. But even if they do, I think very little impact to our business over certainly a several year period. Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nVijay Kumar: Hi, Steve, thanks for taking my questions. Steve, so maybe my first one on -- just so I understand this fiscal '24 commentary, what you're saying is the base business, ex-COVID should be 5% to 7%, inclusive of headwinds. Are Russia and China headwinds to fiscal '24, if they are, could you perhaps give some color on how much of a headwind there are. And when you give that 5% to 7%, should we be perhaps thinking about the bottom half just given some of the macro commentaries you made?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. The 5% to 7% as we related it to Russia and China, which I answered earlier is they're basically like Russia is just a lack of growth opportunity. So it's not a headwind -- yes, it's not an headwind. It's just the lack of what could have been a tailwind in our strat plan. So I think we feel very good about being in that range. We'll give guidance on our November call.\nVijay Kumar: Sorry, is China a headwind, Steve, for next year?\nStephen MacMillan: Not additionally to this year, in our minds probably.\nVijay Kumar: Understood. Understood.\nStephen MacMillan: We feel very good. I think the gist that we keep trying to say here is we feel better and better about the growth of our base businesses in all of our core geographies today.\nVijay Kumar: Understood. Karleen, one for you. Gross margin here sequentially came down. You're talking about inventories flowing through the P&L. So it looks like this could flow through to the first half of next year. Are we -- just given the P&L dynamics, is there some cost controls, any offsets to this at the OpEx line item? Or how should we think about margins? Should we be expecting any expansion next year?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. So I think as I had -- if you go from Q2 to Q3, the gross margin declines primarily lower COVID revenue. So again, we had over $70 million of COVID assay revenue in Q2 and just under $30 million here in Q3. So that's probably the bigger as well as lower gantry revenue, which our gantries in our Breast Health business, their gross margins are accretive to the corporate average. So that explains the sequential. As I had talked about operating margins, we feel that here in the second half of '23, this roughly 29% operating margin is probably the low point and as we move through '24, we should see improvement as we have on revenue growth in the base business, but also some of those headwinds on higher costs will abate over the course of the year. And again, we'll give guidance on the November call.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Tim Daley with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nTimothy Daley: Great, thanks. So Steve, in the prepared remarks, you called out tough comps along with macro factors is the reason for not raising the long-term growth outlook. So just hoping to get a bit more color on this dynamic specifically to breast. I think the guidance gets to around $350 million or so for the fourth quarter. And just curious if that's like a clean run rate for quarterly revenues to think about? Or is that still impacted by the chips on the high end or maybe backlog work down on, I guess on the upside case. Just curious about how we should kind of think about that moving forward as kind of a clean quarterly number we can grow from?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. I would say it's not an unreasonable number. It's probably still a little low from historical levels. I think prior to the chip supply headwind, we would, in each quarter do roughly 1,100 to 1,200 gantries a quarter. This is below that level seemed in Q3 and Q4. I think as we look into '24, I think we're still having recovery in the breast business as we believe our backlog will be worked through over the course of '24.\nTimothy Daley: All right. Helpful. And then just wanted to touch on Mobidiag. So the write-down equated to nearly a quarter of the acquisition price just rough calculations. So can you give us an update on either, I guess, how the European dynamics are going? Or any update on the USA launch time line of Novo [ph]? Thank you.\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. I think overall, as you know, we did about six acquisitions in COVID time, feeling really good that certainly five of them are delivering good growth for us right now. Mobi is just a little more work, frankly, to get it to the U.S. market. As we dug in deeper, a little more redesign is required of both the cartridge and the machine and what we got. We still like the technology. But as we dug in, it's just going to be further out, and that just affected the cash flows, combined with the interest rates and all of that. But we still are very excited about what that will bring. And frankly, the positive is in a weird way, it's going to hit a little later in our strat plan horizon, and the growth for the next few years looks so good anyway, but it will come in at a really good time for us.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nTejas Savant: Hey guys. Good evening and thanks for the time. So Steve, Jack stole my question on your side hustles becoming your full-time hustles. And I'm glad to hear you stay at the Hologic. My question is maybe one on M&A. I know you guys sort of mentioned being open to deals of all sizes in your prepared remarks. And I think Karleen called out the tuck-in pipeline also being pretty active here. But any color you can share on the pipeline for those larger needle-moving assets and on a related note, you've called out the success you've had in Biotheranostics, a bunch over the last few quarters. Could that be a precursor for us seeing you making a bigger push in cancer testing, perhaps not sort of the NGS-based testing that people often think about, but like PCR-based approaches?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes, Tejas, I think the way to think about our M&A strategy right now and Karleen and I have been out with some of our largest shareholders over the last month-ish, and I think they've all reminded us that as you look at our fundamental growth rate and our margin profile, reminding us that, that alone looks pretty damn good. And it's hard to find deals that are really going to enhance either our growth rate as it's accelerated or our margin structure. And so we are being cautious. And I would tell you, I think it's the beauty of a strong base business, so we are looking in those areas, but we sort of have that luxury right now of time on our side because of the base performance. So more likely to just stay more cautious here, continuing to drive the good deals that we've done. Obviously, with the Biotheranostics in the portfolio, it opens up the aperture to look at certain things, but nothing wildly dilutive by any stretch. And I think we like things that already have a little bit of an established revenue base like a Biotheranostics that we can then turbocharge with our operational efficiencies and our sales forces and our marketing in those areas. So I think it will be in those areas.\nTejas Savant: Got it. Makes sense. And then a quick follow-up on GYN Surg. Any updates there on the hospital staffing situation just on a quarter-over-quarter basis. And you talked about sort of that low double-digit growth moderating here in fiscal '24. I mean outside of tough comps, is there anything else to be thinking about? I think, Steve, in the past, you've talked about I think it was almost a quarter of that portfolio is now outside of MyoSure and NovaSure. And presumably, that's growing better than 7% for you guys. So just curious as to any color you can share there.\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. I think clearly, we figure there's probably earlier this year, some catch-up in procedures, this and that. But overall, I think there's still some of that to come. Hospital staffing is clearly tight. But I think in general, the hospitals are figuring out how to manage that. We're figuring out how to manage it and help again as, frankly, so many of our products add efficiencies, including things like Fluent. And so we're really kind of a go-to partner for the hospitals, and I think just feel really good about having both a -- now a laparoscopic portfolio in addition to the hysteroscopic.\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. I would just add on the Surgical business. We've really seen probably over the last four or five, six quarters, international turbocharge for the Surgical business, a small base, but really starting to take traction.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.\nPuneet Souda: Steve. Thanks for taking the questions.\nStephen MacMillan: Thanks, Puneet.\nPuneet Souda: Hey, great. Thanks. So first on Panther utilization. It's talked about quite a bit, and I know you've given percentages for customers that are using two tests versus three tests. But wondering what you're seeing today versus a year ago in terms of customers? Are they -- are certain customers that are using it more aggressively versus those that are not? Maybe just help us sort of understand the landscape out there in reference labs versus hospital labs. Where are you seeing some of the more utilization? Because I totally understand some of those percentage numbers that you provided in the past, those are average. But -- just trying to get a bit more color on where you stand today because this is more of a cleaner picture for utilization at this point in time past COVID.\nStephen MacMillan: It's pretty broad-based between both our hospital customers, the smaller labs and the big labs. It's remarkably broad-based and also in terms of the menu and increasingly the geographic footprint that so many of the Panthers we placed during COVID were also international. And so we're seeing that as well. So it's hard to fully -- it's not like we can sit there and say, hey, 50% of the additional has come from a few customers or just an area. It's really remarkably broad-based.\nPuneet Souda: Okay. Thanks. Good to hear. And if one -- if I may ask a bit of a broader question, this is regarding AI, you talked a little bit about it. Just given the some momentum that we're seeing in MedTech essentially for AI technologies. Just trying to understand how do you expect to utilize AI, where does AI augment Hologic's product. Maybe just walk us through a bit. Obviously, there's quite a bit of discussion out there on AI. So I just want to get a sense of how Hologic is looking at that?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. I think the simplest thing is we've had a number of -- I go back to when we refer to really things as machine learning. When you think about both cytology as well as breast, a lot of it is pattern recognition. And that's what the technology that underlies some of the computer-rated design programs that we've got within our Mammography system, but also our digital cytology that's now been approved in -- basically EC mark or got the mark for the EU. And we're working to get that cleared by FDA as well in the United States. Again, it's pattern recognition. And doing the same thing really within the Breast Health space. And I think it's where our installed base, our knowledge, just the sheer sample size is big. There's a lot of complexities, clearly in terms of getting them through the agency and owning the data to be able to get some of those. But I think we feel really good about the partnerships that we've been able to get and our ability to play strong roles, particularly in those two areas.\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. I would just add that we're also, even in our field service organization, using predictive analytics to predict certain part failures that allow us to coordinate with our customers to prevent unscheduled downtime, unscheduled visits, which is great for the customers and creates operational efficiency for us.\nStephen MacMillan: Thanks, Puneet.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Anthony Petrone with the Mizuho Group. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Petrone: Thanks. And maybe a high-level one, Steve, and then a modeling question for Karleen. Maybe, Steve, you mentioned aspirational top line, 7% to 9%, but you called out macro headwinds to some extent here, both just geographically as well as operational to some of the businesses. If those were not there, is it feasible that the profile is a low double-digit sustainable year, right? The organic profile has been there, excluding COVID. So just maybe thoughts on if we didn't have some of these headwinds here, how could it have settled out in the next two to three years? And then I'll have a follow-up for Karleen on the model.\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. Anthony, I'd like to correct you. There was no reference at all of an aspirational number. We feel really good about the 5% to 7%. This year, we are delivering double that, is what we said, but we feel great about the 5% to 7% in this environment to be a company and people can count on for that.\nAnthony Petrone: That's helpful. And then Karleen, maybe just couple of quick ones on the model. Can you give us an idea of what the Breast Health backlog recapture was in the quarter? And then when we think about earnings growth, do you need lower nonoperational costs to achieve the low double-digit earnings profile? Thanks again.\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. So we haven't given specifics on backlog recapture. I think what we have said is that the backlog continues to be high. It's something that will work through over several quarters to come. I think we're always looking at operational efficiencies to drive earnings results. As I think about '24, I think we'll kind of hit the whole P&L between higher revenue growth, probably some improvement at gross margins and always looking at how do we best manage our operating expenses to deliver that earnings growth.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG. Please go ahead.\nRyan Zimmerman: Hey, thanks for squeezing me in on the questions here. I'll try and keep it as tight as I can. Just a quick point of clarification. If you look at next year's revenue growth, I think the Street is looking at about 4.1%. And it's like 3.7% organic. So is it unreasonable to think that we would be below your long-term guidance in capacity. Again, I appreciate what you said about the 5% to 7%, but I just want to make sure the Street is clear that at the low end, 5% to 7% or 5%, excuse me, is the right number relative to kind of where the Street is at today?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. We kind of run our business as opposed to the Street estimates. My hunch is there's a lot more COVID still in people's numbers for next year. I think what we feel really good about is the base.\nRyan Zimmerman: Okay. All right. I appreciate that, Steve. And then one last one for me. Talked about M&A, we're mostly focused on diagnostics, but I'm a simple MedTech analyst. You're doing well in Bolder, you're doing well in laparoscopic. But help us understand, I mean, with all the shift to robotic surgery, particularly in women's health, I mean is your aperture beyond, say a laparoscopic tuck-in in that arena? I mean, is it unreasonable to think that there are robotic technologies that could one day make it into Hologic's portfolio on the GYN Surgical side?\nStephen MacMillan: We're looking at our Surgical business, both within the GYN world, but also things like Bolder have kind of gotten us into thinking about sort of more specialty surgery because it's getting us into pediatrics in addition to traditional guidance. So I think we're opening our aperture and to your point is understanding the MedTech world way, I think about our company right now is we're able to generate a lot of cash flow out of Diagnostics or MedTech and the ability to spend it where it could possibly give the better return as we've done with things like Bolder and MedTech. There'll probably be some other areas in that space that we will be looking at, whether -- and robotics is a piece. But frankly, they've spent a lot of money chasing robotics right now. That's also -- every once in a while that reminds me a little bit of some of the NIPT spaces or other things. So we're going to continue to be looking for where the profits can be generated.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Andrew Cooper with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Cooper: Hey everybody. Thanks for the questions. I know we're at the end here. So I'll try to be quick. Maybe just one on sort of the chip supply and the visibility here. I fully understand you're not going to guide for '24 at this point. But when you sit here today on July 31 versus a quarter ago or a couple of quarters ago when you think about how comfortable you are in out quarters. Can you just give us a sense for sort of where you are from that visibility perspective, what you're hearing from the suppliers and how we should think about maybe the trajectory there and the sustainability of that backlog work down, over the course of the end of this year and next year?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes, we're incredibly comfortable with where we stand right now on the chip supply. So feel really good.\nKarleen Oberton: Yes, we've deepened our business.\nAndrew Cooper: Is that safe to assume that, that translates to getting the allocations that you are looking for?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. Yes.\nAndrew Cooper: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Andrew Brackmann with William Blair.\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. So we'll take this question and one more to close out the call for today.\nAndrew Brackmann: Okay. Thanks. I'll keep it to one. But maybe just going back to Jack's question around USPSTF for cervical cancer guidelines. Steve, you mentioned Mammography guidelines. But I believe ACS updated their recommendations a few years ago, maybe just in the spirit of giving investors' confidence around whatever USPSTF said. Can you maybe just sort of talk about what you saw in the market following that decision, what you saw sort of from customers and their utilization patterns? Thanks.\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. I think all of these changes create headline -- much more headline noise that I know investors look at. I go back to even recently, was it in May when the new Breast Health guidelines came out. And our stock moves like 7% in 20 minutes. At the end of the day, these things have very little impact one way or the other over the short-term and are really much more -- the way -- I've been in health care now for about, 30-plus years, moves happen glacially. And even as any of these guidelines change, they get the headlines, but the reality in practice is very minimal slow changes. Final question.\nAndrew Brackmann: Thanks.\nOperator: We'll take our final question from Liza Garcia with UBS. Please go ahead.\nElizabeth Garcia: Thanks so much for squeezing me in guys. Really appreciate it.\nStephen MacMillan: It is pleasure.\nElizabeth Garcia: Great. Just to kind of quickly touch on [indiscernible] since I know that. I just wanted to make sure I caught Steve comments that we're working through the backlog through fiscal 2024 and possibly beyond -- and just to kind of get some context, if that's correct, what could be the beyond factors and how to kind of think about that. And then if I could just parlay that into a bigger and broader modeling question since I know that now the 2024, but just to think about the long-term algo maybe and to think about segment mix and margins and how to think about that as we think about our models more broadly?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes, I think the big picture question on the backlog is, I think we'll -- as we currently look we've got pretty much a years-plus worth of backlog, and we'll continue to get more orders in the meantime. So that will keep pushing that backlog well out. So that's the highest level piece. And I'll hand the harder part of that question over to Karleen.\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. So I think when we think about the long-term growth rate, we talked about the 5% to 7%, we've talked about that all the divisions on a worldwide basis would be in that range and think about Breast Health kind to the lower end of the range, Diagnostics and Surgical to the higher end of the range. And as we talked about earlier, Molecular potentially even above that. So again, we feel good about all the businesses being in that growth range. We continue to see international being a bigger piece of the business growing faster than the U.S. And as I've talked about previously, we haven't given guidance for '24, but we believe that we're hitting the low mark of margins here at the back half of '23, and we'll see improvements as we work through that backlog and some of the inflationary pressures subside.\nElizabeth Garcia: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. And this now concludes Hologic's third quarter fiscal 2023 earnings conference call. Have a good evening.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Karleen Oberton",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my statements today, we will briefly revisit our divisional revenue results, walk down our income statement, and speak to a few balance sheet and cash flow items. We will wrap up with our guidance for the full-year and fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. As Steve highlighted, our third quarter financial results were strong, showcasing the durability of our business and the diversified contributions to our growth. Total revenue came in at $984 million, exceeding our estimates, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.93, meeting the high end of our previous guidance range. Now starting with our divisional revenue performance. In Diagnostics, global revenue of $439.7 million declined 21.3%. However, excluding COVID assay and related ancillary revenues, the division grew 11.8% in the quarter. We are once again thrilled by the solid performance, which reinforces the underlying strength of our Diagnostics business. As Steve shared, Molecular Diagnostics grew approximately 13% during our third quarter, excluding the impact of COVID. Additionally, the Cytology and Perinatal business posted nearly 10% growth in our fiscal third quarter. For reasons previously discussed, when modeling, we would advise not to extrapolate this level of growth going forward to our Cytology and Perinatal segment. Moving to Breast Health. Total third quarter revenue of $360.3 million increased 27.5%. In conjunction with our Q2 performance, these results provide further evidence of strong demand for the division's portfolio of products and services. While the current cares revenue growth rate was assisted by supply chain headwinds in the prior year, we are encouraged by the trajectory of the business and the increasing predictability of our semiconductor chip supply. Moving next to Surgical. Third quarter revenue of $157.3 million increased nearly 15% compared to the prior year. Our internal R&D efforts, international execution, and recent laparoscopic acquisitions are contributed to an increasingly diverse and robust business. And finally, in our Skeletal business, revenue of $27.1 million was also very strong, increasing 25%. Now let's move on to the rest of the non-GAAP P&L for the third quarter. Gross margin of 60.8% was driven by strong performance in our base business, and COVID-19 testing revenues, which came in slightly above our expectations. Total operating expenses of $313.9 million in the third quarter increased nominally by 0.9%. This increase was driven by higher sales and R&D expenses, but partially offset by lower marketing spend. Below operating income, other income once again represented a gain in our fiscal third quarter. We continue to benefit from higher interest rates as interest income from our cash balance of nearly $2.8 billion, and the favorable impact of our interest rate hedge has more than offset higher interest expense on our floating rate debt. Our tax rate in Q3 was 21.4%, higher than previously anticipated. The increase in this quarter's effective tax rate represents a cumulative catch-up in the current period to increase our annual tax rate from 19% to 19.75%. The increase in our tax rate for fiscal 2023 is driven by stronger than forecasted domestic performance and losses outside the U.S., which we cannot claim benefit from at this time. Putting these pieces together, operating margin for Q3 came in at 28.9% and net margin was 23.5%. Non-GAAP net income finished at $231.3 million and non-GAAP EPS was $0.93. Finally, while up to this point, we have discussed non-GAAP financial metrics, we feel it's important to call out a non-cash impairment charge related to Mobidiag, which is excluded from our non-GAAP results. To be clear, we continue to be excited about Mobidiag and its long-term potential. As we've previously shared, due to various challenges our entry to the U.S. market will be materially beyond our initial deal model expectations. During our annual strategic planning process in Q3 the need to lower the carrying value of primarily Mobidiag's intangible assets became evident. As a result, we booked a GAAP write-down of $197 million in the quarter specific to Mobidiag, which primarily impacts cost, but also operating expenses. Moving on from the P&L. Cash flow from operations was $332.7 million in our third quarter. We ended the quarter with $2.77 billion of cash on our balance sheet and a net leverage ratio of 0.1x. In addition, we repurchased 1.4 million shares of $114 million in the period. Year-to-date, we have purchased 3.6 million shares of $264 million. As it relates to our longer-term capital allocation strategy, we continue to operate from a position of strength with underlying strong organic growth in each of our businesses. With the growth and margin profile we have today, our hurdle rate to achieve accretion is notably higher than in years past. In addition, we want to make clear that while we are now open to looking at transactions that could be slightly larger, these are by no means the only targets in our funnel. We are prioritizing the right deals not necessarily larger deals and continue to be active, diligent, and patient. Now let's move on to our updated non-GAAP financial guidance for the fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2023. For the full-year fiscal 2023, we are again increasing our guidance at midpoints and expect total revenue in the range of $3.995 billion to $4.035 billion and EPS of $3.87 to $3.94. With only one quarter remaining in our fiscal year, this annual guidance implies revenue of $910 million to $950 million and EPS of $0.80 to $0.87 for our fiscal fourth quarter. With respect to foreign exchange, we are assuming an FX headwind of slightly less than $40 million for the full-year, a marginal improvement compared to our previous guidance. Turning to our divisions. We want to reiterate that each business should grow double-digits in our fiscal 2023, excluding the impact of COVID. However, it is important to remember that 2023 is a unique fiscal year. As a reminder, part of our elevated growth this year has been due to weak comps from supply chain headwinds and COVID's impact on procedural volumes in fiscal 2022. In addition, 2023 is a 53-week fiscal year. Therefore, as we move closer to our fiscal 2024, as Steve discussed, it is appropriate to model our base business revenue growth within our previously outlined 5% to 7% long-term range. Reinforce Steve's comments, this growth is even more impressive than when we introduced the target given our recent base business outperformance and headwinds from the macro environment. Starting with Diagnostics. We expect to close out the year with another strong quarter led by molecular. Our growth continues to be driven by improving utilization and menu expansion on Panther, coupled with increasing contribution from Biotheranostics. Closing out non-COVID diagnostics, we expect blood revenue approximately $35 million for the year. In terms of COVID revenue, we expect COVID assay sales to be approximately $10 million in our fourth quarter of 2023 and slightly more than $235 million for the full-year. COVID related items are expected to be slightly more than $25 million in the fourth quarter and slightly less than $120 million for the full-year. As we look forward with COVID testing revenue, demand and public concern for the disease continue to abate. Therefore, although we plan financially conservative in our COVID estimates, areas of significant upside to our COVID guidance are likely in the rearview mirror. It is also key to recognize that COVID is an accretive product and therefore, as COVID testing revenue shift lower in the next several quarters, this will represent a headwind to margins. Moving to Breast Health. In Q4, we anticipate similar performance to Q3, delivering double-digit revenue growth aided by strong demand as weak comps in the prior period, as well as weak comps in prior periods. Finally, in Surgical, we expect healthy double-digit growth for the full-year, but assume growth rates will start to moderate in Q4 given the elevated comparable period revenue we generated in the prior year. Moving down to P&L. For the full-year, we expect our non-GAAP gross margin percentage to be in the low 60s and our non-GAAP operating margin percentage to be approximately 30%. Within this operating margin profile, we have again incorporated temporary elevated cost pressures in our guidance. On this point, we remind everyone that our elevated cost profile is less related to current movements in spot prices, which have been receiving. For example, one of the primary drivers of our higher assumed costs is semiconductor chips, we have previously procured at higher prices. As we work down our backlog in Breast Health, we'll see this higher cost amortized through the P&L over the next several quarters and persist into our fiscal 2024. We continue to work down the P&L. We expect operating expenses in Q4 to be relatively flat compared to Q3. Below operating income, we assume that other income net to be an expense of slightly more than $10 million in Q4. Our guidance is based on an annual effective tax rate of approximately 19.75%, and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately $249 million for the full-year. To conclude, our strong third quarter results highlights a durable business that is poised to sustainably grow over the long-term. Our growth in the quarter was diverse, with each business again growing double-digits organically, excluding COVID. As we close out our fiscal 2023 and look to 2024, we are excited about the unique growth drivers in each of our franchises and the optionality provided by our pristine balance sheet. Our stakeholders can count on Hologic to deliver against our financial commitments, while also advancing the global state of women's health. With that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions. Yes. And I would just add that, Biotheranostics continues to be a strong double-digit grower contributing to the molecular performance. Yes. So a couple of comments. First, we haven't provided guidance for fiscal '24, and we're not doing that on this call. I would say that what we're seeing here in Q3 and Q4 for operating margins in that 29% range are probably the trough of the low, and we do expect margins to improve over the course of '24. Again, we haven't given that exact percentage, but would expect them to improve from here as some of the inflationary pressures do abate over time. Yes. So I'll tackle this with a couple of points. So one, from earnings growth. If we talk about the 5% to 7% top line, we ground ourselves in growing EPS faster than that and likely in that double-digit, low double-digit range. If we want to ground ourselves in operating margins, we point you to Q2 '20, which was 31.5%. I think compared -- going back to 2016, I think the business is a little more diversified and probably a growing business outside the U.S. compared to 2016. So as we know, OUS has been growing double digits on the top line, but there is kind of diluted from the total margin perspective. And then as we kind of move out of 2030 into '24, as I talked about, it looks like this back half of '23 is kind of the low point of the 29%. We would expect continuing improvement into '24 as higher costs on the semiconductor as well as other higher inflationary pressures such as freight continue to abate over the course of the year. So I think what we try to manage, again, growing EPS low double-digit and still investing in things like R&D and marketing initiatives to grow the top line, not exactly driving to that historical operating margin percentage. I would add. Jack, that last week, we had all the teams together for our quarterly business reviews and Steve was as engaged as ever. Yes. So I think as I had -- if you go from Q2 to Q3, the gross margin declines primarily lower COVID revenue. So again, we had over $70 million of COVID assay revenue in Q2 and just under $30 million here in Q3. So that's probably the bigger as well as lower gantry revenue, which our gantries in our Breast Health business, their gross margins are accretive to the corporate average. So that explains the sequential. As I had talked about operating margins, we feel that here in the second half of '23, this roughly 29% operating margin is probably the low point and as we move through '24, we should see improvement as we have on revenue growth in the base business, but also some of those headwinds on higher costs will abate over the course of the year. And again, we'll give guidance on the November call. Yes. I would say it's not an unreasonable number. It's probably still a little low from historical levels. I think prior to the chip supply headwind, we would, in each quarter do roughly 1,100 to 1,200 gantries a quarter. This is below that level seemed in Q3 and Q4. I think as we look into '24, I think we're still having recovery in the breast business as we believe our backlog will be worked through over the course of '24. Yes. I would just add on the Surgical business. We've really seen probably over the last four or five, six quarters, international turbocharge for the Surgical business, a small base, but really starting to take traction. Yes. I would just add that we're also, even in our field service organization, using predictive analytics to predict certain part failures that allow us to coordinate with our customers to prevent unscheduled downtime, unscheduled visits, which is great for the customers and creates operational efficiency for us. Yes. So we haven't given specifics on backlog recapture. I think what we have said is that the backlog continues to be high. It's something that will work through over several quarters to come. I think we're always looking at operational efficiencies to drive earnings results. As I think about '24, I think we'll kind of hit the whole P&L between higher revenue growth, probably some improvement at gross margins and always looking at how do we best manage our operating expenses to deliver that earnings growth. Yes, we've deepened our business. Yes. So I think when we think about the long-term growth rate, we talked about the 5% to 7%, we've talked about that all the divisions on a worldwide basis would be in that range and think about Breast Health kind to the lower end of the range, Diagnostics and Surgical to the higher end of the range. And as we talked about earlier, Molecular potentially even above that. So again, we feel good about all the businesses being in that growth range. We continue to see international being a bigger piece of the business growing faster than the U.S. And as I've talked about previously, we haven't given guidance for '24, but we believe that we're hitting the low mark of margins here at the back half of '23, and we'll see improvements as we work through that backlog and some of the inflationary pressures subside."

            "name": "Stephen MacMillan",
            "content": "Thank you, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to discuss our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Our results were solid. Total revenue was $984 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.93. Revenue exceeded our prior guidance and EPS finished at the high end of our range. These results showcase the power of our transformed business and demonstrate that Hologic is built for the long-term with the broadest, strongest foundation we've ever had. On top of this transformation, with our strong cash flow and outstanding balance sheet, we continue to operate from a position of strength, with strong operational discipline as we forge ahead. Once again, the proof is in the numbers. Total company organic growth, excluding COVID was rather remarkable at 18.4%. By division, we posted 11.8% organic diagnostics growth ex-COVID and 14.5% growth in Surgical. Standing alone, these growth rates are impressive. Given a wider context, we view these performances as exceptionally strong, because we delivered these results on top of 15% growth in Diagnostics and 9.7% growth in Surgical in Q3 of 2022, both very high bars from a year ago. And in Breast Health, as expected, we delivered another strong quarter of 27.5% growth as chip supply and gantry availability continue to improve and track to our expectations. For this fiscal year, we remain on pace to achieve or exceed our 2023 low double-digit organic growth targets, excluding COVID. In fact, our expected growth rate for fiscal '23 is now more than double our 5% to 7% long-term growth target. Based on our strong performance for a number of quarters now, combined with our continued confidence in our growth ahead, we've recently given serious consideration to raising our long-term target. But given the uncertain macro environment we face, 5% to 7% is still very much a solid long-term outlook. Put simply, there are two reasons why. First, as you all well know, growing 5% to 7% on top of double-digit growth is clearly more challenging than growing 5% to 7% against single-digit comps. For example, in fiscal 2024, we will lap several prior periods of double-digit growth throughout the year. Net, we'll be entering 2024 already much bigger and stronger than when we first set the goal. And second, there are macro business and geopolitical challenges that persist today, which did not exist back in 2021 when we first set our guide. We will expand on this aspect later in today's call. Taken together, overcoming this combination of challenges, while maintaining 5% to 7% growth is in some ways an even last year goal than when we first established it. On that note, let's move on to our focus for today. First, we will highlight the strengths of our business that underpin our strong Q3 results. Our strengths are diverse and durable. And second, with a discussion of the unique advantages we provide our customers, we hope you'll share our confidence that Hologic is built for the long-term. Moving forward to our Q3 growth drivers. As mentioned, excluding COVID, each division posted double-digit organic growth for the quarter. Equally impressive is the year-over-year consistency of our growth drivers, a direct result of execution against our business strategy. In Diagnostics, the division's overall 11.8% organic growth rate, excluding COVID, was again driven by strong performance in molecular. For the quarter, Molecular Diagnostics posted approximately 13% growth ex-COVID, on top of growing over 20% a year ago. Growth in molecular was driven by a combination of both newer assays like BV, CV/TV and contributions from Amgen and HSV, each growing well into the double digits as well as strong growth from our longstanding women's health menu. Rounding out Molecular Diagnostics, our Biotheranostics acquisition continues to shine, being both accretive to our top and bottom lines. Cytology and Perinatal led by cytology, also contributed strong growth this quarter, growing nearly 10%. Cytology's elevated growth for Q3 was driven by the timing of a few large orders placed in the last week of the quarter before the extended July 4 holiday. We view this as a one-time lift as opposed to a shift in the trajectory of the business. That said, co-testing, which includes the Pap+HPV continues to be the preferred cervical cancer screening method for medical practitioners. These are the same practitioners who are on the front lines who know the science and who have seen the overwhelmingly positive impact of the Pap and co-testing firsthand. By our estimates, nearly 99% of cervical cancer screening today in the United States is performed using a combination of the Pap alone or co-testing. Why? The reason is clear. The Pap test has been the most successful cancer screening test in history. Since the Pap was introduced over 80 years ago, the rate of cervical cancer, which was the leading cause of death among women, has fallen by more than 70%. As an advocate of women's health for over 35 years, we continue to support best-in-class care for women, and for cervical cancer screening, the gold standard is co-testing with ThinPrep, the Pap+HPV. Shifting to Breast Health. As expected, we posted another exceptional quarter, growing revenue 27.5%. This strong performance was driven primarily by the ongoing return of our Mammography business as well as solid contributions from service. In Mammography, as we guided in May, we delivered more gantries in Q3 than Q1 and slightly less than in Q2. Demand for our clinically differentiated gantries remains high. In addition, our backlog is still at historically elevated levels. We are in great shape to work down this backlog to more normal levels throughout our fiscal 2024 and possibly beyond. In breast service, our business continues to grow and is becoming an even larger part of the division's mix. Our strong service performance represents stable contracted recurring revenue and demonstrates deepening relationships with our customers. Now moving on to Surgical and our International business. The newer pillars of growth for our company that may not be fully appreciated. In Surgical, the business continues to grow stronger for longer, growing 14.5% in Q3. Revenue growth was again driven by MyoSure and the Fluent Fluid Management System. With contributions from NovaSure V5 and our newer laparoscopic portfolio. Specifically, while still early days in smaller dollars, Bolder continues its strong growth as we leverage our relationships with our GYN customers and explore adjacent surgical channels. The transformation of our Surgical business over recent years has been phenomenal. It underscores the value of both internal innovation plus product line additions through M&A, a winning formula across Hologic. In Surgical, the sum of both strategies has injected new life into the business and transformed it into a meaningful growth driver for the company. Our international business also continues to impress, growing 20.9% in the quarter, excluding COVID. In May, our global leadership team traveled to our Brussels office as part of our annual strategic planning process, spending a week in Brussels reinforced a sense of pride within our leadership team. We are proud of the strides we've made expanding our global footprint and even more important, we are proud of the energy and culture we've built around the world. Coupled with a strong base of talent we have developed over the past few years. We firmly believe our highly engaged workforce and purpose-driven culture truly set us apart. As we've said before, the revenue growth rate for our international business is accretive to our overall growth rate. We expect this trend to continue throughout our long-term horizon. Related, earlier in today's call, we referenced persistent macro challenges in the context of our long-term guide. When we first announced our 5% to 7% guide, we were expecting tailwinds in places like China and Russia, rather than the headwinds they have become. Despite these challenges, we remain committed to our targets and with strong performance in other geographies where we operate, our international growth remains on track. This is a testament to the commitment, grit, and determination of all our employees that support and drive our efforts around the world. Now shifting gears to discuss the advantage we provide to our customers and how we are poised for long-term success. To fully appreciate where we're going, we must reflect on where we've been. From there, we will shed light on our unwavering patient and customer focus, which sets the stage for our bright future. Our transformation has been years in the making. It started even before COVID and as we know, accelerated during the pandemic. In the early days of COVID, when fear and uncertainty led to closures and shutdowns, we delivered our highly accurate COVID molecular diagnostic tests around the globe, playing a pivotal role in helping get the world back on its feet. With COVID surges and high testing volumes now further in the rearview mirror, our ongoing performance shows that we are much more than a great pandemic story. Without a doubt, we are a bigger, stronger company with more durable and diverse growth drivers and positioned well for the long haul. On top of this transformation, with our strong cash flow and exceptional balance sheet, we operate today from a position of strength and continue to exercise operational discipline. As we look ahead, we are laser focused on our purpose, passion and promise and never lose sight of the needs of our patients and our customers. This is the magic within our business. Today, our customers face the challenge of navigating this new operating environment. They seek vendors who can help them operate as efficiently as possible. For labs and hospitals, pressures from inflation and labor shortages remain despite recent improvement. With efficiency a priority, when our customers think of Hologic, they see opportunity. The opportunity to consolidate around our portfolio of products in Diagnostics, Breast Health and Surgical that offer innovative solutions to dramatically improve their operational efficiency. Seconds can turn to minutes and days of time and labor savings throughout the course of a year. In each of our businesses, we feature products that streamline workflows and create real advantages that our customers not only love, but need. From our sophisticated automation with Panther and advances in AI with digital cytology and Diagnostics to our industry-leading gantry scan speed, and streamlined biopsy process with Brevera in Breast Health. And finally, our efficient fluid management approach with Fluent in Surgical. Workflow efficiency is in the DNA of our entire portfolio. In addition, the fact that we have specialized service teams to focus on the unique needs of our customers adds to our competitive advantage. Our customers know that when they choose Hologic, they not only receive world-class products but also world-class service. Between our robust portfolio of industry-leading products and specialized service capabilities, we create a very attractive opportunity for our customers. We offer real and measurable efficiencies that improve their bottom lines. And more importantly, improve the standard of care for patients. This combination sets us up well to meet our customers' needs, both today and into the future. and creates an incredible pathway for Hologic's success. In closing, there are many companies that can sell products. There are fewer who can consistently deliver so many leadership brands and sector-leading margins over the long-term and there are even fewer who can succeed financially, while also helping the world. At Hologic, we do all three. We are tremendously proud to continue our journey, delivering outstanding top-line growth and profitability. Driving value for all our stakeholders and further enabling our ability to make a profound impact on patients' lives and women's health around the world. With that, I will now turn the call over to Karleen. Yes. I think the big piece. We've got, obviously the core women's health menu continues to do well. And I think what keeps getting not fully appreciated, Patrick, is all those additional Panthers we placed during COVID. We kept saying many of those are going to be adopting our new menu, and that's exactly what we're seeing playing out. So the core women's health menu, frankly, some of the virals especially outside the United States, and then the new products, the organic growth of BV/CV, which has really just been off to a tremendous start. And while that's not going to exactly replace COVID, certainly not at its peak, it rapidly will become one of the largest assays we've ever developed organically. So I think we just keep seeing tremendous growth for really years to come as they keep ramping up. Karleen? Yes. [indiscernible]. Yes, Mike, I think Russia for us was really opportunistic. When we developed our strat plan, we went to the 5% to 7%. We were virtually nonexistent in Russia, but we had big plans to expand. So the good part is we're not losing business. It's really the lack of the opportunity and the upside. China, frankly, we're pretty happy that only 2% to 3% of our revenue comes from China right now given all of the issues going on there. So again, I think we've been able to weather that storm reasonably well. And again, it's just not going to be the growth that we would have expected. So I think that the higher way to think about this is when we put out the 5% to 7%, we saw China and Russia becoming clearly accretive to that. They're now -- Russia is effectively flatlined at zero, and China is not the headwind or the tailwind that we had hoped. So what it really means is our core businesses and our core geographies are growing even faster than what we had originally modeled at that time. Hi, Jack. Yes, sure. Let's be really clear. I'm at Hologic through the end of my useful life in terms of what I've worked for, built for. And as a reminder to everybody, I am personally a top 15 shareholder in Hologic. So this is my day job. This is my passion. This is my love. What I have to see is the company five minutes away, that's troubled that I thought, frankly, I could also help out in a different role, which is as Chairman of the Board. And I'm very proud that I think I can do both. If I didn't have the great team around me at Hologic wouldn't be able to. Frankly, over there, it's going to be about also just getting a great CEO in place. And we're making a couple of key decisions there, which are probably pretty obvious. And then it's going to be a normal Chairmanship from there. So this is my love and my passion and frankly, where I'm fully engaged sometimes more than my teams would like. I want to add... Yes, Jack, I think the interesting stuff on the USPSTF guidelines, as they relook at cervical cancer screening, is we don't have an exact time line. It could be months from now. It could be any time, could be late this year, early next. You're never quite sure where that plays out. I think the biggest piece, the way I look at all of this is there's the headline the day any of those guidelines, whether it's breast cancer or cervical cancer screening guidelines get tweaked. And then there's the reality of how it plays out in the marketplace with the physicians. And I think just as when USPSTF raised the age of Mammography years ago and said, women should really wait until they're 50 instead of 40 and you have those kind of shifts, medical practice didn't change that much. And now when they reversed it and came back to 40 just like that, it's not going to dramatically change because it never changed that much in the first place. We think that is very true as well in cervical cancer. The Pap test has truly been one of the gold standards, as we've said, probably has had more impact on women's health and changing cervical cancer from one of the number one killers of women to going way down the food chain in terms of that because of how well it's been -- how well it's performed over time. And so while not necessarily the greatest procedure for somebody to have to have. It has worked out incredibly well over time, and we think it's going to continue to be strong. So it will be a little headline stuff. We still hope that, frankly, patient groups and the medical community's opinions will properly be listened to. And then frankly, the guideline shouldn't change much. But even if they do, I think very little impact to our business over certainly a several year period. Thank you. Yes. The 5% to 7% as we related it to Russia and China, which I answered earlier is they're basically like Russia is just a lack of growth opportunity. So it's not a headwind -- yes, it's not an headwind. It's just the lack of what could have been a tailwind in our strat plan. So I think we feel very good about being in that range. We'll give guidance on our November call. Not additionally to this year, in our minds probably. We feel very good. I think the gist that we keep trying to say here is we feel better and better about the growth of our base businesses in all of our core geographies today. Yes. I think overall, as you know, we did about six acquisitions in COVID time, feeling really good that certainly five of them are delivering good growth for us right now. Mobi is just a little more work, frankly, to get it to the U.S. market. As we dug in deeper, a little more redesign is required of both the cartridge and the machine and what we got. We still like the technology. But as we dug in, it's just going to be further out, and that just affected the cash flows, combined with the interest rates and all of that. But we still are very excited about what that will bring. And frankly, the positive is in a weird way, it's going to hit a little later in our strat plan horizon, and the growth for the next few years looks so good anyway, but it will come in at a really good time for us. Yes, Tejas, I think the way to think about our M&A strategy right now and Karleen and I have been out with some of our largest shareholders over the last month-ish, and I think they've all reminded us that as you look at our fundamental growth rate and our margin profile, reminding us that, that alone looks pretty damn good. And it's hard to find deals that are really going to enhance either our growth rate as it's accelerated or our margin structure. And so we are being cautious. And I would tell you, I think it's the beauty of a strong base business, so we are looking in those areas, but we sort of have that luxury right now of time on our side because of the base performance. So more likely to just stay more cautious here, continuing to drive the good deals that we've done. Obviously, with the Biotheranostics in the portfolio, it opens up the aperture to look at certain things, but nothing wildly dilutive by any stretch. And I think we like things that already have a little bit of an established revenue base like a Biotheranostics that we can then turbocharge with our operational efficiencies and our sales forces and our marketing in those areas. So I think it will be in those areas. Yes. I think clearly, we figure there's probably earlier this year, some catch-up in procedures, this and that. But overall, I think there's still some of that to come. Hospital staffing is clearly tight. But I think in general, the hospitals are figuring out how to manage that. We're figuring out how to manage it and help again as, frankly, so many of our products add efficiencies, including things like Fluent. And so we're really kind of a go-to partner for the hospitals, and I think just feel really good about having both a -- now a laparoscopic portfolio in addition to the hysteroscopic. Thanks, Puneet. It's pretty broad-based between both our hospital customers, the smaller labs and the big labs. It's remarkably broad-based and also in terms of the menu and increasingly the geographic footprint that so many of the Panthers we placed during COVID were also international. And so we're seeing that as well. So it's hard to fully -- it's not like we can sit there and say, hey, 50% of the additional has come from a few customers or just an area. It's really remarkably broad-based. Yes. I think the simplest thing is we've had a number of -- I go back to when we refer to really things as machine learning. When you think about both cytology as well as breast, a lot of it is pattern recognition. And that's what the technology that underlies some of the computer-rated design programs that we've got within our Mammography system, but also our digital cytology that's now been approved in -- basically EC mark or got the mark for the EU. And we're working to get that cleared by FDA as well in the United States. Again, it's pattern recognition. And doing the same thing really within the Breast Health space. And I think it's where our installed base, our knowledge, just the sheer sample size is big. There's a lot of complexities, clearly in terms of getting them through the agency and owning the data to be able to get some of those. But I think we feel really good about the partnerships that we've been able to get and our ability to play strong roles, particularly in those two areas. Thanks, Puneet. Yes. Anthony, I'd like to correct you. There was no reference at all of an aspirational number. We feel really good about the 5% to 7%. This year, we are delivering double that, is what we said, but we feel great about the 5% to 7% in this environment to be a company and people can count on for that. Yes. We kind of run our business as opposed to the Street estimates. My hunch is there's a lot more COVID still in people's numbers for next year. I think what we feel really good about is the base. We're looking at our Surgical business, both within the GYN world, but also things like Bolder have kind of gotten us into thinking about sort of more specialty surgery because it's getting us into pediatrics in addition to traditional guidance. So I think we're opening our aperture and to your point is understanding the MedTech world way, I think about our company right now is we're able to generate a lot of cash flow out of Diagnostics or MedTech and the ability to spend it where it could possibly give the better return as we've done with things like Bolder and MedTech. There'll probably be some other areas in that space that we will be looking at, whether -- and robotics is a piece. But frankly, they've spent a lot of money chasing robotics right now. That's also -- every once in a while that reminds me a little bit of some of the NIPT spaces or other things. So we're going to continue to be looking for where the profits can be generated. Yes, we're incredibly comfortable with where we stand right now on the chip supply. So feel really good. Yes. Yes. Yes. So we'll take this question and one more to close out the call for today. Yes. I think all of these changes create headline -- much more headline noise that I know investors look at. I go back to even recently, was it in May when the new Breast Health guidelines came out. And our stock moves like 7% in 20 minutes. At the end of the day, these things have very little impact one way or the other over the short-term and are really much more -- the way -- I've been in health care now for about, 30-plus years, moves happen glacially. And even as any of these guidelines change, they get the headlines, but the reality in practice is very minimal slow changes. Final question. It is pleasure. Yes, I think the big picture question on the backlog is, I think we'll -- as we currently look we've got pretty much a years-plus worth of backlog, and we'll continue to get more orders in the meantime. So that will keep pushing that backlog well out. So that's the highest level piece. And I'll hand the harder part of that question over to Karleen."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Hologic Second Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Rachel, and I'm your operator for today's call. Today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce Ryan Simon, Vice President, Investor Relations, to begin the call.\nRyan Simon: Thank you, Rachel. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Hologic's Second Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer. Our second quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We will also post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them as well as an updated corporate presentation. And a replay of this call will be available for the next 30 days. Before we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements we make today will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the safe harbor statement included in our earnings release and SEC filings. Also, during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Two of these non-GAAP measures are: one, organic revenue, which we define as revenue excluding the divested blood screening business and revenue from acquired businesses owned by Hologic for less than one year; and two, organic revenue, excluding COVID-19, which excludes COVID-19 assay revenue, revenue related to COVID-19 and sales from discontinued products in Diagnostics; finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO.\nStephen MacMillan: Thank you, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Our exceptional results confirmed that Hologic is now a much bigger, stronger company with more diverse and durable growth than pre-pandemic. On top of this transformation, with our strong cash flow and exceptional balance sheet, we are operating from a position of strength and are poised to carry our positive momentum forward. We've also said throughout the pandemic that we've dramatically strengthened the company. We recognize that this transformation was harder to see and fully appreciate against a backdrop of COVID spikes and supply chain anomalies. As these clouds continue to clear the result of our robust transformation really shines. For the quarter, total revenue was $1.03 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.06, both results were above the high end of our guidance. Before providing the highlights for the quarter, which admittedly did have two more selling days, and we were going against softer comps from last year due to the Omicron surge, make no mistake about it, we are very proud of these results. First and most notable, our organic revenue, excluding COVID, grew 21.9% and with two out of three divisions growing north of 25%. By division, excluding COVID, Diagnostics were 14.9%, and again, powered by molecular diagnostics, which grew nearly 24%. Surgical also continued to deliver growing 25.2%. And Breast Health returned to growth, posting a very strong performance of 25.7% growth. Our outstanding results are a testament to the commitment of our many colleagues around the world to our purpose, passion and promise to elevate women's health. Without the discipline and incredible execution of our teams who have shown up every day throughout the pandemic. This strong performance would not be possible. Turning to our themes for today. First, we'll provide insight into the growth drivers in each division to showcase and to reinforce the diversity and durability of our transformed business. Second, we'll review our strong performance against our 2023 guidance and longer-term growth targets, helping to frame the outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year and longer term. And to close, we'll reflect on where we stand with COVID today, our progress through the pandemic and our excitement as we look ahead. With that brief introduction, let's now focus on our second quarter performance and specifically, the growth drivers powering our strong results. At the highest level, we continue to demonstrate and appreciate that many of you have come to realize our business is dramatically different compared to where we were pre-pandemic. We are more balanced, more diverse and more durable. Through the pandemic, we strategically added growth drivers across the company that are contributing to our top line growth today and will do so for years ahead. These innovative products and services are also accretive to our overall strength within the markets we participate in, deepening our strong relationships with the customers we serve. While the macro environment continues to present a multitude of challenges, you can count on us to deliver. In Diagnostics, Molecular Diagnostics continues to lead the way. Our expanded global installed base of Panthers, over 3,250 strong represents the catalyst for the division's sustained growth. The superior workflow of the Panther combined with our broad menu of nearly 20 FDA-approved assays across the Panther and Panther Fusion systems, creates tremendous value for our customers. and differentiates us from our competition. As we exit the pandemic, we are placing more menu with more throughput on more Panthers and adding more Panther Fusion systems, positioning labs to unlock our full breadth of menu over time. Hologic and our Panther systems are well positioned to continue our strong performance. Consistent with prior quarters, the pillars of Molecular Diagnostics growth were diverse in the period. Growth was driven by our BVCVTV vaginitis panel and aided by our core STI menu, including Clemidiagonrhia, HPV and Trich. We also once again had strong contributions from Biotheranostics and our respiratory menu on the Panther Fusion, where we expect the latter of the two to be more seasonal in nature. In Breast Health, after four quarters of decline, primarily due to semiconductor chip supply headwinds, the division emphatically returned to growth, posting 25.7% growth for the quarter. Comp considerations aside, the strong growth in Breast Health resulted from a combination of four positive factors. First, semiconductor chip availability continues to improve, allowing for the delivery of more gantries in the quarter than planned. This included moving a number of gantries originally allocated for the back half of the year into the second quarter. As a result, for the balance of the year, we anticipate Q3 and Q4 gantry delivery levels to each register modestly below Q2, though still well ahead of last year as our visibility and chip availability continues to strengthen. Second, exceptional demand for our clinically differentiated mammography instruments remains high. And despite the duration of the chip headwind, our backlog remains strong, and we are seeing no increase in order cancellations. Third, in Q2, we again delivered strong service revenue service being the largest source of revenue for the division as we consistently demonstrate our value proposition and strengthen our relationships with customers. And fourth, the interventional side of the Breast Health business returned to form, growing 13.9% for the quarter, driven by our disposable portfolio such as Brevera biopsy needles and Somatex Tumark markers. This strong interventional result also serves as an indication of our success navigating some of the non-chip related supply chain headwinds we faced in prior quarters. To close out Breast Health, we'd like to take this opportunity to thank our chip supply partners who have aligned with our purpose and have prioritized women's health. As a result, we had the ability and confidence to deliver more gantries than projected this quarter, and our customers are better positioned to screen more women sooner rather than later. We are thankful for these strengthened partnerships, which have also undeniably influenced our innovation and design efforts, making Hologic even stronger for the future. While much attention has been given to Diagnostics and Breast Health, our surgical business has also remarkably transformed during the last few years and is emerging as a meaningful driver of growth for us globally, a completely different business than three to four years ago. It's much bigger, stronger and faster growing. In Q2, Surgical grew more than 25% and was driven by strong contributions from our hysteroscopic portfolio of MyoSure the Fluent fluid management system and NovaSure. On the latter, we are encouraged by yet another strong quarter for our latest NovaSure iteration, the NovaSure V5. In addition, our laparoscopic portfolio continues to build momentum and is growing into a larger driver for the division. Now we'll move on from the division growth drivers to reflect on our performance against our guidance for the year. At the beginning of the fiscal year, we said that each division would deliver low double-digit organic growth for 2023, excluding COVID. As the Q2 close marks the halfway point of the fiscal year, we are pleased to share our progress towards achieving our 2023 goal. Through the first half of our fiscal year, the total company has delivered organic growth of nearly 14%, excluding COVID. And by division, Diagnostics, Surgical and Health have grown 15.4%, 19.6% and 9.1%, respectively. This puts us in great shape to achieve or exceed our initial low double-digit 2023 targets. Looking ahead, Diagnostics and Surgical, we will have much tougher comps going forward. By the close of Q3 last year, both divisions were posting solid numbers, resulting in a healthier, stronger comps will now be facing. And for Breast Health going forward, due to the phasing of the chip headwind, the opposite is true. Our Breast Health comps in the back half of fiscal '23 will be softer than in Q2. Now, focusing on our longer-term growth projections with recent very strong results, we understand that some may question whether our 5% to 7% excluding COVID, organic revenue growth rate through 2025 is still appropriate. In short, we believe that it is because we see fiscal '23 as a unique year. Taking a step back, we view our long-term revenue goal as more impressive today due to our expectation for double-digit growth in 2023 on top of our already strong performance since we announced the target. Shifting gears to our final topic today, COVID. In Q2, we generated $71 million in COVID assay revenue, exceeding our prior guidance of $50 million. We are excited for the opportunity to turn the corner and further concentrate our energy and resources to continue to drive our dynamic business forward. Since the start of the pandemic in early 2020, we maximize the opportunities presented. We rose to the occasion, delivering high-quality, highly accurate molecular tests to meet the world's thing needs. For this, we are extremely proud. And should COVID Wave's return leaning on a massive expansion of our manufacturing capacity and operational flexibility, we are even more capable of weathering future storms. We are also extremely proud of the larger and stronger business Hologic is today. We've accelerated years of Panther placements across the globe. And as a byproduct, we expanded our largely domestic business into a much more formidable global enterprise. Today, Hologic is a more recognized and respected worldwide brand which is immensely more influence to advance women's health around the world. With the benefits from our response to the pandemic.We diligently and thoughtfully invested in our business, adding growth driving products through organic R&D innovation and completing strategic acquisitions. And equally important, through it all, even during the strongest quarters of COVID revenue, we maintained expense discipline. We managed our business with precision and never got ahead of ourselves with headcount. And when the world needed it most, we made opportunistic and carefully timed to marketing investments with our Super Bowl ad and WTA sponsorship, each encouraging women to prioritize their health and to return to well woman exams that were put off during the pandemic, maintaining our operational discipline and opportunistic investment approach, affords us the ability to continue to support R&D, marketing and sales initiatives today, all while keeping expenses relatively flat versus a year ago, after adjusting for the Super Bowl and WTA initiatives. All in, our Q2 results demonstrate that we are realizing the benefits of our transformed bigger, stronger business that is fueled by our purpose-driven culture. We've built our culture from the ground up over many years, and it has powered our success through the challenges of pandemic, where we maximized our opportunity. As a result, Hologic has transformed into the strong force we are today and at the same time, transformed our future. We have strengthened our durable growth path, and our future is bright. With that, let me turn the call over to Karleen.\nKarleen Oberton: Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my statements today, I'm going to recap our divisional revenue results, provide a walk-through of our income statement, touch on a few other key financial metrics and finish with our guidance for the full year and third quarter of fiscal 2023. As Steve said, our second quarter financial results were very strong and well ahead of our expectations for both revenue and profitability. Total revenue came in at $1.03 billion beating the midpoint of our guidance by over $70 million. And our non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.06, 25% higher than the midpoint of our guide. . We also continue to repurchase our shares. In Q2, we repurchased approximately 600,000 shares for $50 million. And year-to-date, we have repurchased 2.2 million shares for $150 million. Before moving to our divisional results, we want to emphasize again that our balance sheet is a bedrock of strength in an uncertain macro landscape. With nearly $2.6 billion of cash and a leverage ratio well below our target range, we have tremendous amount of firepower should opportunities for capital deployment arise. However, while we are very active, our philosophy remains to be patient, which we will discuss in more substance shortly. Before we do that, let me recap our divisional revenue results. In Diagnostics, global revenue of $464.7 million declined 52.2%. However, it is important to recognize that COVID testing revenue in the prior year period was inflated because of Omicron. Specifically, we generated $584 million of COVID assay revenue in Q2 2022, more than 8x higher than our COVID assay revenue for Q2 2023. Therefore, a more accurate depiction of the long-term health of the Diagnostics business is to exclude COVID assay and related ancillary revenues. By making this adjustment, we see that organic diagnostics revenue increased 14.9% in the quarter. The Diagnostics division continues to be led by molecular, which grew nearly 24% in the period, excluding COVID. As Steve highlighted, Power in Q2 performance within Molecular Diagnostics was our increasingly diverse portfolio of assets as the newer assays contributed alongside our legacy women's health portfolio. Rounding out Diagnostics, our cytology and perinatal businesses declined 0.7% compared to the prior year. Moving to Breast Health. Our fiscal second quarter results were terrific. Total revenue of $385.4 million increased 25.7%, and while this performance was aided by soft comps due to supply chain headwinds in the prior year, the outcome still exceeded our estimates. Moving next to Surgical. Second quarter revenue of $144.8 million increased approximately 25% compared to the prior year. And finally, in our Skeletal business, revenue of $31.6 million increased slightly more than 53%. It is important to point out that growth rates in our Skeletal business can change based on the timing of just a few orders, therefore, we would caution when modeling not to extrapolate this level of growth going forward. Now let's move on to the rest of the non-GAAP P&L for the second quarter. Gross margin of 62.1% was driven by strong performance in our base business and higher-than-expected COVID-19 testing revenues. Total operating expenses of $317 million in the second quarter decreased 6.3%. The decrease was driven by less marketing spend as our Super Bowl ad in the initial portion of the expense from our partnership with the WTA were incurred in the prior year period. When normalizing for these marketing initiatives, total operating expenses would have been relatively flat compared to the prior year, partially offsetting lower marketing spend in the quarter was higher R&D and sales expense as we continue to invest in internal programs to drive top line growth. Below operating income, other expense represented a gain in our fiscal second quarter. Net, we benefited from higher interest rates in the period as interest income from our nearly $2.6 billion cash balance more than offset elevated interest expense on our floating rate debt instruments. Finally, our tax rate in Q2 was 19%, as expected. Putting these pieces together, operating margin for Q2 came in at 31.3% and net margin was 25.9%. Non-GAAP net income finished at $265.7 million and non-GAAP EPS was $1.06. Moving on from the P&L. Cash flow from operations was $206.3 million in the second quarter. We had nearly $2.6 billion of cash on our balance sheet and our leverage ratio remained at 0.2x. As it relates to our broader capital allocation strategy, our philosophy remains unchanged. We continue to be very active and selective in screening potential targets, while also exercising discipline and patience. We are operating from a position of strength as we explore opportunities. Now let's move on to our updated non-GAAP financial guidance for the third quarter and full year fiscal 2023. In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect strong financial results with total revenue in the range of $930 million to $980 million, representing another quarter of double-digit growth when you exclude COVID. For the full year fiscal 2023, we are again increasing our guidance and expect total revenue in the range of $3.925 billion to $4.025 billion. To help with constant currency modeling, we are assuming minimal foreign exchange headwinds in the third quarter at less than $5 million. And for the full year, we are expecting approximately $40 million in foreign exchange headwinds. These headwinds have improved compared to our previous guidance as the relative strength of the U.S. dollar has abated over the past several months. Turning to our divisions. Each business maintains its own unique growth drivers for the remainder of our fiscal 2023 and beyond. In Diagnostics, we expect continued strong performance out of molecular, aided by steady support from cytology. Within molecular, we are excited to go after additional greenfield opportunities with newer assays such as BV/CVTV and Amgen, while also reinforcing our leadership position in core women's health screening. Closing out non-COVID diagnostics, we expect blood revenue of slightly more than $30 million for the year. In terms of COVID revenue, we expect COVID assay sales to be approximately $25 million in the third quarter of 2023 and $245 million for the full year. COVID-related items, inclusive of a small amount of discontinued product revenue are expected to be slightly less than $30 million in the third quarter and approximately $120 million for the full year. Moving to Breast Health. As mentioned, we capitalized on improved chip availability and moved a number of gantries allocated for the back half of the year into Q2. As a result, we are assuming total Breast Health revenue above Q1 2023 levels for each quarter in the back half of this fiscal year, but below Q2. These results are still expected to deliver healthy double-digit revenue growth compared to the prior year in Q3 and Q4. Finally, in Surgical, we expect strong low double-digit growth in fiscal Q3 and for the full year. Starting with our legacy portfolio, we are pleased by the performance of NovaSure and MyoSure. In NovaSure, customers continue to see the benefits of our innovative V5 line extension. And with MyoSure, we continue to grow the myomectomy total addressable market. However, the beauty of our surgical business today is that the franchise is more than just NovaSure, MyoSure, and our guidance contemplates fluent, Bolder and Acessa adding accretive growth to the division's top line. Moving down the P&Listen-only mode, for the full year, we continue to expect our non-GAAP gross margin percentage to be in the low 60s, and our non-GAAP operating margin percentage to be approximately 30%. Within this operating margin profile, we have again incorporated elevated inflationary pressures into our guidance of approximately 200 to 250 basis points, which we expect to persist throughout fiscal 2023 and likely into fiscal 2024. In terms of operating expenses, we expect spending to move lower sequentially in Q3 and remain relatively flat in Q4. As Steve shared, we are proud of how we have managed expenses over the last several years. Our level of operating expense is expected to decline not because of reduction in head count but rather due to our efficient management of larger marketing initiatives coinciding with periods of elevated COVA testing revenue. Below operating income, we expect other income net to be an expense of slightly more than $20 million for the full year. Our guidance is based on an annual effective tax rate of approximately 19% and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately $250 million for the full year. All this nets out to expected non-GAAP EPS of $0.83 to $0.93 in the third quarter and $3.75 to $3.95 for the year. To conclude, our strong second quarter results exceeded our guidance, and we are once again raising our full year estimates despite larger macro uncertainties. Our growth in the quarter was broad-based with each business growing double digits organically, excluding COVID. Our results reinforce the fact that Hologic is a much stronger company than just a few years ago. We are larger and more durable than prior to the pandemic and balance sheet is as strong as it's ever been. As we move to the back half of our fiscal 2020 , we are excited to continue to advance women's health, while also delivering strong financial results and creating value for all of our stakeholders. With that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Citi.\nPatrick Donnelly: Karleen, maybe just 1 on the margin profile. You guys have done 31%, I think, both this quarter and last quarter. That guidance still for 30% op margins, obviously implies a bit of a step down here in the second half. Can you just talk about, I guess, the moving pieces in the second half? And then just thinking forward about what the right exit rate would be? Because, obviously, again, the second half will be a little lower as we work our way towards '24, just thinking about the margin profile. I know during COVID, you guys always talked about kind of that landing rate margin numbers. So if we could just revisit that and the second half and then also does that move forward right ballpark to think about the out margin would be helpful?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes, sure. So I think when you look at the second half compared to the first two quarters, certainly, the low COVID revenue are putting pressure on that operating margin compared to the first half. And I think prior to pandemic, Patrick, what is also putting pressure on those operating margins are the higher inflationary costs that we've quantified it. 200 to 250 basis points for the full year. So I think moving forward to think about low 30s is probably the right way to think about it as we move forward, like you said.\nPatrick Donnelly: Okay. Understood. M&A commentary, Steve, that's something that's come up a lot more this quarter with investors. I know Karleen, I think you had a tremendous amount of firepower there during the call. Can you just talk about the pipeline, the appetite here? I know you guys want to be patient, but what the right sizing is, whether it's a leverage ratio? Is -- are you looking only in core areas, Steve, I believe you said in the past, you don't want to add another leg to the stool, but would love to just talk through the M&A side, given it's become a bit more of a focus here since last quarter?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. I think overall, Patrick, our strategy remains the same, which is being patient, diligent and active. And I think our focus continues to be leveraging the capabilities and strengths that we have and leveraging the existing sales channels. So bulking up the businesses that we have makes sense. We are considering widening the aperture to consider larger deals, but frankly, those would be things with more mature earnings profiles and still be accretive to growth. So each of the divisions has some pretty nice pipelines. We've also because the core business is doing so well, again, I think it gives us that ability to be patient because we don't have to do anything. And so it's this magical combination of we can afford to be patient. We've got a lot going on, but we'll continue to see where it goes.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from the line of Tim Daley with Wells Fargo.\nTimothy Daley: So just curious about the growth performance driven by the selling days. I think you guys called out two extra selling days in the quarter. What was the contribution of that towards growth? And then how should we think about that for the year? And then as well, any potential offsets or not once we start thinking about modeling 2024?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes, the contribution really wasn't that significant, probably less than 200 basis points in the quarter. I think when we compare it to Q1, we had that full calendar week, which drives the service revenue which really didn't have any minimal impact in this quarter. And as we look at the balance of the year, I think it's a pretty negligible effect of extra days.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Casey Woodring with JPMorgan.\nCasey Woodring: So you talked about Breast Health pull forward on ship allocations, which sort of drove the non-COVID beat here. Is there further upside to chip allocations this year because we see another surprise pump in the back half, I would be interested to hear what you're hearing from suppliers on that front?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes, Casey, I think it was kind of more of a onetime bump here as it now gets very steady. I think we feel really good about our visibility frankly, not just through '23 but into '24, and we continue to manage this for the long haul. We had to run a little extra over time for some of our service people with the extra installs, and I think we'll be at a really good rate here going forward.\nCasey Woodring: Great. And then just longer term, have you changed your expectations at all within molecular diagnostics as it relates to the 5% to 7% total diagnostic growth guide? Just looking at non-COVID side has been strong for a number of quarters. So just trying to think through your expectations on that business, have they changed at all since you gave that initial guidance now back in July of 2021?\nStephen MacMillan: Longer term, not necessarily. We always just want to be careful not to get ahead of ourselves. I think clearly, in the short term, and what we aspire to be is certainly better. And clearly, what we're putting up right now is great. Now it's going to be much tougher clearly when we start bumping up against 24% comparable levels, then growing that in that 5% to 7% on top of those numbers. cumulative is going to be a lot better off than frankly, when we gave the guidance. So in fact, in some ways, it actually is much higher, but we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves on that number.\nKarleen Oberton: Yes, Casey, I would just add that we've always said that we'd expect molecular to be at that high end of that 5% to 7%, if not slightly over, but overall, Dx would be within the 5% to 7%.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone with Mizuho Group.\nAnthony Petrone: And congrats on another strong quarter here. The first 1 will be on surgical the 25% organic. Just trying to get an understanding of how much of that is underlying procedures within women's health just coming back versus, let's say, synergies with Bolder Surgical? And then I'll have 1 quick follow-up on molecular.\nStephen MacMillan: Sure, Anthony. I think it's probably more the market coming back. And combined with Surgical was weaker in this quarter a year ago because of the Onton surge. And I think the I go back to a year ago where people were kind of picking at gee, surgical might not be as strong or whatever else, and it was back to. That was a market dynamic, and I think now there's probably some catch-up going on procedure-wise as you're hearing really across the med tech space. And having said that, I think we feel really good about how we're performing among that, both with our existing businesses and frankly, having the broader portfolio that you referenced.\nKarleen Oberton: Yes, we're just -- we're getting some really nice traction internationally with our surgical business, a smaller base, but like I said, some really nice traction that's helping that growth rate for sure. .\nAnthony Petrone: And then on molecular, just excluding COVID, another strong quarter. And just wondering if you could provide an update on where utilization on the Panther systems that were placed during the pandemic, those new systems where you had some demand pull, just where utilization on those systems is today? And where do you think it can go over the next 12 to 18 months?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes, Anthony, we haven't really -- we haven't disclosed that utilization number, but what we have said is that of the new Panthers placed since April 2020, over 85% customers globally are driving at least 1 other assay beyond COVID. And I think 55% have at least 2 other assays that are driving that utilization. So feel good about the stickiness of those Panthers, the new Panthers that have been placed.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Liza Garcia with UBS.\nElizabeth Garcia: Congrats on another strong quarter. I guess on a maybe Biotheranostics. So you guys -- maybe if you could dive in there and thinking about that one. So I know you said strong contribution there, but I know you recently opened up the lab and you've been working on initiatives to help that improving the customer ordering flow. But how do we think about the run rate of the business there and where that can go and kind of thinking about that in the diagnostics platform?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. I think we are as excited, if not more excited about the growth potential, probably more excited even, I would say, Liza today than when we acquired the business. The team that we have there is great. As you mentioned, we've now brought the lab over from nearby we've consolidated into our San Diego facility. And I think we're realizing that the penetration of this opportunity relative to the full market is still in the very low single digits. So there's potentially a lot of runway. We've been putting in more automation, frankly, just to make the ordering systems easier and other stuff. And I think we're really excited. It's clearly growing very accretive to the growth rate of the division, and we think will be for -- that's 1 of those for years to come.\nElizabeth Garcia: Great. That's helpful. And then just circling back to kind of guidance surge. I know that there was some weakness last quarter, but even kind of when you do the two-year stack, I'm still getting to some low double digits kind of growth there. And I think you've called out just kind of the performance of NovaSure and V5 kind if you could just dig in a little bit on kind of -- it seems like it's been surprising you to the upside there. And obviously, I know that you got Fluent and Acessa as well. Just kind of where that portfolio can go and how you think about that and the growth levels there?\nStephen MacMillan: Liza, I think this is 1 we've been incredibly excited under the leadership of Essex Mitchell, who's been running that business now for the last few years. he's dramatically strengthened both the U.S. business as well as we've made a couple of those great acquisitions of Acessa and Bolder. And so we are seeing some really nice growth. I still think this quarter, may have been a little bit of procedural catch-up in the overall market. So we never -- as you know, we never want to get too far ahead of ourselves, but we love the team that we have there now. And as Karleen said, and you can see in the press release, the growth rate internationally now for Surgical is really, really doing well. We're north of 30%. And I think in this quarter, close to 40-ish and that's starting to become meaningful. So I think our -- as we sit here today and think about another growth driver for this company, Surgical is definitely in there.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Andrew Cooper with Raymond James.\nAndrew Cooper: Maybe just 1 more on breast and thinking about the commentary for the back half of the year. How much of that pull forward do we think about working the backlog down and that's why maybe a little bit lower quarter-over-quarter into 3Q versus still being a little bit limited by chip supply? Just where are you in terms of kind of the allocations versus what you'd ideally like to have? And just help us think about sort of the cadence as we work through the back half of the year in terms of why a little bit lower or being able to maintain maybe the great level that you saw in this quarter?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. What hasn't changed is the chip availability. And with that increased confidence we allowed to accelerate into Q2 from the back half. So the total production outlook hasn't changed. And I think as we've always as Steve mentioned, to accelerate even here in the quarter is an uptake on our service, our field service engineers to do those installs. So like we've said all along, we don't think we'll have any outsized quarters as we move through this recovery. And certainly, cancellations are at a minimal level and that backlog is still really strong.\nAndrew Cooper: Okay. Super helpful. And then maybe just 1 more. You mentioned the respiratory seasonality in the prepared remarks. So can you maybe just help us think about the sizing of kind of where that business is on a non-COVID basis today? And how you think about what that seasonality really looks like through the course of the year as it continues to kind of stick with us post-COVID?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. I mean really strong performance. If we think about growth year-over-year, that non-COVID respiratory more than doubled versus prior year in the quarter. But what we are planning conservatively is a significant step down in Q3 and Q4, given the seasonal nature of the respiratory infections. But this continues as the flu seasons in the flu season, we're seeing really nice uptake in growth in that business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Puneet Souda with SVB Securities.\nPuneet Souda: Steve, congrats on another solid quarter here. So first one, at a high level, given the macro uncertainty which businesses -- I mean, if things -- obviously, recessionary talk is here and ongoing and expectations are sort of lower for the second half across overall in the economy. So where do you think the businesses can hold up better versus others where the team is continuing to watch sort of more closely for the demand term versus where you think the demand will continue to outpace the macro uncertainties?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. Truthfully, I think we feel good about all three of the businesses as we go into the back half of the year. I mean, obviously, it's -- the biggest thing is it's 1 reason we wouldn't get ahead of ourselves and start to raise guidance and long-term expectations when we're going into that exact uncertainty that you're referencing. But the fundamentals of each of the businesses, I think we feel really good about.\nPuneet Souda: Got it. And then a question on HPV stand-alone versus co-testing that's come up again in our investor conversations. So just wondering any updated thoughts on the potential for it to go stand-alone versus co-testing? And do you think the USPSTF guidelines could get revised potentially with updated information from ACC? And do you see any risk for COVID testing from sort of primary testing with the new emerging competitors in the space?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. Let's start at the highest level. There is no doubt in our minds that more frequent co-testing is still the absolute best health care for women. There are anecdotal increases that we're starting to see upticks in cervical cancer screening since the intervals have gotten longer. And frankly, there's enough data out there that is co-testing is significantly better than HPV primary alone. So while there are those advocating for that and USPSTF could do that. It doesn't make it the best science. And I think where we feel really, really good. And as you know, in our tagline is the science of sure. We feel it's our responsibility to bring the best care to women around the world, and we're going to continue to drive for co-testing as the right way to go. So -- and frankly, I think most of the -- certainly, most of the U.S. doctors are well aware of that. And even if the USPSTF does something to change those guidelines. We think that will be slow to change because of the remarkable success of the PAP test in largely almost eliminating cervical cancer screening over the last generation or two particularly in the U.S. So it's something we feel very strongly about, and we believe time and the science will be on our side. Having said that, there's going to be pressure. There's deep pocket pharmaceutical companies that want to try to drive to HPV primary. But we feel really good about the science on our side and that our business will be more durable.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research.\nJack Meehan: Wanted to get your latest expectations on COVID-19. So I heard the guidance commentary. We've heard from some of the big labs about volume following off and we have the PHE expiry coming soon. Can you just talk about like the stickiness of this product line and what your latest stab is on when an endemic number or guidepost might be for 2024 here?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes, Jack, I think the fundamental reality on COVID is none of us have been able to predict more than a quarter out going. I think, if anything, our expectations for next year might be a little bit less I think we're certainly starting to see it start to ramp off a bit. And yet, what we feel really good about is those that are still going to do it, we'll be using us. I think there'll still be usage at the hospital levels for admissions, for staff, those kind of pieces. So I think we're still going to have some ongoing business, but we're still having it this quarter. But I think clearly, you see it coming down to just a few percentage points of the total business at this point. And it's hard to fully predict certainly by the time a guidance next year will be more up to date. But it certainly looks like it's falling off pretty sharply at this point, which keep down for our company and getting on with it and letting people look at the true transformation of the business, we kind of like but a little bit of that profit flowing through isn't bad either.\nJack Meehan: Yes, makes sense. Just as a follow-up, I wanted to talk about something that might be a little bit more not that COVID isn't durable, but might be more durable in the eyes of investors, the vaginitis panel. Can you just give any color on the size of that business now? Is it annualizing over $100 million at this point? And just talk about like the penetration in your customer base, how is that going?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. We're really pleased with the performance in that uptake and our full year outlook would be that, that would be over a $100 million business. Clearly, 1 of our top women's health assays and think there's still room to grow there. So really excited about that uptake and what we can do there with our customers.\nStephen MacMillan: It's been a really nice surprise for us how big that's getting held quickly, Jack.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley.\nTejas Savant: One quick cleanup question on guidance. Actually, Steve, if I may. You got the approval in Europe and Canada on V5 for NovaSure. How are you thinking about the revenue implications of that over the medium term here? NovaSure. I mean, it's been a flattish business, doesn't get too much attention from investors, but I think it's still the second largest piece of that segment for you?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. That business has been a great business. When I arrived here 10 years ago. The -- that was the big part of this division. That was most of it, and Myosure was this little thing. And it's been fun to see MyoSure come up. But I think our team has done a great job of really trying to maintain NovaSure in the midst of all kinds of both market issues from the ACA Act and everything else and just continue to bring innovation, and it's still a great procedure. So I think the overall procedural numbers, that marketplace probably continues to be a low single-digit decliner. But I think we do -- we're doing well within that from a share and an innovation standpoint.\nTejas Savant: Got it. That's helpful. And then one on Imaging. Karleen, I know you talked about sort of the cadence you're normalizing versus F2 2Q levels for the gantries. But did you benefit at all from this very significant correction in demand that some of these semi manufacturers are seeing? I know you've talked about your chips being very distinct from what into consumer products in the past. But just curious as to whether that drove a little bit of the uplift here? And to your point, Steve, around the macro being something you're watching, is this just sort of a little bit of conservatism and wider error bars around sort of the normalization trajectory here that's making you take a relatively conservative stance of the gantry replacements versus the field service engineers in that aspect of it?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. So just on the chip issue itself, I don't -- increasing availability was not the direct result of demand dropping other sectors. It is more of our partnerships with our suppliers and having them understand what we're using the chips for and how important they are and really working closely with them versus other sectors, demand declining. And sorry, you had a second part of that question.\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. And the other part was just -- we're being conservative. I think we're managing for the long haul here, too. We're very much thinking about 2024 and what things look like there. And I think this is already a really, really good year, and let's get ahead of ourselves.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Brackmann with William Blair.\nAndrew Brackmann: I've actually got two questions on Molecular Diagnostics and sexual health specifically. So I'll just ask them both the front. First, CDC had the report out a few weeks ago showing the rise in FTI cases. So maybe can you just sort of remind us on some of the initiatives that you have here with customers and public health services broadly for your testing solutions? And then just secondly, on this platform, can you just sort of talk about what you're seeing internationally with this franchise anything in terms of where wins might be coming from, be that versus competitor tests or even sort of LDTs transitioning here?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. I think the first part, Andrew, really is -- I think it's the given gem of our company that doesn't always get as much attention, but is that dedicated physician sales force that we have within our Diagnostics business, that's really unique. It's an extra investment from our end, but it is having our reps that call on the physicians and really help educate them, both about the guidelines and including the changing guidelines where we've gone to effectively the need to opt out. So you're getting more screening earlier. And we're -- it allows us to partner with a lot of the major labs and even hospital systems where they value that education that we do. And it helps us both shape but also build markets. When you look at really what Hologic has done, and I think we've been pretty good about it across our businesses, we've helped create a lot of markets through physician education. I mean, if you go back to the original Pap test and thin prep and what we did there, what NovaSure and MyoSure have done, and we're doing it a lot in diagnostics, certainly through the STIs. And to the second part of your question on international, I think, again, by placing so many Panthers internationally, it's allowed us to have more of those discussions and start to get some of that menu in around the world as well and then hopefully able to help educate and shift guidelines in those countries over the years ahead as well.\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. The only thing I would add internationally for molecular diagnostics is our viral business, specifically in Africa continues to have really nice double-digit growth as we make investments there to help that region.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.\nJohn Murphy: This is John on for Derek. I wanted to ask, so recently, a federal judge struck down a key provisions of the Affordable Care Act and that kind of jeopardize the free coverage of wide-ranging preventive services, including mammograms and cervical cancer screening. How do you see this playing out? And I guess, are you worried at all about reimbursement? Or is that -- or do you have any fear of having to pay -- or the patients having to pay out of pocket and that will deter them from screening?\nStephen MacMillan: No. I mean, there's been so many various court cases between state, federal, all kinds of, frankly, goofiness going on in the political and court systems right now. we tend to think here, things will prevail and be fine over time. So we're not going to react any 1 thing that could easily get overturned again.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore.\nVijay Kumar: Steve, congrats on a really strong quarter here.\nStephen MacMillan: Thanks. Sorry, I missed you on the visit out here.\nVijay Kumar: No. No, all good. You guys made it up with the print. I guess on some of the numbers we're seeing here, Steve. I'm this is almost.\nStephen MacMillan: Personality come on.\nVijay Kumar: You made it up with some pretty impressive numbers. This is almost also kind of numbers 20%. Now and from an perspective, there's backlog. So I was just curious, when you look at numbers like 25% GYN, and 15% overall diagnostics to you. What do you think is driving this? Is this a catch-up of backlog? Or is this perhaps a pull forward of demand? And related to that, Steve, first half, I think the organic now was almost teens, mid-teens. I think the prior guidance here for all segments, double digits. Is the implication now for the back half 6% to 7% in line with the longer-term shafts? So just talk about what drove first half and what the implication is for the second half?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. I think the implication for the second half is still much better than the numbers you just mentioned the -- we're still saying double digit here in the third quarter and likely fourth. So I think -- I don't think it was pull forward, Vijay, to be very clear. I do think the GynSurg market probably like some of the ortho markets and some of the other markets, some of the docs may have been doing more, what I would call catch up. So I don't think it's as much pull forward, but they're catching up from the last few years not maybe doing as many procedures as they could have. So I think will that same quarter a year from now, maybe not be quite as active yes, but I don't think it was any kind of pull forward per se. I think it's more catch-up. And I think we just feel great about our surgical business, we have added more growth drivers. I think, again, it's been kind of missed in the COVID spikes. I think it's the business that's been most overlooked because of the way the COVID spikes were happening. And just really proud of what that team is doing and we've added Fluent we got MyoSure and NovaSure doing well, and then we've got Bolder and Acessa. And we've got that business getting stronger internationally.\nVijay Kumar: That's helpful, Steve. And Karleen, one for you here. I know you called out the data, any days impact here in back half are days never a headwind here in the back half? And -- sorry, on capital allocation, is this -- Steve, sorry, I missed your comments. Are you saying like the pipeline is looking healthier? Maybe just put some context around the M&A commentary here on perhaps we're getting closer to something here in the near term versus how we should interpret your commentary around the pipeline looking good across all segments?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. Let me start with the days, Vijay. So we have, I think, 1 less day in the fourth quarter. So really negligible impact in the back half of the year when we talk about selling days. And again, here in the second quarter, a little bit of benefit, but not to the extent that we had in the first quarter given the full calendar week and how that impacts our service line. . And let me try to answer your M&A. I think what I would say is a couple of things, as we said in the prepared remarks, our philosophy and approach hasn't changed. Division-led, very active, probably some rebuilding over the past year in diagnostics of the pipeline, given the level of acquisitions we did in 2021. But we're approaching it from a position of strength. Our aperture is a little wider, given our firepower and that we can look at some things that may be a little bigger than we've done in the past. But certainly, those things we're looking for mature on product -- on market products and accretive to earnings. So not looking for a fourth leg of a stool that just to leverage our strengths and capabilities that we have across our current businesses.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Navann Ty with BNP Paribas Exane.\nNavann Ty Dietschi: I just have a few on women's health. So what's the vaginosis assay still the key driver of Q2 performance? And can you discuss the competitive environment in women's health, so competitors far behind, given Hologics, competitive advantage and women's health focus? And does Hologic still benefit from the opt-out guideline for its legacy test? And I have a follow-up on M&A after.\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. So our vaginosis panel, as we said, we really like the performance that we're seeing. The outlook would be that, that's greater than $100 million for 2023 and really put that as 1 of our top assay. Women's health was still market leaders in protecting that market leadership. And as Steve said, one of the kind of the secret sauce that's underappreciated in how we do that is our physician sales force that's out there educating physicians on guidelines, promoting testing, and certainly where we saw a change in guidelines about two years ago where it's more universal screening. We're helping grow our business as well as our customers' business with acquisition sales force.\nNavann Ty Dietschi: And then on M&A, so would M&A part of the international expansion? Or is it mostly -- or is international expansion mostly expanding the installed base and menu?\nKarleen Oberton: From an M&A perspective, certainly, some of the recent deals we did -- we acquired companies that were based overseas, but Mobidiag, the biggest 1 would have potential revenue from the U.S. and OUS over time. And then we do have our GoDirect strategy, primarily in our breast health and we've done a little in surgical, where we've, in the past, leverage dealers. And what we find is when we go direct, those businesses perform better as part of Hologic than on a stand-alone basis. But certainly, as a global organization, we look at acquisitions around the globe, not just in the U.S.\nOperator: Thank you. This now concludes Hologic's Second Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Have a good evening.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Karleen Oberton",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my statements today, I'm going to recap our divisional revenue results, provide a walk-through of our income statement, touch on a few other key financial metrics and finish with our guidance for the full year and third quarter of fiscal 2023. As Steve said, our second quarter financial results were very strong and well ahead of our expectations for both revenue and profitability. Total revenue came in at $1.03 billion beating the midpoint of our guidance by over $70 million. And our non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.06, 25% higher than the midpoint of our guide. . We also continue to repurchase our shares. In Q2, we repurchased approximately 600,000 shares for $50 million. And year-to-date, we have repurchased 2.2 million shares for $150 million. Before moving to our divisional results, we want to emphasize again that our balance sheet is a bedrock of strength in an uncertain macro landscape. With nearly $2.6 billion of cash and a leverage ratio well below our target range, we have tremendous amount of firepower should opportunities for capital deployment arise. However, while we are very active, our philosophy remains to be patient, which we will discuss in more substance shortly. Before we do that, let me recap our divisional revenue results. In Diagnostics, global revenue of $464.7 million declined 52.2%. However, it is important to recognize that COVID testing revenue in the prior year period was inflated because of Omicron. Specifically, we generated $584 million of COVID assay revenue in Q2 2022, more than 8x higher than our COVID assay revenue for Q2 2023. Therefore, a more accurate depiction of the long-term health of the Diagnostics business is to exclude COVID assay and related ancillary revenues. By making this adjustment, we see that organic diagnostics revenue increased 14.9% in the quarter. The Diagnostics division continues to be led by molecular, which grew nearly 24% in the period, excluding COVID. As Steve highlighted, Power in Q2 performance within Molecular Diagnostics was our increasingly diverse portfolio of assets as the newer assays contributed alongside our legacy women's health portfolio. Rounding out Diagnostics, our cytology and perinatal businesses declined 0.7% compared to the prior year. Moving to Breast Health. Our fiscal second quarter results were terrific. Total revenue of $385.4 million increased 25.7%, and while this performance was aided by soft comps due to supply chain headwinds in the prior year, the outcome still exceeded our estimates. Moving next to Surgical. Second quarter revenue of $144.8 million increased approximately 25% compared to the prior year. And finally, in our Skeletal business, revenue of $31.6 million increased slightly more than 53%. It is important to point out that growth rates in our Skeletal business can change based on the timing of just a few orders, therefore, we would caution when modeling not to extrapolate this level of growth going forward. Now let's move on to the rest of the non-GAAP P&L for the second quarter. Gross margin of 62.1% was driven by strong performance in our base business and higher-than-expected COVID-19 testing revenues. Total operating expenses of $317 million in the second quarter decreased 6.3%. The decrease was driven by less marketing spend as our Super Bowl ad in the initial portion of the expense from our partnership with the WTA were incurred in the prior year period. When normalizing for these marketing initiatives, total operating expenses would have been relatively flat compared to the prior year, partially offsetting lower marketing spend in the quarter was higher R&D and sales expense as we continue to invest in internal programs to drive top line growth. Below operating income, other expense represented a gain in our fiscal second quarter. Net, we benefited from higher interest rates in the period as interest income from our nearly $2.6 billion cash balance more than offset elevated interest expense on our floating rate debt instruments. Finally, our tax rate in Q2 was 19%, as expected. Putting these pieces together, operating margin for Q2 came in at 31.3% and net margin was 25.9%. Non-GAAP net income finished at $265.7 million and non-GAAP EPS was $1.06. Moving on from the P&L. Cash flow from operations was $206.3 million in the second quarter. We had nearly $2.6 billion of cash on our balance sheet and our leverage ratio remained at 0.2x. As it relates to our broader capital allocation strategy, our philosophy remains unchanged. We continue to be very active and selective in screening potential targets, while also exercising discipline and patience. We are operating from a position of strength as we explore opportunities. Now let's move on to our updated non-GAAP financial guidance for the third quarter and full year fiscal 2023. In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect strong financial results with total revenue in the range of $930 million to $980 million, representing another quarter of double-digit growth when you exclude COVID. For the full year fiscal 2023, we are again increasing our guidance and expect total revenue in the range of $3.925 billion to $4.025 billion. To help with constant currency modeling, we are assuming minimal foreign exchange headwinds in the third quarter at less than $5 million. And for the full year, we are expecting approximately $40 million in foreign exchange headwinds. These headwinds have improved compared to our previous guidance as the relative strength of the U.S. dollar has abated over the past several months. Turning to our divisions. Each business maintains its own unique growth drivers for the remainder of our fiscal 2023 and beyond. In Diagnostics, we expect continued strong performance out of molecular, aided by steady support from cytology. Within molecular, we are excited to go after additional greenfield opportunities with newer assays such as BV/CVTV and Amgen, while also reinforcing our leadership position in core women's health screening. Closing out non-COVID diagnostics, we expect blood revenue of slightly more than $30 million for the year. In terms of COVID revenue, we expect COVID assay sales to be approximately $25 million in the third quarter of 2023 and $245 million for the full year. COVID-related items, inclusive of a small amount of discontinued product revenue are expected to be slightly less than $30 million in the third quarter and approximately $120 million for the full year. Moving to Breast Health. As mentioned, we capitalized on improved chip availability and moved a number of gantries allocated for the back half of the year into Q2. As a result, we are assuming total Breast Health revenue above Q1 2023 levels for each quarter in the back half of this fiscal year, but below Q2. These results are still expected to deliver healthy double-digit revenue growth compared to the prior year in Q3 and Q4. Finally, in Surgical, we expect strong low double-digit growth in fiscal Q3 and for the full year. Starting with our legacy portfolio, we are pleased by the performance of NovaSure and MyoSure. In NovaSure, customers continue to see the benefits of our innovative V5 line extension. And with MyoSure, we continue to grow the myomectomy total addressable market. However, the beauty of our surgical business today is that the franchise is more than just NovaSure, MyoSure, and our guidance contemplates fluent, Bolder and Acessa adding accretive growth to the division's top line. Moving down the P&Listen-only mode, for the full year, we continue to expect our non-GAAP gross margin percentage to be in the low 60s, and our non-GAAP operating margin percentage to be approximately 30%. Within this operating margin profile, we have again incorporated elevated inflationary pressures into our guidance of approximately 200 to 250 basis points, which we expect to persist throughout fiscal 2023 and likely into fiscal 2024. In terms of operating expenses, we expect spending to move lower sequentially in Q3 and remain relatively flat in Q4. As Steve shared, we are proud of how we have managed expenses over the last several years. Our level of operating expense is expected to decline not because of reduction in head count but rather due to our efficient management of larger marketing initiatives coinciding with periods of elevated COVA testing revenue. Below operating income, we expect other income net to be an expense of slightly more than $20 million for the full year. Our guidance is based on an annual effective tax rate of approximately 19% and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately $250 million for the full year. All this nets out to expected non-GAAP EPS of $0.83 to $0.93 in the third quarter and $3.75 to $3.95 for the year. To conclude, our strong second quarter results exceeded our guidance, and we are once again raising our full year estimates despite larger macro uncertainties. Our growth in the quarter was broad-based with each business growing double digits organically, excluding COVID. Our results reinforce the fact that Hologic is a much stronger company than just a few years ago. We are larger and more durable than prior to the pandemic and balance sheet is as strong as it's ever been. As we move to the back half of our fiscal 2020 , we are excited to continue to advance women's health, while also delivering strong financial results and creating value for all of our stakeholders. With that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions. Yes, sure. So I think when you look at the second half compared to the first two quarters, certainly, the low COVID revenue are putting pressure on that operating margin compared to the first half. And I think prior to pandemic, Patrick, what is also putting pressure on those operating margins are the higher inflationary costs that we've quantified it. 200 to 250 basis points for the full year. So I think moving forward to think about low 30s is probably the right way to think about it as we move forward, like you said. Yes, the contribution really wasn't that significant, probably less than 200 basis points in the quarter. I think when we compare it to Q1, we had that full calendar week, which drives the service revenue which really didn't have any minimal impact in this quarter. And as we look at the balance of the year, I think it's a pretty negligible effect of extra days. Yes, Casey, I would just add that we've always said that we'd expect molecular to be at that high end of that 5% to 7%, if not slightly over, but overall, Dx would be within the 5% to 7%. Yes, we're just -- we're getting some really nice traction internationally with our surgical business, a smaller base, but like I said, some really nice traction that's helping that growth rate for sure. . Yes, Anthony, we haven't really -- we haven't disclosed that utilization number, but what we have said is that of the new Panthers placed since April 2020, over 85% customers globally are driving at least 1 other assay beyond COVID. And I think 55% have at least 2 other assays that are driving that utilization. So feel good about the stickiness of those Panthers, the new Panthers that have been placed. Yes. What hasn't changed is the chip availability. And with that increased confidence we allowed to accelerate into Q2 from the back half. So the total production outlook hasn't changed. And I think as we've always as Steve mentioned, to accelerate even here in the quarter is an uptake on our service, our field service engineers to do those installs. So like we've said all along, we don't think we'll have any outsized quarters as we move through this recovery. And certainly, cancellations are at a minimal level and that backlog is still really strong. Yes. I mean really strong performance. If we think about growth year-over-year, that non-COVID respiratory more than doubled versus prior year in the quarter. But what we are planning conservatively is a significant step down in Q3 and Q4, given the seasonal nature of the respiratory infections. But this continues as the flu seasons in the flu season, we're seeing really nice uptake in growth in that business. Yes. We're really pleased with the performance in that uptake and our full year outlook would be that, that would be over a $100 million business. Clearly, 1 of our top women's health assays and think there's still room to grow there. So really excited about that uptake and what we can do there with our customers. Yes. So just on the chip issue itself, I don't -- increasing availability was not the direct result of demand dropping other sectors. It is more of our partnerships with our suppliers and having them understand what we're using the chips for and how important they are and really working closely with them versus other sectors, demand declining. And sorry, you had a second part of that question. Yes. The only thing I would add internationally for molecular diagnostics is our viral business, specifically in Africa continues to have really nice double-digit growth as we make investments there to help that region. Yes. Let me start with the days, Vijay. So we have, I think, 1 less day in the fourth quarter. So really negligible impact in the back half of the year when we talk about selling days. And again, here in the second quarter, a little bit of benefit, but not to the extent that we had in the first quarter given the full calendar week and how that impacts our service line. . And let me try to answer your M&A. I think what I would say is a couple of things, as we said in the prepared remarks, our philosophy and approach hasn't changed. Division-led, very active, probably some rebuilding over the past year in diagnostics of the pipeline, given the level of acquisitions we did in 2021. But we're approaching it from a position of strength. Our aperture is a little wider, given our firepower and that we can look at some things that may be a little bigger than we've done in the past. But certainly, those things we're looking for mature on product -- on market products and accretive to earnings. So not looking for a fourth leg of a stool that just to leverage our strengths and capabilities that we have across our current businesses. Yes. So our vaginosis panel, as we said, we really like the performance that we're seeing. The outlook would be that, that's greater than $100 million for 2023 and really put that as 1 of our top assay. Women's health was still market leaders in protecting that market leadership. And as Steve said, one of the kind of the secret sauce that's underappreciated in how we do that is our physician sales force that's out there educating physicians on guidelines, promoting testing, and certainly where we saw a change in guidelines about two years ago where it's more universal screening. We're helping grow our business as well as our customers' business with acquisition sales force. From an M&A perspective, certainly, some of the recent deals we did -- we acquired companies that were based overseas, but Mobidiag, the biggest 1 would have potential revenue from the U.S. and OUS over time. And then we do have our GoDirect strategy, primarily in our breast health and we've done a little in surgical, where we've, in the past, leverage dealers. And what we find is when we go direct, those businesses perform better as part of Hologic than on a stand-alone basis. But certainly, as a global organization, we look at acquisitions around the globe, not just in the U.S."

            "name": "Stephen MacMillan",
            "content": "Thank you, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Our exceptional results confirmed that Hologic is now a much bigger, stronger company with more diverse and durable growth than pre-pandemic. On top of this transformation, with our strong cash flow and exceptional balance sheet, we are operating from a position of strength and are poised to carry our positive momentum forward. We've also said throughout the pandemic that we've dramatically strengthened the company. We recognize that this transformation was harder to see and fully appreciate against a backdrop of COVID spikes and supply chain anomalies. As these clouds continue to clear the result of our robust transformation really shines. For the quarter, total revenue was $1.03 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.06, both results were above the high end of our guidance. Before providing the highlights for the quarter, which admittedly did have two more selling days, and we were going against softer comps from last year due to the Omicron surge, make no mistake about it, we are very proud of these results. First and most notable, our organic revenue, excluding COVID, grew 21.9% and with two out of three divisions growing north of 25%. By division, excluding COVID, Diagnostics were 14.9%, and again, powered by molecular diagnostics, which grew nearly 24%. Surgical also continued to deliver growing 25.2%. And Breast Health returned to growth, posting a very strong performance of 25.7% growth. Our outstanding results are a testament to the commitment of our many colleagues around the world to our purpose, passion and promise to elevate women's health. Without the discipline and incredible execution of our teams who have shown up every day throughout the pandemic. This strong performance would not be possible. Turning to our themes for today. First, we'll provide insight into the growth drivers in each division to showcase and to reinforce the diversity and durability of our transformed business. Second, we'll review our strong performance against our 2023 guidance and longer-term growth targets, helping to frame the outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year and longer term. And to close, we'll reflect on where we stand with COVID today, our progress through the pandemic and our excitement as we look ahead. With that brief introduction, let's now focus on our second quarter performance and specifically, the growth drivers powering our strong results. At the highest level, we continue to demonstrate and appreciate that many of you have come to realize our business is dramatically different compared to where we were pre-pandemic. We are more balanced, more diverse and more durable. Through the pandemic, we strategically added growth drivers across the company that are contributing to our top line growth today and will do so for years ahead. These innovative products and services are also accretive to our overall strength within the markets we participate in, deepening our strong relationships with the customers we serve. While the macro environment continues to present a multitude of challenges, you can count on us to deliver. In Diagnostics, Molecular Diagnostics continues to lead the way. Our expanded global installed base of Panthers, over 3,250 strong represents the catalyst for the division's sustained growth. The superior workflow of the Panther combined with our broad menu of nearly 20 FDA-approved assays across the Panther and Panther Fusion systems, creates tremendous value for our customers. and differentiates us from our competition. As we exit the pandemic, we are placing more menu with more throughput on more Panthers and adding more Panther Fusion systems, positioning labs to unlock our full breadth of menu over time. Hologic and our Panther systems are well positioned to continue our strong performance. Consistent with prior quarters, the pillars of Molecular Diagnostics growth were diverse in the period. Growth was driven by our BVCVTV vaginitis panel and aided by our core STI menu, including Clemidiagonrhia, HPV and Trich. We also once again had strong contributions from Biotheranostics and our respiratory menu on the Panther Fusion, where we expect the latter of the two to be more seasonal in nature. In Breast Health, after four quarters of decline, primarily due to semiconductor chip supply headwinds, the division emphatically returned to growth, posting 25.7% growth for the quarter. Comp considerations aside, the strong growth in Breast Health resulted from a combination of four positive factors. First, semiconductor chip availability continues to improve, allowing for the delivery of more gantries in the quarter than planned. This included moving a number of gantries originally allocated for the back half of the year into the second quarter. As a result, for the balance of the year, we anticipate Q3 and Q4 gantry delivery levels to each register modestly below Q2, though still well ahead of last year as our visibility and chip availability continues to strengthen. Second, exceptional demand for our clinically differentiated mammography instruments remains high. And despite the duration of the chip headwind, our backlog remains strong, and we are seeing no increase in order cancellations. Third, in Q2, we again delivered strong service revenue service being the largest source of revenue for the division as we consistently demonstrate our value proposition and strengthen our relationships with customers. And fourth, the interventional side of the Breast Health business returned to form, growing 13.9% for the quarter, driven by our disposable portfolio such as Brevera biopsy needles and Somatex Tumark markers. This strong interventional result also serves as an indication of our success navigating some of the non-chip related supply chain headwinds we faced in prior quarters. To close out Breast Health, we'd like to take this opportunity to thank our chip supply partners who have aligned with our purpose and have prioritized women's health. As a result, we had the ability and confidence to deliver more gantries than projected this quarter, and our customers are better positioned to screen more women sooner rather than later. We are thankful for these strengthened partnerships, which have also undeniably influenced our innovation and design efforts, making Hologic even stronger for the future. While much attention has been given to Diagnostics and Breast Health, our surgical business has also remarkably transformed during the last few years and is emerging as a meaningful driver of growth for us globally, a completely different business than three to four years ago. It's much bigger, stronger and faster growing. In Q2, Surgical grew more than 25% and was driven by strong contributions from our hysteroscopic portfolio of MyoSure the Fluent fluid management system and NovaSure. On the latter, we are encouraged by yet another strong quarter for our latest NovaSure iteration, the NovaSure V5. In addition, our laparoscopic portfolio continues to build momentum and is growing into a larger driver for the division. Now we'll move on from the division growth drivers to reflect on our performance against our guidance for the year. At the beginning of the fiscal year, we said that each division would deliver low double-digit organic growth for 2023, excluding COVID. As the Q2 close marks the halfway point of the fiscal year, we are pleased to share our progress towards achieving our 2023 goal. Through the first half of our fiscal year, the total company has delivered organic growth of nearly 14%, excluding COVID. And by division, Diagnostics, Surgical and Health have grown 15.4%, 19.6% and 9.1%, respectively. This puts us in great shape to achieve or exceed our initial low double-digit 2023 targets. Looking ahead, Diagnostics and Surgical, we will have much tougher comps going forward. By the close of Q3 last year, both divisions were posting solid numbers, resulting in a healthier, stronger comps will now be facing. And for Breast Health going forward, due to the phasing of the chip headwind, the opposite is true. Our Breast Health comps in the back half of fiscal '23 will be softer than in Q2. Now, focusing on our longer-term growth projections with recent very strong results, we understand that some may question whether our 5% to 7% excluding COVID, organic revenue growth rate through 2025 is still appropriate. In short, we believe that it is because we see fiscal '23 as a unique year. Taking a step back, we view our long-term revenue goal as more impressive today due to our expectation for double-digit growth in 2023 on top of our already strong performance since we announced the target. Shifting gears to our final topic today, COVID. In Q2, we generated $71 million in COVID assay revenue, exceeding our prior guidance of $50 million. We are excited for the opportunity to turn the corner and further concentrate our energy and resources to continue to drive our dynamic business forward. Since the start of the pandemic in early 2020, we maximize the opportunities presented. We rose to the occasion, delivering high-quality, highly accurate molecular tests to meet the world's thing needs. For this, we are extremely proud. And should COVID Wave's return leaning on a massive expansion of our manufacturing capacity and operational flexibility, we are even more capable of weathering future storms. We are also extremely proud of the larger and stronger business Hologic is today. We've accelerated years of Panther placements across the globe. And as a byproduct, we expanded our largely domestic business into a much more formidable global enterprise. Today, Hologic is a more recognized and respected worldwide brand which is immensely more influence to advance women's health around the world. With the benefits from our response to the pandemic.We diligently and thoughtfully invested in our business, adding growth driving products through organic R&D innovation and completing strategic acquisitions. And equally important, through it all, even during the strongest quarters of COVID revenue, we maintained expense discipline. We managed our business with precision and never got ahead of ourselves with headcount. And when the world needed it most, we made opportunistic and carefully timed to marketing investments with our Super Bowl ad and WTA sponsorship, each encouraging women to prioritize their health and to return to well woman exams that were put off during the pandemic, maintaining our operational discipline and opportunistic investment approach, affords us the ability to continue to support R&D, marketing and sales initiatives today, all while keeping expenses relatively flat versus a year ago, after adjusting for the Super Bowl and WTA initiatives. All in, our Q2 results demonstrate that we are realizing the benefits of our transformed bigger, stronger business that is fueled by our purpose-driven culture. We've built our culture from the ground up over many years, and it has powered our success through the challenges of pandemic, where we maximized our opportunity. As a result, Hologic has transformed into the strong force we are today and at the same time, transformed our future. We have strengthened our durable growth path, and our future is bright. With that, let me turn the call over to Karleen. Yes. I think overall, Patrick, our strategy remains the same, which is being patient, diligent and active. And I think our focus continues to be leveraging the capabilities and strengths that we have and leveraging the existing sales channels. So bulking up the businesses that we have makes sense. We are considering widening the aperture to consider larger deals, but frankly, those would be things with more mature earnings profiles and still be accretive to growth. So each of the divisions has some pretty nice pipelines. We've also because the core business is doing so well, again, I think it gives us that ability to be patient because we don't have to do anything. And so it's this magical combination of we can afford to be patient. We've got a lot going on, but we'll continue to see where it goes. Yes, Casey, I think it was kind of more of a onetime bump here as it now gets very steady. I think we feel really good about our visibility frankly, not just through '23 but into '24, and we continue to manage this for the long haul. We had to run a little extra over time for some of our service people with the extra installs, and I think we'll be at a really good rate here going forward. Longer term, not necessarily. We always just want to be careful not to get ahead of ourselves. I think clearly, in the short term, and what we aspire to be is certainly better. And clearly, what we're putting up right now is great. Now it's going to be much tougher clearly when we start bumping up against 24% comparable levels, then growing that in that 5% to 7% on top of those numbers. cumulative is going to be a lot better off than frankly, when we gave the guidance. So in fact, in some ways, it actually is much higher, but we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves on that number. Sure, Anthony. I think it's probably more the market coming back. And combined with Surgical was weaker in this quarter a year ago because of the Onton surge. And I think the I go back to a year ago where people were kind of picking at gee, surgical might not be as strong or whatever else, and it was back to. That was a market dynamic, and I think now there's probably some catch-up going on procedure-wise as you're hearing really across the med tech space. And having said that, I think we feel really good about how we're performing among that, both with our existing businesses and frankly, having the broader portfolio that you referenced. Yes. I think we are as excited, if not more excited about the growth potential, probably more excited even, I would say, Liza today than when we acquired the business. The team that we have there is great. As you mentioned, we've now brought the lab over from nearby we've consolidated into our San Diego facility. And I think we're realizing that the penetration of this opportunity relative to the full market is still in the very low single digits. So there's potentially a lot of runway. We've been putting in more automation, frankly, just to make the ordering systems easier and other stuff. And I think we're really excited. It's clearly growing very accretive to the growth rate of the division, and we think will be for -- that's 1 of those for years to come. Liza, I think this is 1 we've been incredibly excited under the leadership of Essex Mitchell, who's been running that business now for the last few years. he's dramatically strengthened both the U.S. business as well as we've made a couple of those great acquisitions of Acessa and Bolder. And so we are seeing some really nice growth. I still think this quarter, may have been a little bit of procedural catch-up in the overall market. So we never -- as you know, we never want to get too far ahead of ourselves, but we love the team that we have there now. And as Karleen said, and you can see in the press release, the growth rate internationally now for Surgical is really, really doing well. We're north of 30%. And I think in this quarter, close to 40-ish and that's starting to become meaningful. So I think our -- as we sit here today and think about another growth driver for this company, Surgical is definitely in there. Yes. Truthfully, I think we feel good about all three of the businesses as we go into the back half of the year. I mean, obviously, it's -- the biggest thing is it's 1 reason we wouldn't get ahead of ourselves and start to raise guidance and long-term expectations when we're going into that exact uncertainty that you're referencing. But the fundamentals of each of the businesses, I think we feel really good about. Yes. Let's start at the highest level. There is no doubt in our minds that more frequent co-testing is still the absolute best health care for women. There are anecdotal increases that we're starting to see upticks in cervical cancer screening since the intervals have gotten longer. And frankly, there's enough data out there that is co-testing is significantly better than HPV primary alone. So while there are those advocating for that and USPSTF could do that. It doesn't make it the best science. And I think where we feel really, really good. And as you know, in our tagline is the science of sure. We feel it's our responsibility to bring the best care to women around the world, and we're going to continue to drive for co-testing as the right way to go. So -- and frankly, I think most of the -- certainly, most of the U.S. doctors are well aware of that. And even if the USPSTF does something to change those guidelines. We think that will be slow to change because of the remarkable success of the PAP test in largely almost eliminating cervical cancer screening over the last generation or two particularly in the U.S. So it's something we feel very strongly about, and we believe time and the science will be on our side. Having said that, there's going to be pressure. There's deep pocket pharmaceutical companies that want to try to drive to HPV primary. But we feel really good about the science on our side and that our business will be more durable. Yes, Jack, I think the fundamental reality on COVID is none of us have been able to predict more than a quarter out going. I think, if anything, our expectations for next year might be a little bit less I think we're certainly starting to see it start to ramp off a bit. And yet, what we feel really good about is those that are still going to do it, we'll be using us. I think there'll still be usage at the hospital levels for admissions, for staff, those kind of pieces. So I think we're still going to have some ongoing business, but we're still having it this quarter. But I think clearly, you see it coming down to just a few percentage points of the total business at this point. And it's hard to fully predict certainly by the time a guidance next year will be more up to date. But it certainly looks like it's falling off pretty sharply at this point, which keep down for our company and getting on with it and letting people look at the true transformation of the business, we kind of like but a little bit of that profit flowing through isn't bad either. It's been a really nice surprise for us how big that's getting held quickly, Jack. Yes. That business has been a great business. When I arrived here 10 years ago. The -- that was the big part of this division. That was most of it, and Myosure was this little thing. And it's been fun to see MyoSure come up. But I think our team has done a great job of really trying to maintain NovaSure in the midst of all kinds of both market issues from the ACA Act and everything else and just continue to bring innovation, and it's still a great procedure. So I think the overall procedural numbers, that marketplace probably continues to be a low single-digit decliner. But I think we do -- we're doing well within that from a share and an innovation standpoint. Yes. And the other part was just -- we're being conservative. I think we're managing for the long haul here, too. We're very much thinking about 2024 and what things look like there. And I think this is already a really, really good year, and let's get ahead of ourselves. Yes. I think the first part, Andrew, really is -- I think it's the given gem of our company that doesn't always get as much attention, but is that dedicated physician sales force that we have within our Diagnostics business, that's really unique. It's an extra investment from our end, but it is having our reps that call on the physicians and really help educate them, both about the guidelines and including the changing guidelines where we've gone to effectively the need to opt out. So you're getting more screening earlier. And we're -- it allows us to partner with a lot of the major labs and even hospital systems where they value that education that we do. And it helps us both shape but also build markets. When you look at really what Hologic has done, and I think we've been pretty good about it across our businesses, we've helped create a lot of markets through physician education. I mean, if you go back to the original Pap test and thin prep and what we did there, what NovaSure and MyoSure have done, and we're doing it a lot in diagnostics, certainly through the STIs. And to the second part of your question on international, I think, again, by placing so many Panthers internationally, it's allowed us to have more of those discussions and start to get some of that menu in around the world as well and then hopefully able to help educate and shift guidelines in those countries over the years ahead as well. No. I mean, there's been so many various court cases between state, federal, all kinds of, frankly, goofiness going on in the political and court systems right now. we tend to think here, things will prevail and be fine over time. So we're not going to react any 1 thing that could easily get overturned again. Thanks. Sorry, I missed you on the visit out here. Personality come on. Yes. I think the implication for the second half is still much better than the numbers you just mentioned the -- we're still saying double digit here in the third quarter and likely fourth. So I think -- I don't think it was pull forward, Vijay, to be very clear. I do think the GynSurg market probably like some of the ortho markets and some of the other markets, some of the docs may have been doing more, what I would call catch up. So I don't think it's as much pull forward, but they're catching up from the last few years not maybe doing as many procedures as they could have. So I think will that same quarter a year from now, maybe not be quite as active yes, but I don't think it was any kind of pull forward per se. I think it's more catch-up. And I think we just feel great about our surgical business, we have added more growth drivers. I think, again, it's been kind of missed in the COVID spikes. I think it's the business that's been most overlooked because of the way the COVID spikes were happening. And just really proud of what that team is doing and we've added Fluent we got MyoSure and NovaSure doing well, and then we've got Bolder and Acessa. And we've got that business getting stronger internationally."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to Hologic's First Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Justin, and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute. I would now like introduce Ryan Simon, Vice President, Investor Relations to begin the call.\nRyan Simon: Thank you, Justin. Good afternoon and thank you for joining Hologic's first quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call. With me today are Steve McMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer. Our first quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We will also post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them, as well as an updated corporate presentation. And a replay of this call will be available for the next 30 days. Before we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements we make today will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the safe harbor statement included in our earnings release and SEC filings. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Two of these non-GAAP measures are: one, organic revenue, which we define as constant currency revenue excluding the divested Blood Screening business and revenue from acquired businesses owned by Hologic for less than one year. And two, organic revenue, excluding COVID-19, which excludes COVID-19 assay revenue, revenue related to COVID-19 and sales from discontinued product in Diagnostics. Finally, any percentage change we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis and revenue growth rates will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO.\nStephen MacMillan: Thank you, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Our results highlight the strength of our three divisions, the power of our commercial channels and the increasing impact of our transformative growth drivers from R&D and acquisitions. For the quarter, total revenue was $1.07 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.07, both above the high end of our guidance. We also repurchased 1.5 million shares of our stock for $100 million in the quarter. To recap our pre-release, while we did have the benefit of three extra selling days, our top line performance was strong. Diagnostics grew 15.8%, powered by molecular diagnostics, which grew 24.5%. Both figures are organic and exclude COVID. Surgical also delivered an impressive quarter, growing 14.7% organically. And Breast Health finished the quarter down only 5.2%, a signal that our recovery from chip-related supply chain headwinds is indeed underway. While the extra days contributed approximately 250 basis points of growth net, even without the extra days, Diagnostics and Surgical both grew double digits and Breast Health exceeded prior guidance. All in, we are well positioned to achieve our full year guidance of low double-digit organic growth ex-COVID in all three of our franchises, well above our 5% to 7% long-term growth rate. Our balance sheet and cash flow are exceptionally strong and we continue to create value for our stakeholders. Today, we'd like to cover two main topics. First, we'll build on the thesis from our JPMorgan presentation three weeks ago, a theme that encapsulates how we improve women's health globally, drive our commercial success and elevate Hologic's reputation at the same time. Second, we'll highlight the transformation of our business and showcase the growth we are driving in each division, which we hope is now becoming much more evident in recent quarters. We are incredibly excited about today and confident about our future. Jumping right in, purpose driven, results driven. These four words comprise the theme of our JPMorgan presentation this year and these four words underpin the success of our entire business. At Hologic, we have an unparalleled commitment to women's health. When we speak purpose driven, results driven, nothing symbolizes these words better than our virtuous circle, which we feature in our corporate presentation. It is simple and powerful at the same time. Most importantly, it unifies and inspires our thousands of employees around the world and points our talented workforce in one singular direction, to elevate women's health, where we have leadership positions in each segment in which we operate. Our business starts with innovative, clinically differentiated, life changing, lifesaving technologies. Whether through R&D or by M&A, it all starts with innovation. As we bring these new innovative products to market, they grow our sales and profits. And here is the key to our success. What we believe sets us apart and allows us to thrive, we then invest these profits into championing women's health on a global scale. We are expanding policy and access, which then allows our products to reach more women and have an even greater impact on the world. And as our business grows, this cycle continues, simple and powerful. Two weeks ago for the second straight year, we had the opportunity to engage with global leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. This is an incredible platform that was not available to us just three years ago. We've earned our access through our leadership in women's health, our pioneering Hologic Global Women's Health Index and our outstanding response to COVID that continues today. As we've grown our business, we have significantly elevated the Hologic brand around the world. With our engagement at Davos, making powerful connections and building strong relationships, combined with recognition from our global partnership with the Women's Tennis Association. Hologic and what we stand for is more recognized globally than ever before, which in turn helps us attract the best and the brightest to the Hologic team, an important advantage in today's labor market. Quite frankly, the best thing we can do for the world and also for our business is to raise awareness and opportunities for women's health globally. For a sense of scale, there are approximately 170 million women in the U.S., our largest market. This is only a fraction of the nearly 4 billion women in the world. We have a long way to go. And as the importance of women's health is elevated and these markets grow, Hologic will be there at each step along the way. Shifting gears to our second topic, understanding the growth that is driving our business. With our strong performance for the quarter, the number one question we are asked is, how are we growing our top line? To answer this question, we will first reflect on our business transformation, a powerful mix of organic innovation, and strategic tuck-in acquisitions. Second, we will discuss each division and highlight examples of our growth engines and the multitude of market strategies deployed across each division. Reflecting on our transformation, it really started well before COVID. Three years ago, we were ready to show the world how we had diligently and thoughtfully strengthened our business for growth. Then, the pandemic hit. And when it did, we established three goals. One, take care of our employees, which we have done; two, meet the world's needs for highly accurate molecular diagnostic COVID testing, which we continue today; and three, emerge as a fundamentally stronger company, which is happening now. Under the cloud of COVID, while successfully deploying Panthers and producing our COVID assays, we strengthened Hologic for the long-term, to a level higher than even we had imagined prior to the pandemic. We achieved this through the combination of innovative internal R&D efforts, plus a series of tuck-in acquisitions. As a result, we've had continuous new product releases that have fundamentally transformed our business and boosted our growth profile. Now as the COVID cloud begins to clear, it is increasingly more evident that we are geared for success, geared for growth and geared to sustained performance over the long-term. Next, to fully appreciate our growth potential is to understand the transformation and diversification of our portfolio and growth strategies. Across all divisions, we are innovating, acquiring and building new markets, entering underdeveloped markets and penetrating existing segments. All while continuing to defend and even grow share in the markets we lead. Our growth in each division is grounded in strong and durable core products. These resilient core franchises are backed by long established clinical needs and commercial relationships, which provide a rock solid foundation to leverage into our newer growth drivers. We leverage our installed bases and customer relationships to advance our newer products, which we expect to both diversify the portfolio and accelerate growth. Moving on to the divisions. In Diagnostics, we have leading positions in core women's health product lines, such as STIs, and cervical cancer. Our women's health molecular diagnostics and psychology base drives steady growth and supports positive relationships with top laboratories and key opinion leaders, which opens the door for additional new products. Today, Diagnostics has grown from primarily a US women's health business to a global diagnostic franchise with many more growth drivers. For example, we now have over 3,250 Panthers worldwide. A number beyond what we had even imagined, along with 19 assays and the Fusion system that enables even further menu expansion. We also have a vastly expanded footprint with three acquisitions: Biotheranostics, Diagenode and Mobidiag that are contributing today and will even more so in the future. More specifically, driving future growth for Diagnostics means leveraging our expanded Panther installed base. These customers are adopters of our newer assays, including BV/CV/TV, and M.gen. We add menu, promote guidelines and drive adoption through our women's health clinical channel. Likewise, we also leverage our Panther installed base to enter established categories such as virology, and respiratory testing. Focusing on our Diagnostics acquisitions, with Biotheranostics we are already seeing solid contributions as we build a new market that is currently minimally penetrated. And with Mobidiag, the Mobidiag platform allows for significant future contributions as we prepare to enter the large and emerging syndromic panel market that is adjacent to our core molecular diagnostics franchise. In Breast Health, revenue from our 3D Mammography equipment and related service represents the core revenue foundation of the division. While our fiscal 2023 growth is primarily driven by the return of chip supply and gantry availability. The division is primed for future growth via a further portfolio expansion. The Breast Health business now spans the Breast Continuum of Care with more recurring growth drivers than ever before. We have expanded from what was once a capital intensive business by growing service revenue and adding more recurring disposable revenue. In doing so, we are creating new markets as with our Brevera breast biopsy system, while also entering existing markets where we compete with clinically differentiated products. And while we are leaders in the screening space, our R&D teams are poised to keep us ahead of the pack. In surgical, the business has changed dramatically, evolving from essentially a two product division, to one which is now much more robust and diverse. Last quarter, revenue outside of NovaSure and core MyoSure represented approximately 25% of the division's total compared to only approximately 10% in fiscal 2019. While NovaSure and core MyoSure still formed a strong durable base of the division, the business is far more dynamic than pre-pandemic. We now have meaningful growth drivers outside of these two core product lines from acquisitions, new in-house products and also improvements to existing products. Going a level deeper, the growth in surgical is driven by products like Fluent as well as NovaSure V5, both from our internal R&D efforts. With Fluent, we created an elegant solution to hysteroscopic fluid management that stands alone. And with our NovaSure V5 line extension, we have proven that even the best can get better and that we are never satisfied and never done innovating. By acquisition, the assessor procedure and the bolder advanced vessel sealing portfolio also diversify and elevate the division's growth trajectory. These are both laparoscopic tools that we've moved swiftly to acquire during COVID times and have added to our prior hysteroscopic only offering. Acessa is a unique radio frequency fibroid removal solution where we are building a new market and improving payer coverage. In Boulder, we are entering an underdeveloped market by deploying our large surgical sales force to introduce our advanced sealing portfolio to the OB/GYN market. Finally, our international business is so much stronger and poised for exceptional future growth post pandemic. Bolstering the individual product growth drivers in each division, we continue to penetrate our markets internationally. For example, in the quarter our Diagnostics business ex-COVID and surgical businesses each grew more than 20%. As we've stated before, we expect international growth rates to be accretive to our overall growth rate for years to come. In summary, our commitment to our purpose has paved the way for our success during the pandemic and is a beacon for our future. We are now a transformed, much stronger Hologic with more diverse growth drivers across each business and a much larger, more capable international presence. And through our innovative R&D and effective tuck in acquisition strategy, we are well positioned to continue to drive strong sustainable growth for years to come. With that, let me turn the call over to Karleen.\nKarleen Oberton: Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon everyone. We are pleased to share first quarter results that exceeded our guidance on both the top line and bottom line. Our strong performance was once again driven by our diagnostics and surgical businesses with each growing mid-teens organically in the period, excluding COVID-19 revenue. And in Breast Health, we are encouraged by results that show the chip supplies moving in the right direction and that our mammography business is recovering. Before moving into our divisional results, it is important to highlight our balance sheet. Our leverage ratio of 0.2 times shows the capital structure that is strong as it has ever been, providing our business a tremendous amount of flexibility for internal investment and capital deployment opportunities. Moving on, I will now provide more color on our financial results. In the first quarter, revenue and profitability once again meaningfully surpassed our estimates, with the balance sheet split between our base business and COVID. Total revenue came in at $1.074 billion, a result more than $100 million higher than the midpoint of our guidance. And non GAAP EPS was $1.07, more than $0.20 higher than the midpoint of our prior guide. Turning to our business results. In Diagnostics, total revenue of $559.3 million declined 41.2% compared to the prior year. It is important to remember that COVID testing revenue was elevated in our fiscal first quarter of 2022 given the surge in infections from the Omicron variant. Thus, a more accurate representation of the diagnostics business is to exclude COVID assay revenue, related ancillaries and a small amount of revenue from discontinued products. When making this normalization, we see that organic diagnostics revenue increased 15.8% in the quarter. Within Diagnostics, we continue to see momentum in molecular. For the third quarter in a row, we delivered healthy double digit growth. Specifically, molecular diagnostics grew nearly 25% in our first quarter excluding the impact of COVID. This outstanding result demonstrates strong utilization across our significantly larger Panther installed base. Performance was driven by a mix of our legacy portfolio and newer assays. For example, the collective revenue of our core STI menu was well above pre pandemic levels in the quarter. In addition, BV/CV/TV had another strong quarter, more than doubling compared to the prior year as our progress continues growing the IVD vaginitis market. Further, our non COVID respiratory portfolio delivered revenue ahead of expectations in the period. As we saw uptake and testing for flu and RSV given heightened prevalence in public awareness of these pathogens. Finally, the Biotheranostics contribution to our base molecular performance continues to increase with accretive revenue growth in the quarter. Moving to our COVID results, we generated $127 million of COVID assay revenue in the quarter, exceeding our previous guidance of $75 million. In terms of the COVID assay revenue split by geography, domestic sales led most of our upside and represented nearly 80% of COVID assay revenue in the period. The demand for our COVID assay remains primarily COVID only. However, we did see above trend demand for our COVID flu multiplex test. Rounding out Diagnostics, our Cytology and Perinatal businesses increased 1.6% compared to the prior year. In Brest Health, total revenue of $334.2 million was down 5.2%, better than expected. These results were driven by strong demand for our Mammography equipment and improving semiconductor chip supply. We remain cautiously optimistic that Q1 revenue performance in our breast imaging segment being down only 4.5% highlights that the worst of the chip supply headwinds are likely behind us. We would remind everyone, we are still on allocation and that the macro backdrop could change quickly. As it relates to our interventional business, revenue was down 8% in the period, driven by lingering supply chain issues outside of chip availability. We expect these headwinds to subside for the balance of the year and the segment to resume a cadence of strong growth starting in fiscal Q2. In surgical, first quarter revenue of $154.1 million grew more than 17%. And excluding the Boulder acquisition, the business grew nearly 15%. These results underscore a more diverse surgical business with more growth drivers than in the past. In addition to strong performance from MyoSure and better than expected results from NovaSure, the quarter showcased increasing contributions from Fluent and our laparoscopic portfolio of Asessa and Boulder. Lastly, in our Skeletal business, revenue of $26.6 million increased slightly, less than 1% compared to the prior year period. Now let's move on to the rest of the non GAAP P&L for the first quarter. Gross margin of 62.7% was driven by higher than expected COVID-19 testing revenues and strong performance in our base business in the period. Total operating expenses of $339.4 million in the first quarter increased 1.6%, but were up less than 1% when excluding expenses from Boulder, which closed at the end of November 2021. The increase was led by higher marketing spend given the timing of certain initiatives. We expect marketing expense to move lower starting in our fiscal second quarter of 2023. Below operating income other expense was less than anticipated primarily due to higher interest income from investing our elevated cash balances at higher interest rates. Finally, our tax rate in Q1 was 19% as expected. Putting these pieces together, operating margin for Q1 came in at 31.1% and net margin was 24.9%, both ahead of our previous estimates. Non GAAP net income finished at $267.9 million and non GAAP EPS was $1.07. Moving on from the P&L. Cash flow from operations was $253.4 million in the first quarter. We had $2.4 billion of cash on our balance sheet and our leverage ratio remained at 0.2 times. Although it may appear to the outside our eye that we are letting our cash balance build, rest assured, our M&A teams in each division are incredibly active. Our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged. Our first priority remains pursuing growth accretive tuck in deals that align with our divisions and leverage our core strengths and strong commercial channels. More recently, given the stability of our balance sheet and the strength of our business, we have widened our aperture to consider slightly larger EBITDA of generating deals. That said, it is important to make clear that we expect any transaction we pursue will be complementary to our core strengths and not represent a completely new or unrelated vertical. Our second priority will continue to be share repurchases. And as Steve highlighted, in the first quarter we repurchased 1.5 million shares for $100 million. Now let's move on to our updated non GAAP financial guidance for the second quarter and full year fiscal 2023. As a reminder, our organic guidance excludes acquisition revenue until each deal annualizes. Therefore, all deals are part of our organic base starting in Q2, 2023. In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we again expect strong financial results with total revenue in the range of $930 million to $980 million. For all of fiscal 2023, we are increasing our full year guidance and expect total revenue in the range of $3.85 billion to $4 billion, reflecting low double digit organic growth ex-COVID across each of our divisions. To help with constant currency modeling, we are assuming foreign currency exchange headwinds of slightly less than $20 million in the second quarter of 2023 and approximately $50 million for the full year. These headwinds have improved compared to our previous guidance as the U.S. dollar has depreciated over the past several months. Turning to our divisions, we are thrilled with the outlook for each business as we continue to anticipate that core diagnostics excluding COVID, Breast Health and Surgical will organically grow low double digits for our fiscal 2023. In diagnostics, molecular should continue to lead the way. We expect our assays to drive growth as non COVID utilization improves and customers add additional menu to their Panther system. As a reminder, our molecular diagnostic growth is not predicated on placing more Panther instruments, but rather helping our existing customers grow their business. As we have said consistently, even though Panther placements are likely to slow in the near term, given the huge pull forward during the pandemic, additional placements do not influence the trajectory of our molecular outlook. Closing out on diagnostics, we expect blood revenue of slightly less than $25 million for the year. Moving to Breast Health, we see an improving environment for chip supply and our position is unchanged from last quarter. Our expectation is that for a gradual improvement in our breast imaging business throughout 2023. We maintain our view that the business should exit fiscal 2023 at or near normal level. However, we'd like to make clear that you should not expect an outsized revenue catch up in any particular quarter. Instead, our plan is to incrementally work down our backlog over time as we look to efficiently manage the resources of our outstanding field service team. Finally in surgical, as evidenced by our first quarter's results, the business has quietly transformed into a dynamic franchise, moving beyond what was once a two product division. Low double digit organic growth for fiscal 2023 will be driven by a combination of MyoSure, the related FluentFluid Management System and our laparoscopic portfolio of Acessa and Boulder. In terms of COVID sales, we expect COVID assay sales to be approximately $50 million in the second quarter of 2023 and $225 million for the full year. COVID related items inclusive of a small amount of discontinued product revenue are expected to be approximately $35 million in the second quarter and $130 million for the full year. Moving down the P&L. For the full year, we continue to expect our non GAAP gross margin percentage to be in the low 60s and our non GAAP operating margin percentage to be approximately 30%. Within this operating margin profile, we have again incorporated elevated inflationary pressures into our guidance of approximately 200 basis points to 250 basis points, which we anticipate will persist throughout our fiscal 2023. In terms of operating expenses, we expect spending to step down starting in our second quarter, given the timing of marketing expenses primarily associated with our WTA partnership. Further, we foresee operating expense dollars as fairly flat sequentially from Q2 through Q4. Below operating income, we expect other income net to be an expense of around $50 million for the rest of the year. Our guidance is based on an annual effective tax rate of approximately 19% and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately $25 million for the full year. All this nets out to expected non GAAP EPS of $0.80 to $0.90 in the second quarter and $3.55 to $3.85 for the year. To conclude, let me wrap up by repeating that our strong first quarter results exceeded our guidance despite a persistent macro uncertain. Performance was driven by tremendous growth in our molecular diagnostics and surgical businesses. Combined with a better than expected progress in Breast Health. As we look forward to the remainder of our fiscal 2023, we are excited to showcase our transformed business. With our updated guidance reinforcing our expectations of low double digit growth in each division for the remainder of the year. Hologic is a much stronger company than prior to the pandemic and we believe our 2023 performance will further prove this out. With that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Patrick Donnelly with Citi.\nPatrick Donnelly: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the questions. Karleen, maybe just picking up on the margin side there, obviously, pretty good performance in the quarter. Still talking about, obviously, some of the headwinds throughout the year. Can you just talk about the cadence? I know previously you were talking kind of 30% -ish every quarter. Can you just walk us through, I guess, obviously, the tailwinds we saw in 1Q and what the rest of the year looks like in terms of headwinds versus tailwinds and how that cadence works?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes, sure. So I think the outlook would say that each quarter is roughly 30% operating margin and what you see happening is, you have the marketing expenses coming down from Q1. You have lower COVID revenue, which is a headwind, but then you have higher Breast Health revenue, which is a tailwind. So they kind of offset those headwinds or the tailwinds offset over the course of the year. And we maintain at that 30%, again, a little lower than pre-pandemic, because we have the higher inflationary costs still anticipated.\nPatrick Donnelly: Okay. It's understood. And then Steve, maybe just on molecular diagnostics, really strong core performance there. Can you just flush out a little bit more on the drivers you saw? I guess, sustainability, again, obviously, some pretty big numbers you guys have put up there. Just trying to get a sense for the drivers and what we could expect going forward on that front?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. You probably got it in multiple buckets, Patrick. Part is just a return of the Panther is being used for the core STI, most of our women's health business. You've got increasing growth in our new product launches, especially BV/CV, which is off to a tremendous start and we said we think will be a major driver of growth. And you really have -- what we kept saying over the last couple of years and it wasn't as obvious is so many of our customers around the world that we're running COVID are now putting the menu onto the Panthers. And it's really that simple and a huge part of it. And there's just a little bit of Africa and some viral stuff. But...\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. The only thing I would add to that, Patrick, because we had some nice contribution from our respiratory assays, which will be seasonal as we move forward.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research.\nJack Meehan: Thank you. Hi. You're going to get the formalities out of the way, go birds. It feels like [indiscernible], but I say that every year.\nStephen MacMillan: Fly Eagle fly, fly Hologic fly. Okay, go ahead, Jack.\nJack Meehan: Excellent. So I had a couple of 10-Q derived questions that I personally thought were kind of interesting and I want to get your thoughts on. The first is, so you report international molecular sales of $97 million. Karleen, based on your COVID assay disclosures, I think it's like $25 million of international COVID. So it implies about $72 million of base molecular international. Prior to the pandemic, it was like $30 million a quarter. So I was just wondering like could this be an interesting gauge of what the international installed base could look like in terms of the stickiness of Panther? Just any thoughts on that would be helpful.\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. So we have, as you said, that number includes the COVID assay revenues. So I think you've attempted to take some of that up. We also have the ancillaries, which are part of that, that are elevated because of COVID. But I think certainly, we're seeing the uptake, again, with newer customers in more than COVID. As well as our initiatives like in Africa, what Steve talked about the viral picking up some nice traction there as well. I think we -- as we think about international molecular, we would think that that is going to grow a little faster than U.S. given the commercial investments that we've made there and the Panther placements.\nStephen MacMillan: Yes, Jack, just to interpolate on that point that you've noticed. We placed a lot of Panthers with so many, especially in the European countries as we responded with COVID and every one of those was coming with trailing shift over to the STI business. So I think that's a big piece of it.\nJack Meehan: Interesting. Okay. Then my second question is on breast imaging. So the U.S. sales in the quarter were $212 million. I think that's actually like the largest first quarter you've had, at least several years. International still seeing some pressure, but I'm just trying to juxtapose this versus your comment about you're still seeing ongoing semiconductor pressure. What was going on in the U.S. in the quarter? Was there any flush of some sort as chips came in and just what does 2Q assume?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes, there was absolutely no flush we can tell you. We did get a little bit more supply that we we\u2019re able to install. And candidly, Jack, we had the extra week. We got a little bit of service revenue in there, because of that extra week in the quarter. So that kind of pushed us into the growth without that extra week that would have been slightly down a bit. But we like where we're coming and we were able to kind of refurb a few more chips, got a few more chips in and we're able to get a little more product out, but we're feeling really good about where we're headed this quarter and for the rest of the year in Breast Health.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Max Masucci with Cowen & Company.\nMax Masucci: Great. Thanks for taking the question. First one on operating margins. So it looks like the COVID testing and related items were about 15% of the organic revenues. So just based on your expectations for global COVID testing revenues this year and as we near the end of the U.S. government's DAG program, does COVID testing and reimbursement remain the big needle mover for 2023 operating margins? Or is the operating margin expansion opportunity now more dependent on the Breast Health rebounds and/or continued strength in non COVID molecular DX?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes, I would say that the margin accretion from COVID is less and less dependent on COVID as we move throughout the year and it's going to be more driven by the Breast Health recovery and certainly Q1 to Q2 lower operating expenses, which will persist throughout the year.\nMax Masucci: Okay. Got it. And then just in terms of M&A, I think if you look at your free cash flow deployment, about 28% over the past five years. I think it's been for share buybacks in any sense? I would just be curious to hear about the potential size of any M&A deal you'd be willing to pursue. Any recent conversations amongst the biz dev team in terms of what types of companies fit best with the Hologic of today? And just a general update on capital deployment would be great? Thanks.\nStephen MacMillan: Sure, Max. To reiterate what Karleen said, our primary goal is still tuck in acquisitions followed by share buybacks. We certainly have been opportunistic on the buybacks because we generated a whole bunch of more cash during that time and thought that made a lot sense. Going forward, we're looking across the businesses, all being led by the divisions. We're not going to get into particular scale or targets for obvious reasons. But I think what we would say is, we might go a little bit bigger on scale if it brought more EBITDA. So it will be a proportionate thought process there. But I think we're -- the biggest takeaway frankly is, we're in a position of strength where our base businesses are very strong. We don't have to go do anything. And candidly, when I think there's a lot of folks around trying to figure out what they want to be when they grow up right now. We know exactly where we're going and what we want to be and that is championing women's health and having every business going well. So it gives us the luxury of being patient and smart on the business development front.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Puneet Souda with SVB Securities.\nPuneet Souda: Yes. Hi, Steve. Thanks for taking the question. So maybe for you, given the low double digit growth rate that you're highlighting here, obviously, the business, all three segments are doing great. So what's holding you back on the long term guide of 5% to 7%? Why couldn't that be higher now in your long term outlook?\nStephen MacMillan: Because we're running the business for the long term. And fundamentally, let's look at it. We're still bouncing off of some comps from last year where things were a little depressed from COVID everything else. We are a company that delivers and plans for the long haul and everything we've done to move up to the 5% to 7% has been very smart and we're going to continue to be prudent.\nPuneet Souda: Okay, great. And then just on capital deployment, maybe Karleen. What's your ability to lever up? What ratio are you comfortable with, just given the sort of the interest rates that are there right now and potential for those to continue to ramp up a bit higher?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. I mean, I think we have indicated that we'd be comfortable in a 2 times to 3 times leverage ratio that's something we talked to and supported by our credit agency. But to your point, we would continue to evaluate based on interest rate environment. But certainly, at this point we have plenty of cash and we have a credit line that we can fully deploy. So we feel like we've got good flexibility to do what we want in that event.\nOperator: And moving on to Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.\nVijay Kumar: Hey, guys. Congratulations on a solid Q here, and thanks for taking my question. Steve, I wanted to ask one on this guidance update here. It looks like you beat the quarter versus your midpoint of your prior guidance by about $120 million, the annual guide was raised by about $125 million. It looks like most of that's coming from FX and change in code assumptions. When I look at Q1 print here, your underlying organic came in better. So why wouldn't some of that underlying strength we saw in Q1 flow through -- flows through the rest of the year? Is there any kinding impact of revenue recognition or is this just a conservatism?\nStephen MacMillan: It's -- we continue to deliver, I can promise you, it has nothing to do with timing of revenue recognition, Vijay. The underlying business is very strong, we\u2019re one quarter in. Think about where we were a year ago at this time. Suddenly Russia invaded Ukraine, nobody saw that coming. I've lived through the downturn of 2008-2009. We've watched the world go up and down and over the first quarter of the year. So we're going to continue to be very prudent, do not underestimate our confidence in our ability to run the business.\nVijay Kumar: Understood. And then maybe another way to ask this question Steve is Diagnostic. Clearly it was a highlight, 16% and organic. So what is driving this? Is this like reagents? What kind of testing is driving this? Or was this easy code comp? When I look at Q1, overall underlying organic was 6%, they hit double digits for the year, the base has to do clean stroke at the back half. How should we think about this diagnostic which was 15% in Q1 ramping up in back half or is the back half being carried by normalization of breast imaging revenues?\nStephen MacMillan: Look, clearly the comps on molecular and diagnostics will get harder in the back half. But fundamentally, what's driving it, we sort of answered this I think earlier. We placed a whole bunch of Panthers, almost 1,500 Panthers in COVID time over the last three years. We've got more customers adopting our core menu. We have our new products being launched doing very well. And those are really the main drivers, as well as a little bit of flu and a little bit of viral stuff as we've been penetrating a little more Africa.\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. I mean, I think it is the Panther placements and new customers as well. I think we've talked about in our corporate presentation that of newly acquired customers, 85% are running at least one other assay and over 55% are running at least two other assays. So I think that is the value of the Panther in the menu that we have driving that growth.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Tim Daley with Wells Fargo.\nTim Daley: Great. So Steve, I love the comments on some parties out there trying to figure out who they want to be when they grow up. And just running with that, we've seen a lot of players in molecular diagnostics seem to be adding menu in women's health arena. So given your legacy foothold there, how can you think about the current competitive environment? Are you worried about any price pressures, maybe from new entrants trying to gain share via that lever? Yes, just kind of the sensible stance here and kind of what you would answer as to any questions around that?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes, we worry all the time. But at the end of the day, we've also built an incredible sales force that has partnered both with the labs, but also with the clinicians. And our assays have proven themselves over time as well as do not underestimate the workflow advantages of our Panther system. And so, there's a lot of people that can talk a good game and especially let's face it. There were so many startups that all were working on stuff and then they got money in COVID time and they start talking about all their women's health assays. And it's an interesting little landscape right now. So we never take anybody for granted. We face some very formidable competitors, but we always have and we will continue to and we frankly think we continue to innovate things like BB/CV. We continue to bring new assays and new tests and new education to our customers. And that continues to provide strength for us.\nTim Daley: All right. And I appreciate that. And then one for Karleen. So Surgical, great to hear about the performance outside of the legacy products and appreciate the detail on the growth drivers this year. But could you kind of give us a bit more quantified detail about growth ranges here across the various buckets, so kind of the legacy products versus the new in house developed versus kind of the recent acquisitions, any additional kind of above below ranges or anything like that you could provide? And thank you.\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. What I would say is dollar contribution is probably evenly split between the legacy platform and affluent our new innovative and then the acquisitions. But certainly, the percentage growth rate is much higher than the acquisitions building off a smaller base. But at the end of the day, I think the key takeaway is, there's not just one growth driver, there's multiple growth drivers that are driving the success of that business.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley.\nTejas Savant: Hey, guys. Good evening and thanks for the time here. Maybe I'll start with a couple on some of the recent deals for you, Steve. On Mobidiag, can you just remind us again where things stand in terms of -- I think you had said there's an entry buildup underway ahead of the launch. How big do you think the revenue opportunity could be in fiscal 2023? And then similarly, you highlighted Biotheranostics a couple of times today and obviously, they've got into guidelines. They have the recent data from December as well. How big do you see this opportunity becoming for you, perhaps not this year, but a couple of years out?\nStephen MacMillan: Sure. I think on Mobi, Mobi will still be pretty small this year. Mobi will hit its stride ultimately when bring it to the U.S. which is still several years away. But we love the platform we have there. On Biotheranostics, it's still very small penetration. So the reality is, clearly, it's going to be probably potentially a few hundred million, we're not sure at this point, never great at. When you're creating new markets, it's always really hard because when you go back eight years ago, people ask me, could MyoSure someday be the size of NovaSure. And at that point in time, it was hard to picture that. And today, MyoSure is way bigger than NovaSure. So I think this magic that we have where we really are creating and building markets, it's sometimes hard to fully put a number on it other than to see, we think there's a lot of runway here, a lot.\nTejas Savant: Got it. That's helpful. And then a couple of follow-ups here. One on, just the hospital CapEx environment and any sort of change in either sort of decision timelines or perhaps cancellation rates here a month into the new calendar year? And China, I know it's small for you guys. I think it's less than 3% of sales. But is there anything going on there in terms of the COVID case surge that we should be factoring in at least in the fiscal second quarter here?\nStephen MacMillan: I think on the -- first on CapEx, we continue to stay really close to our sales teams on it. And seeing very tiny, nothing outside of historical cancellation rates, which is de minimis. On China, I think what you will see is, probably most of the hospitals in China over the last 60-ish days and probably here for a little period four are probably cutting down on normal procedures as they've been treating the COVID patients. But I think for our business, again, pretty small, but I think that's the kind of macro way I'd be thinking about China right now. And my hunch is, after the Chinese New Year and everything else, they're going to largely come back online and that will start to pick back up probably later this actual calendar quarter. I think they're going to get through it fine.\nOperator: And moving on to Derik de Bruin with Bank of America.\nDerik de Bruin: Hi, good afternoon.\nStephen MacMillan: Hey, Derek.\nDerik de Bruin: Hey. A question, you're talking about 30-ish percent adjusted operating margin for this year. I'm looking at the consensus for 2024, it's about 30.5%. You're talking about 200 basis point to 250 basis points of inflationary pressures that are sort of in there. So like can you walk us through how you're thinking about operating margins as you sort of invest in the business and some of these inflationary pressures normalize, just sort of trying to get a sense of where we go from here?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes, Derek, it's Karleen. So I'll take this one. So if you think about prior to the pandemic, what I would say is, our normal operating margin was roughly 30%, 31.5%, very rich margins for our industry. I see us probably over time getting back to that level. But what I would say is, think about our 5% to 7% top line long term growth rate. We will grow EPS faster than that, so likely low double digits and that EPS growth comes from more than just operating margin expansion. It comes from higher revenue growth, as well as some things that we can do below the line. So that's how we think about our long term outlook for earnings growing faster than revenue and again anchored on that 5% to 7%.\nStephen MacMillan: And Derek, I\u2019ll put a little point on it too. I've been around this business long enough to watch either divisions or big companies or companies themselves trying to push that operating margin so far that they cut into R&D and you don't see it immediately, but over time your innovation falls. And so, we know a lot of folks want to just keep saying all -- every number go up like that. We're thinking very much as Karleen said about driving the EPS number, but continuing to invest in R&D and not try to drive the operating margin as high as humanly possible.\nDerik de Bruin: Well, thanks for setting me up Steve. That's exactly where I was going next. So I appreciate that. When you think -- you've got Biotheranostics, which is your entry in sort of like the oncology world. I mean there were some dabbling in the past with some things with like -- I think with PCA3 or some of this like stuff. How do you sort of think about oncology market? I mean there's obviously a lot of real estate out there, but I think pointed out that you don't want to do anything that's super dilutive in those areas. Can you just sort of -- but clearly there's a lot that's going on that market and opportunities for Hologic. Can you sort of like flesh out where you sort of think your genomics focus is, where this is going, how it is? Thanks.\nKarleen Oberton: Sure, Derik. You're probably the only person who remembers PCA3. So I think we're comfortable continuing to be fairly patient. If I look at this overall, right? So I go back seven or eight years, liquid biopsy, it's going to be the greatest thing ever and everybody thought by 2018, 2020 this massive thing, we kept saying, look, we just don't know that there's going to be a lot of money made. So we continue and particularly in our acquisitions, everything we look at is thinking about what is the long term value creation from an earnings standpoint, not just a revenue and let's face it. As you well know in this industry as well there's a whole bunch of companies that generate a lot of top line, but no bottom line and they get great valuations when they're standalones. You try to drop those into a healthy company and where suddenly the EPS starts to get looked at, you never get that same expansion on the multiple. So I also think for all of the promise, the promise never comes as quickly as everybody thinks it's going to do. I'm still waiting for gain sharing in orthopedics to take over the full world 20 years later. And I just think as we continue to watch the space, we believe there will be winners that will emerge, but we're still letting some of those play out candidly and try to see it's not just a revenue gain or a number of boxes sold or a number of kits sold or whatever else. It really is, okay, what's our long term trajectory is how we're trying to think about these things? Thank you for asking that.\nOperator: And we will take a question from Andrew Brackmann with William Blair.\nDustin Scaringe: Hey, this is Dustin on the line for Andrew. Going back to a comment you made earlier on Mobidiag and the entry in the roaming testing market. Can you be more specific on the timelines and how you plan to leverage your tampered relationships to drive that forward?\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. We're clearly entering in Europe right now on a smaller scale. The U.S. clearance will be ultimately the bigger part. And as we said, that's probably at least a 2025-ish event at this point. So we're still a few years away as we prepare for it. And we'll certainly be able to leverage a lot of the strength that we have in the labs, especially the medium sized labs as we go into that point at that point.\nDustin Scaringe: Okay. And I recognize that you talked a lot about M&A already, but I\u2019m wondering if you can be more specific and speak to how you're thinking about valuations both in the public and private space?\nStephen MacMillan: We're always looking -- at the end of the day, we're thinking about the long term top and bottom line growth. We're very focused on ROIC, a key part of our senior leadership team comp is tied on ROIC, so we look at it on every deal. And we've watched a whole bunch of things that even if come down 80% or 90% and some of them we still don't necessarily like. So again, I think we've got the luxury of time on our side given the strength of underlying business and the strength of our balance sheet, which gives us the chance to be relatively picky around what might be out there.\nOperator: And we have a question from Navann Ty with BNP Paribas Exane.\nNavann Ty: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. On women's health, so I believe vaginitis drove Q1 growth ex-COVID. Should it continue to drive growth for the rest of the year? And longer term, could you discuss your women's health focus being potentially a competitive advantage versus your non focused peers? Thank you.\nStephen MacMillan: Yes. I think we continue to see growth certainly in our women's health assays that's been -- and it kind of got me to your second point of view. If you think about something like BB/CV/TV that we've launched, we discovered and realized about that because we're so tapped into to the key opinion leaders and starting to realize that there are other tests that may be able to be developed that we can bring to the market to bring greater levels of certainty and specificity. And I think when we have that knowledge because we surround those customers, our focused approach certainly benefits as well and I think helps us on the innovation side, the same in 3D mammography and how that's led to better biopsy stuff. And then the same in our surgical business where understanding fibroids better than anybody else and being able to innovate endometrial ablation. So we kind of surround these, call them, large niches, but it's really the insights that we have more with the KOLs that I think does provide us a level of competitive advantage. Thank you.\nNavann Ty: Thanks. And staying at women's health, you mentioned future portfolio expansion in Breast Health. So are you able to tell us more about any Breast Health innovation?\nStephen MacMillan: Any Breast Health innovation. I think the way to think about that is, we just continue to innovate. We've always been -- we've brought enhanced detectors, enhanced workflow solutions and enhanced imaging along the way and we'll continue that.\nKarleen Oberton: Yes, I think we focus -- one of the important focus on innovation is patient experience, focus on that as well as machine learning, what we can do to make radiologists more efficient and certainly that's a big issue outside the U.S. where there's much fewer radiologists.\nOperator: Thank you. And this now concludes Hologic\u2019s earnings conference call. Have a good evening.",

            "name": "Karleen Oberton",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon everyone. We are pleased to share first quarter results that exceeded our guidance on both the top line and bottom line. Our strong performance was once again driven by our diagnostics and surgical businesses with each growing mid-teens organically in the period, excluding COVID-19 revenue. And in Breast Health, we are encouraged by results that show the chip supplies moving in the right direction and that our mammography business is recovering. Before moving into our divisional results, it is important to highlight our balance sheet. Our leverage ratio of 0.2 times shows the capital structure that is strong as it has ever been, providing our business a tremendous amount of flexibility for internal investment and capital deployment opportunities. Moving on, I will now provide more color on our financial results. In the first quarter, revenue and profitability once again meaningfully surpassed our estimates, with the balance sheet split between our base business and COVID. Total revenue came in at $1.074 billion, a result more than $100 million higher than the midpoint of our guidance. And non GAAP EPS was $1.07, more than $0.20 higher than the midpoint of our prior guide. Turning to our business results. In Diagnostics, total revenue of $559.3 million declined 41.2% compared to the prior year. It is important to remember that COVID testing revenue was elevated in our fiscal first quarter of 2022 given the surge in infections from the Omicron variant. Thus, a more accurate representation of the diagnostics business is to exclude COVID assay revenue, related ancillaries and a small amount of revenue from discontinued products. When making this normalization, we see that organic diagnostics revenue increased 15.8% in the quarter. Within Diagnostics, we continue to see momentum in molecular. For the third quarter in a row, we delivered healthy double digit growth. Specifically, molecular diagnostics grew nearly 25% in our first quarter excluding the impact of COVID. This outstanding result demonstrates strong utilization across our significantly larger Panther installed base. Performance was driven by a mix of our legacy portfolio and newer assays. For example, the collective revenue of our core STI menu was well above pre pandemic levels in the quarter. In addition, BV/CV/TV had another strong quarter, more than doubling compared to the prior year as our progress continues growing the IVD vaginitis market. Further, our non COVID respiratory portfolio delivered revenue ahead of expectations in the period. As we saw uptake and testing for flu and RSV given heightened prevalence in public awareness of these pathogens. Finally, the Biotheranostics contribution to our base molecular performance continues to increase with accretive revenue growth in the quarter. Moving to our COVID results, we generated $127 million of COVID assay revenue in the quarter, exceeding our previous guidance of $75 million. In terms of the COVID assay revenue split by geography, domestic sales led most of our upside and represented nearly 80% of COVID assay revenue in the period. The demand for our COVID assay remains primarily COVID only. However, we did see above trend demand for our COVID flu multiplex test. Rounding out Diagnostics, our Cytology and Perinatal businesses increased 1.6% compared to the prior year. In Brest Health, total revenue of $334.2 million was down 5.2%, better than expected. These results were driven by strong demand for our Mammography equipment and improving semiconductor chip supply. We remain cautiously optimistic that Q1 revenue performance in our breast imaging segment being down only 4.5% highlights that the worst of the chip supply headwinds are likely behind us. We would remind everyone, we are still on allocation and that the macro backdrop could change quickly. As it relates to our interventional business, revenue was down 8% in the period, driven by lingering supply chain issues outside of chip availability. We expect these headwinds to subside for the balance of the year and the segment to resume a cadence of strong growth starting in fiscal Q2. In surgical, first quarter revenue of $154.1 million grew more than 17%. And excluding the Boulder acquisition, the business grew nearly 15%. These results underscore a more diverse surgical business with more growth drivers than in the past. In addition to strong performance from MyoSure and better than expected results from NovaSure, the quarter showcased increasing contributions from Fluent and our laparoscopic portfolio of Asessa and Boulder. Lastly, in our Skeletal business, revenue of $26.6 million increased slightly, less than 1% compared to the prior year period. Now let's move on to the rest of the non GAAP P&L for the first quarter. Gross margin of 62.7% was driven by higher than expected COVID-19 testing revenues and strong performance in our base business in the period. Total operating expenses of $339.4 million in the first quarter increased 1.6%, but were up less than 1% when excluding expenses from Boulder, which closed at the end of November 2021. The increase was led by higher marketing spend given the timing of certain initiatives. We expect marketing expense to move lower starting in our fiscal second quarter of 2023. Below operating income other expense was less than anticipated primarily due to higher interest income from investing our elevated cash balances at higher interest rates. Finally, our tax rate in Q1 was 19% as expected. Putting these pieces together, operating margin for Q1 came in at 31.1% and net margin was 24.9%, both ahead of our previous estimates. Non GAAP net income finished at $267.9 million and non GAAP EPS was $1.07. Moving on from the P&L. Cash flow from operations was $253.4 million in the first quarter. We had $2.4 billion of cash on our balance sheet and our leverage ratio remained at 0.2 times. Although it may appear to the outside our eye that we are letting our cash balance build, rest assured, our M&A teams in each division are incredibly active. Our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged. Our first priority remains pursuing growth accretive tuck in deals that align with our divisions and leverage our core strengths and strong commercial channels. More recently, given the stability of our balance sheet and the strength of our business, we have widened our aperture to consider slightly larger EBITDA of generating deals. That said, it is important to make clear that we expect any transaction we pursue will be complementary to our core strengths and not represent a completely new or unrelated vertical. Our second priority will continue to be share repurchases. And as Steve highlighted, in the first quarter we repurchased 1.5 million shares for $100 million. Now let's move on to our updated non GAAP financial guidance for the second quarter and full year fiscal 2023. As a reminder, our organic guidance excludes acquisition revenue until each deal annualizes. Therefore, all deals are part of our organic base starting in Q2, 2023. In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we again expect strong financial results with total revenue in the range of $930 million to $980 million. For all of fiscal 2023, we are increasing our full year guidance and expect total revenue in the range of $3.85 billion to $4 billion, reflecting low double digit organic growth ex-COVID across each of our divisions. To help with constant currency modeling, we are assuming foreign currency exchange headwinds of slightly less than $20 million in the second quarter of 2023 and approximately $50 million for the full year. These headwinds have improved compared to our previous guidance as the U.S. dollar has depreciated over the past several months. Turning to our divisions, we are thrilled with the outlook for each business as we continue to anticipate that core diagnostics excluding COVID, Breast Health and Surgical will organically grow low double digits for our fiscal 2023. In diagnostics, molecular should continue to lead the way. We expect our assays to drive growth as non COVID utilization improves and customers add additional menu to their Panther system. As a reminder, our molecular diagnostic growth is not predicated on placing more Panther instruments, but rather helping our existing customers grow their business. As we have said consistently, even though Panther placements are likely to slow in the near term, given the huge pull forward during the pandemic, additional placements do not influence the trajectory of our molecular outlook. Closing out on diagnostics, we expect blood revenue of slightly less than $25 million for the year. Moving to Breast Health, we see an improving environment for chip supply and our position is unchanged from last quarter. Our expectation is that for a gradual improvement in our breast imaging business throughout 2023. We maintain our view that the business should exit fiscal 2023 at or near normal level. However, we'd like to make clear that you should not expect an outsized revenue catch up in any particular quarter. Instead, our plan is to incrementally work down our backlog over time as we look to efficiently manage the resources of our outstanding field service team. Finally in surgical, as evidenced by our first quarter's results, the business has quietly transformed into a dynamic franchise, moving beyond what was once a two product division. Low double digit organic growth for fiscal 2023 will be driven by a combination of MyoSure, the related FluentFluid Management System and our laparoscopic portfolio of Acessa and Boulder. In terms of COVID sales, we expect COVID assay sales to be approximately $50 million in the second quarter of 2023 and $225 million for the full year. COVID related items inclusive of a small amount of discontinued product revenue are expected to be approximately $35 million in the second quarter and $130 million for the full year. Moving down the P&L. For the full year, we continue to expect our non GAAP gross margin percentage to be in the low 60s and our non GAAP operating margin percentage to be approximately 30%. Within this operating margin profile, we have again incorporated elevated inflationary pressures into our guidance of approximately 200 basis points to 250 basis points, which we anticipate will persist throughout our fiscal 2023. In terms of operating expenses, we expect spending to step down starting in our second quarter, given the timing of marketing expenses primarily associated with our WTA partnership. Further, we foresee operating expense dollars as fairly flat sequentially from Q2 through Q4. Below operating income, we expect other income net to be an expense of around $50 million for the rest of the year. Our guidance is based on an annual effective tax rate of approximately 19% and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately $25 million for the full year. All this nets out to expected non GAAP EPS of $0.80 to $0.90 in the second quarter and $3.55 to $3.85 for the year. To conclude, let me wrap up by repeating that our strong first quarter results exceeded our guidance despite a persistent macro uncertain. Performance was driven by tremendous growth in our molecular diagnostics and surgical businesses. Combined with a better than expected progress in Breast Health. As we look forward to the remainder of our fiscal 2023, we are excited to showcase our transformed business. With our updated guidance reinforcing our expectations of low double digit growth in each division for the remainder of the year. Hologic is a much stronger company than prior to the pandemic and we believe our 2023 performance will further prove this out. With that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions. Yes, sure. So I think the outlook would say that each quarter is roughly 30% operating margin and what you see happening is, you have the marketing expenses coming down from Q1. You have lower COVID revenue, which is a headwind, but then you have higher Breast Health revenue, which is a tailwind. So they kind of offset those headwinds or the tailwinds offset over the course of the year. And we maintain at that 30%, again, a little lower than pre-pandemic, because we have the higher inflationary costs still anticipated. Yes. The only thing I would add to that, Patrick, because we had some nice contribution from our respiratory assays, which will be seasonal as we move forward. Yes. So we have, as you said, that number includes the COVID assay revenues. So I think you've attempted to take some of that up. We also have the ancillaries, which are part of that, that are elevated because of COVID. But I think certainly, we're seeing the uptake, again, with newer customers in more than COVID. As well as our initiatives like in Africa, what Steve talked about the viral picking up some nice traction there as well. I think we -- as we think about international molecular, we would think that that is going to grow a little faster than U.S. given the commercial investments that we've made there and the Panther placements. Yes, I would say that the margin accretion from COVID is less and less dependent on COVID as we move throughout the year and it's going to be more driven by the Breast Health recovery and certainly Q1 to Q2 lower operating expenses, which will persist throughout the year. Yes. I mean, I think we have indicated that we'd be comfortable in a 2 times to 3 times leverage ratio that's something we talked to and supported by our credit agency. But to your point, we would continue to evaluate based on interest rate environment. But certainly, at this point we have plenty of cash and we have a credit line that we can fully deploy. So we feel like we've got good flexibility to do what we want in that event. Yes. I mean, I think it is the Panther placements and new customers as well. I think we've talked about in our corporate presentation that of newly acquired customers, 85% are running at least one other assay and over 55% are running at least two other assays. So I think that is the value of the Panther in the menu that we have driving that growth. Yes. What I would say is dollar contribution is probably evenly split between the legacy platform and affluent our new innovative and then the acquisitions. But certainly, the percentage growth rate is much higher than the acquisitions building off a smaller base. But at the end of the day, I think the key takeaway is, there's not just one growth driver, there's multiple growth drivers that are driving the success of that business. Yes, Derek, it's Karleen. So I'll take this one. So if you think about prior to the pandemic, what I would say is, our normal operating margin was roughly 30%, 31.5%, very rich margins for our industry. I see us probably over time getting back to that level. But what I would say is, think about our 5% to 7% top line long term growth rate. We will grow EPS faster than that, so likely low double digits and that EPS growth comes from more than just operating margin expansion. It comes from higher revenue growth, as well as some things that we can do below the line. So that's how we think about our long term outlook for earnings growing faster than revenue and again anchored on that 5% to 7%. Sure, Derik. You're probably the only person who remembers PCA3. So I think we're comfortable continuing to be fairly patient. If I look at this overall, right? So I go back seven or eight years, liquid biopsy, it's going to be the greatest thing ever and everybody thought by 2018, 2020 this massive thing, we kept saying, look, we just don't know that there's going to be a lot of money made. So we continue and particularly in our acquisitions, everything we look at is thinking about what is the long term value creation from an earnings standpoint, not just a revenue and let's face it. As you well know in this industry as well there's a whole bunch of companies that generate a lot of top line, but no bottom line and they get great valuations when they're standalones. You try to drop those into a healthy company and where suddenly the EPS starts to get looked at, you never get that same expansion on the multiple. So I also think for all of the promise, the promise never comes as quickly as everybody thinks it's going to do. I'm still waiting for gain sharing in orthopedics to take over the full world 20 years later. And I just think as we continue to watch the space, we believe there will be winners that will emerge, but we're still letting some of those play out candidly and try to see it's not just a revenue gain or a number of boxes sold or a number of kits sold or whatever else. It really is, okay, what's our long term trajectory is how we're trying to think about these things? Thank you for asking that. Yes, I think we focus -- one of the important focus on innovation is patient experience, focus on that as well as machine learning, what we can do to make radiologists more efficient and certainly that's a big issue outside the U.S. where there's much fewer radiologists."

            "name": "Stephen MacMillan",
            "content": "Thank you, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Our results highlight the strength of our three divisions, the power of our commercial channels and the increasing impact of our transformative growth drivers from R&D and acquisitions. For the quarter, total revenue was $1.07 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.07, both above the high end of our guidance. We also repurchased 1.5 million shares of our stock for $100 million in the quarter. To recap our pre-release, while we did have the benefit of three extra selling days, our top line performance was strong. Diagnostics grew 15.8%, powered by molecular diagnostics, which grew 24.5%. Both figures are organic and exclude COVID. Surgical also delivered an impressive quarter, growing 14.7% organically. And Breast Health finished the quarter down only 5.2%, a signal that our recovery from chip-related supply chain headwinds is indeed underway. While the extra days contributed approximately 250 basis points of growth net, even without the extra days, Diagnostics and Surgical both grew double digits and Breast Health exceeded prior guidance. All in, we are well positioned to achieve our full year guidance of low double-digit organic growth ex-COVID in all three of our franchises, well above our 5% to 7% long-term growth rate. Our balance sheet and cash flow are exceptionally strong and we continue to create value for our stakeholders. Today, we'd like to cover two main topics. First, we'll build on the thesis from our JPMorgan presentation three weeks ago, a theme that encapsulates how we improve women's health globally, drive our commercial success and elevate Hologic's reputation at the same time. Second, we'll highlight the transformation of our business and showcase the growth we are driving in each division, which we hope is now becoming much more evident in recent quarters. We are incredibly excited about today and confident about our future. Jumping right in, purpose driven, results driven. These four words comprise the theme of our JPMorgan presentation this year and these four words underpin the success of our entire business. At Hologic, we have an unparalleled commitment to women's health. When we speak purpose driven, results driven, nothing symbolizes these words better than our virtuous circle, which we feature in our corporate presentation. It is simple and powerful at the same time. Most importantly, it unifies and inspires our thousands of employees around the world and points our talented workforce in one singular direction, to elevate women's health, where we have leadership positions in each segment in which we operate. Our business starts with innovative, clinically differentiated, life changing, lifesaving technologies. Whether through R&D or by M&A, it all starts with innovation. As we bring these new innovative products to market, they grow our sales and profits. And here is the key to our success. What we believe sets us apart and allows us to thrive, we then invest these profits into championing women's health on a global scale. We are expanding policy and access, which then allows our products to reach more women and have an even greater impact on the world. And as our business grows, this cycle continues, simple and powerful. Two weeks ago for the second straight year, we had the opportunity to engage with global leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. This is an incredible platform that was not available to us just three years ago. We've earned our access through our leadership in women's health, our pioneering Hologic Global Women's Health Index and our outstanding response to COVID that continues today. As we've grown our business, we have significantly elevated the Hologic brand around the world. With our engagement at Davos, making powerful connections and building strong relationships, combined with recognition from our global partnership with the Women's Tennis Association. Hologic and what we stand for is more recognized globally than ever before, which in turn helps us attract the best and the brightest to the Hologic team, an important advantage in today's labor market. Quite frankly, the best thing we can do for the world and also for our business is to raise awareness and opportunities for women's health globally. For a sense of scale, there are approximately 170 million women in the U.S., our largest market. This is only a fraction of the nearly 4 billion women in the world. We have a long way to go. And as the importance of women's health is elevated and these markets grow, Hologic will be there at each step along the way. Shifting gears to our second topic, understanding the growth that is driving our business. With our strong performance for the quarter, the number one question we are asked is, how are we growing our top line? To answer this question, we will first reflect on our business transformation, a powerful mix of organic innovation, and strategic tuck-in acquisitions. Second, we will discuss each division and highlight examples of our growth engines and the multitude of market strategies deployed across each division. Reflecting on our transformation, it really started well before COVID. Three years ago, we were ready to show the world how we had diligently and thoughtfully strengthened our business for growth. Then, the pandemic hit. And when it did, we established three goals. One, take care of our employees, which we have done; two, meet the world's needs for highly accurate molecular diagnostic COVID testing, which we continue today; and three, emerge as a fundamentally stronger company, which is happening now. Under the cloud of COVID, while successfully deploying Panthers and producing our COVID assays, we strengthened Hologic for the long-term, to a level higher than even we had imagined prior to the pandemic. We achieved this through the combination of innovative internal R&D efforts, plus a series of tuck-in acquisitions. As a result, we've had continuous new product releases that have fundamentally transformed our business and boosted our growth profile. Now as the COVID cloud begins to clear, it is increasingly more evident that we are geared for success, geared for growth and geared to sustained performance over the long-term. Next, to fully appreciate our growth potential is to understand the transformation and diversification of our portfolio and growth strategies. Across all divisions, we are innovating, acquiring and building new markets, entering underdeveloped markets and penetrating existing segments. All while continuing to defend and even grow share in the markets we lead. Our growth in each division is grounded in strong and durable core products. These resilient core franchises are backed by long established clinical needs and commercial relationships, which provide a rock solid foundation to leverage into our newer growth drivers. We leverage our installed bases and customer relationships to advance our newer products, which we expect to both diversify the portfolio and accelerate growth. Moving on to the divisions. In Diagnostics, we have leading positions in core women's health product lines, such as STIs, and cervical cancer. Our women's health molecular diagnostics and psychology base drives steady growth and supports positive relationships with top laboratories and key opinion leaders, which opens the door for additional new products. Today, Diagnostics has grown from primarily a US women's health business to a global diagnostic franchise with many more growth drivers. For example, we now have over 3,250 Panthers worldwide. A number beyond what we had even imagined, along with 19 assays and the Fusion system that enables even further menu expansion. We also have a vastly expanded footprint with three acquisitions: Biotheranostics, Diagenode and Mobidiag that are contributing today and will even more so in the future. More specifically, driving future growth for Diagnostics means leveraging our expanded Panther installed base. These customers are adopters of our newer assays, including BV/CV/TV, and M.gen. We add menu, promote guidelines and drive adoption through our women's health clinical channel. Likewise, we also leverage our Panther installed base to enter established categories such as virology, and respiratory testing. Focusing on our Diagnostics acquisitions, with Biotheranostics we are already seeing solid contributions as we build a new market that is currently minimally penetrated. And with Mobidiag, the Mobidiag platform allows for significant future contributions as we prepare to enter the large and emerging syndromic panel market that is adjacent to our core molecular diagnostics franchise. In Breast Health, revenue from our 3D Mammography equipment and related service represents the core revenue foundation of the division. While our fiscal 2023 growth is primarily driven by the return of chip supply and gantry availability. The division is primed for future growth via a further portfolio expansion. The Breast Health business now spans the Breast Continuum of Care with more recurring growth drivers than ever before. We have expanded from what was once a capital intensive business by growing service revenue and adding more recurring disposable revenue. In doing so, we are creating new markets as with our Brevera breast biopsy system, while also entering existing markets where we compete with clinically differentiated products. And while we are leaders in the screening space, our R&D teams are poised to keep us ahead of the pack. In surgical, the business has changed dramatically, evolving from essentially a two product division, to one which is now much more robust and diverse. Last quarter, revenue outside of NovaSure and core MyoSure represented approximately 25% of the division's total compared to only approximately 10% in fiscal 2019. While NovaSure and core MyoSure still formed a strong durable base of the division, the business is far more dynamic than pre-pandemic. We now have meaningful growth drivers outside of these two core product lines from acquisitions, new in-house products and also improvements to existing products. Going a level deeper, the growth in surgical is driven by products like Fluent as well as NovaSure V5, both from our internal R&D efforts. With Fluent, we created an elegant solution to hysteroscopic fluid management that stands alone. And with our NovaSure V5 line extension, we have proven that even the best can get better and that we are never satisfied and never done innovating. By acquisition, the assessor procedure and the bolder advanced vessel sealing portfolio also diversify and elevate the division's growth trajectory. These are both laparoscopic tools that we've moved swiftly to acquire during COVID times and have added to our prior hysteroscopic only offering. Acessa is a unique radio frequency fibroid removal solution where we are building a new market and improving payer coverage. In Boulder, we are entering an underdeveloped market by deploying our large surgical sales force to introduce our advanced sealing portfolio to the OB/GYN market. Finally, our international business is so much stronger and poised for exceptional future growth post pandemic. Bolstering the individual product growth drivers in each division, we continue to penetrate our markets internationally. For example, in the quarter our Diagnostics business ex-COVID and surgical businesses each grew more than 20%. As we've stated before, we expect international growth rates to be accretive to our overall growth rate for years to come. In summary, our commitment to our purpose has paved the way for our success during the pandemic and is a beacon for our future. We are now a transformed, much stronger Hologic with more diverse growth drivers across each business and a much larger, more capable international presence. And through our innovative R&D and effective tuck in acquisition strategy, we are well positioned to continue to drive strong sustainable growth for years to come. With that, let me turn the call over to Karleen. Yes. You probably got it in multiple buckets, Patrick. Part is just a return of the Panther is being used for the core STI, most of our women's health business. You've got increasing growth in our new product launches, especially BV/CV, which is off to a tremendous start and we said we think will be a major driver of growth. And you really have -- what we kept saying over the last couple of years and it wasn't as obvious is so many of our customers around the world that we're running COVID are now putting the menu onto the Panthers. And it's really that simple and a huge part of it. And there's just a little bit of Africa and some viral stuff. But... Fly Eagle fly, fly Hologic fly. Okay, go ahead, Jack. Yes, Jack, just to interpolate on that point that you've noticed. We placed a lot of Panthers with so many, especially in the European countries as we responded with COVID and every one of those was coming with trailing shift over to the STI business. So I think that's a big piece of it. Yes, there was absolutely no flush we can tell you. We did get a little bit more supply that we we're able to install. And candidly, Jack, we had the extra week. We got a little bit of service revenue in there, because of that extra week in the quarter. So that kind of pushed us into the growth without that extra week that would have been slightly down a bit. But we like where we're coming and we were able to kind of refurb a few more chips, got a few more chips in and we're able to get a little more product out, but we're feeling really good about where we're headed this quarter and for the rest of the year in Breast Health. Sure, Max. To reiterate what Karleen said, our primary goal is still tuck in acquisitions followed by share buybacks. We certainly have been opportunistic on the buybacks because we generated a whole bunch of more cash during that time and thought that made a lot sense. Going forward, we're looking across the businesses, all being led by the divisions. We're not going to get into particular scale or targets for obvious reasons. But I think what we would say is, we might go a little bit bigger on scale if it brought more EBITDA. So it will be a proportionate thought process there. But I think we're -- the biggest takeaway frankly is, we're in a position of strength where our base businesses are very strong. We don't have to go do anything. And candidly, when I think there's a lot of folks around trying to figure out what they want to be when they grow up right now. We know exactly where we're going and what we want to be and that is championing women's health and having every business going well. So it gives us the luxury of being patient and smart on the business development front. Because we're running the business for the long term. And fundamentally, let's look at it. We're still bouncing off of some comps from last year where things were a little depressed from COVID everything else. We are a company that delivers and plans for the long haul and everything we've done to move up to the 5% to 7% has been very smart and we're going to continue to be prudent. It's -- we continue to deliver, I can promise you, it has nothing to do with timing of revenue recognition, Vijay. The underlying business is very strong, we're one quarter in. Think about where we were a year ago at this time. Suddenly Russia invaded Ukraine, nobody saw that coming. I've lived through the downturn of 2008-2009. We've watched the world go up and down and over the first quarter of the year. So we're going to continue to be very prudent, do not underestimate our confidence in our ability to run the business. Look, clearly the comps on molecular and diagnostics will get harder in the back half. But fundamentally, what's driving it, we sort of answered this I think earlier. We placed a whole bunch of Panthers, almost 1,500 Panthers in COVID time over the last three years. We've got more customers adopting our core menu. We have our new products being launched doing very well. And those are really the main drivers, as well as a little bit of flu and a little bit of viral stuff as we've been penetrating a little more Africa. Yes, we worry all the time. But at the end of the day, we've also built an incredible sales force that has partnered both with the labs, but also with the clinicians. And our assays have proven themselves over time as well as do not underestimate the workflow advantages of our Panther system. And so, there's a lot of people that can talk a good game and especially let's face it. There were so many startups that all were working on stuff and then they got money in COVID time and they start talking about all their women's health assays. And it's an interesting little landscape right now. So we never take anybody for granted. We face some very formidable competitors, but we always have and we will continue to and we frankly think we continue to innovate things like BB/CV. We continue to bring new assays and new tests and new education to our customers. And that continues to provide strength for us. Sure. I think on Mobi, Mobi will still be pretty small this year. Mobi will hit its stride ultimately when bring it to the U.S. which is still several years away. But we love the platform we have there. On Biotheranostics, it's still very small penetration. So the reality is, clearly, it's going to be probably potentially a few hundred million, we're not sure at this point, never great at. When you're creating new markets, it's always really hard because when you go back eight years ago, people ask me, could MyoSure someday be the size of NovaSure. And at that point in time, it was hard to picture that. And today, MyoSure is way bigger than NovaSure. So I think this magic that we have where we really are creating and building markets, it's sometimes hard to fully put a number on it other than to see, we think there's a lot of runway here, a lot. I think on the -- first on CapEx, we continue to stay really close to our sales teams on it. And seeing very tiny, nothing outside of historical cancellation rates, which is de minimis. On China, I think what you will see is, probably most of the hospitals in China over the last 60-ish days and probably here for a little period four are probably cutting down on normal procedures as they've been treating the COVID patients. But I think for our business, again, pretty small, but I think that's the kind of macro way I'd be thinking about China right now. And my hunch is, after the Chinese New Year and everything else, they're going to largely come back online and that will start to pick back up probably later this actual calendar quarter. I think they're going to get through it fine. Hey, Derek. And Derek, I'll put a little point on it too. I've been around this business long enough to watch either divisions or big companies or companies themselves trying to push that operating margin so far that they cut into R&D and you don't see it immediately, but over time your innovation falls. And so, we know a lot of folks want to just keep saying all -- every number go up like that. We're thinking very much as Karleen said about driving the EPS number, but continuing to invest in R&D and not try to drive the operating margin as high as humanly possible. Yes. We're clearly entering in Europe right now on a smaller scale. The U.S. clearance will be ultimately the bigger part. And as we said, that's probably at least a 2025-ish event at this point. So we're still a few years away as we prepare for it. And we'll certainly be able to leverage a lot of the strength that we have in the labs, especially the medium sized labs as we go into that point at that point. We're always looking -- at the end of the day, we're thinking about the long term top and bottom line growth. We're very focused on ROIC, a key part of our senior leadership team comp is tied on ROIC, so we look at it on every deal. And we've watched a whole bunch of things that even if come down 80% or 90% and some of them we still don't necessarily like. So again, I think we've got the luxury of time on our side given the strength of underlying business and the strength of our balance sheet, which gives us the chance to be relatively picky around what might be out there. Yes. I think we continue to see growth certainly in our women's health assays that's been -- and it kind of got me to your second point of view. If you think about something like BB/CV/TV that we've launched, we discovered and realized about that because we're so tapped into to the key opinion leaders and starting to realize that there are other tests that may be able to be developed that we can bring to the market to bring greater levels of certainty and specificity. And I think when we have that knowledge because we surround those customers, our focused approach certainly benefits as well and I think helps us on the innovation side, the same in 3D mammography and how that's led to better biopsy stuff. And then the same in our surgical business where understanding fibroids better than anybody else and being able to innovate endometrial ablation. So we kind of surround these, call them, large niches, but it's really the insights that we have more with the KOLs that I think does provide us a level of competitive advantage. Thank you. Any Breast Health innovation. I think the way to think about that is, we just continue to innovate. We've always been -- we've brought enhanced detectors, enhanced workflow solutions and enhanced imaging along the way and we'll continue that."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Hologic's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shelly, and I am your operator for today\u2019s call. Today's conference is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute. I would now like to introduce Ryan Simon, Vice President, Investor Relations to begin the call.\nRyan Simon: Thank you, Shelly. Good afternoon and thank you for joining Hologic's fourth quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; Essex Mitchell, our Chief Operating Officer; and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer. Our fourth quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We will also post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them, and a replay of this call will be available on our website for the next 30 days. Before we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements we make today will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the safe harbor statement included in our earnings release and SEC filings. Also during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Two of these non-GAAP measures are one, organic revenue, which we define as revenue excluding divested businesses and revenue from acquired businesses owned by Hologic for less than one year. And two, organic revenue excluding COVID-19, which further excludes COVID-19 assay revenue, other revenue related to COVID-19 and sales from discontinued products in diagnostics. Finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis and revenue growth rates will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve McMillan, Hologic's CEO.\nStephen MacMillan: Thank you, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Total revenue was $987.9 million and non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.01. We closed the fiscal year with another solid with revenue above the high end of our previous guidance range and EPS at the midpoint. Our fourth quarter results underscore the durable growth of our business and our ability to consistently deliver. For the full fiscal year 2024, we posted $4.03 billion in revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $4.08. Before discussing our themes for today, we'd like to first reflect on the fiscal year we just completed. In 2024, we made great progress strengthening and growing our business. By leveraging our leading brands, we drove diverse revenue growth and delivered industry leading margins, all while generating exceptional cash flow. This enabled us to achieve broad based growth and expand our end markets. Thanks to our intense focus on workflow automation and identifying opportunities for better solutions. At the same time, we executed our M&A strategy effectively, while delivering differentiated solutions for our customers and further solidifying our durable competitive advantage as champions of women's health. We also continue to make progress and are still in the early innings of the large international opportunity that lies ahead. Going a level deeper, we have four highlights to share that reflect our progress. One, for the full year, our Molecular Diagnostics business grew 9%, excluding COVID, continuing its strong growth. These results should put to rest any concerns regarding Panther utilization in a post-COVID environment. Two, in breast imaging, we maintained our market leading position while effectively navigating through the impact of the global semiconductor chip shortage. Three, from an operating margin perspective, we finished the year at 30%, maintaining profitability in the top tier of our peer group with opportunities for further improvement in 2025. Regarding our M&A strategy, four, we have been patient, disciplined and notably more active recently as opportunities we've been cultivating have become actionable. More specifically, we acquired Endomagnetics in July and signed a definitive agreement in October to acquire Gynesonics. Both are tuck in deals that are straight down the fairway as it relates to our M&A strategy and fit nicely into our global portfolio. We are the right partner to maximize these business opportunities, helping to benefit more women with the innovative products from these deals. From a broader capital allocation perspective, in 2024, we fully funded key organic initiatives and continued to reduce our share count. Additionally, as part of our release today, we announced our intention to launch a new $250 million accelerated share repurchase program. Overall, we have the ability to consistently deliver value to our shareholders through solid top line growth, operating and net margin expansion and strong and strong cash generation and deployment. Now moving to our two themes for our call. One, reinforcing who we are and how we got here. And two, shedding more light on where we are today and where we're headed in 2025 and beyond. As we've said before, Hologic is a company you can count on. Over the past 10 years, our non-GAAP EPS compound annual growth rate is over 10%, a meaningful achievement. Despite changing markets and unexpected macro conditions over the years, we have consistently delivered. Looking ahead, there will be ups and downs, challenges and headwinds but we expect to deliver as we have over the past decade. Since joining Hologic in 2013, we have dramatically transformed our business through two important phases. First, we steadied the ship and firmly rooted our leadership brands across our three main franchises: diagnostics, breast health and surgical. Second, during the COVID pandemic, we added several growth drivers across each of our franchises, both organically and through acquisitions. Today, we have industry leading platforms in each franchise and some of the strongest commercial channels in healthcare. The common theme across these two phases of transformation is our ability to create markets, establish market leading positions and drive growth by generating new opportunities. Looking back, products such as the Panther, Horizon DXA, our ThinPrep liquid based Pap test, 3D mammography, NovaSure, and MyoSure all represented improvements on the standard of care and therefore new markets at the time of their introduction. These trailblazing product lines generated new opportunities, which we continue to capitalize on today. Building on our foundation, products such as the Panther Fusion, Breast Cancer Index, Genius Digital Cytology, AI in mammography, Fluent and Acessa leverage our established core businesses and enable more growth through market-creating innovation. That said, as an organization, we are never satisfied and consistently aim to create new essential innovations to make the best even better. Our culture and leadership have never been stronger as we continue to make a profound impact on women's health globally. Looking ahead to fiscal 2025, we are excited about our durable revenue base, diverse mix of growth drivers including our latest in Endomagnetics, and the opportunity to further strengthen our new product pipeline through organic and inorganic opportunities. We anticipate 2025 to be another year we deliver on our commitments, positioning Hologic for even greater long-term success. Now, I will pass the call over to Essex.\nEssex Mitchell: Thank you, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks, I will highlight where we are as a business today including divisional level revenue performance and share insights into where we are headed. As Steve discussed, our success transforming Hologic has been underpinned by our ability to excel as market creators. Over time, our products and solutions become integral to our customers' operations. Across our franchises, we provide solutions that enhance our customer success by incorporating industry leading workflow automation. As our products significantly improve our customers' operational efficiency, we are more than just a supplier, we become a partner. Today, our portfolio includes several new products with considerable potential. These products span our franchises and geographies creating multiple layers of sustainable future growth. Coupled with our strong balance sheet, we have the firepower to add new growth drivers both organically and inorganically. We are confident that our robust portfolio along with future additions will enable us to grow sustainably and navigate the evolving market landscape with agility and resilience. Now shifting gears to our divisional revenue results for the fourth quarter. In Diagnostics, fourth quarter global revenue of $443.3 million grew 6.2% and 9.2% organically excluding COVID. Molecular Diagnostics remains a pillar of strength for the division, growing 9.1% and 13.2% excluding COVID. Molecular performance continues to be powered by our BV/CV/TV assay and biotheranostics business, both of which have runway for future growth. The divisions respiratory, 4-plex, COVID, Flu A, B, RSV assay also contributed growth for the quarter. For the full year, Molecular posted excellent global growth of 9% ex-COVID. This performance was again driven by BV/CV/TV as we continue to grow this market, moving testing for vaginitis to our FDA approved assays on our highly automated, high throughput Panther system. In addition, we continue to see accretive growth from our biotheranostics business as we drive adoption and expand coverage for the breast cancer index test. And finally, we are expanding the global footprint of our Panther Fusion system, allowing us to meet the need for high throughput molecular diagnostic respiratory testing, while also setting us up nicely as we build additional menu on the platform. Shifting to cytology and our perinatal business within diagnostics, we posted 0.7% growth in our fourth quarter. Since the FDA approval of our Genius Digital Diagnostic System or Digital Pap test, we've worked closely with our early adopting customers and they've given us great positive feedback on the system. This platform represents a significant improvement to the current Pap test workflows. It combines AI and advanced digital imaging to provide customers more sensitive disease detection and a streamlined efficiency, a digital AI assisted Pap test. We are proud to announce that our first U.S. Genius Digital Diagnostics customers went live in the fourth customers went live in the fourth quarter. This milestone is yet another example of Hologic understanding the needs of our customers and responding to changing market dynamics with essential innovation.Turning to Breast Health. Total fourth quarter revenue of $375.5 million, increased 6.2% or 5.3% organically when excluding SSI and Endomagnetics. Organic growth in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by increased breast imaging service revenue along with contributions from our gantry business and interventional products.In Surgical, fourth quarter revenue of $156.5 million increased 5.4% compared to the prior year. The period's growth was once again led by core MyoSure and the platform's complementary fluent fluid management system, helping to offset declines in our legacy domestic NovaSure business. In addition, our international surgical business continues to drive strong broad based performance, as we expand access to our technologies into new markets.And finally, in our Scalable business, fourth quarter revenue of $12.7 million decreased 54.9%. This result was expected based on the Horizon DXA stop ship we announced on our third quarter earnings call. As a reminder, this is a temporary headwind and we expect to resume shipping in the back half of our first quarter.Moving next to where we are headed, I will first comment on our international business and close with comments on our M&A strategy. From an international perspective, our efforts to expand globally have been broadly successful. Our international business is nearly 50% larger compared to 2019 with an accretive annual revenue growth. That said, the full potential of our international business remains largely untapped. While we have taken key steps and are more directed international markets than ever before, there is a vast international opportunity available to us that we are still in the early stages of realizing. Over a multi-year horizon, we see meaningful growth prospects for our international business as we continue to penetrate new regions and enhance our presence in existing ones. By leveraging our innovative products and strong brand reputation, we are well positioned to capture emerging markets opportunities, which we expect to be accretive to total company growth rates for years to come.Shifting now to M&A, it should come as no surprise that a combination of organic and inorganic innovation will add fuel for our future growth. Our M&A strategy continues to focus on pursuing tuck-in deals that align with our three franchises. We aim to identify and acquire assets that leverage our existing strengths, drive top-line growth and add accretion to earnings over time. Going deeper, we prioritize assets that nicely fit into our current market segments or near adjacent markets. We target strategic and high growth areas across our franchises to enhance our current market position and to build global durable growth portfolio. In summary, our M&A strategy is designed to identify and integrate valuable assets that drive incremental growth, reinforce our market leadership and deliver sustained value to our shareholders. By maintaining focus on our core markets, exploring adjacent opportunities and driving essential innovation, we believe we are well positioned to navigate 2025 and the years ahead. With that, I'll hand the call over to Karleen.\nKarleen Oberton : Thank you, Essex, and good afternoon everyone. In my comments today, we will begin with an overview of our solid fourth quarter and full year financial results, providing more color on margin and capital deployment. In closing, we will finish with our fiscal 2025 guidance for Q1 and the full year. We are pleased to close fiscal 2024 by continuing to meet or exceed our commitments on both the top and bottom line. In our fourth quarter, total revenue was $987.9 million growing 4.2% over the prior year period and 5% organically excluding COVID. In addition, our Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.01 growing 13.5%. For the full fiscal 2024, total revenue was $4.030 billion declining 0.2%, while growing 5.3% organically excluding COVID. And non-GAAP earnings per share were $4.08 growing 3%. Given the revenue headwind of the skeletal stop ship in Q4, we view these results as solid. More notably, for the second quarter in a row, we returned to top line growth for our total business as we continue to bend the revenue curve in a positive direction. Before moving on to the income statement, we'd like to highlight the continued strength of our balance sheet as well as our commitment to our capital allocation strategy. In fiscal 2024, we pulled both levers of our capital allocation strategy by completing a revenue accretive tuck in M&A deal in Endomagnetics, while also repurchasing 11.2 million shares for $808 million which includes a $500 million ASR completed in the second quarter. Over the course of fiscal 2024, we reduced our diluted share count by over 10 million shares, demonstrating our commitment to leveraging our strong balance sheet and cash flow to manage our share count and deliver EPS growth. Starting off 2025, as Steve mentioned, we remain confident in our business. We continue to leverage our ability to repurchase shares with the announcement of our intention to enter into a new $250 million ASR. With our strong operating cash flow, we are in excellent position to continue funding our priority organic investments as well as our capital allocation strategy. We exited the year with over $2.4 million in cash and investments on the balance sheet and we'll continue to pursue growth opportunities in fiscal 2025. As mentioned earlier on this call, we are off to a great start by signing a definitive agreement in October to acquire Gynesonics. We anticipate closing this deal in the first half of calendar 2025. Now on to the non-GAAP P&L for the fourth quarter, starting at gross margin. In Q4, gross margin increased to 61.5%, and up 110 basis points year-over-year, driven by broad based domestic revenue growth. We are pleased with this performance, having achieved steady expansion throughout the year while overcoming several headwinds, including the amortization of higher cost inventory of semiconductor chips and the headwind from the skeletal stop ship. Moving down the P&L. Fourth quarter operating expenses of $311 million increased approximately 2.4%. This increase was primarily driven by the inclusion of Endomagnetics in our fourth quarter results as well as stronger local currencies in our international business. Excluding the impact of Endomagnetics and FX, our operating expenses were approximately flat compared to the prior year. Altogether, fourth quarter operating margins finished at 30% and net margin was 24%, both representing a modest increase over the prior year. Below operating income, other income net represented a loss in our fiscal fourth quarter of slightly less than $1 million, better than previously anticipated due to lower net interest expense. Finally, our tax rate in Q4 was 19.75% as expected. Now let's move on to our non-GAAP financial guidance for the first quarter in full fiscal year of 2025. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we are expecting total revenue in the range of $1.025 billion to $1.035 billion and EPS of $1 to $1.03. For the full year 2025, our guidance assumes revenue of $4.15 billion to $4.20 billion and EPS of $4.25 to $4.35. Help with constant currency modeling, we are assuming a foreign exchange tailwind of slightly less than $10 million for Q1 and $30 million for the full year. Our guidance assumes the recent trend of strengthening local currencies in our international markets continues in fiscal '25. Overall, for the full fiscal year, our guidance assumes organic ex-COVID growth of approximately 4% at the midpoint. We expect revenue growth to build throughout the year. In Q1, we will be impacted by several transitory headwinds, such as the stop ship in our skeletal business as well as strong prior year comparisons in Breast Health and Surgical. We are also planning conservatively around the respiratory season and the residual impact from recent hurricanes, including the saline IV fluid shortage that we anticipate will be a headwind to our more elective breast and surgical procedures. Now moving on to assumptions underlying our revenue guidance at the division level. For core diagnostics, we expect mid-single-digit growth for the full year, driven by our BV/CV/TV assay and the ongoing adoption of our Biotheranostics BCI test. Further, as Essex mentioned, we successfully launched genius digital cytology in the U.S. during the fourth quarter. We are excited to continue this rollout and the growth opportunity it represents. Regarding COVID and respiratory assay assumptions, given the inherent variability of the respiratory season, we continue to plan conservatively for both, while maintaining capacity to aggressively meet any surges in demand. In addition, fiscal 2024 saw COVID revenue transitioning to our 4-Plex respiratory assay in our base molecular business. In 2025, we anticipate lapping the benefit of this conversion. In terms of COVID revenue, we expect COVID assay sales to about $10 million in the first quarter and approximately $25 million for the full year. COVID-related items are expected to be about $24 million in the first quarter and approximately $95 million for the full year. Closing out our diagnostics business, we expect blood screening revenue of about $5 million in Q1 and about $20 million for the full year. Turning to Breast Health. Over the past two fiscal years, we experienced elevated growth rates as we gradually recovered from the global chip shortage. Moving past this dynamic in fiscal 2025, we expect the gantry business within Breast Health to return to more normal growth ahead of our anticipated next-generation gantry launch. In our Interventional Breast segment, we expect continued strong performance from our portfolio of disposable needles and markers, though partially offset by recent withdrawal BioZorb products from the market. Lastly, in surgical, we expect broad-based progress across our portfolio to offset anticipated domestic NovaSure declines. We also foresee strong international surgical growth in fiscal '25 and driven by deeper market access and market penetration opportunities. Moving next to margins. Our fiscal '25 guidance assumes both gross margin and operating margin expansion, highlighting our strong operational discipline and commitment to shareholder value. Thus, we expect Q1 gross margins around 60% and expect improvement of roughly 50 basis points over the course of the year. Additionally, we expect Q1 operating margins around 30%, with an expected increase of 50 basis points to 100 basis points throughout the year. We are in outstanding position given the current macro environment. Working down the P&L. We expect Q1 to represent our highest quarter of operating expense in fiscal '25. This is due to normal seasonal expenses, including larger marketing campaigns as well as sales and trade meetings. For the balance of the year, we anticipate quarterly operating expense to represent a modest increase over fiscal '24 as we include the addition of Endomagnetics business into our fiscal '25 guidance. Below operating income, we estimate fiscal '25 other income net to be an expense of approximately $10 million to $15 million in Q1 and an expense between $50 million and $60 million for the full year. Our guidance is based on an annual effective tax rate of approximately 19.5%, and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately $235 million for the full year. To conclude, our solid fourth quarter completes another successful year for Hologic. As always, our focus remains on advancing women's health globally and delivering durable long-term results. Entering fiscal '25, we are excited about the opportunities ahead. With that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is coming from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi.\nPatrick Donnelly : Karleen, maybe you start where you finished it. Just on the margins, Karleen, can you talk through how to think about the year? Obviously, a lot of folks are anchored to kind of the 31.5% for the year. And I know there was a lot of focus as COVID finally gets cleaned up, land on that number. Can you talk about the moving pieces on the margin front for the year and kind of where we should be thinking about the year and then the expansion potential off of this as well?\nKarleen Oberton : Yes. So you talk about fiscal '25, Patrick, moving forward?\nPatrick Donnelly : Yes, correct.\nKarleen Oberton : Yes. So I think we talked about certainly some headwinds in the first half of the year that we think those are transitory in nature. And certainly, when we talk about the IV fluids shortage impacting surgical our most profitable business that gives you some of the first half challenges that we think are, again, transitory and we'll work through those over the course of the year. I think as we also think about the year, we've talked about network optimization opportunities that have been underway, we'll start to see more of a benefit from those as we exit the fiscal year. So those are some of the key items that we look to over the course of the year. And again, if you look at the full year revenue guidance, 4% at the midpoint to the full year lower than that. Certainly, in Q1 as we start off, that gives you a sense of accelerated revenue growth in the back year that's going to help that margin expansion at the end of the year.\nPatrick Donnelly : Okay. That's helpful. And then, Steve, maybe just on the Breast Health business. Can you talk about the outlook for the year. It sounds like maybe a new launch moving here on the gantry side, how to think about -- there's always risk and maybe a little bit of a pause before that or a replacement cycle on the back of it. So maybe just frame up how to think about Breast Health with some new products coming and what the growth could look like there?\nStephen MacMillan : Yes. Thanks, Patrick. I think the reality of the new gantry is that's going to be more impacted in kind of '26, '27, '28 from revenue. We are in that year prior to the launch that it might be a touch slower on pure gantries. The flip side is, as our service business as the interventional business and particularly things like Endomag coming through, it's the magic of continuing to deliver. So probably be a little bit lower than the last couple of years, as Karleen mentioned. But still very solid and we still feel really good about the existing gantries and the customers we still have to go, but probably just a little bit lower than last year before it reaccelerates.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research.\nJack Meehan : I had a couple of diagnostic question. Backwards leaps over players here. First question, now that it is the end of the year, I was wondering, it sounds like Biotheranostics, BV/CV/TV, two of the key growth drivers here. Could you just give us a mark-to-market for the year, ballpark of what the sales were? And then, what your view is on kind of how much the level of growth you should expect in 2025?\nKarleen Oberton : Yes. So I'd say a couple of points on BV/CV/TV, I think we've talked about that as approximately our second largest assay. So it's going to be several hundred million dollars in revenue. Biotheranostics is not at that level. It's probably closer to the $100 million plus level. I would think about those as BBC a very strong double-digit grower will continue to grow double-digits in '25, probably a little lesser rate given the increasing base. And Biotheranostics, a solid double-digit grower in '24 and we expect similar in '25.\nJack Meehan : And then, Karleen, you also talked about the transition you saw this year to the respiratory panel. And just trying to read through the lines, it sounds like you're expecting you re at least your initial assumption is that decline this year? Any chance you could give us a ballpark what that sales contribution was in 2024 and just assumptions there?\nKarleen Oberton : Yes. I mean it was definitely in the several tens of millions of dollars for the Plex assay. And so I think at this point, again, that was a transition from COVID revenue to this product. And so I think we're -- don't expect another transition year, if you will. So that's why it's a little bit of a headwind here as we think about the first half of \u201925.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Anthony Petrone with Mizuho Group.\nAnthony Petrone : Coming back on the quarter here. Maybe one breast health and one on Gynesonics, the acquisition announced a couple of weeks ago. On Breast Health, just in terms of gantry rollout post RSNA and we think about next fiscal year, should we be thinking that sort of the 2014 to 2017 sort of installs from the 3D Tomosynthesis on initial product cycle, those would be up for renewal beginning next year? Or is there a bigger portion of that installed base that potentially is eligible for an upgrade? And then just on Gynesonics, the Sonata system, maybe just a little bit on how many systems already out there in the marketplace and just synergies with the existing GYN surgical portfolio.\nStephen MacMillan : Yes. On the Breast Health piece, I would think it's going to be a rolling. I wouldn't expect some big bolus of the 2014 to 2017 all coming due. I think we're going to be phasing it out. And frankly, again, looking for more durable growth than the quick bullish of uptake. And then on Gynesonics.\nEssex Mitchell : Yes I can answer the Gynesonics question. So first, we won't go to any details on installed base or anything like that. And so we actually close. But what I will say is that -- we believe this really complements our portfolio and really aligns with what our surgical team is doing every day. So the same customers doing the same type of procedures that are historic -- hysteroscopic or trans cervical, which really aligns where our strength is at. So excited about it. We'll have a little bit more information once we close.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.\nVijay Kumar : Steve, sorry -- if you're -- I missed the first part of the call. When I look at the guidance here, 3.4x to 4.7x ex-COVID, I guess, how do you make the bridge to the LRP of 57. Is skeletal still a headwind here in fiscal '25, anything else that we need to be aware of to draw the bridge from your current guide to the 5% to 7%?\nKarleen Oberton : Yes. So what you missed, Vijay, is talking about what we call transitory headwinds that we're experiencing here. I'd say, Q1 and potentially into Q2. Both the skeletal again, that we -- in our prepared remarks said we'd start shipping that in the latter half of Q1, so it's definitely a headwind here. And then we talked about being conservative on our respiratory products, again, given the seasonality of flu -- and then finally, the IV fluid shortages that as a result of the hurricanes, we do anticipate that this is going to be a headwind for our surgical and breast businesses that need those fluids. Here in Q1, and it could creep into Q2. So if you take all those transitory headwinds for the first half, you look at the midpoint of our guide for the full year much lower growth rate here in Q1 that gives you a sense that the back half is going to have accelerated growth on the revenue.\nVijay Kumar : Understood. Steve, maybe on this IV flow shortage, none of the other metric companies have called us. I'm curious. Are you seeing something now? Or is this more of a modeling assumption?\nStephen MacMillan : I think a few have mentioned it. And I think the other piece is, candidly, I'd remind you, we were the first one that called out the chip shortage. We've been the first to call out a lot of things, Vijay, as you well know, because we're very close to the business and we are seeing little pockets. I think the other part is our surgical business is very highly elective. And so part of what is happening is clearly Baxter's prioritize -- hospitals are prioritizing the emergency and non-elective procedures. So we expect we probably do have a slight more short-term, clearly, transitory impacted, again, nothing lurking beyond that as soon as we come bouncing back. And frankly, it could be a headwind that could turn into a tailing but we always want to be conservative going into starting the year.\nKarleen Oberton : Yes. Vijay, I would say at least three to four other med tech companies have called it out specifically. So we're not alone in this.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Dan Leonard with UBS.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is [Lu] on for Dan. Just wanted to going back to the transitory headwinds, is it possible to kind of like quantify like what's the magnitude in shortages? And then what is in the kind of conservatism in the respiratory revenue? Just any more color that would be great.\nKarleen Oberton : Yes. I mean, we haven't quantified it specifically. I think from -- we've talked about the skeletal stop ship is roughly $5 million a month, so that might give -- we talked about returning to shipment in the back half. So that gives you a sense of what that could be. Certainly, conservatism in the respiratory could be in a range of at least $10 million to $20 million and on the IV fluid, I think that's still evolving and we really don't have a sense of that quite yet.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Got it. And then I wanted to touch a little bit on the share repo that you mentioned, the $250 million, is that going to happen entirely in one quarter? Or is that like a year or multiyear program?\nKarleen Oberton : Yes. We expect we're going to kick that off in the next couple of weeks here, and it should finish within our fiscal second quarter. So we'll have a prorated benefit, if you will, within the fiscal 2025 full year.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Casey Woodring with JPMorgan.\nCasey Woodring : I was curious if you could break out the 1Q guide by business segment, just to help us understand the growth acceleration expected over the course here between segments? And then also, curious what you're expecting in terms of international business growth versus domestic sales in '25 and what the outlook is across the different businesses internationally?\nKarleen Oberton : Yes. I mean we haven't provided the specific detail, but if you think about -- we talked about those transitory headwinds. Least impact probably in diagnostics. So you think about diagnostics in the mid-single-digit growth for the first quarter, and you have the other businesses below that.\nCasey Woodring : And then just internationally as well, how you're thinking about that?\nEssex Mitchell : Yes. We expect international to grow at a faster rate than our domestic business.\nCasey Woodring : Got it. Okay. And then just maybe if I can fit in one quick last one. So you talked about leveraging some supply chain costs moving around to give you some tax benefit. Just wondering if there's anything baked in there from a supply chain perspective that 19.5% tax rate for '25 or if there's some upside to that number?\nKarleen Oberton : Yes. Casey, I would remind you that the 19.5% is lower than fiscal '24. We're taking it down 25 basis points. primarily related to limiting some of our foreign losses that weren't deductible. And of course, we're always looking at other supply chain opportunities or business opportunities to drive the rate. But I wouldn't say that we're ready to commit to anything lower than the 19.5% that's already lower than '24.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Mike Matson with Needham & Company.\nMike Matson : So I want to ask one on vertical business. So NovaSure sounds like it's declining in the U.S. So can you talk about why and whether or not that's something that could be stabilized and you return to growth? Or is it going to be a perpetual decline?\nEssex Mitchell : Yes. What I would say is that for a number of years, the volumes of global endometrial operation across the market have been a slow decliner, we've continued to maintain our market share and do well in the space but we do see alternatives versus competitors become more prevalent such as IUDs and other things to control hormonal abnormal uterine bleeding. So as of right now, we do expect that to continue on a slow decline. We feel great about our ability to continue to grow internationally, which is expanding and has a nice growth rate with NovaSure. So expecting all-in to still put up market-leading results, but we do see it declining in the U.S.\nMike Matson: Okay. Got it. And then just another one on the Gynesonics. I understand it hasn't closed. So I don't know if you can or you're willing or able to answer this. But I guess it looks like it's for fibroids, similar to MyoSure. So I guess, why won't -- why isn't this something that will cannibalize MyoSure to some degree? Is it used for different patients or different types of fibroids or something like that? Is that why wall or?\nEssex Mitchell : Yes, it sounds like you're right on it. It is for different fibroids. So we have large fibroids on the outside and in the wall the uterus with Accesa, small polyps and I say only up to type 2 fibroids, with MyoSure. There are six different types of fibroids, Gynesonics so it not a system fills the gap in between both Sonata -- or both Accesa and MyoSure. So it is attacking a different type of fibroid using a different technology than MyoSure.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Navann Ty with BNP Paribas.\nNavann Ty : I have one on M&A. If you could discuss recent M&A environment in Hologic three segments. And maybe more broadly, your capital allocation priorities in 2025.\nKarleen Oberton : Yes. I would say that as Hologic M&A is within each division. So each division has their own business development teams that are out there identifying assets, cultivating relationships and hopefully, we're able to acquire assets before they jump into a process. And hopefully, assets that we're kind of the rightful owner of. And so I'd say there's no priority between divisions at this time. It's really about what is the best deal for Hologic. And I think we gave some examples on how Endomagnetics and Gynesonics fit nicely into our current portfolio. And we bring a point of expertise. And I would say, as we look to 2025, I think it's probably more of the same of what we saw in '24, a balance of M&A and share repurchase is what we're looking to do.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hello. This is [John] on for Michael. I wanted to ask about the Panthers. What I believe is one of your manufacturing partners recent tier results, and I was wondering if that has something to do with how the Panther placements are going? I know that utilization and then the assay menu expansion is the way to the growth, but -- and I'm sure the level of placements is far different from what it used to be pre pandemic, but so I wanted to ask how that's been trending?\nKarleen Oberton : Yes, absolutely. I think this is something we've talked about for the last couple of years. We have an installed base of over 3,300 Panthers worldwide, which is significantly higher than what we had prior to the pandemic, and we had obviously, an accelerated placement of Panthers during that time. And as we expected, those placements have slowed. But no impact on the growth of the business. As we said, molecular diagnostics, excluding COVID grew 9% in fiscal '24, many years after the end of the -- post the pandemic. So continued strength with that business.\nUnidentified Analyst: Well, I mean, if you wanted to give me more color but I would have taken that.\nStephen MacMillan : As you know, [Michael] and some people, I think, sometimes forget is we make all of the revenue on the assays, not on Panther. So I know that we've gotten some questions of investors that are thinking, gee, if we sell less Panthers is that showing a downturn. But as you know, it's a reagent rental model. So frankly, right now, the next few years are largely driving that assay adoption without having to even place a lot of Panthers, which is even better on the CapEx side. So it's a very good structure for us.\nUnidentified Analyst: And yes, and on that related note, any update to the statistics you provided in the past about 55 users having using two or more assays and 1/3 having four or more?\nKarleen Oberton : We haven't provided an update to that. And just in general, I would say that those trends continue to improve -- move in the right direction.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Mason Carrico with Stephens.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is [Harrison] on for Mason. It looks like -- so last quarter, I believe you talked about some facility integrations within the Breast Health business. Could you maybe talk a little bit about the cadence or time line of how those integrations will play out this year and then the margin impact as we progress through the year?\nKarleen Oberton : Yes. We expect that migration to be completed over the course of which is it's great not only from a manufacturing but also R&D will be ceded there and some great synergies with the R&D teams. But we haven't provided specific improvements, but it is part of the improvement we will see over the course of the year.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Yes. Sounds great. And then so within Breast Health. Have we largely moved past the higher cost of chips at this point? Are we at a more normalized level heading into '25 or is there still a drag on margin earlier in the year relative to the back half?\nKarleen Oberton : Yes. We're probably on the tail end of that. There was wasn't just one ship. There was many, many different ships that have the issue. So there could be still a few working their way through the system. But I think as we go through '25, we will move past that.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley.\nUnknown Analyst: This is [Jason] on for Tejas. So just modeling-related questions. So in skeletal health, do you expect the supply change by the end of F 1Q. So how much of any of the sort of $15 million per quarter loss, can we expect to be recouped in fiscal year 2025 on top of the base sales expectations? And then on BioZorb, could you quantify the financial impact from removing this product for fiscal year '25?\nKarleen Oberton : Yes. The BioZorb impact is deminimis, it really as a revenue line item that was less than $10 million in '24. So pretty deminimis. And I think on the skeletal, I think what we're really focused on is getting this back on the market and satisfying our customer demand. I wouldn't project right now that there will be some level of pickup. Again, we need to get it back to shipping status here in the first quarter.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Conor McNamara with RBC Capital Markets.\nRicardo Moreno: This is Ricardo Moreno for Conor. I have a question about as normal growth returns to the gantry business. How does that coincide with earlier the chip shortage that was experienced with the gantry business intersecting with equipment upgrades and replacement cycles?\nKarleen Oberton : So what I would say is, as we're kind of through the chip issue and I think we covered that in the prepared comments that as we get into '25, we expect more normalized growth rates. With potentially a little bit of headwind, again, as we anticipate this next-gen gantry. But as Steve talked about, we don't expect a significant increase in that conversion cycle given that technology improvement, software improvements, AI has been available to customers in our installed base over the past several years. It's been very intentional that our R&D efforts were producing upgrades that were backwards compatible to the installed base so that we didn't create this pent-up demand. So I think we're really going to move into a more normalized replacement cycle or an ongoing replacement cycle here in the U.S. which is a great business to have that steady state.\nRicardo Moreno: Fantastic. And coming from FX comments earlier about the international business and focus there. How does that roll in, in terms of reaching the pre-pandemic operating margin goal of 31.5%. Usually, those -- traditionally, those margins have been a bit lower than 30%.\nKarleen Oberton : Yes. Well, I think as we've talked about our guide here from fiscal 2025, starting at 30% and expecting some improvement of 50 basis points to 100 basis points over the course of '25. I think you see a really nice balance of us continue to drive improvement in margins where we can. While we know that international is getting bigger and that's usually dilutive to the margins, but as international continues to grow, they have their own opportunities to create leverage on their operating margin line. So it's an ongoing balance and we see -- we're really pleased about what we expect for 2025.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Andrew Brackmann with William Blair.\nMaggie Wilmouth : This is Maggie Wil on for Andrew today. Maybe one on Biotheranostics, I know you spoke to earlier, you're expecting kind of that double-digit growth that you saw in fiscal '24 for fiscal 2025. But how should we be thinking about the contribution from that to growth moving forward? And just where do you feel like you are in terms of that opportunity?\nKarleen Oberton : Yes. I think we think it's still early innings on that opportunity. I think there's it's pretty low market penetration at this point, but we haven't given guidance beyond '25, but to say that it's still early innings.\nStephen MacMillan : It certainly seems accretive to our company for many years to come, as are most of the acquisitions we've been doing over the last few years.\nOperator: And our final question is coming from Andrew Cooper with Raymond James.\nAndrew Cooper : Maybe just one more on the margin side to the degree you can help sort of frame the swing factors of adding that 50 bps to 100 bps over the course of the year, how much of that is just these transitory items getting lapsed by the time or resolved by the time you get to the fiscal fourth quarter versus the network optimization and other things you called out in one of your earlier answers.\nKarleen Oberton : Yes. We haven't quantified them specifically, but certainly, they are contributing to kind of lower margins here in the beginning, the first half of the year. But again, we view this as transitory and as they clear, we'll reap that margin benefit.\nOperator: Thank you. And this now concludes Hologic's third quarter fiscal 2024 earnings conference call. Have a good evening.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Karleen Oberton",
            "content": "Thank you, Essex, and good afternoon everyone. In my comments today, we will begin with an overview of our solid fourth quarter and full year financial results, providing more color on margin and capital deployment. In closing, we will finish with our fiscal 2025 guidance for Q1 and the full year. We are pleased to close fiscal 2024 by continuing to meet or exceed our commitments on both the top and bottom line. In our fourth quarter, total revenue was $987.9 million growing 4.2% over the prior year period and 5% organically excluding COVID. In addition, our Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.01 growing 13.5%. For the full fiscal 2024, total revenue was $4.030 billion declining 0.2%, while growing 5.3% organically excluding COVID. And non-GAAP earnings per share were $4.08 growing 3%. Given the revenue headwind of the skeletal stop ship in Q4, we view these results as solid. More notably, for the second quarter in a row, we returned to top line growth for our total business as we continue to bend the revenue curve in a positive direction. Before moving on to the income statement, we'd like to highlight the continued strength of our balance sheet as well as our commitment to our capital allocation strategy. In fiscal 2024, we pulled both levers of our capital allocation strategy by completing a revenue accretive tuck in M&A deal in Endomagnetics, while also repurchasing 11.2 million shares for $808 million which includes a $500 million ASR completed in the second quarter. Over the course of fiscal 2024, we reduced our diluted share count by over 10 million shares, demonstrating our commitment to leveraging our strong balance sheet and cash flow to manage our share count and deliver EPS growth. Starting off 2025, as Steve mentioned, we remain confident in our business. We continue to leverage our ability to repurchase shares with the announcement of our intention to enter into a new $250 million ASR. With our strong operating cash flow, we are in excellent position to continue funding our priority organic investments as well as our capital allocation strategy. We exited the year with over $2.4 million in cash and investments on the balance sheet and we'll continue to pursue growth opportunities in fiscal 2025. As mentioned earlier on this call, we are off to a great start by signing a definitive agreement in October to acquire Gynesonics. We anticipate closing this deal in the first half of calendar 2025. Now on to the non-GAAP P&L for the fourth quarter, starting at gross margin. In Q4, gross margin increased to 61.5%, and up 110 basis points year-over-year, driven by broad based domestic revenue growth. We are pleased with this performance, having achieved steady expansion throughout the year while overcoming several headwinds, including the amortization of higher cost inventory of semiconductor chips and the headwind from the skeletal stop ship. Moving down the P&L. Fourth quarter operating expenses of $311 million increased approximately 2.4%. This increase was primarily driven by the inclusion of Endomagnetics in our fourth quarter results as well as stronger local currencies in our international business. Excluding the impact of Endomagnetics and FX, our operating expenses were approximately flat compared to the prior year. Altogether, fourth quarter operating margins finished at 30% and net margin was 24%, both representing a modest increase over the prior year. Below operating income, other income net represented a loss in our fiscal fourth quarter of slightly less than $1 million, better than previously anticipated due to lower net interest expense. Finally, our tax rate in Q4 was 19.75% as expected. Now let's move on to our non-GAAP financial guidance for the first quarter in full fiscal year of 2025. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we are expecting total revenue in the range of $1.025 billion to $1.035 billion and EPS of $1 to $1.03. For the full year 2025, our guidance assumes revenue of $4.15 billion to $4.20 billion and EPS of $4.25 to $4.35. Help with constant currency modeling, we are assuming a foreign exchange tailwind of slightly less than $10 million for Q1 and $30 million for the full year. Our guidance assumes the recent trend of strengthening local currencies in our international markets continues in fiscal '25. Overall, for the full fiscal year, our guidance assumes organic ex-COVID growth of approximately 4% at the midpoint. We expect revenue growth to build throughout the year. In Q1, we will be impacted by several transitory headwinds, such as the stop ship in our skeletal business as well as strong prior year comparisons in Breast Health and Surgical. We are also planning conservatively around the respiratory season and the residual impact from recent hurricanes, including the saline IV fluid shortage that we anticipate will be a headwind to our more elective breast and surgical procedures. Now moving on to assumptions underlying our revenue guidance at the division level. For core diagnostics, we expect mid-single-digit growth for the full year, driven by our BV/CV/TV assay and the ongoing adoption of our Biotheranostics BCI test. Further, as Essex mentioned, we successfully launched genius digital cytology in the U.S. during the fourth quarter. We are excited to continue this rollout and the growth opportunity it represents. Regarding COVID and respiratory assay assumptions, given the inherent variability of the respiratory season, we continue to plan conservatively for both, while maintaining capacity to aggressively meet any surges in demand. In addition, fiscal 2024 saw COVID revenue transitioning to our 4-Plex respiratory assay in our base molecular business. In 2025, we anticipate lapping the benefit of this conversion. In terms of COVID revenue, we expect COVID assay sales to about $10 million in the first quarter and approximately $25 million for the full year. COVID-related items are expected to be about $24 million in the first quarter and approximately $95 million for the full year. Closing out our diagnostics business, we expect blood screening revenue of about $5 million in Q1 and about $20 million for the full year. Turning to Breast Health. Over the past two fiscal years, we experienced elevated growth rates as we gradually recovered from the global chip shortage. Moving past this dynamic in fiscal 2025, we expect the gantry business within Breast Health to return to more normal growth ahead of our anticipated next-generation gantry launch. In our Interventional Breast segment, we expect continued strong performance from our portfolio of disposable needles and markers, though partially offset by recent withdrawal BioZorb products from the market. Lastly, in surgical, we expect broad-based progress across our portfolio to offset anticipated domestic NovaSure declines. We also foresee strong international surgical growth in fiscal '25 and driven by deeper market access and market penetration opportunities. Moving next to margins. Our fiscal '25 guidance assumes both gross margin and operating margin expansion, highlighting our strong operational discipline and commitment to shareholder value. Thus, we expect Q1 gross margins around 60% and expect improvement of roughly 50 basis points over the course of the year. Additionally, we expect Q1 operating margins around 30%, with an expected increase of 50 basis points to 100 basis points throughout the year. We are in outstanding position given the current macro environment. Working down the P&L. We expect Q1 to represent our highest quarter of operating expense in fiscal '25. This is due to normal seasonal expenses, including larger marketing campaigns as well as sales and trade meetings. For the balance of the year, we anticipate quarterly operating expense to represent a modest increase over fiscal '24 as we include the addition of Endomagnetics business into our fiscal '25 guidance. Below operating income, we estimate fiscal '25 other income net to be an expense of approximately $10 million to $15 million in Q1 and an expense between $50 million and $60 million for the full year. Our guidance is based on an annual effective tax rate of approximately 19.5%, and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately $235 million for the full year. To conclude, our solid fourth quarter completes another successful year for Hologic. As always, our focus remains on advancing women's health globally and delivering durable long-term results. Entering fiscal '25, we are excited about the opportunities ahead. With that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions. Yes. So you talk about fiscal '25, Patrick, moving forward? Yes. So I think we talked about certainly some headwinds in the first half of the year that we think those are transitory in nature. And certainly, when we talk about the IV fluids shortage impacting surgical our most profitable business that gives you some of the first half challenges that we think are, again, transitory and we'll work through those over the course of the year. I think as we also think about the year, we've talked about network optimization opportunities that have been underway, we'll start to see more of a benefit from those as we exit the fiscal year. So those are some of the key items that we look to over the course of the year. And again, if you look at the full year revenue guidance, 4% at the midpoint to the full year lower than that. Certainly, in Q1 as we start off, that gives you a sense of accelerated revenue growth in the back year that's going to help that margin expansion at the end of the year. Yes. So I'd say a couple of points on BV/CV/TV, I think we've talked about that as approximately our second largest assay. So it's going to be several hundred million dollars in revenue. Biotheranostics is not at that level. It's probably closer to the $100 million plus level. I would think about those as BBC a very strong double-digit grower will continue to grow double-digits in '25, probably a little lesser rate given the increasing base. And Biotheranostics, a solid double-digit grower in '24 and we expect similar in '25. Yes. I mean it was definitely in the several tens of millions of dollars for the Plex assay. And so I think at this point, again, that was a transition from COVID revenue to this product. And so I think we're -- don't expect another transition year, if you will. So that's why it's a little bit of a headwind here as we think about the first half of '25. Yes. So what you missed, Vijay, is talking about what we call transitory headwinds that we're experiencing here. I'd say, Q1 and potentially into Q2. Both the skeletal again, that we -- in our prepared remarks said we'd start shipping that in the latter half of Q1, so it's definitely a headwind here. And then we talked about being conservative on our respiratory products, again, given the seasonality of flu -- and then finally, the IV fluid shortages that as a result of the hurricanes, we do anticipate that this is going to be a headwind for our surgical and breast businesses that need those fluids. Here in Q1, and it could creep into Q2. So if you take all those transitory headwinds for the first half, you look at the midpoint of our guide for the full year much lower growth rate here in Q1 that gives you a sense that the back half is going to have accelerated growth on the revenue. Yes. Vijay, I would say at least three to four other med tech companies have called it out specifically. So we're not alone in this. Yes. I mean, we haven't quantified it specifically. I think from -- we've talked about the skeletal stop ship is roughly $5 million a month, so that might give -- we talked about returning to shipment in the back half. So that gives you a sense of what that could be. Certainly, conservatism in the respiratory could be in a range of at least $10 million to $20 million and on the IV fluid, I think that's still evolving and we really don't have a sense of that quite yet. Yes. We expect we're going to kick that off in the next couple of weeks here, and it should finish within our fiscal second quarter. So we'll have a prorated benefit, if you will, within the fiscal 2025 full year. Yes. I mean we haven't provided the specific detail, but if you think about -- we talked about those transitory headwinds. Least impact probably in diagnostics. So you think about diagnostics in the mid-single-digit growth for the first quarter, and you have the other businesses below that. Yes. Casey, I would remind you that the 19.5% is lower than fiscal '24. We're taking it down 25 basis points. primarily related to limiting some of our foreign losses that weren't deductible. And of course, we're always looking at other supply chain opportunities or business opportunities to drive the rate. But I wouldn't say that we're ready to commit to anything lower than the 19.5% that's already lower than '24. Yes. I would say that as Hologic M&A is within each division. So each division has their own business development teams that are out there identifying assets, cultivating relationships and hopefully, we're able to acquire assets before they jump into a process. And hopefully, assets that we're kind of the rightful owner of. And so I'd say there's no priority between divisions at this time. It's really about what is the best deal for Hologic. And I think we gave some examples on how Endomagnetics and Gynesonics fit nicely into our current portfolio. And we bring a point of expertise. And I would say, as we look to 2025, I think it's probably more of the same of what we saw in '24, a balance of M&A and share repurchase is what we're looking to do. Yes, absolutely. I think this is something we've talked about for the last couple of years. We have an installed base of over 3,300 Panthers worldwide, which is significantly higher than what we had prior to the pandemic, and we had obviously, an accelerated placement of Panthers during that time. And as we expected, those placements have slowed. But no impact on the growth of the business. As we said, molecular diagnostics, excluding COVID grew 9% in fiscal '24, many years after the end of the -- post the pandemic. So continued strength with that business. We haven't provided an update to that. And just in general, I would say that those trends continue to improve -- move in the right direction. Yes. We expect that migration to be completed over the course of which is it's great not only from a manufacturing but also R&D will be ceded there and some great synergies with the R&D teams. But we haven't provided specific improvements, but it is part of the improvement we will see over the course of the year. Yes. We're probably on the tail end of that. There was wasn't just one ship. There was many, many different ships that have the issue. So there could be still a few working their way through the system. But I think as we go through '25, we will move past that. Yes. The BioZorb impact is deminimis, it really as a revenue line item that was less than $10 million in '24. So pretty deminimis. And I think on the skeletal, I think what we're really focused on is getting this back on the market and satisfying our customer demand. I wouldn't project right now that there will be some level of pickup. Again, we need to get it back to shipping status here in the first quarter. So what I would say is, as we're kind of through the chip issue and I think we covered that in the prepared comments that as we get into '25, we expect more normalized growth rates. With potentially a little bit of headwind, again, as we anticipate this next-gen gantry. But as Steve talked about, we don't expect a significant increase in that conversion cycle given that technology improvement, software improvements, AI has been available to customers in our installed base over the past several years. It's been very intentional that our R&D efforts were producing upgrades that were backwards compatible to the installed base so that we didn't create this pent-up demand. So I think we're really going to move into a more normalized replacement cycle or an ongoing replacement cycle here in the U.S. which is a great business to have that steady state. Yes. Well, I think as we've talked about our guide here from fiscal 2025, starting at 30% and expecting some improvement of 50 basis points to 100 basis points over the course of '25. I think you see a really nice balance of us continue to drive improvement in margins where we can. While we know that international is getting bigger and that's usually dilutive to the margins, but as international continues to grow, they have their own opportunities to create leverage on their operating margin line. So it's an ongoing balance and we see -- we're really pleased about what we expect for 2025. Yes. I think we think it's still early innings on that opportunity. I think there's it's pretty low market penetration at this point, but we haven't given guidance beyond '25, but to say that it's still early innings. Yes. We haven't quantified them specifically, but certainly, they are contributing to kind of lower margins here in the beginning, the first half of the year. But again, we view this as transitory and as they clear, we'll reap that margin benefit."

            "content": "Thank you, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks, I will highlight where we are as a business today including divisional level revenue performance and share insights into where we are headed. As Steve discussed, our success transforming Hologic has been underpinned by our ability to excel as market creators. Over time, our products and solutions become integral to our customers' operations. Across our franchises, we provide solutions that enhance our customer success by incorporating industry leading workflow automation. As our products significantly improve our customers' operational efficiency, we are more than just a supplier, we become a partner. Today, our portfolio includes several new products with considerable potential. These products span our franchises and geographies creating multiple layers of sustainable future growth. Coupled with our strong balance sheet, we have the firepower to add new growth drivers both organically and inorganically. We are confident that our robust portfolio along with future additions will enable us to grow sustainably and navigate the evolving market landscape with agility and resilience. Now shifting gears to our divisional revenue results for the fourth quarter. In Diagnostics, fourth quarter global revenue of $443.3 million grew 6.2% and 9.2% organically excluding COVID. Molecular Diagnostics remains a pillar of strength for the division, growing 9.1% and 13.2% excluding COVID. Molecular performance continues to be powered by our BV/CV/TV assay and biotheranostics business, both of which have runway for future growth. The divisions respiratory, 4-plex, COVID, Flu A, B, RSV assay also contributed growth for the quarter. For the full year, Molecular posted excellent global growth of 9% ex-COVID. This performance was again driven by BV/CV/TV as we continue to grow this market, moving testing for vaginitis to our FDA approved assays on our highly automated, high throughput Panther system. In addition, we continue to see accretive growth from our biotheranostics business as we drive adoption and expand coverage for the breast cancer index test. And finally, we are expanding the global footprint of our Panther Fusion system, allowing us to meet the need for high throughput molecular diagnostic respiratory testing, while also setting us up nicely as we build additional menu on the platform. Shifting to cytology and our perinatal business within diagnostics, we posted 0.7% growth in our fourth quarter. Since the FDA approval of our Genius Digital Diagnostic System or Digital Pap test, we've worked closely with our early adopting customers and they've given us great positive feedback on the system. This platform represents a significant improvement to the current Pap test workflows. It combines AI and advanced digital imaging to provide customers more sensitive disease detection and a streamlined efficiency, a digital AI assisted Pap test. We are proud to announce that our first U.S. Genius Digital Diagnostics customers went live in the fourth customers went live in the fourth quarter. This milestone is yet another example of Hologic understanding the needs of our customers and responding to changing market dynamics with essential innovation.Turning to Breast Health. Total fourth quarter revenue of $375.5 million, increased 6.2% or 5.3% organically when excluding SSI and Endomagnetics. Organic growth in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by increased breast imaging service revenue along with contributions from our gantry business and interventional products.In Surgical, fourth quarter revenue of $156.5 million increased 5.4% compared to the prior year. The period's growth was once again led by core MyoSure and the platform's complementary fluent fluid management system, helping to offset declines in our legacy domestic NovaSure business. In addition, our international surgical business continues to drive strong broad based performance, as we expand access to our technologies into new markets.And finally, in our Scalable business, fourth quarter revenue of $12.7 million decreased 54.9%. This result was expected based on the Horizon DXA stop ship we announced on our third quarter earnings call. As a reminder, this is a temporary headwind and we expect to resume shipping in the back half of our first quarter.Moving next to where we are headed, I will first comment on our international business and close with comments on our M&A strategy. From an international perspective, our efforts to expand globally have been broadly successful. Our international business is nearly 50% larger compared to 2019 with an accretive annual revenue growth. That said, the full potential of our international business remains largely untapped. While we have taken key steps and are more directed international markets than ever before, there is a vast international opportunity available to us that we are still in the early stages of realizing. Over a multi-year horizon, we see meaningful growth prospects for our international business as we continue to penetrate new regions and enhance our presence in existing ones. By leveraging our innovative products and strong brand reputation, we are well positioned to capture emerging markets opportunities, which we expect to be accretive to total company growth rates for years to come.Shifting now to M&A, it should come as no surprise that a combination of organic and inorganic innovation will add fuel for our future growth. Our M&A strategy continues to focus on pursuing tuck-in deals that align with our three franchises. We aim to identify and acquire assets that leverage our existing strengths, drive top-line growth and add accretion to earnings over time. Going deeper, we prioritize assets that nicely fit into our current market segments or near adjacent markets. We target strategic and high growth areas across our franchises to enhance our current market position and to build global durable growth portfolio. In summary, our M&A strategy is designed to identify and integrate valuable assets that drive incremental growth, reinforce our market leadership and deliver sustained value to our shareholders. By maintaining focus on our core markets, exploring adjacent opportunities and driving essential innovation, we believe we are well positioned to navigate 2025 and the years ahead. With that, I'll hand the call over to Karleen. Yes I can answer the Gynesonics question. So first, we won't go to any details on installed base or anything like that. And so we actually close. But what I will say is that -- we believe this really complements our portfolio and really aligns with what our surgical team is doing every day. So the same customers doing the same type of procedures that are historic -- hysteroscopic or trans cervical, which really aligns where our strength is at. So excited about it. We'll have a little bit more information once we close. Yes. We expect international to grow at a faster rate than our domestic business. Yes. What I would say is that for a number of years, the volumes of global endometrial operation across the market have been a slow decliner, we've continued to maintain our market share and do well in the space but we do see alternatives versus competitors become more prevalent such as IUDs and other things to control hormonal abnormal uterine bleeding. So as of right now, we do expect that to continue on a slow decline. We feel great about our ability to continue to grow internationally, which is expanding and has a nice growth rate with NovaSure. So expecting all-in to still put up market-leading results, but we do see it declining in the U.S. Yes, it sounds like you're right on it. It is for different fibroids. So we have large fibroids on the outside and in the wall the uterus with Accesa, small polyps and I say only up to type 2 fibroids, with MyoSure. There are six different types of fibroids, Gynesonics so it not a system fills the gap in between both Sonata -- or both Accesa and MyoSure. So it is attacking a different type of fibroid using a different technology than MyoSure."

            "name": "Stephen MacMillan",
            "content": "Thank you, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Total revenue was $987.9 million and non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.01. We closed the fiscal year with another solid with revenue above the high end of our previous guidance range and EPS at the midpoint. Our fourth quarter results underscore the durable growth of our business and our ability to consistently deliver. For the full fiscal year 2024, we posted $4.03 billion in revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $4.08. Before discussing our themes for today, we'd like to first reflect on the fiscal year we just completed. In 2024, we made great progress strengthening and growing our business. By leveraging our leading brands, we drove diverse revenue growth and delivered industry leading margins, all while generating exceptional cash flow. This enabled us to achieve broad based growth and expand our end markets. Thanks to our intense focus on workflow automation and identifying opportunities for better solutions. At the same time, we executed our M&A strategy effectively, while delivering differentiated solutions for our customers and further solidifying our durable competitive advantage as champions of women's health. We also continue to make progress and are still in the early innings of the large international opportunity that lies ahead. Going a level deeper, we have four highlights to share that reflect our progress. One, for the full year, our Molecular Diagnostics business grew 9%, excluding COVID, continuing its strong growth. These results should put to rest any concerns regarding Panther utilization in a post-COVID environment. Two, in breast imaging, we maintained our market leading position while effectively navigating through the impact of the global semiconductor chip shortage. Three, from an operating margin perspective, we finished the year at 30%, maintaining profitability in the top tier of our peer group with opportunities for further improvement in 2025. Regarding our M&A strategy, four, we have been patient, disciplined and notably more active recently as opportunities we've been cultivating have become actionable. More specifically, we acquired Endomagnetics in July and signed a definitive agreement in October to acquire Gynesonics. Both are tuck in deals that are straight down the fairway as it relates to our M&A strategy and fit nicely into our global portfolio. We are the right partner to maximize these business opportunities, helping to benefit more women with the innovative products from these deals. From a broader capital allocation perspective, in 2024, we fully funded key organic initiatives and continued to reduce our share count. Additionally, as part of our release today, we announced our intention to launch a new $250 million accelerated share repurchase program. Overall, we have the ability to consistently deliver value to our shareholders through solid top line growth, operating and net margin expansion and strong and strong cash generation and deployment. Now moving to our two themes for our call. One, reinforcing who we are and how we got here. And two, shedding more light on where we are today and where we're headed in 2025 and beyond. As we've said before, Hologic is a company you can count on. Over the past 10 years, our non-GAAP EPS compound annual growth rate is over 10%, a meaningful achievement. Despite changing markets and unexpected macro conditions over the years, we have consistently delivered. Looking ahead, there will be ups and downs, challenges and headwinds but we expect to deliver as we have over the past decade. Since joining Hologic in 2013, we have dramatically transformed our business through two important phases. First, we steadied the ship and firmly rooted our leadership brands across our three main franchises: diagnostics, breast health and surgical. Second, during the COVID pandemic, we added several growth drivers across each of our franchises, both organically and through acquisitions. Today, we have industry leading platforms in each franchise and some of the strongest commercial channels in healthcare. The common theme across these two phases of transformation is our ability to create markets, establish market leading positions and drive growth by generating new opportunities. Looking back, products such as the Panther, Horizon DXA, our ThinPrep liquid based Pap test, 3D mammography, NovaSure, and MyoSure all represented improvements on the standard of care and therefore new markets at the time of their introduction. These trailblazing product lines generated new opportunities, which we continue to capitalize on today. Building on our foundation, products such as the Panther Fusion, Breast Cancer Index, Genius Digital Cytology, AI in mammography, Fluent and Acessa leverage our established core businesses and enable more growth through market-creating innovation. That said, as an organization, we are never satisfied and consistently aim to create new essential innovations to make the best even better. Our culture and leadership have never been stronger as we continue to make a profound impact on women's health globally. Looking ahead to fiscal 2025, we are excited about our durable revenue base, diverse mix of growth drivers including our latest in Endomagnetics, and the opportunity to further strengthen our new product pipeline through organic and inorganic opportunities. We anticipate 2025 to be another year we deliver on our commitments, positioning Hologic for even greater long-term success. Now, I will pass the call over to Essex. Yes. Thanks, Patrick. I think the reality of the new gantry is that's going to be more impacted in kind of '26, '27, '28 from revenue. We are in that year prior to the launch that it might be a touch slower on pure gantries. The flip side is, as our service business as the interventional business and particularly things like Endomag coming through, it's the magic of continuing to deliver. So probably be a little bit lower than the last couple of years, as Karleen mentioned. But still very solid and we still feel really good about the existing gantries and the customers we still have to go, but probably just a little bit lower than last year before it reaccelerates. Yes. On the Breast Health piece, I would think it's going to be a rolling. I wouldn't expect some big bolus of the 2014 to 2017 all coming due. I think we're going to be phasing it out. And frankly, again, looking for more durable growth than the quick bullish of uptake. And then on Gynesonics. I think a few have mentioned it. And I think the other piece is, candidly, I'd remind you, we were the first one that called out the chip shortage. We've been the first to call out a lot of things, Vijay, as you well know, because we're very close to the business and we are seeing little pockets. I think the other part is our surgical business is very highly elective. And so part of what is happening is clearly Baxter's prioritize -- hospitals are prioritizing the emergency and non-elective procedures. So we expect we probably do have a slight more short-term, clearly, transitory impacted, again, nothing lurking beyond that as soon as we come bouncing back. And frankly, it could be a headwind that could turn into a tailing but we always want to be conservative going into starting the year. As you know, [Michael] and some people, I think, sometimes forget is we make all of the revenue on the assays, not on Panther. So I know that we've gotten some questions of investors that are thinking, gee, if we sell less Panthers is that showing a downturn. But as you know, it's a reagent rental model. So frankly, right now, the next few years are largely driving that assay adoption without having to even place a lot of Panthers, which is even better on the CapEx side. So it's a very good structure for us. It certainly seems accretive to our company for many years to come, as are most of the acquisitions we've been doing over the last few years."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Hologic's Third Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Cynthia, and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute. I would now like to introduce Ryan Simon, Vice President, Investor Relations to begin the call. Please go ahead.\nRyan Simon: Thank you, Cynthia. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Hologic's third quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer; and Essex Mitchell, our Chief Operating Officer. Our third quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We will also post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them as well as an updated corporate presentation. And a replay of this call will be available on our website for the next 30 days. Before we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements we make today will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the safe harbor statement included in our earnings release and SEC filings. Also during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Two of these non-GAAP measures are: one, organic revenue, which we define as revenue excluding divested businesses and revenue from acquired businesses owned by Hologic for less than one year; and two, organic revenue, excluding COVID-19, which further excludes COVID-19 assay revenue, other revenue related to COVID-19, and sales from discontinued products in Diagnostics. Finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis and revenue growth rates will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO.\nStephen MacMillan: Thank you, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to discuss our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Total revenue for Q3 was $1.01 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.06, both again above the high-end of our guidance. Importantly, we are excited that with COVID now mostly in the rear view mirror, our reported revenue has returned to growth. Our strong performance goes beyond the top line and shines throughout the P&L. For the quarter, we delivered a solid 31.2% operating margin and deployed $100 million during the quarter to repurchase 1.4 million shares. All-in, the $1.06 in EPS translates to 14% growth on the bottom-line, a very strong result and also very encouraging as we flip the script now to reported revenue and EPS growth again. Looking back to the start of our fiscal year, we knew there were still certain questions on some investors\u2019 minds about the true strength and durability of our underlying business. These were questions that surfaced as we exited a period of uncertainty created by the pandemic, followed by the global chip shortage. While we and many long-term investors understood the power and potential of our transformed, much stronger business, we acknowledged that these unanswered questions created barriers for some of those newer to Hologic. As usual, rather than rely on words, we knew it would be our performance that would emphatically answer these questions and clearly demonstrate that we are indeed a bigger, faster, stronger company than before the pandemic. Our third quarter performance should make this very clear. In Q3, we bent the top-line curve to green after eleven quarters of COVID driven declines. Our top line reported revenue returned to growth at 3.1% versus last year. Organic ex-COVID we delivered healthy 5.8% growth and we achieved these strong results on top of exceptionally strong 18.4% organic ex-COVID growth last year. Turning to our themes for today. First, we would like to recap our performance since the start of the fiscal year by answering five key questions which were on many investors\u2019 minds. Second, we\u2019ll pass the call over to Essex, who will highlight certain overlooked elements of our broad-based international growth, as well as provide an update on M&A activities. On to our first theme. The top five questions which have been out there: One, will Panther utilization continue to grow? Two, will Breast Health return to full strength and maintain market leadership? Three, will Hologic return to delivering industry-leading 30% plus operating margins? Four, with a $2.4 billion dollar cash position, will Hologic be successful in deploying capital? And finally five, can Hologic maintain its cervical cancer screening leadership if USPSTF issues an adverse cervical cancer screening guideline? The short answer to all five is, without a doubt, yes. We will continue to thrive. From here, we will take each question in order. First, our molecular diagnostics business continues to deliver and is so much bigger and stronger than it was prior to the pandemic. Our global installed base of Panthers now exceeds 3,300 and is rock solid. More importantly, our customers continue to praise and utilize our platform. Panther\u2019s superior workflow, automation, ease of use, and constantly expanding menu continues to drive demand and differentiate us in a competitive environment. In quite simple terms, revenue per Panther and number of assays run per Panther continue to grow, with the simple metric being our Molecular Diagnostics growth rate. In Q3, our molecular business excluding COVID grew 10.5%, on top of 12.9% growth in the prior year period. We\u2019ve now delivered high-single to double-digit performance in 13 of the last 15 quarters. Quarter-after-quarter, year-over-year, we continue to deliver by expanding utilization, and our outlook remains bright. Second, our breast health results continue to demonstrate a profound strength in breast cancer screening. Our gantry business is well on pace to fully recover from the chip shortage, and we continue to maintain our leadership position. Our supply chain is much improved and now fortified from successfully navigating the chip shortage experience. Over a decade from the initial launch of our breakthrough 3D mammography, customers still view Hologic as leaders in performance, including image quality and scan time, leaders in service, and leaders in customer satisfaction. Letting the numbers speak for themselves, in Q3, we delivered 7.1% growth in Breast Health, on top of 27.5% growth in the prior year period. The business is more diverse than ever, and continuing to add in even more recurring revenue with our Endomagnetics acquisition. Third, operating margins. As Karleen will share in more detail later, we delivered a 31.2% operating margin in our third quarter, a 230 basis point improvement from the prior year period, and an 80 basis point improvement sequentially. At the highest level, we are now back to delivering pre-COVID margins, even with our International business being over 40% larger than it was in 2019. Consistent with our expectations, we recaptured our strong sector margin profile by maintaining focus on operational efficiency and moving past the amortization of higher priced chips purchased during the chip shortage. Fourth, on capital deployment, our balance sheet and cash flow remain incredibly robust. As announced last week, we recently closed the Endomagnetics acquisition, a transaction that we view as straight down the fairway in terms of execution within our broader M&A strategy. Overall, the deal is a prudent investment of capital that we expect to add revenue, margin and EPS accretion over time. Together, we have an incredible opportunity to improve interventional breast care for women. On top of closing the Endomag deal, we continue to demonstrate that we are willing to bet on ourselves and repurchase shares. As a baseline, we are looking to offset dilution from our internal share plans. And from there, with our strong cash position, we look to layer on additional share repurchases. Fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased 10.5 million shares for $750 million. We plan to continue on our capital allocation path and fully intend for our deployment strategy to include both M&A and share repurchases. And finally, before turning the call over to Essex, USPSTF. As we\u2019ve done for nearly 30 years in cervical cancer screening, no matter the direction the USPSTF may take for its cervical cancer guidelines, we will navigate the landscape and remain strong. Overall, we achieved our strong results by maintaining our long term focus and commitment to women\u2019s health. As we shared on our Q2 call, the strength of Hologic lies in the sum of our parts. We expect our results to continue to answer the call, and speak for themselves while we continue to demonstrate our durable strength quarter-after-quarter, year-over-year. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Essex to share insight on international growth drivers and more on Endomagnetics.\nEssex Mitchell: Thank you, Steve. Overall, our third quarter performance speaks to the successful implementation of our growth strategy, building multiple durable growth drivers into our franchises around the world. Today, we\u2019d like to quickly highlight three specific growth drivers from International Diagnostics and Surgical. These drivers are sometimes overlooked because of their strong market shares in the U.S., however we still have a great growth opportunity outside of the United States. That said, internationally molecular STI testing, cytology and MyoSure, all delivered nice growth in the quarter. This underscores the power of the sum of our parts, and reinforces our opportunity and ability to grow by expanding markets. Let\u2019s start with STI testing. The largest category in our global molecular diagnostics business. In the U.S., STI testing is our largest category and we have earned and maintained leadership for years. Internationally, we are still in the early days of leveraging our expanded Panther installed base. We have a sizeable opportunity to increase our share, not only in STI testing but across all categories where we offer testing. We have a long runway ahead of us as we continue to build the new markets we\u2019ve entered. With several irons in the fire, we expect to layer in more contribution over time, driven by more assays and more volume on our Panther systems. The same can be said for cytology and cervical cancer screening. In some regions of the world, we are bringing liquid based pap tests to the market for the first time and subsequently growing the market. While overshadowed by the U.S. revenue, international cytology, like STI testing, adds meaningful revenue that moves the needle over time. Shifting to Surgical and MyoSure, while MyoSure is still growing strong in the U.S., the MyoSure international growth rate is even higher. This is possible because international markets are vastly underpenetrated, and demand remains high for our minimally invasive option for treating uterine polyps and fibroids. In many regions, we are the first and only minimally invasive alternative to a complete hysterectomy. And it\u2019s our belief that all women should have access to minimally invasive options. All-in, while it\u2019s clear that certain products across our portfolio are more established in the U.S., what is not as obvious is that there are meaningful market expansion opportunities for these same products internationally. As leaders in these areas and champions for women\u2019s health, we are well positioned to capitalize on this global growth opportunity. And finally, before turning the call over to Karleen, I\u2019d like to provide more detail on Endomagnetics. As Steve mentioned, we are pleased to welcome the Endomag team to Hologic. 150 employees strong, and with seasoned management and R&D capabilities, the company has done an incredible job growing the business to what it has become today. That includes 500,000 plus women treated and adoption by over 1,300 hospitals in over 45 countries. Endomag products include Magseed markers for wireless lesion localization, Magtrace for lymphatic tracing, and Sentimag, a simple, easy-to-use handheld device to visualize both. The Endomag portfolio enables us to provide robust and differentiated offerings to meet demand in the growing interventional breast surgery market. From an investment perspective, the business directly aligns with our Breast Health franchise and has proven on-market products that are well accepted into clinical workflows. With our established, deep rooted sales channels we expect to amplify revenue growth well above our corporate average and also expect both margin and earnings accretion over time. Overall, we are excited to join forces and determined to go even further together. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Karleen.\nKarleen Oberton : Thank you Essex, and good afternoon, everyone. In my statements today, I will provide an overview of our revenue results, walk down our income statement showcasing strong performance, touch on certain key financial metrics, and finish with our guidance for the fourth quarter and full fiscal 2024. Our third quarter financial results were robust, once again exceeding our expectations on revenue and profitability, building on the momentum from the first half of the year. To recap high level results, total revenue came in at $1.11 billion, beating the midpoint of our prior guidance by $11 million. We delivered 3.1% revenue growth and organic growth of 5.8%, excluding COVID. In addition, non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.06, growing 14.0% and exceeding the high end of our prior guidance by $0.001. Before moving on to our franchise results, we want to highlight the continued strength of our balance sheet. In Q3, we generated over $400 million in cash from operating activities, ending the quarter with $2.4 billion on the balance sheet, deployed $100 million on share repurchases, and announced the acquisition of Endomagnetics. We continue to demonstrate that our strong cash balance, leverage ratio well below our target range, and ability to generate cash consistently provide us the flexibility to fund innovation and pull both levers of our capital allocation strategy, tuck-in M&A and share repurchases, at the same time. Moving forward, we still have significant firepower to continue to deploy capital diligently, as opportunities arise. Turning to our franchise results. In Diagnostics, third quarter revenue of $440.8 million grew 0.7%. Excluding COVID assay and related revenue, worldwide Diagnostics grew by 6.0%. Within Diagnostics, Molecular Diagnostics continues to contribute significantly, growing 10.5% excluding COVID. We continue to see underlying strength in BV CV/TV, which continues its outstanding growth trajectory and has become our second-largest assay globally. Additionally, as expected, non-COVID respiratory assay sales declined sequentially from Q2, in line with the flu season. However, year-over-year growth remains strong, highlighting the continued adoption of our four plex COVID, Flu A, Flu B, and RSV assay. And finally, Biotheranostics continues to be accretive to growth for our Molecular business. Rounding out Diagnostics, Cytology and Perinatal declined 2.9% globally, with U.S. declines partially offset by solid international growth, as Essex highlighted earlier. As a reminder, in fiscal Q3\u201923, customers built up cytology inventory levels in the U.S. due to third-party shipping constraints in Q2\u201923, leading to elevated sales in the prior year period. While the cytology business has largely returned to normal, year-over-year growth rates were impacted. Looking ahead, we expect flat to modest growth from the cytology business. Moving on to Breast Health. Total third quarter revenue of $385 million increased by 7.1%, or 8.2%, when excluding SSI. Within Breast Health, growth was primarily driven by Breast Imaging, with solid domestic and international results, contributing 7.2% and 12.1% growth, respectively, excluding SSI. Third quarter performance was driven largely by increased gantry shipments and robust Service revenue growth that continues to contribute meaningfully. Continuing next to Surgical. Third quarter revenue of $166.6 million increased 6.2%. Surgical growth continues to be fueled by MyoSure and the related Fluent Fluid Management System. Our Laparoscopy business, while smaller in dollars, grew significantly in the quarter and continues to progress nicely. Additionally, International continues to be a bright spot, growing just under 20% in the quarter. Finally, in our Skeletal business, third quarter revenue of $19 million declined 29.7% due to lower Horizon DXA shipments resulting from a temporary stop ship related to a non-conformance issue. We are working with our suppliers to resolve this situation and expect to resume shipments during the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Now, let\u2019s move on to the rest of the non-GAAP P&L for the third quarter. Gross margin was 61.1% for the quarter, a 30 basis point improvement from the prior year period, even though COVID assay revenue declines continue to be a headwind. Additionally, gross margin expanded 40 basis points sequentially from fiscal Q2 primarily driven by favorable product mix. Total operating expense of $302.8 million in the third quarter decreased by 3.5%. This decrease was driven primarily by elimination of expenses related to the divested SSI business. Operating margin was 31.2% for the third quarter. The year-over-year increase of 230 basis points was driven by top line growth, expanding gross margins, and lower operating expenses. Sequentially, as expected, operating margins expanded 80 basis points from Q2, largely from lower operating expenses and higher gross margin in Q3. Below operating income, other income, net, represented an expense of nearly $3 million in our fiscal third quarter. Interest income is lower due to lower cash balances from the significant share repurchases we have completed throughout the fiscal year. Additionally, interest expense is up due to higher interest rates. Finally, our tax rate in Q3 was 19.75% as expected. Now let\u2019s move on to our Non-GAAP financial guidance for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2024. For Q4 2024, we are expecting total revenue in the range of $970 million to $985 million, and EPS of $0.97 to $1.04. For the full year 2024, our guidance assumes revenue of $4.012 billion to $4.027 billion and EPS of $4.04 to $4.11. Unpacking this guidance, we lowered the midpoint of our prior revenue guidance by $5 million, which represents about a $20 million headwind related to the temporary Skeletal Health stop ship previously mentioned, partially offset by our strong performance in Q3 and the inclusion of an estimated $4 million to $5 million of revenue from Endomagnetics, now that we have closed the acquisition. With respect to foreign exchange, we are assuming Q4 will have a headwind of about $3 million. For the full year, we now expect a slight tailwind of about $3 million. Turning to our franchises. We expect Diagnostics, Breast Health, and Surgical to grow mid-single digits in Q4 and full year fiscal 2024, excluding the impact of COVID. As a reminder, fiscal \u201824 has four fewer selling days compared to fiscal \u201823, which we estimate to be a headwind of more than 100 basis points for the full year. Starting with Diagnostics. In Q4, we expect our Molecular Diagnostics business to drive high-single digit growth, excluding COVID, as customers continue to adopt and drive utilization of our broad Panther menu. In Cytology and Perinatal, we expect growth in the mid-single digits for the fourth quarter. Sequentially, however, we expect the business to perform flat to Q3. In Q4 of last year, sales dropped below typical ordering patterns due to inventory buildup in Q3\u201923. We expect Cytology and Perinatal comps to stabilize in fiscal year \u201925. Closing out on non-COVID Diagnostics, we expect blood revenue of approximately $6 million in Q4 and $20 million (ph) for the year. In terms of COVID revenue, we expect COVID assay sales to be about $7 million in Q4 \u201824, and about $70 million for the full year. COVID-related items are expected to be about $25 million in the fourth quarter and approximately $105 million for the full year. Moving on to Breast Health. We remain on pace to grow the business mid-single digits for the fourth quarter. We expect to see solid gantry placements in Q4, continuing the steady performance we have delivered year-to-date. The demand for our portfolio of products and services remains strong, and we have solid visibility into gantry orders. Further, our confidence in delivering more gantries than last year remains high. We are successfully managing resource availability among both our install teams and our customers, as customers balance the need to meet elevated demand for screening and staffing constraints. Finally, in Surgical, we anticipate Q4 revenue to grow mid-single digits. We expect the growth to continue to come from MyoSure, Fluent, and laparoscopy division \u2013 business. Moving next to margins. Our guidance continues to assume a cadence of improvement moving into Q4, for both gross margin and operating margin, we remain on pace to exit the fiscal year in the low 60s for gross margin. Our guidance also assumes Q4 operating margins in the low 30s, and we are on pace to finish fiscal \u201924 between 30 to 31%, which includes the stub period of Endomagnetics. Below operating income, we estimate fiscal \u201824 other income, net, to be an expense of approximately $8 million in Q4 and $11 million for the full year. Our guidance is based on an annual effective tax rate of approximately 19.75% and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately 238 million for the full year. To conclude, Q3 was another strong quarter for Hologic. We continue to deliver robust growth and quality earnings. As we approach the end of fiscal year 2024 and look ahead to 2025, we are excited by the performance across all our franchises and the additional strength provided by a pristine balance sheet. As always, our stakeholders can count on us to deliver while also advancing the state of women\u2019s health around the world. With that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Donnelly: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the questions. Steve, probably the biggest inbound is just on the 4Q guide, obviously, Karleen talked a little bit there. It seems like a lot of it is around the skeletal piece. I guess just when you think about the core business going into 4Q. Has anything changed relative to a few months ago? Has anything gotten worse? It seems like it's all skeletal, but I just want to talk through the core business and how you're feeling about it into 4Q here?\nStephen MacMillan: You nailed it, Patrick. It's probably a little alarming because of the skeletal piece, but the three core businesses are all going great, and it is completely a reflection of that. And we just had a little hiccup with the supplier issue in our Skeletal business. It is our non-core, but for Diagnostics, Breast Health, Surgical, we are feeling really, really good.\nKarleen Oberton: Yeah. And just, Patrick, just to add a finer point to it. Of the $20 million headwind, about $16 million is related to the fourth quarter specifically.\nPatrick Donnelly: Okay. That's helpful. And then, Karleen, maybe one of the questions we get broadly is on the margin profile as we work our way forward here. I think there's some fear that you guys could be a little more kind of heading towards the peak margin. Can you talk about, I guess, the 4Q piece, the moving pieces? You talked a little bit about the exit rate there. And just how you think about the build going forward when you think about the algorithm, the keys to getting that margin continuing to expand as we go forward and just broadly how to think about the jumping off point as we look to '25? Thanks so much.\nKarleen Oberton: Yeah. I think we'd like to ground people in the pre-pandemic operating margins at 31.5%. And I think as you see, as we exit Q4, we'll be right in that range and really thinking about that we've added a lot of revenue growth drivers that have a lower operating margin profile than the legacy business. So feel really good about achieving that as we exit 24. For the full year, '24, we'll be a little bit below that, as we said in our prepared remarks, between 30 to 31. But I have good confidence as we look to '25, we will be squarely for the full year at those pre-pandemic levels. And just to walk through some of the components, again, as I mentioned, the recent acquisitions will have lower margin profiles. The international business has a lower margin profile, and we're still working through some of the higher supply chain costs, primarily related to chips, as well as we integrate certain facilities, we have double costs. We\u2019ll see those primarily work through over the course of \u201825.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nTejas Savant: Hey, guys. Thanks for the time here. Karleen, I just want to follow up on Patrick's line of questioning there on the second question. Can you just help us think through sort of underlying algorithm for EPS growth, 5% to 7% for the top line, presumably, it stays intact for next year as well. As you think through the different buckets here, right, between the margin expansion piece, which you said it sounds like you're on track to achieve, but then you've also got repos. And then you've got a little bit of dilution from potential tuck-ins, including ones you might do in the next 12 months or so. So as we think about those multiple pieces in the context of EPS growth next year, is sort of high-single digit essentially a fair way to think about it or could it be a little bit better than that?\nKarleen Oberton: Yeah. So first of all, Tejas, I'll say that we have -- we're not giving guidance for 2025 at this point. We're still working through our budget cycle, and we'll be doing that in totality in the November call. What I would say at a high level when we think about earnings, yes, we want to grow earnings faster than revenue. So again, that 5% to 7% would lead you to the high single-digit, low double-digit earnings growth. And we do think about that as balance using the whole P&L, not just margin expansion, but share repurchase and potentially some favorability on the tax line as well. But again, we will be giving that full guidance on the November call.\nTejas Savant: Got it. Fair enough. And then a quick follow-up on some of the recent tuck-ins here. I'll start with Boulder actually, perhaps for you, Steve. Could you just give us an update on where things stand and expanding from the pediatric setting there to the OB/GYN channel. Obviously, you flagged a lot more lap procedures there in the OB/GYN side. And then a similar sort of question, early days on Endomag but how should we be thinking about status quo in that market that Endomag can really help displace particularly in the U.S. where it's underpenetrated? And what's the feedback been like from physicians from any early conversations ahead of due course (ph)?\nStephen MacMillan: Great. We'll kick that right to Essex to handle.\nEssex Mitchell: Great. Yeah. So I'll start with Boulder. And so we're seeing great success expanding outside of the pediatric channel. I would say our fastest-growing area is actually in thoracic with the reveal product. So we're seeing nice, it's an open product. We're getting to new customers, really honing in and focusing similar to our strategies that we've utilized with gynecology, where we focus on the specialty, really understand our differentiated position with the product and expand from there. So we feel really good about the success thus far with Boulder and still quite a bit of meat on the bone left, I would say, with pediatrics as we look to focus there moving forward. With regard to Endomag, very early days. I would say, we just closed, I feel really great about that team, excited to have them as part of the Hologic family and know that we'll do great things together. As far as feedback from customers don't have anything to comment on that right now, but feel really good about the prospects of this business, especially with the strong channel and relationships that we have today.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nJack Meehan: Thank you. Good afternoon. Wanted to focus on the diagnostic business here, starting with Panther. So I think I heard over 3,300 in the field now. So it feels like that stepped up a little bit. Pre-COVID, you were placing about 50 a quarter. I was wondering, if you felt like are you seeing any signs you might be getting back to those levels or still a bit of a COVID hangover on placements?\nStephen MacMillan: Yeah, still lower on the placements. Clearly, this chapter of our growth, Jack, is expanding the utilization for Panther, but we are still seeing a modestly moving up, which we consider to be good. But yeah, not back at that pre-COVID level.\nJack Meehan: Got it. Okay. And then on BV CV/TV, I think I also heard second largest assay globally. Would that put it in the quarter kind of a floor $40 million or so? And would you care to wager where this could land in terms of overall size at some point? What's driving the growth?\nKarleen Oberton: Yeah. I think that's a fair estimate of where it is. And I think we would -- I would be comfortable saying that it could be our largest assay someday. So to put it in perspective, there's still room for growth there.\nStephen MacMillan: Okay. Operator, next question.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nVijay Kumar: Hi, Steve. Good afternoon. Congrats on the nice sprint and thanks for taking my question. I guess my first one on the skeletal ship home (ph) ratio. How -- is that in the backlog, Steve. So is this -- could this now be a tailwind for fiscal '25 or are those more like a lost revenues?\nStephen MacMillan: It could potentially be a little bit of a -- it won't be lost revenue. I think we feel pretty good. There will be a couple of tiny ones. But overall, I think we feel pretty good. So it might be a modest tailwind for next year, but we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves. But we're fixing it and feel very good. We'll be back in place by the beginning of '25.\nVijay Kumar: That's helpful, Steve. And Karleen, maybe one for you on the margins here for Q4. Did that expectations change versus prior and mostly because of the deal and perhaps revenue push out? If so, what is the underlying jump-off point and is that a relevant number to be thinking of to be modeling the company?\nKarleen Oberton: Yeah. I think as I talked about, we'll end the full year between 30 to 31, which would give you something higher than 31 in the fourth quarter. I would say -- from an annualized basis, I'd jump off the midpoint of the 30 to 31 and think that we're going to get back to probably that 31.5 range. But there is some seasonality to margins. And typically, Q1 is our lowest operating margin quarter. So I wouldn't like spring off of Q4 to a higher number in Q1.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Anthony Petrone with Mizuho Group. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Petrone: Thanks and congrats on the quarter here. Maybe I'll just throw two out there quick. Just on cytology testing. I know the comps were a little bit bifurcated the last two quarters, but the business itself just generally has been a little bit lumpy. So maybe just what you're seeing there? Do you think there's any changing patterns ahead of the preventative task force rule? You also have the upgrade cycle with the digital platform. So just a little bit on the lumpiness in cytology. And then the second one on Panther utilization. Can you actually provide the range of assays used in the post-pandemic systems? I know the average is two, but where does that range sit? What is the upper end of that range and what is the lower end of that range? Where could it trend over time? Thanks.\nStephen MacMillan: Let me take the first part of that. The first part is, we are not seeing any shift in the market in terms of cytology usage, Anthony. It is -- really it's more because we changed a third-party vendor last year, it kind of made a little bit of lumpiness between the Q2 to Q3 last year comparisons, but the underlying is very consistent. And the initial stages on our digital cytology, which is further ahead in Europe, are looking very good, and we're in the early stages of some very positive consumer -- or I'm sorry, customer acceptance of that in the United States. So I think we continue to feel good about our cytology business. I\u2019ll pass it On the Panther utilization, we'll take...\nKarleen Oberton: Yeah. Sure. So Anthony, on the Panther utilization on the new customers, we talked about over 55% are running two or more assays. But when we look at U.S. in total, that we look at over a third of our customers are running four or more assays. So I would kind of anchor into that 4 -- 4 to 6is the likely target range. That over a third at the end of \u201823, compares to just under 20% at the end of \u201819. So you can see that growth that we\u2019re able to achieve as we drive utilization on the Panthers that are out there.\nAnthony Petrone: Thank you.\nStephen MacMillan: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Mike Matson with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.\nMichael Matson: Yeah. Thanks. So I want to ask one on the cytology business, OUS. It sounds like that is a growth driver for you guys. But -- just want to kind of understand what's happening in those markets and what's driving the growth and kind of what you're seeing there with PAF versus primary HPV testing in the different regions of the world?\nStephen MacMillan: Yeah. We're seeing some nice acceptance to our digital cytology. One of the challenges outside the United States is not as many cytologists around. And so the ability to help on the workflow is a big win and so rolling out our digital cytology, the genius cytology there is good. And we continue to work with guidelines. I think the hidden piece that's been missed for everything that we did in the pandemic to provide the COVID test, is we establish much stronger relationships across the world with ministries of health and everything else. And we're having more dialogues really that's going to benefit so many of our businesses, including our surgical businesses, our breast interventional business and really just shifting guidelines. And so there's more discussions. Germany has gone to a co-testing model in cytology and HPV over the last few years that we're benefiting from and working those angles really country by country.\nMichael Matson: Okay. Thanks. And then I think I heard currently Karleen call out tax rate as a kind of opportunity over the next few years. So your tax rate is a little bit on the higher side relative to some of the larger companies. So -- can you maybe elaborate on that?\nKarleen Oberton: Yeah. I think as we look at our operations and supply chain and even more specifically, continue to leverage Costa Rica for manufacturing, especially as we acquire new companies and optimize their supply chain, we try to leverage those points to contribute to favorability on the tax rate.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Casey Woodring with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nCasey Woodring: Great. Thank you for taking my questions. So I wanted to talk about the strong molecular growth in the quarter here, that 10.5% number. One of the larger players in the molecular space that sits more in the point of care market has been seeing strong growth rates on the non-respiratory side as well now for several quarters in a row. This competitors called out sexual health and virology specifically as areas of growth. Just given your menu overlap, can you help frame up how the Panther is coexisting in the market now with some of these growing point-of-care platforms? And just your latest thoughts around any potential share shifts one way or the other in that market? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.\nStephen MacMillan: Yeah. I think we continue to feel really, really good that most of the screening is asymptomatic. It's standard testing that the economics are still going to work very well for the labs. And so I think we love our position. And there's always going to be people punching around on the edges that will help expand the market probably as well, but we feel really good about where we're going.\nCasey Woodring: That's helpful. And then just my follow-up here quickly, on that 5% to 7% top line algorithm, you previously talked about surgical is probably at the higher end of that range, rest on the lower and diagnostic somewhere in the middle when including cytology. So just -- is that the right way to think about 2025 on an ex-COVID basis? Maybe just walk through the moving parts there as you see them for next year. Thank you.\nStephen MacMillan: Yeah. Probably not quite ready to give individual line forecast for 2025, but I think we feel good overall. As any given year, any given quarter, any given business, maybe slightly above, slightly below, but I think we\u2019d like where we\u2019re headed. So we\u2019ll give you more of that detail, Casey, when we guide in November. Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ryskin: Thanks for taking the question, guys. Just a couple kind of loose ends for me. Going back to the skeletal, the stop ship. I think you talked about confidence that getting resolved in fiscal 1Q, I think you talked about $15 million in the fourth quarter. Just any sense of timing when in the quarter you're going to have it resolved? And just sort of if you could frame the range of outcomes there? Could this extend a little bit longer? Do you really have good line of sight on the resolution?\nStephen MacMillan: We do have good line of sight. We're not expect it to go out far into Q1 of '25. So you should be able to count on it again. We'll guide by that point, but we fully expect to be back in the market by then.\nMichael Ryskin: Okay. And on the capital deployment side, you talked about balance sheet, strong free cash flow year-to-date. And then obviously, you've got both share buybacks and M&A kind of going on at the same time. Just remind us sort of how you frame those two options right now? Obviously, you just got a couple of deals under your belt recently, but still in a good position. So just going forward, priorities between the two and how you see that trading off?\nKarleen Oberton: Yeah. Certainly, as we look at our cash flow generation with a very strong balance sheet and very competitive credit agreement. Our focus is on deploying that free cash flow as well as the cash that we\u2019ve built on the balance sheet at this point in time. The priority continues to be tuck-in M&A, acquisitions that give us confidence in our ability to grow our revenue, hopefully accretive to our current growth rate. And then it would be share repurchase. As we\u2019ve stated in our remarks at a minimum to manage dilution from our equity plans and then opportunistic as we see disconnects and valuation in the market.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Navann Ty with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nNavann Ty: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the M&A pipeline with your $2.5 billion cash available for acquisition? What are you seeing at the moment? And then also if you could discuss the innovation, including the next-generation gantry system in Breast Health and AI? Thank you.\nStephen MacMillan: Sure. I think on the M&A front, we obviously were very pleased we closed the Endomag deal last week. We continue to look at other deals in that size a little bit bigger or whatever. But again, you can only make them when they're available. As we said last quarter, we'd love to do kind of one Endomag every quarter. It doesn't always work out that way. So we're in this great position of being able to be disciplined buyers as we continue to watch things shake out and also being able to redeploy on our own cash by buying back our own shares along the way. So it's not an either/or given the incredible cash position we have. So we like where we are on that.\nKarleen Oberton: Yeah. In regards to innovation, certainly, we've talked about a next-generation gantry that really continues to focus on workflow, patient experience and image quality. Those are the key drivers of innovation in that space and certainly layer on AI. How can we help the radiologist in assessing risk within those images and again, assessing or helping improve workflow is the use of AI, not only in breast but also in genius digital cytology.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG. Please go ahead.\nRyan Zimmerman: Thanks for taking the question. Maybe Karleen, just to follow up on your next-gen gantry. I mean you made the comment today that you're on pace to grow gantries this year. And I don't know if you'll be comfortable answering this yet, but do you expect to grow gantries in '25? And coincidentally, can you just give any color on kind of timing of a next-gen gantry?\nKarleen Oberton: Yeah. I don't think we're going to give any specifics on timing, I think likely as we look towards RSA would be a time that we would highlight that for certain of our customers and probably give a little more specifics on what we're expecting for 2025 and beyond.\nRyan Zimmerman: Okay. Just a follow-up, two quick questions. One, what's the status or impact that you're seeing from the BioZorb recall dynamics? How does that impact with Endo-Magnetic, if at all? And then the second thing that I wanted to just ask about, unrelated, was you've had a number of these deals. And to go back to kind of the earlier margin question, is there an opportunity in any way for some facility integration or manufacturing integration that hasn't been kind of contemplated or discussed yet? Because it would seem like with the number of deals you've done over the past years, there could be some low-hanging fruit there. And I just don't recall you guys really talking too much about that thus far. Thanks for taking the questions.\nEssex Mitchell: Yes. This is Essex. I'll jump in on the BioZorb question. So Endomag and BioZorb are completely unrelated from each other, number one. But number two, I would say, is that the BioZorb recall was more of an administrative recall where we needed to update our PI or language in our insert. So we are still selling our product, feel great about it and are working through that. With regard to facility integration, I don't know if Karleen wants to jump on that?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes. Sure. So as we\u2019ve highlighted, we\u2019re doing some facility integration in our Breast Health business right now. From each of the acquisitions, they all have different profiles. Some makes sense to stand alone as they are and others do make sense to integrate and they\u2019re in various stages of integration. And as we always do, we always look at our supply chain, look at our network and continue to focus on opportunities for optimization. And I would say, over the next five years, I think we\u2019ll continue to realize those opportunities.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Mason Carrico with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nMason Carrico: Hey, thanks for taking the questions. On the molecular business, could you provide some color on how adoption is trending for the fusion sidecar recently. You doubled the Panther installed base during COVID. How has adoption really been among those new customers? And then as a follow-up, what are your expectations for where that fusion attach rate can move longer term?\nStephen MacMillan: Yeah. We're seeing steady adoption of the Fusion sidecar, which is [indiscernible] it really opens up the menu. We're focusing on customer by customer. What we're seeing is quarter-over-quarter, more customers adopting the Fusion as we go along. It doesn't necessarily mean every Panther needs a fusion. And in fact, it will probably end up being, I don't know, maybe even a third of our total Panthers, even if that \u2013 what it really comes down to is does each customer have the capability. And so that\u2019s been our big focal point, and we\u2019re seeing good adoption and steady growth.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Andrew Cooper with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Cooper: Hey, everybody. Thanks for the time. A lot has been asked. So maybe just one, a little bit nitpicky on margins, but could you give us a little bit more flavor for the pretty modest change for the year, but just how much of a driver is Endomag flowing in versus maybe a little bit of a decremental from the skeletal headwind versus anything in the core in terms of as we think about that 4Q operating margin and full year operating margin for fiscal '24?\nKarleen Oberton: Yeah. So I would say, it's more geared towards the stop ship on the skeletal versus the Endomag. Think about Endomag as very small revenue for only two months, but certainly stop ship on even a noncore franchise is going to have an impact on margins.\nStephen MacMillan: The way to think about it, too, is with that, I think our margins are still looking really, really good.\nAndrew Cooper: No, agreed. And then just one more again kind of on margins. But Karleen, I just want to make sure I caught something you said correct. I think you said something about working through chip costs and integrating facilities -- or the elevated chip costs, I should say, and integrating facilities through fiscal '25. Just wanted to get a sense, has anything changed in terms of how quickly you're working through those higher-cost chips and when you expect to be at kind of more normal levels in terms of the chip cost themselves?\nKarleen Oberton: Yeah. I think we're substantially through them as we exit '24 and probably be a little bit into '25. But I think what we're having is as we increase production overall, getting more favorable absorption than what we had prior when manufacturing was really reduced because of the chip supply.\nAndrew Cooper: Okay. Great. I\u2019ll stop here. Thank you so much.\nKarleen Oberton: The facility integration is -- yes, the facility integration in the breast business specifically will go through at least the first half of \u201825.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Lou Lee with UBS. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Participant: Great. Thank you for taking my question. I think just a quick one on breast. I think you mentioned the pacement (ph) is pretty strong -- potential pacement is pretty strong in the quarter. I wonder if you can get like a specific number on the pacement? And then also, is it really back to the one-way, pre COVID one way?\nKarleen Oberton: Yeah. I don't think we've given specific numbers on gantries. Again, we've grown -- we have real confidence that the total gantries are going to grow year-over-year. We're not quite back to pre-pandemic levels, but we'll be at those levels in 2025.\nUnidentified Participant: [indiscernible] pacement, sorry.\nKarleen Oberton: I'm sorry, can you repeat that?\nUnidentified Participant: I'm sorry, yes. And any regional comment that you want to call out in the gantry pacement?\nKarleen Oberton: No, not specifically.\nOperator: And we will take our last question from Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.\nPuneet Souda: Hey. Thanks, Steve. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I'll just round it out I'll round it out with one question. On the skeletal, I just wanted to confirm -- when you look at the market for bone density measurement and fracture assessment, has anything changed there competitively in your view? Just wanted to confirm that and get a view about [indiscernible] pushouts that you're seeing in the quarter?\nStephen MacMillan: Yeah, we still feel great about the market and great about our products. This is truly a supplier [indiscernible] pickup on our smallest business, and we'll be through it within another quarter and right back to what we expect. And in the meantime, obviously, that the core businesses are all delivering very, very well, so that the total is still very strong. So \u2013 but yes, nothing different, Puneet, no concern about it.\nPuneet Souda: Okay. Super. Okay. Thank you.\nStephen MacMillan: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: This does conclude today's question-and-answer session. And this now concludes Hologic's third quarter fiscal 2024 earnings conference call. Have a good evening.",

            "name": "Karleen Oberton",
            "content": "Thank you Essex, and good afternoon, everyone. In my statements today, I will provide an overview of our revenue results, walk down our income statement showcasing strong performance, touch on certain key financial metrics, and finish with our guidance for the fourth quarter and full fiscal 2024. Our third quarter financial results were robust, once again exceeding our expectations on revenue and profitability, building on the momentum from the first half of the year. To recap high level results, total revenue came in at $1.11 billion, beating the midpoint of our prior guidance by $11 million. We delivered 3.1% revenue growth and organic growth of 5.8%, excluding COVID. In addition, non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.06, growing 14.0% and exceeding the high end of our prior guidance by $0.001. Before moving on to our franchise results, we want to highlight the continued strength of our balance sheet. In Q3, we generated over $400 million in cash from operating activities, ending the quarter with $2.4 billion on the balance sheet, deployed $100 million on share repurchases, and announced the acquisition of Endomagnetics. We continue to demonstrate that our strong cash balance, leverage ratio well below our target range, and ability to generate cash consistently provide us the flexibility to fund innovation and pull both levers of our capital allocation strategy, tuck-in M&A and share repurchases, at the same time. Moving forward, we still have significant firepower to continue to deploy capital diligently, as opportunities arise. Turning to our franchise results. In Diagnostics, third quarter revenue of $440.8 million grew 0.7%. Excluding COVID assay and related revenue, worldwide Diagnostics grew by 6.0%. Within Diagnostics, Molecular Diagnostics continues to contribute significantly, growing 10.5% excluding COVID. We continue to see underlying strength in BV CV/TV, which continues its outstanding growth trajectory and has become our second-largest assay globally. Additionally, as expected, non-COVID respiratory assay sales declined sequentially from Q2, in line with the flu season. However, year-over-year growth remains strong, highlighting the continued adoption of our four plex COVID, Flu A, Flu B, and RSV assay. And finally, Biotheranostics continues to be accretive to growth for our Molecular business. Rounding out Diagnostics, Cytology and Perinatal declined 2.9% globally, with U.S. declines partially offset by solid international growth, as Essex highlighted earlier. As a reminder, in fiscal Q3'23, customers built up cytology inventory levels in the U.S. due to third-party shipping constraints in Q2'23, leading to elevated sales in the prior year period. While the cytology business has largely returned to normal, year-over-year growth rates were impacted. Looking ahead, we expect flat to modest growth from the cytology business. Moving on to Breast Health. Total third quarter revenue of $385 million increased by 7.1%, or 8.2%, when excluding SSI. Within Breast Health, growth was primarily driven by Breast Imaging, with solid domestic and international results, contributing 7.2% and 12.1% growth, respectively, excluding SSI. Third quarter performance was driven largely by increased gantry shipments and robust Service revenue growth that continues to contribute meaningfully. Continuing next to Surgical. Third quarter revenue of $166.6 million increased 6.2%. Surgical growth continues to be fueled by MyoSure and the related Fluent Fluid Management System. Our Laparoscopy business, while smaller in dollars, grew significantly in the quarter and continues to progress nicely. Additionally, International continues to be a bright spot, growing just under 20% in the quarter. Finally, in our Skeletal business, third quarter revenue of $19 million declined 29.7% due to lower Horizon DXA shipments resulting from a temporary stop ship related to a non-conformance issue. We are working with our suppliers to resolve this situation and expect to resume shipments during the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Now, let's move on to the rest of the non-GAAP P&L for the third quarter. Gross margin was 61.1% for the quarter, a 30 basis point improvement from the prior year period, even though COVID assay revenue declines continue to be a headwind. Additionally, gross margin expanded 40 basis points sequentially from fiscal Q2 primarily driven by favorable product mix. Total operating expense of $302.8 million in the third quarter decreased by 3.5%. This decrease was driven primarily by elimination of expenses related to the divested SSI business. Operating margin was 31.2% for the third quarter. The year-over-year increase of 230 basis points was driven by top line growth, expanding gross margins, and lower operating expenses. Sequentially, as expected, operating margins expanded 80 basis points from Q2, largely from lower operating expenses and higher gross margin in Q3. Below operating income, other income, net, represented an expense of nearly $3 million in our fiscal third quarter. Interest income is lower due to lower cash balances from the significant share repurchases we have completed throughout the fiscal year. Additionally, interest expense is up due to higher interest rates. Finally, our tax rate in Q3 was 19.75% as expected. Now let's move on to our Non-GAAP financial guidance for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2024. For Q4 2024, we are expecting total revenue in the range of $970 million to $985 million, and EPS of $0.97 to $1.04. For the full year 2024, our guidance assumes revenue of $4.012 billion to $4.027 billion and EPS of $4.04 to $4.11. Unpacking this guidance, we lowered the midpoint of our prior revenue guidance by $5 million, which represents about a $20 million headwind related to the temporary Skeletal Health stop ship previously mentioned, partially offset by our strong performance in Q3 and the inclusion of an estimated $4 million to $5 million of revenue from Endomagnetics, now that we have closed the acquisition. With respect to foreign exchange, we are assuming Q4 will have a headwind of about $3 million. For the full year, we now expect a slight tailwind of about $3 million. Turning to our franchises. We expect Diagnostics, Breast Health, and Surgical to grow mid-single digits in Q4 and full year fiscal 2024, excluding the impact of COVID. As a reminder, fiscal \u201824 has four fewer selling days compared to fiscal \u201823, which we estimate to be a headwind of more than 100 basis points for the full year. Starting with Diagnostics. In Q4, we expect our Molecular Diagnostics business to drive high-single digit growth, excluding COVID, as customers continue to adopt and drive utilization of our broad Panther menu. In Cytology and Perinatal, we expect growth in the mid-single digits for the fourth quarter. Sequentially, however, we expect the business to perform flat to Q3. In Q4 of last year, sales dropped below typical ordering patterns due to inventory buildup in Q3'23. We expect Cytology and Perinatal comps to stabilize in fiscal year '25. Closing out on non-COVID Diagnostics, we expect blood revenue of approximately $6 million in Q4 and $20 million (ph) for the year. In terms of COVID revenue, we expect COVID assay sales to be about $7 million in Q4 \u201824, and about $70 million for the full year. COVID-related items are expected to be about $25 million in the fourth quarter and approximately $105 million for the full year. Moving on to Breast Health. We remain on pace to grow the business mid-single digits for the fourth quarter. We expect to see solid gantry placements in Q4, continuing the steady performance we have delivered year-to-date. The demand for our portfolio of products and services remains strong, and we have solid visibility into gantry orders. Further, our confidence in delivering more gantries than last year remains high. We are successfully managing resource availability among both our install teams and our customers, as customers balance the need to meet elevated demand for screening and staffing constraints. Finally, in Surgical, we anticipate Q4 revenue to grow mid-single digits. We expect the growth to continue to come from MyoSure, Fluent, and laparoscopy division \u2013 business. Moving next to margins. Our guidance continues to assume a cadence of improvement moving into Q4, for both gross margin and operating margin, we remain on pace to exit the fiscal year in the low 60s for gross margin. Our guidance also assumes Q4 operating margins in the low 30s, and we are on pace to finish fiscal '24 between 30 to 31%, which includes the stub period of Endomagnetics. Below operating income, we estimate fiscal \u201824 other income, net, to be an expense of approximately $8 million in Q4 and $11 million for the full year. Our guidance is based on an annual effective tax rate of approximately 19.75% and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately 238 million for the full year. To conclude, Q3 was another strong quarter for Hologic. We continue to deliver robust growth and quality earnings. As we approach the end of fiscal year 2024 and look ahead to 2025, we are excited by the performance across all our franchises and the additional strength provided by a pristine balance sheet. As always, our stakeholders can count on us to deliver while also advancing the state of women's health around the world. With that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions. Yeah. And just, Patrick, just to add a finer point to it. Of the $20 million headwind, about $16 million is related to the fourth quarter specifically. Yeah. I think we'd like to ground people in the pre-pandemic operating margins at 31.5%. And I think as you see, as we exit Q4, we'll be right in that range and really thinking about that we've added a lot of revenue growth drivers that have a lower operating margin profile than the legacy business. So feel really good about achieving that as we exit 24. For the full year, '24, we'll be a little bit below that, as we said in our prepared remarks, between 30 to 31. But I have good confidence as we look to '25, we will be squarely for the full year at those pre-pandemic levels. And just to walk through some of the components, again, as I mentioned, the recent acquisitions will have lower margin profiles. The international business has a lower margin profile, and we're still working through some of the higher supply chain costs, primarily related to chips, as well as we integrate certain facilities, we have double costs. We'll see those primarily work through over the course of \u201825. Yeah. So first of all, Tejas, I'll say that we have -- we're not giving guidance for 2025 at this point. We're still working through our budget cycle, and we'll be doing that in totality in the November call. What I would say at a high level when we think about earnings, yes, we want to grow earnings faster than revenue. So again, that 5% to 7% would lead you to the high single-digit, low double-digit earnings growth. And we do think about that as balance using the whole P&L, not just margin expansion, but share repurchase and potentially some favorability on the tax line as well. But again, we will be giving that full guidance on the November call. Yeah. I think that's a fair estimate of where it is. And I think we would -- I would be comfortable saying that it could be our largest assay someday. So to put it in perspective, there's still room for growth there. Yeah. I think as I talked about, we'll end the full year between 30 to 31, which would give you something higher than 31 in the fourth quarter. I would say -- from an annualized basis, I'd jump off the midpoint of the 30 to 31 and think that we're going to get back to probably that 31.5 range. But there is some seasonality to margins. And typically, Q1 is our lowest operating margin quarter. So I wouldn't like spring off of Q4 to a higher number in Q1. Yeah. Sure. So Anthony, on the Panther utilization on the new customers, we talked about over 55% are running two or more assays. But when we look at U.S. in total, that we look at over a third of our customers are running four or more assays. So I would kind of anchor into that 4 -- 4 to 6is the likely target range. That over a third at the end of \u201823, compares to just under 20% at the end of \u201819. So you can see that growth that we're able to achieve as we drive utilization on the Panthers that are out there. Yeah. I think as we look at our operations and supply chain and even more specifically, continue to leverage Costa Rica for manufacturing, especially as we acquire new companies and optimize their supply chain, we try to leverage those points to contribute to favorability on the tax rate. Yeah. Certainly, as we look at our cash flow generation with a very strong balance sheet and very competitive credit agreement. Our focus is on deploying that free cash flow as well as the cash that we've built on the balance sheet at this point in time. The priority continues to be tuck-in M&A, acquisitions that give us confidence in our ability to grow our revenue, hopefully accretive to our current growth rate. And then it would be share repurchase. As we've stated in our remarks at a minimum to manage dilution from our equity plans and then opportunistic as we see disconnects and valuation in the market. Yeah. In regards to innovation, certainly, we've talked about a next-generation gantry that really continues to focus on workflow, patient experience and image quality. Those are the key drivers of innovation in that space and certainly layer on AI. How can we help the radiologist in assessing risk within those images and again, assessing or helping improve workflow is the use of AI, not only in breast but also in genius digital cytology. Yeah. I don't think we're going to give any specifics on timing, I think likely as we look towards RSA would be a time that we would highlight that for certain of our customers and probably give a little more specifics on what we're expecting for 2025 and beyond. Yes. Sure. So as we've highlighted, we're doing some facility integration in our Breast Health business right now. From each of the acquisitions, they all have different profiles. Some makes sense to stand alone as they are and others do make sense to integrate and they're in various stages of integration. And as we always do, we always look at our supply chain, look at our network and continue to focus on opportunities for optimization. And I would say, over the next five years, I think we'll continue to realize those opportunities. Yeah. So I would say, it's more geared towards the stop ship on the skeletal versus the Endomag. Think about Endomag as very small revenue for only two months, but certainly stop ship on even a noncore franchise is going to have an impact on margins. Yeah. I think we're substantially through them as we exit '24 and probably be a little bit into '25. But I think what we're having is as we increase production overall, getting more favorable absorption than what we had prior when manufacturing was really reduced because of the chip supply. The facility integration is -- yes, the facility integration in the breast business specifically will go through at least the first half of \u201825. Yeah. I don't think we've given specific numbers on gantries. Again, we've grown -- we have real confidence that the total gantries are going to grow year-over-year. We're not quite back to pre-pandemic levels, but we'll be at those levels in 2025. I'm sorry, can you repeat that? No, not specifically."

            "name": "Essex Mitchell",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve. Overall, our third quarter performance speaks to the successful implementation of our growth strategy, building multiple durable growth drivers into our franchises around the world. Today, we'd like to quickly highlight three specific growth drivers from International Diagnostics and Surgical. These drivers are sometimes overlooked because of their strong market shares in the U.S., however we still have a great growth opportunity outside of the United States. That said, internationally molecular STI testing, cytology and MyoSure, all delivered nice growth in the quarter. This underscores the power of the sum of our parts, and reinforces our opportunity and ability to grow by expanding markets. Let's start with STI testing. The largest category in our global molecular diagnostics business. In the U.S., STI testing is our largest category and we have earned and maintained leadership for years. Internationally, we are still in the early days of leveraging our expanded Panther installed base. We have a sizeable opportunity to increase our share, not only in STI testing but across all categories where we offer testing. We have a long runway ahead of us as we continue to build the new markets we've entered. With several irons in the fire, we expect to layer in more contribution over time, driven by more assays and more volume on our Panther systems. The same can be said for cytology and cervical cancer screening. In some regions of the world, we are bringing liquid based pap tests to the market for the first time and subsequently growing the market. While overshadowed by the U.S. revenue, international cytology, like STI testing, adds meaningful revenue that moves the needle over time. Shifting to Surgical and MyoSure, while MyoSure is still growing strong in the U.S., the MyoSure international growth rate is even higher. This is possible because international markets are vastly underpenetrated, and demand remains high for our minimally invasive option for treating uterine polyps and fibroids. In many regions, we are the first and only minimally invasive alternative to a complete hysterectomy. And it's our belief that all women should have access to minimally invasive options. All-in, while it's clear that certain products across our portfolio are more established in the U.S., what is not as obvious is that there are meaningful market expansion opportunities for these same products internationally. As leaders in these areas and champions for women's health, we are well positioned to capitalize on this global growth opportunity. And finally, before turning the call over to Karleen, I'd like to provide more detail on Endomagnetics. As Steve mentioned, we are pleased to welcome the Endomag team to Hologic. 150 employees strong, and with seasoned management and R&D capabilities, the company has done an incredible job growing the business to what it has become today. That includes 500,000 plus women treated and adoption by over 1,300 hospitals in over 45 countries. Endomag products include Magseed markers for wireless lesion localization, Magtrace for lymphatic tracing, and Sentimag, a simple, easy-to-use handheld device to visualize both. The Endomag portfolio enables us to provide robust and differentiated offerings to meet demand in the growing interventional breast surgery market. From an investment perspective, the business directly aligns with our Breast Health franchise and has proven on-market products that are well accepted into clinical workflows. With our established, deep rooted sales channels we expect to amplify revenue growth well above our corporate average and also expect both margin and earnings accretion over time. Overall, we are excited to join forces and determined to go even further together. Now, I'll turn the call over to Karleen. Great. Yeah. So I'll start with Boulder. And so we're seeing great success expanding outside of the pediatric channel. I would say our fastest-growing area is actually in thoracic with the reveal product. So we're seeing nice, it's an open product. We're getting to new customers, really honing in and focusing similar to our strategies that we've utilized with gynecology, where we focus on the specialty, really understand our differentiated position with the product and expand from there. So we feel really good about the success thus far with Boulder and still quite a bit of meat on the bone left, I would say, with pediatrics as we look to focus there moving forward. With regard to Endomag, very early days. I would say, we just closed, I feel really great about that team, excited to have them as part of the Hologic family and know that we'll do great things together. As far as feedback from customers don't have anything to comment on that right now, but feel really good about the prospects of this business, especially with the strong channel and relationships that we have today. Yes. This is Essex. I'll jump in on the BioZorb question. So Endomag and BioZorb are completely unrelated from each other, number one. But number two, I would say, is that the BioZorb recall was more of an administrative recall where we needed to update our PI or language in our insert. So we are still selling our product, feel great about it and are working through that. With regard to facility integration, I don't know if Karleen wants to jump on that?"
        },
        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Stephen MacMillan",
            "content": "Thank you, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to discuss our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Total revenue for Q3 was $1.01 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.06, both again above the high-end of our guidance. Importantly, we are excited that with COVID now mostly in the rear view mirror, our reported revenue has returned to growth. Our strong performance goes beyond the top line and shines throughout the P&L. For the quarter, we delivered a solid 31.2% operating margin and deployed $100 million during the quarter to repurchase 1.4 million shares. All-in, the $1.06 in EPS translates to 14% growth on the bottom-line, a very strong result and also very encouraging as we flip the script now to reported revenue and EPS growth again. Looking back to the start of our fiscal year, we knew there were still certain questions on some investors' minds about the true strength and durability of our underlying business. These were questions that surfaced as we exited a period of uncertainty created by the pandemic, followed by the global chip shortage. While we and many long-term investors understood the power and potential of our transformed, much stronger business, we acknowledged that these unanswered questions created barriers for some of those newer to Hologic. As usual, rather than rely on words, we knew it would be our performance that would emphatically answer these questions and clearly demonstrate that we are indeed a bigger, faster, stronger company than before the pandemic. Our third quarter performance should make this very clear. In Q3, we bent the top-line curve to green after eleven quarters of COVID driven declines. Our top line reported revenue returned to growth at 3.1% versus last year. Organic ex-COVID we delivered healthy 5.8% growth and we achieved these strong results on top of exceptionally strong 18.4% organic ex-COVID growth last year. Turning to our themes for today. First, we would like to recap our performance since the start of the fiscal year by answering five key questions which were on many investors' minds. Second, we'll pass the call over to Essex, who will highlight certain overlooked elements of our broad-based international growth, as well as provide an update on M&A activities. On to our first theme. The top five questions which have been out there: One, will Panther utilization continue to grow? Two, will Breast Health return to full strength and maintain market leadership? Three, will Hologic return to delivering industry-leading 30% plus operating margins? Four, with a $2.4 billion dollar cash position, will Hologic be successful in deploying capital? And finally five, can Hologic maintain its cervical cancer screening leadership if USPSTF issues an adverse cervical cancer screening guideline? The short answer to all five is, without a doubt, yes. We will continue to thrive. From here, we will take each question in order. First, our molecular diagnostics business continues to deliver and is so much bigger and stronger than it was prior to the pandemic. Our global installed base of Panthers now exceeds 3,300 and is rock solid. More importantly, our customers continue to praise and utilize our platform. Panther's superior workflow, automation, ease of use, and constantly expanding menu continues to drive demand and differentiate us in a competitive environment. In quite simple terms, revenue per Panther and number of assays run per Panther continue to grow, with the simple metric being our Molecular Diagnostics growth rate. In Q3, our molecular business excluding COVID grew 10.5%, on top of 12.9% growth in the prior year period. We've now delivered high-single to double-digit performance in 13 of the last 15 quarters. Quarter-after-quarter, year-over-year, we continue to deliver by expanding utilization, and our outlook remains bright. Second, our breast health results continue to demonstrate a profound strength in breast cancer screening. Our gantry business is well on pace to fully recover from the chip shortage, and we continue to maintain our leadership position. Our supply chain is much improved and now fortified from successfully navigating the chip shortage experience. Over a decade from the initial launch of our breakthrough 3D mammography, customers still view Hologic as leaders in performance, including image quality and scan time, leaders in service, and leaders in customer satisfaction. Letting the numbers speak for themselves, in Q3, we delivered 7.1% growth in Breast Health, on top of 27.5% growth in the prior year period. The business is more diverse than ever, and continuing to add in even more recurring revenue with our Endomagnetics acquisition. Third, operating margins. As Karleen will share in more detail later, we delivered a 31.2% operating margin in our third quarter, a 230 basis point improvement from the prior year period, and an 80 basis point improvement sequentially. At the highest level, we are now back to delivering pre-COVID margins, even with our International business being over 40% larger than it was in 2019. Consistent with our expectations, we recaptured our strong sector margin profile by maintaining focus on operational efficiency and moving past the amortization of higher priced chips purchased during the chip shortage. Fourth, on capital deployment, our balance sheet and cash flow remain incredibly robust. As announced last week, we recently closed the Endomagnetics acquisition, a transaction that we view as straight down the fairway in terms of execution within our broader M&A strategy. Overall, the deal is a prudent investment of capital that we expect to add revenue, margin and EPS accretion over time. Together, we have an incredible opportunity to improve interventional breast care for women. On top of closing the Endomag deal, we continue to demonstrate that we are willing to bet on ourselves and repurchase shares. As a baseline, we are looking to offset dilution from our internal share plans. And from there, with our strong cash position, we look to layer on additional share repurchases. Fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased 10.5 million shares for $750 million. We plan to continue on our capital allocation path and fully intend for our deployment strategy to include both M&A and share repurchases. And finally, before turning the call over to Essex, USPSTF. As we've done for nearly 30 years in cervical cancer screening, no matter the direction the USPSTF may take for its cervical cancer guidelines, we will navigate the landscape and remain strong. Overall, we achieved our strong results by maintaining our long term focus and commitment to women's health. As we shared on our Q2 call, the strength of Hologic lies in the sum of our parts. We expect our results to continue to answer the call, and speak for themselves while we continue to demonstrate our durable strength quarter-after-quarter, year-over-year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Essex to share insight on international growth drivers and more on Endomagnetics. You nailed it, Patrick. It's probably a little alarming because of the skeletal piece, but the three core businesses are all going great, and it is completely a reflection of that. And we just had a little hiccup with the supplier issue in our Skeletal business. It is our non-core, but for Diagnostics, Breast Health, Surgical, we are feeling really, really good. Great. We'll kick that right to Essex to handle. Yeah, still lower on the placements. Clearly, this chapter of our growth, Jack, is expanding the utilization for Panther, but we are still seeing a modestly moving up, which we consider to be good. But yeah, not back at that pre-COVID level. Okay. Operator, next question. It could potentially be a little bit of a -- it won't be lost revenue. I think we feel pretty good. There will be a couple of tiny ones. But overall, I think we feel pretty good. So it might be a modest tailwind for next year, but we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves. But we're fixing it and feel very good. We'll be back in place by the beginning of '25. Let me take the first part of that. The first part is, we are not seeing any shift in the market in terms of cytology usage, Anthony. It is -- really it's more because we changed a third-party vendor last year, it kind of made a little bit of lumpiness between the Q2 to Q3 last year comparisons, but the underlying is very consistent. And the initial stages on our digital cytology, which is further ahead in Europe, are looking very good, and we're in the early stages of some very positive consumer -- or I'm sorry, customer acceptance of that in the United States. So I think we continue to feel good about our cytology business. I'll pass it On the Panther utilization, we'll take... Great. Thanks. Yeah. We're seeing some nice acceptance to our digital cytology. One of the challenges outside the United States is not as many cytologists around. And so the ability to help on the workflow is a big win and so rolling out our digital cytology, the genius cytology there is good. And we continue to work with guidelines. I think the hidden piece that's been missed for everything that we did in the pandemic to provide the COVID test, is we establish much stronger relationships across the world with ministries of health and everything else. And we're having more dialogues really that's going to benefit so many of our businesses, including our surgical businesses, our breast interventional business and really just shifting guidelines. And so there's more discussions. Germany has gone to a co-testing model in cytology and HPV over the last few years that we're benefiting from and working those angles really country by country. Yeah. I think we continue to feel really, really good that most of the screening is asymptomatic. It's standard testing that the economics are still going to work very well for the labs. And so I think we love our position. And there's always going to be people punching around on the edges that will help expand the market probably as well, but we feel really good about where we're going. Yeah. Probably not quite ready to give individual line forecast for 2025, but I think we feel good overall. As any given year, any given quarter, any given business, maybe slightly above, slightly below, but I think we'd like where we're headed. So we'll give you more of that detail, Casey, when we guide in November. Thank you. We do have good line of sight. We're not expect it to go out far into Q1 of '25. So you should be able to count on it again. We'll guide by that point, but we fully expect to be back in the market by then. Sure. I think on the M&A front, we obviously were very pleased we closed the Endomag deal last week. We continue to look at other deals in that size a little bit bigger or whatever. But again, you can only make them when they're available. As we said last quarter, we'd love to do kind of one Endomag every quarter. It doesn't always work out that way. So we're in this great position of being able to be disciplined buyers as we continue to watch things shake out and also being able to redeploy on our own cash by buying back our own shares along the way. So it's not an either/or given the incredible cash position we have. So we like where we are on that. Yeah. We're seeing steady adoption of the Fusion sidecar, which is [indiscernible] it really opens up the menu. We're focusing on customer by customer. What we're seeing is quarter-over-quarter, more customers adopting the Fusion as we go along. It doesn't necessarily mean every Panther needs a fusion. And in fact, it will probably end up being, I don't know, maybe even a third of our total Panthers, even if that \u2013 what it really comes down to is does each customer have the capability. And so that's been our big focal point, and we're seeing good adoption and steady growth. The way to think about it, too, is with that, I think our margins are still looking really, really good. Yeah, we still feel great about the market and great about our products. This is truly a supplier [indiscernible] pickup on our smallest business, and we'll be through it within another quarter and right back to what we expect. And in the meantime, obviously, that the core businesses are all delivering very, very well, so that the total is still very strong. So \u2013 but yes, nothing different, Puneet, no concern about it. All right. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Hologic Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Justin, and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Ryan Simon, Vice President, Investor Relations, to begin the call. \nRyan Simon: Thank you, Justin. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Hologic's Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer; and Essex Mitchell, our Chief Operating Officer.  \n Our second quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We will also post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them as well as an updated corporate presentation and a replay of this call will be available on our website for the next 30 days.  \n Before we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements we make today will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the safe harbor statement included in our earnings release and SEC filings. Also during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Two of these non-GAAP measures are: one, organic revenue, which we define as revenue excluding divested businesses and revenue from acquired businesses owned by Hologic for less than 1 year; and two, organic revenue, excluding COVID-19, which further excludes COVID-19 assay revenue, revenue related to COVID-19 and sales from discontinued products in Diagnostics.  \n Finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis and revenue growth rates will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted. \n Now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO. \nStephen MacMillan: Thank you, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to discuss our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. For the quarter, total revenue was $1.02 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.03. Both revenue and EPS came in above the high end of our guidance, reflecting another strong quarter.  \n Similar to Q1, it is again important to view our Q2 performance in proper perspective. As we shared on our Q1 earnings call in February, throughout 2024, we faced double-digit comps, massive comps in the first half and still very strong comps in the second. As a reminder, in Q2 of last year, organic Molecular Diagnostics ex COVID posted growth of nearly 25%. And both Surgical and Breast Health posted phenomenal growth of over 25%. This year, in Q2, on top of the high growth rates from a year ago, we grew our Molecular Diagnostics business, ex COVID at 10.7%. Our surgical business, 7.4%; and our Breast Health business 1%, excluding the divested SSI business, a solid result given the elevated gantry placements in Q2 a year ago.  \n We also delivered operating margins of 30.4% in Q2, improving 190 basis points sequentially from Q1 and setting us up nicely to approach 31% for the full fiscal year. Now past the halfway point of fiscal '24, we believe we are in an excellent position to achieve our full year goals.  \n Before moving on to our themes for today, our fiscal second quarter marks the fourth anniversary of when the COVID virus changed the world. When COVID initially surged, we had 3 goals: one, ensure that we take care of our employees; two, make a huge difference in the world with our Panther system and COVID testing. And three, emerge as a bigger, stronger, faster growing company in a post-pandemic world.  \n Fast forward to today, as you can see from our results, we have delivered against these 3 goals, and we're aiming for more. Not only did we achieve our primary objectives, we also successfully managed to strengthen all of our franchises, both in the U.S. and internationally, remain innovative and disciplined in executing our growth strategies and build a fortress balance sheet to facilitate future growth. \n On top of these achievements, we continue to elevate our already high employee engagement scores and all through complicated macro challenges. That said, we are never satisfied and firmly believe the best is still ahead. As we look further out beyond the horizon, we see significant potential to continue to innovate and unlock growth opportunities for years to come.  \n Now on to our 3 themes for today. First, our core franchises Diagnostics, Breast Health and Surgical continued to showcase the benefits of our diverse portfolio. As planned, we continue to yield robust growth and durability because we benefit from being both Diagnostics and Medtech. Second, our international business quietly continues to drive strong top line growth. demonstrating our ability to capture potential growth opportunities and turn them into reality. And third, our strong balance sheet and disciplined approach to capital allocation, empower us to fortify our foundation as we've done this week with the announcement of the Endomagnetics acquisition. We have the ability to build on our strength with significant operational flexibility, which allows us multiple levers to deliver top and bottom line performance.  \n Turning to our first theme. Sometimes overlooked and misunderstood -- the strength of our business comes from the sum of our parts. We are a unique collection of Diagnostics and Medtech businesses with many more growth drivers than meets the eye. Each business has multiple growth drivers with tremendous runway ahead. To the outside, it may be unclear how we can keep driving growth with the strong market shares we have. In reality, our product and service diversity creates enduring strength as we advance forward and notch incremental wins.  \n Over time, these wins collectively deliver meaningful and durable growth across multiple franchises and multiple geographies. While we know we don't fit neatly into either diagnostics or medical device, we do fit neatly into the world of improving women's health. Our unique set of businesses equips us to deliver results and positively impact more and more women regardless of external macro challenges. Our strong growth over the past 4 years reflects a combination of multiple durable growth drivers intentionally built into each of our businesses.  \n The beauty here is that over time and in any given quarter, our growth drivers can change and morph. What we've done is create multiphase extended and stacked growth cycles. The net result is our ability to consistently deliver on a consolidated basis over time. A few examples to highlight from across our business. In our second quarter, worldwide diagnostics growth ex COVID of 9.8% was again primarily driven by our Molecular Diagnostics business.  \n In Molecular Diagnostics, over the last few years, we've dramatically expanded both our installed base and menu, nearly doubling our installed base from 1,700 Panthers to over 3,200 during the pandemic and going from 4 FDA-approved assays to over 20. Our next phase of growth is about menu adoption and driving more volume by focusing largely on existing customers while adding more geographies. At the same time, we continue to broaden our menu. As a result, we create years of growth ahead as we extend our commercial reach and continue to add products to our portfolio.  \n In the second quarter, U.S. Molecular Diagnostics delivered double-digit growth, led by ongoing adoption of BV/CV/TV on the Panther, strong contributions from our respiratory suite of assays on the fusion as well as continued growth from Biotheranostics. Each of these are newer products to our portfolio, underscoring the power of our extended reach, layering on top of the strong U.S. molecular performance, international cytology was also accretive to worldwide diagnostics growth. Outside the U.S., diagnostics growth was driven primarily by multi-country adoption of our innovative Genius AI digital psychology in the quarter.  \n As a reminder, digital cytology was only recently approved in the U.S. earlier this year. meaning the U.S. opportunity is still ahead.  \n In Breast Health, we've expanded our product offering from imaging to cover the continuum of breast cancer care, including biopsy and surgery. In the second quarter, on a worldwide basis, the gantry and service businesses performed well against very strong comps from the prior year period. Meanwhile, outside the U.S, our emerging interventional breast business grew double digits in Q2, accretive to the worldwide growth rate.  \n And finally, in Surgical. Once essentially only a U.S. 2 product business with NovaSure and MyoSure, we now have Fluent, Accesa and Bolder. And internationally, we are just getting started with both the core business and new product lines. In Q2, worldwide growth of 7.4% was very strong against the high prior year comp. Our performance was driven in large part by very strong double-digit growth in our International Surgical business, which in Q2 is a reflection of continued market penetration as well as our go-direct strategy in the Nordics.  \n All in, we are a powerful women's health composite. As we extend our reach globally, we expect to grow even in product categories and territories that may on their surface appear to be mature and well penetrated.  \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Essex to discuss our final 2 themes for today. \nEssex Mitchell: Thank you, Steve. As previewed by Steve's discussion of our diverse and durable growth drivers, our strong international growth is a direct result of identifying and capturing underpenetrated market opportunities with steady execution. As a reminder, our international business is over 40% larger than it was in 2019. We are in more territory and more direct than ever before. That said, big picture, we are still in the early days of our international opportunities. Our early success is driven largely by 2 approaches: One, going direct; and two, entering markets where we elevate the standard of care. \n For example, on the latter, while the ThinPrep Pap test, 2D and even 3D mammo and procedures like NovaSure and MyoSure are widely accepted as standard of care in the U.S., internationally, this is unfortunately not yet the case. Many parts of the world even those considered developed and industrialized, still have the opportunity to elevate their screening, diagnosis and treatment of women to gold standards. These women deserve it, and Hologic is poised to realize this potential. Acceptability to women's health options around the world remains a priority and a great opportunity for Hologic. This is why our work with the Hologic Global Women's Health Index and our worldwide partnership with the Women's Tennis Association to elevate women's health, education and access are critically important.  \n Reinforcing our position, the index clearly shows that we are only scratching the surface of the global opportunity, and this holds true even in Europe, with other large market geographies like Asia Pacific being further out on the time horizon. From our perspective, as leading champions for women's health, we believe there is still significant market adoption opportunity ahead of us. And this adoption will not happen overnight, we expect adoption to grow over time, at different paces around the world as more and more governments prioritize women's health.  \n And for our final theme today, we'd like to underscore the importance of our strong balance sheet and recap our capital allocation priorities. With over $2 billion in cash and strong cash flow we have the capacity to fund key in-house initiatives and also deploy cash towards both M&A and share repurchases. Regarding capital allocation, our strategy remains the same. We are focused on tuck-in opportunities for our 3 core franchises. And as we have stated in the past, we have a strong preference for any potential deal to have a clear line of sight to accretion on both top and bottom line, if not immediately, the sooner, the better.  \n Our business development teams across each of our franchises are consistently building and reviewing opportunities in their respective pipeline. We view our ability to shop across multiple aisles as a strength as we continue to grow into an even greater performing composite than we are today. The ability to shop in multiple aisles also creates the flexibility to maneuver potentially unfavorable valuations in one aisle versus another.  \n Overall, a blend of adding in-house developed and external innovation across our strong fan franchises is an important part of our growth strategy. Leading into our strategy, on Monday, we announced our agreement to acquire Endo-Magnetics LTD -- a provider of breast cancer surgery technologies for approximately $310 million. Endo-Mag's portfolio of innovative breast surgery localization and lymphatic tracing products complements and diversifies our expanding interventional breast business. We are excited for the potential to join forces, amplify growth and better serve patients around the world. In calendar 2023, Endomag generated approximately $35 million of revenue, and we believe our combined global reach and breadth of interventional options will accelerate growth in this exciting space.  \n At this point, we are still early and do not have a definitive time line on closing the transaction, though we estimate to close in the second half of calendar year. Before I turn the call over to Karleen, let me conclude by saying we are proud of our strong Q2 results that build on our Q1 performance. All said, we are in a solid position to carry our success into Q3 and Q4. \nKarleen Oberton: Thank you, Essex, and good afternoon, everyone. In my statements today, I will provide an overview of our revenue results, walk down our income statement showcasing strong performance, touch on a few other key financial metrics and finish with our guidance for the third quarter and full fiscal 2024.  \n As highlighted, our second quarter financial results were very strong. exceeding our expectations on revenue and profitability. Q2 was a continuation of our momentum from Q1. Total revenue came in at $1.018 billion, beating the midpoint of our guidance by $18 million. We delivered organic growth of 4.9%, excluding COVID, on top of a challenging double-digit comp from the prior year.  \n In addition, non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.03, which exceeded the high end of our guidance by $0.03. Before moving on to our franchise results,  we want to highlight the continued strength of our balance sheet. In Q2, we generated over $290 million in cash from operating activities and ended the quarter with nearly $2.2 billion on the balance sheet. Our strong cash balance leverage ratio well below our target range and ability to consistently generate strong cash flow provide us the flexibility to fund innovation and execute our capital allocation strategy.  \n We have significant firepower to continue to deploy capital as opportunities arise.  \n Turning to our franchise results. In Diagnostics, second quarter revenue of $450.1 million declined 3.2%. Excluding COVID assay and related revenue, worldwide Diagnostics grew by 9.8%. Within Diagnostics, Molecular Diagnostics continues to contribute significantly, growing 10.7% excluding COVID. We continue to see underlying strength in BV/CV/TV, which continues its outstanding growth trajectory. BV/CV/TV is tracking to become our second largest assay globally. With very little international revenue as we have focused primarily on the U.S. market.  \n Additionally, as expected, non-COVID respiratory assay sales remained solid as the flu season continued into our second quarter. Growth was a combination of more volume year-over-year across our respiratory menu plus ASP lift from elevated contribution from our COVID, Flu A, Flu B and RSV 4-Plex assay. Finally, Biotheranostics remains a strong pillar of growth for our base molecular business. Rounding out Diagnostics, Psychology and perinatal grew 7.9% globally, primarily fueled by double-digit growth internationally as well as impact from the prior year comp. As a reminder, Q2 last year was adversely impacted by supply constraint issues related to a third-party logistics partner. Level set growth in the second quarter is above our long-term expectations for this business.  \n Moving on to Breast Health. Total second quarter revenue of $384.6 million decreased 0.3%, but grew 1% when excluding SSI. As a reminder, Q1 '24 resulted in an elevated growth rate assisted by lapping soft prior year performance due to supply constraints in Q1 '23. The opposite is true for Q2 '24, where we faced significant prior year comps. \n In Q2 of last year, we placed an elevated number of gantries as semiconductor chip supply and visibility improved. For the remainder of the year, we expect growth rates in the gantry business to normalize. Within Breast Health, growth was driven primarily by our international interventional mix. This highlights the diversity of growth drivers Steve and Essex commented on. And the fact that growth drivers across our business and within our divisions can change and morph over time.  \n Continuing next to Surgical. Second quarter revenue of $156 million increased 7.4%. Surgical growth continues to be fueled by MyoSure in the related Fluent fluid management system. As anticipated, NovaSure continues to be a headwind to growth as we lapped the prior year NovaSure V5 ASP lift. \n And finally, in our Skeletal business, Second quarter revenue of $27.1 million declined 14.3% from lower capital placements and upgrades. Now let's move on to the rest of the non-GAAP P&L for the second quarter. Gross margin was 60.7% for the quarter and in line with expectations. The decline of 160 basis points from the prior year was anticipated and primarily driven by lower COVID sales compared to the prior year period. As a reminder, we expect gross margin to improve as we work past the amortization of previously procured higher-priced semiconductor chips. Total operating expense of $307.6 million in the second quarter decreased by 3%. This decrease was primarily driven by elimination of expenses related to the divested SSI business. As Steve mentioned, the operating margin was 30.4% for the second quarter. The year-over-year decline of 90 basis points was driven primarily from lower COVID sales. \n Sequentially, as expected, operating margins expanded 190 basis points from Q1 largely from lower operating expenses in Q2, a strong result for the quarter. Below operating income, other income net represented a loss of nearly $6 million in our first -- in our fiscal second quarter. As expected, interest income is lower due to lower cash balances from the significant share repurchases completed earlier in the fiscal year.\n Additionally, interest expense is up due to lower proceeds from our interest rate swaps.  \n Finally, our tax rate in Q2 was 19.75% as expected. \n Now let's move on to our non-GAAP financial guidance for the third quarter and full year fiscal 2024. For Q3 2024, we are expecting total revenue in the range of $992.5 million to $1007.5 million. and EPS of $0.98 to $1.05. For the full year 2024, our guidance assumes revenue of $4 billion to $4.05 billion. and EPS of $4.02 to $4.12.  \n With respect to foreign exchange, we expect the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar to create a significant headwind in the second half of the year. For Q3, we are assuming FX headwind of about $3 million. For the full year, we now expect a slight tailwind of about $2 million. All in, this represents about a $2 million -- a $10 million impact to our prior guidance. And as a reminder, prior guidance assumed a $12 million tailwind for the full year.  \n Turning to our franchises. We want to reiterate that we expect each to grow at least 5% to 7% in our fiscal 2024, excluding the impact of COVID. While we have navigated the most challenging comps from fiscal '23, we still have strong double-digit comps across the board to close out fiscal '24. Starting with Diagnostics. We expect our Molecular Diagnostics business to drive high single-digit growth, excluding COVID as customers continue to adopt and drive utilization of our expanded menu.  \n In cytology and perinatal, however, we expect minimal growth in Q3. In Q3 of last year, customers built inventory as a result of the third-party shipping constraints experienced in Q2 of '23, resulting in slightly elevated sales. We expect to see more normalized comps for our cytology and perinatal business in fiscal year '25.  \n Closing out on non-COVID diagnostics, we expect blood revenue of approximately $7 million in Q3 and $28 million for the full year. In terms of COVID revenue, we expect COVID assay sales to be about $5 million to $10 million in Q3 '24 and about $60 million to $65 million for the full year. COVID-related items are expected to be about $25 million in the third quarter and approximately $105 million for the full year.  \n Moving on to Breast Health. We remain on pace to grow the business within the 5% to 7% range for the year. As a reminder, we closed out fiscal '23 with 3 straight quarters of 25% plus growth rates. We expect steady performance in Breast Health in the back half of the year as the business continues to improve sequentially. The demand for our portfolio of products and service remains strong. and we continue to have excellent visibility into gantry orders.  \n Further, our confidence in delivering more gantries than last year remains high. We continue to successfully manage resource availability among both our install teams and our customers, as customers balance the need to meet elevated demand for screening and staffing constraints.  \n Finally, in Surgical, we anticipate our full year fiscal 2024 revenue growth to be at the high end of our 5% to 7% long-term target. The growth will continue to come from MyoSure Fluent as well as both Accessa and Bolder.  \n Moving next to margins. We reiterate that our guidance assumes the cadence of improvement throughout fiscal '24 for both gross margin and operating margin. For gross margin, we anticipate Q3 will improve sequentially from Q2 as we continue to work through our higher cost chips in Breast Health. Remain on pace to exit the fiscal year in the low 60s. Our guidance also assumes Q3 operating margins in the low 30s, and we remain on pace to finish fiscal '24, approaching 31%. Below operating income, we estimate fiscal '24 other income net to be an expense of approximately $10 million in Q3 and an expense between $30 million and $40 million for the full year.  \n Our guidance is based on an annual effective tax rate of approximately 19.75%, and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately $238 million for the full year. To conclude, Q2 was another strong quarter and sets us up nicely for the second half of the year. As always, we remain focused on advancing women's health around the world while delivering on our promises and commitments to our shareholders, employees, customers and patients. With that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. \nPatrick Donnelly: Steve, maybe one on the Diagnostics, particularly the molecular DXP continues to put up pretty good numbers in spite of obviously some tough comps, pretty competitive environment, too. Can you just to back that a little bit and just talk about what you're seeing in the market? Again, you called out obviously a few assays that are doing well. But just curious the key drivers of the strength there and the durability as you look forward and how you think about that franchise over the next few quarters? \nStephen MacMillan: Yes, Patrick, I really call it. It's the dividend and reward for coming to the country and the world's rescue when they needed a stern COVID. And as you well know, we placed a ton of Panthers, almost doubled our worldwide placements. And the big question all through that time and through those next few years was, yes, what's going to happen to those Panthers on the back end. \n And what we said is just keep watching, because I think what we feel great about is in a labor-constrained world, our Panther and the workflow automation, combined with the incredible menu that we have the tight footprint on Panther. And then we've added the Fusion sidecar that these things are just incredible workhorses that really are getting the adoption. And I think you start to -- when you put a double-digit number on top of a 25% number from last year, what we're really just seeing is more customers putting more menu on their Panthers. And I think it's -- the proof is what we've been saying for years and hopefully, it's starting to become evident in the results. \nPatrick Donnelly: That's helpful. I appreciate it. And then maybe just on the capital allocation side, that remains focus obviously you guys announced the recent deal. Can you just talk about the priority? You have the larger repo. I think that last quarter, a smaller deal, a little bit of dilution. How do you think about the priorities here in terms of the balance sheet? And how actively be on the M&A side post that deal? Just how large your thinking would be helpful. \nStephen MacMillan: Yes, Pat, let's try to put this into context. We were talking as a team about this the other day and said, if we can line up the perfect world, we'd love to do like one Endomag every quarter. right? $300 million deal, bring in some additional revenue products that drop in that we know what to do and just kind of keep phasing those along and then maybe a little bit of a buyback here or there. The real world doesn't work nearly as linear. But that's what we would like to be doing is those size deals on a fairly regular basis. \n Because they don't always pop up from time to time, it is where we'll jump in and do some buybacks, and we're comfortable amassing the cash because there might be a year where we can do a number of these like we did at one point during COVID when we picked up Biotheranostics, Fluent, Accesa, Diagenode, these things that have all been very good for us. So no real change. We think the Endomagnetics deal is right down the fairway, hopefully, exactly what anybody would expect from us and what we've been signaling and if we can find more of those, that'd be great. \n With that, I'll kick it to Karleen. \nKarleen Oberton: Yes. I would just emphasize, Patrick, that the strength of our balance sheet as well as our ongoing cash flow generation allows us significant flexibility to do things like Endomag and the share repurchase on an ongoing and regular basis. So for years to come as we look at our financial projections over the coming years, so we have a lot of flexibility and strength. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. \nJack Meehan: I wanted to -- can take the eagle's questions off-line. For now, I wanted to focus on the Breast Health business pick up where we just left off. I was wondering Essex talked a little bit about the time line to close Endomagnetics. Is there any commentary you can share just around the valuation for the deal in context of like what your expectations are in terms of the growth rate of this business maybe more broadly, just how it fits with the existing portfolio. \nKarleen Oberton: Yes. Well, I think we think it fits really nicely with our existing interventional portfolio. And I think that's 1 of the values that we'll bring is that currently Endomag uses a mix of direct and distributors, and we obviously have a significant direct sales force in the U.S. that I think will be a differentiator for us with that asset in our hands. \nJack Meehan: And then any comments you can share around like the growth rate you're expecting for this business? \nKarleen Oberton: Yes. I would just say, Jack, we would expect it to be accretive certainly to the division's growth rate. \nStephen MacMillan: Sorry. I'm sorry, go ahead, Justin. \nOperator: Oh, I'm sorry. I was just going to say our next question is from Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley. \nUnknown Analyst: This is Yuko on the call for Tejas. I have one question on the recent breast cancer screening update. If USPSTF recommends annual mammal screening them, what does that do from a physician adoption standpoint, given ACS is already there? And then from a quantitative standpoint, how much of an uplift would annual testing represent to your Breast Health business? \nStephen MacMillan: Yes. As you saw, they're really kind of still in the biannual world and we don't think the USPSTF guidelines changed much. Recall that our Breast Health is really a screening business where it's a capital sale and less volume dependent. But we really don't see much of an impact either way, just as when the guidelines shifted \"negatively\" a few years back, I didn't see a downturn there and don't see a big shift now. \n We do think the guidelines are a step forward for women. Unless you're a woman over 74 where they still haven't gone far enough. \nUnknown Analyst: Got it. That was helpful. And then another question on USPSTF. If they were to move to an HPV primary what would a potential trial design look like to establish primary HPV delay claim on your existing optima test? And what would the time line be to run such trial? Is there a possibility of using real-world data? Or would you need a prospective trial? \nStephen MacMillan: We are very focused on maintaining co-testing as the gold standard. If anything, what we're seeing is a modest uptick in cervical cancer in women in the United States that really started when the intervals went from to 3 to 5 years back almost 10 years ago and believe absolutely the co-testing is the right way to go. That continues to be -- our base is based on the scientific facts. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore. \nUnknown Analyst: This is Kevin on for Vijay. Congrats on the quarter, 5% on top of a tough comp last year is impressive. Just on your organic revenue guide range, it looks like it's tightening versus being raised, given performance in the quarter, why not raise guidance? and was this quarter performance above your internal expectations? \nKarleen Oberton: Yes. I would just say the impact on the full year guidance is primarily related to currency, if you actually look at the midpoint of this guide versus our prior guide on a constant currency basis, it's up slightly. So we really view the performance in this quarter a lot of to tighten the range as you indicated really hone in and delivering within that range. \nStephen MacMillan: No need to get too far ahead of ourselves. Great. \nOperator: We'll take a question from Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. \nPuneet Souda: Steve First one, if I could touch on the Genius digital cytology system. I mean you've had that in the U.S. market for -- correct me, for a quarter or so. Just, can you provide a feedback on sort of what are you hearing from the early folks in the field? And do you expect the international adoption of this sort of playing out similarly within the U.S.? And are you hearing anything in terms of the pushback in terms of the overall throughput of the system? \nKarleen Oberton: Yes. Let me kick off in that. Yes, it was just recently approved in the U.S., and I would say that we're really partnering with our lab customers on implementing and integrating into the workflow, so that's what we're focused on really more of a successful integration into the lab workflow at this point. \n So minimal contribution in '24 from the U.S. approval. But I think the feedback here, early days, there's a lot of excitement of what this can do in what we've talked about in a labor-constrained environment. And we think those will be really well received. \nPuneet Souda: Got it. And a broader question maybe for Steve. I mean when you look at the overall competitive landscape, Steve, there's another larger peer who's in the point-of-care testing side, but they pointed out 40% growth in [Strep A] and women's health -- and I know sort of their positioning is different in the market, but just wondering sort of how you're seeing the share shift. We're also seeing that one of the larger peers that's in the reference lab side, they still don't have RSV in the market for their product. So just trying to understand sort of where the opportunity set for Hologic continues to be the most strongest and where you think the share opportunities will be -- will continue to be the sort of the strongest going forward? \nStephen MacMillan: Yes. It's funny in so many ways, we don't focus always as much probably on share as we do on just building our business for our customers and growing the categories. So I think what we continue to feel great about is we've got, as you know, more respiratory menu than we've ever had. We've got the Fusion sidecars, so we're building a respiratory business. We're not competing in the point of care business. We are very strong in our reference labs in the hospital systems, the public health labs and just really focused on delivering for those customers. \n And we believe we've got both an economic and workflow advantage as well as, frankly, the sensitivity specificity of a lot of our assays. So continue to feel very good about the growth rates there. And at the end of the day, these are big markets, and there will be, I think, several companies going up and others that will be shared donors in the equation. \nOperator: And moving on to Casey Woodring with JPMorgan. \nCasey Woodring: Great. So just now that we're halfway through the fiscal year, looking at the top line guidance above the LRP range on an ex COVID and ex selling day basis after the strong quarter, particularly in Diagnostics and Surgical. I'm curious on how you guys are thinking about your fiscal '25 and if growth could fall on potentially the higher end of the LRP range or even above the range? How should we think about the different moving parts there given the outperformance here so far? \nStephen MacMillan: Yes, Casey, you'll love it. We're not going anywhere near '25 guidance at this point in time. So we've given the long range we're delivering for now, investing for the future. But stay tuned for the November call, and we'll get into that. But thank you. \nCasey Woodring: All right. And then maybe if I could just follow up here. How do you assess the international opportunity for BV/CV/TV, you mentioned in the prepared that the strong growth you've seen in that assay really hasn't included any international contribution. So maybe help us frame how much growth runway you have on that assay just based on phasing in the international piece. \nStephen MacMillan: Yes. We're earlier stages of really looking at the opportunity there. There are some other things on the markets and frankly, the indication is not necessarily developed. So it's probably a little more of a market development longer-term opportunity for us internationally as frankly, many of our products have been. So very minimal expectations in the near term internationally. I would tell you though we love the momentum we have, certainly in the United States on it. \nOperator: And we have a question from Andrew Brackmann with William Blair. \nAndrew Brackmann: Maybe on the international business and margins, in particular, can you maybe just sort of talk to us about some of the levers which exist there to drive future margin expansion for that segment in general? And how much of that is in your control? And I guess as a related follow-up here, if we go back a handful of years, logic has been pretty successful in acquiring distributors, namely international distributors. So I guess, how does that sort of play into that margin expansion opportunity? \nKarleen Oberton: Yes. Certainly, that is one of the strategies to improve margins as we go direct and we find that as we go direct, we have better outcomes in those markets with our market development and market access capabilities, which -- that is something we have invested in over the last 5 years. So that strength that commercial investment at the point of leverage as we move forward as well as we continue to grow the portfolio, specifically surgical -- it's early days, but certainly, the surgical portfolio is an accretive product to the overall margin profile for that business. So I think there'll be multiple drivers as we move forward. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Andrew Cooper with Raymond James. \nAndrew Cooper: Maybe just first sticking with international. One thing jumps out, just looking at the table at the bottom of the release. The region that seems to have the most outsized growth has really been kind of all other. I think part of that might just be COVID unwinding a little bit, but maybe any thoughts there? And then as you think about the international opportunity, can you highlight maybe if it's a particular product in a particular region or a particular region in general? What areas are you most excited about in terms of that geographic expansion opportunity as we sit here in the start of May '24. \nStephen MacMillan: Yes. I think the magic of our international business is -- it's a lot of individual products in individual countries that we've been building kind of market access capabilities and everything over the years. And while there's no one that's driving it. We've just got a series of different products and different geographies that are really building momentum. And a lot of them in kind of the surgical and interventional space. \n Certainly, we're getting very excited about our Surgical business and its opportunity internationally, both what we've been doing with our own sales forces plus we did mention we acquired our distributor in the Nordics. So continuing to go -- feel very well there. And then it's just -- you get different times. The fact we got our digital cytology approved, internationally, that's been going very well in Western Europe. \n So it's just this collection of the different franchises, the different geographies building over time. And I think the magic is, Andrew, from the years in the past, we always said we're going to be building these businesses internationally, not by showing up 1 day and saying, hey, we're going to dramatically expand our sales forces and take a year off on profit growth. We've been making the investments all along. \n And then as certain products launch in certain countries, then we use that funding to fund the next year and keep building. So it's really just this inexorable building of success. \nOperator: Our next question come from Andrew Petrone with Mizuho Securities. \nUnknown Analyst: This is Brad Davis on for Anthony. -- not another Andrew, but -- talk on the Breast Health business. I figure -- whenever we see you guys make a move in Breast Health, obviously, core competency at which you're paying attention. The one to kind of hear your strategic rationale on the Endomag acquisition, why you see now as kind of a time to get bigger on the procedural side of the business and if we should expect kind of further moves to cover the swap and the continuum, if there's any other assets that you think that you'd like to have in that portfolio? \nStephen MacMillan: Yes. I think the biggest piece is it's just a continuation of what we've been doing over the last 5, 6 years where we've tried to build, especially the gantry business and build out across the breast care continuum. So into biopsies and into interventional techniques. So as we've been building our own markers business, this has been an area we've been looking. We got into localizer a few years back. We've been doing both organic, inorganic. And the timing on this one really is driven by the opportunity to pick up Endomag. They've been a business we've been tracking for quite some time that we liked a lot, and the opportunity finally became available to grab them. Thank you. But yes, just continuing on what we've been doing. \nUnknown Analyst: Got it. That's helpful. And then just to stay on the breast business, you recently called out some of the life cycle in the boxes 2014 launch time frame. So maybe getting to the 9-, 10-year time frame. Can you just remind us, I guess, the life span on these devices and how Hologic plans to kind of best monetize the upgrade replacement opportunity and also if this is part of the rationale on timing of any new systems software and product enhancements. \nKarleen Oberton: Yes. I would say we've been very intentional into really smooth out that business and really move away from the boom bust of a life cycle replacement -- replacement cycle. And as we've talked about, we've had many software and other upgrades to the gantry system over the past several years, all of which have been backwards compatible to that installed base. The customers have been able to get improvements and upgrades along the way. They don't have to wait for that next gen gantry. But having said that, we certainly have something in development, but that's what we'll be talking about later, probably in '25. \nOperator: Absolutely. That question will come from [Michael Ryskin] with Bank of America. \nUnknown Analyst: This is John came on for Mike. I think we've talked about these numbers before, and I was wondering the improved utilization seems to be the main contributor. So I was wondering how the average number of assay used for Panther has been trending, like what percentage of the customers is using more than one assay versus more than 4 assays. \nKarleen Oberton: Yes. So I think if we go back to 2019, we would say that less than or about 20% of our customers were running about 4 more assays at the end of that into '22, that was probably approaching high 30%, maybe 40%. But I think that's the entire installed base. But I think the other metric I'd look to -- point to is the newer Panthers that were placed since April of 2020. So new customers acquired since the pandemic over 90% of those customers are running at least one other assay and over 55% of running at least 2 other assays. \n So I think that all points to the value, the workflow that our customers see with the Panther instrument in the menu and the long runway ahead to continue to drive utilization on the installed base. \nOperator: And this now concludes Hologic's First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Have a good evening.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Karleen Oberton",
            "content": "Thank you, Essex, and good afternoon, everyone. In my statements today, I will provide an overview of our revenue results, walk down our income statement showcasing strong performance, touch on a few other key financial metrics and finish with our guidance for the third quarter and full fiscal 2024.  \n As highlighted, our second quarter financial results were very strong. exceeding our expectations on revenue and profitability. Q2 was a continuation of our momentum from Q1. Total revenue came in at $1.018 billion, beating the midpoint of our guidance by $18 million. We delivered organic growth of 4.9%, excluding COVID, on top of a challenging double-digit comp from the prior year.  \n In addition, non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.03, which exceeded the high end of our guidance by $0.03. Before moving on to our franchise results,  we want to highlight the continued strength of our balance sheet. In Q2, we generated over $290 million in cash from operating activities and ended the quarter with nearly $2.2 billion on the balance sheet. Our strong cash balance leverage ratio well below our target range and ability to consistently generate strong cash flow provide us the flexibility to fund innovation and execute our capital allocation strategy.  \n We have significant firepower to continue to deploy capital as opportunities arise.  \n Turning to our franchise results. In Diagnostics, second quarter revenue of $450.1 million declined 3.2%. Excluding COVID assay and related revenue, worldwide Diagnostics grew by 9.8%. Within Diagnostics, Molecular Diagnostics continues to contribute significantly, growing 10.7% excluding COVID. We continue to see underlying strength in BV/CV/TV, which continues its outstanding growth trajectory. BV/CV/TV is tracking to become our second largest assay globally. With very little international revenue as we have focused primarily on the U.S. market.  \n Additionally, as expected, non-COVID respiratory assay sales remained solid as the flu season continued into our second quarter. Growth was a combination of more volume year-over-year across our respiratory menu plus ASP lift from elevated contribution from our COVID, Flu A, Flu B and RSV 4-Plex assay. Finally, Biotheranostics remains a strong pillar of growth for our base molecular business. Rounding out Diagnostics, Psychology and perinatal grew 7.9% globally, primarily fueled by double-digit growth internationally as well as impact from the prior year comp. As a reminder, Q2 last year was adversely impacted by supply constraint issues related to a third-party logistics partner. Level set growth in the second quarter is above our long-term expectations for this business.  \n Moving on to Breast Health. Total second quarter revenue of $384.6 million decreased 0.3%, but grew 1% when excluding SSI. As a reminder, Q1 '24 resulted in an elevated growth rate assisted by lapping soft prior year performance due to supply constraints in Q1 '23. The opposite is true for Q2 '24, where we faced significant prior year comps. \n In Q2 of last year, we placed an elevated number of gantries as semiconductor chip supply and visibility improved. For the remainder of the year, we expect growth rates in the gantry business to normalize. Within Breast Health, growth was driven primarily by our international interventional mix. This highlights the diversity of growth drivers Steve and Essex commented on. And the fact that growth drivers across our business and within our divisions can change and morph over time.  \n Continuing next to Surgical. Second quarter revenue of $156 million increased 7.4%. Surgical growth continues to be fueled by MyoSure in the related Fluent fluid management system. As anticipated, NovaSure continues to be a headwind to growth as we lapped the prior year NovaSure V5 ASP lift. \n And finally, in our Skeletal business, Second quarter revenue of $27.1 million declined 14.3% from lower capital placements and upgrades. Now let's move on to the rest of the non-GAAP P&L for the second quarter. Gross margin was 60.7% for the quarter and in line with expectations. The decline of 160 basis points from the prior year was anticipated and primarily driven by lower COVID sales compared to the prior year period. As a reminder, we expect gross margin to improve as we work past the amortization of previously procured higher-priced semiconductor chips. Total operating expense of $307.6 million in the second quarter decreased by 3%. This decrease was primarily driven by elimination of expenses related to the divested SSI business. As Steve mentioned, the operating margin was 30.4% for the second quarter. The year-over-year decline of 90 basis points was driven primarily from lower COVID sales. \n Sequentially, as expected, operating margins expanded 190 basis points from Q1 largely from lower operating expenses in Q2, a strong result for the quarter. Below operating income, other income net represented a loss of nearly $6 million in our first -- in our fiscal second quarter. As expected, interest income is lower due to lower cash balances from the significant share repurchases completed earlier in the fiscal year.\n Additionally, interest expense is up due to lower proceeds from our interest rate swaps.  \n Finally, our tax rate in Q2 was 19.75% as expected. \n Now let's move on to our non-GAAP financial guidance for the third quarter and full year fiscal 2024. For Q3 2024, we are expecting total revenue in the range of $992.5 million to $1007.5 million. and EPS of $0.98 to $1.05. For the full year 2024, our guidance assumes revenue of $4 billion to $4.05 billion. and EPS of $4.02 to $4.12.  \n With respect to foreign exchange, we expect the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar to create a significant headwind in the second half of the year. For Q3, we are assuming FX headwind of about $3 million. For the full year, we now expect a slight tailwind of about $2 million. All in, this represents about a $2 million -- a $10 million impact to our prior guidance. And as a reminder, prior guidance assumed a $12 million tailwind for the full year.  \n Turning to our franchises. We want to reiterate that we expect each to grow at least 5% to 7% in our fiscal 2024, excluding the impact of COVID. While we have navigated the most challenging comps from fiscal '23, we still have strong double-digit comps across the board to close out fiscal '24. Starting with Diagnostics. We expect our Molecular Diagnostics business to drive high single-digit growth, excluding COVID as customers continue to adopt and drive utilization of our expanded menu.  \n In cytology and perinatal, however, we expect minimal growth in Q3. In Q3 of last year, customers built inventory as a result of the third-party shipping constraints experienced in Q2 of '23, resulting in slightly elevated sales. We expect to see more normalized comps for our cytology and perinatal business in fiscal year '25.  \n Closing out on non-COVID diagnostics, we expect blood revenue of approximately $7 million in Q3 and $28 million for the full year. In terms of COVID revenue, we expect COVID assay sales to be about $5 million to $10 million in Q3 '24 and about $60 million to $65 million for the full year. COVID-related items are expected to be about $25 million in the third quarter and approximately $105 million for the full year.  \n Moving on to Breast Health. We remain on pace to grow the business within the 5% to 7% range for the year. As a reminder, we closed out fiscal '23 with 3 straight quarters of 25% plus growth rates. We expect steady performance in Breast Health in the back half of the year as the business continues to improve sequentially. The demand for our portfolio of products and service remains strong. and we continue to have excellent visibility into gantry orders.  \n Further, our confidence in delivering more gantries than last year remains high. We continue to successfully manage resource availability among both our install teams and our customers, as customers balance the need to meet elevated demand for screening and staffing constraints.  \n Finally, in Surgical, we anticipate our full year fiscal 2024 revenue growth to be at the high end of our 5% to 7% long-term target. The growth will continue to come from MyoSure Fluent as well as both Accessa and Bolder.  \n Moving next to margins. We reiterate that our guidance assumes the cadence of improvement throughout fiscal '24 for both gross margin and operating margin. For gross margin, we anticipate Q3 will improve sequentially from Q2 as we continue to work through our higher cost chips in Breast Health. Remain on pace to exit the fiscal year in the low 60s. Our guidance also assumes Q3 operating margins in the low 30s, and we remain on pace to finish fiscal '24, approaching 31%. Below operating income, we estimate fiscal '24 other income net to be an expense of approximately $10 million in Q3 and an expense between $30 million and $40 million for the full year.  \n Our guidance is based on an annual effective tax rate of approximately 19.75%, and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately $238 million for the full year. To conclude, Q2 was another strong quarter and sets us up nicely for the second half of the year. As always, we remain focused on advancing women's health around the world while delivering on our promises and commitments to our shareholders, employees, customers and patients. With that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions. Yes. I would just emphasize, Patrick, that the strength of our balance sheet as well as our ongoing cash flow generation allows us significant flexibility to do things like Endomag and the share repurchase on an ongoing and regular basis. So for years to come as we look at our financial projections over the coming years, so we have a lot of flexibility and strength. Yes. Well, I think we think it fits really nicely with our existing interventional portfolio. And I think that's 1 of the values that we'll bring is that currently Endomag uses a mix of direct and distributors, and we obviously have a significant direct sales force in the U.S. that I think will be a differentiator for us with that asset in our hands. Yes. I would just say, Jack, we would expect it to be accretive certainly to the division's growth rate. Yes. I would just say the impact on the full year guidance is primarily related to currency, if you actually look at the midpoint of this guide versus our prior guide on a constant currency basis, it's up slightly. So we really view the performance in this quarter a lot of to tighten the range as you indicated really hone in and delivering within that range. Yes. Let me kick off in that. Yes, it was just recently approved in the U.S., and I would say that we're really partnering with our lab customers on implementing and integrating into the workflow, so that's what we're focused on really more of a successful integration into the lab workflow at this point. \n So minimal contribution in '24 from the U.S. approval. But I think the feedback here, early days, there's a lot of excitement of what this can do in what we've talked about in a labor-constrained environment. And we think those will be really well received. Yes. Certainly, that is one of the strategies to improve margins as we go direct and we find that as we go direct, we have better outcomes in those markets with our market development and market access capabilities, which -- that is something we have invested in over the last 5 years. So that strength that commercial investment at the point of leverage as we move forward as well as we continue to grow the portfolio, specifically surgical -- it's early days, but certainly, the surgical portfolio is an accretive product to the overall margin profile for that business. So I think there'll be multiple drivers as we move forward. Yes. I would say we've been very intentional into really smooth out that business and really move away from the boom bust of a life cycle replacement -- replacement cycle. And as we've talked about, we've had many software and other upgrades to the gantry system over the past several years, all of which have been backwards compatible to that installed base. The customers have been able to get improvements and upgrades along the way. They don't have to wait for that next gen gantry. But having said that, we certainly have something in development, but that's what we'll be talking about later, probably in '25. Yes. So I think if we go back to 2019, we would say that less than or about 20% of our customers were running about 4 more assays at the end of that into '22, that was probably approaching high 30%, maybe 40%. But I think that's the entire installed base. But I think the other metric I'd look to -- point to is the newer Panthers that were placed since April of 2020. So new customers acquired since the pandemic over 90% of those customers are running at least one other assay and over 55% of running at least 2 other assays. \n So I think that all points to the value, the workflow that our customers see with the Panther instrument in the menu and the long runway ahead to continue to drive utilization on the installed base."

            "name": "Essex Mitchell",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve. As previewed by Steve's discussion of our diverse and durable growth drivers, our strong international growth is a direct result of identifying and capturing underpenetrated market opportunities with steady execution. As a reminder, our international business is over 40% larger than it was in 2019. We are in more territory and more direct than ever before. That said, big picture, we are still in the early days of our international opportunities. Our early success is driven largely by 2 approaches: One, going direct; and two, entering markets where we elevate the standard of care. \n For example, on the latter, while the ThinPrep Pap test, 2D and even 3D mammo and procedures like NovaSure and MyoSure are widely accepted as standard of care in the U.S., internationally, this is unfortunately not yet the case. Many parts of the world even those considered developed and industrialized, still have the opportunity to elevate their screening, diagnosis and treatment of women to gold standards. These women deserve it, and Hologic is poised to realize this potential. Acceptability to women's health options around the world remains a priority and a great opportunity for Hologic. This is why our work with the Hologic Global Women's Health Index and our worldwide partnership with the Women's Tennis Association to elevate women's health, education and access are critically important.  \n Reinforcing our position, the index clearly shows that we are only scratching the surface of the global opportunity, and this holds true even in Europe, with other large market geographies like Asia Pacific being further out on the time horizon. From our perspective, as leading champions for women's health, we believe there is still significant market adoption opportunity ahead of us. And this adoption will not happen overnight, we expect adoption to grow over time, at different paces around the world as more and more governments prioritize women's health.  \n And for our final theme today, we'd like to underscore the importance of our strong balance sheet and recap our capital allocation priorities. With over $2 billion in cash and strong cash flow we have the capacity to fund key in-house initiatives and also deploy cash towards both M&A and share repurchases. Regarding capital allocation, our strategy remains the same. We are focused on tuck-in opportunities for our 3 core franchises. And as we have stated in the past, we have a strong preference for any potential deal to have a clear line of sight to accretion on both top and bottom line, if not immediately, the sooner, the better.  \n Our business development teams across each of our franchises are consistently building and reviewing opportunities in their respective pipeline. We view our ability to shop across multiple aisles as a strength as we continue to grow into an even greater performing composite than we are today. The ability to shop in multiple aisles also creates the flexibility to maneuver potentially unfavorable valuations in one aisle versus another.  \n Overall, a blend of adding in-house developed and external innovation across our strong fan franchises is an important part of our growth strategy. Leading into our strategy, on Monday, we announced our agreement to acquire Endo-Magnetics LTD -- a provider of breast cancer surgery technologies for approximately $310 million. Endo-Mag's portfolio of innovative breast surgery localization and lymphatic tracing products complements and diversifies our expanding interventional breast business. We are excited for the potential to join forces, amplify growth and better serve patients around the world. In calendar 2023, Endomag generated approximately $35 million of revenue, and we believe our combined global reach and breadth of interventional options will accelerate growth in this exciting space.  \n At this point, we are still early and do not have a definitive time line on closing the transaction, though we estimate to close in the second half of calendar year. Before I turn the call over to Karleen, let me conclude by saying we are proud of our strong Q2 results that build on our Q1 performance. All said, we are in a solid position to carry our success into Q3 and Q4."
        },
        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Stephen MacMillan",
            "content": "Thank you, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to discuss our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. For the quarter, total revenue was $1.02 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.03. Both revenue and EPS came in above the high end of our guidance, reflecting another strong quarter.  \n Similar to Q1, it is again important to view our Q2 performance in proper perspective. As we shared on our Q1 earnings call in February, throughout 2024, we faced double-digit comps, massive comps in the first half and still very strong comps in the second. As a reminder, in Q2 of last year, organic Molecular Diagnostics ex COVID posted growth of nearly 25%. And both Surgical and Breast Health posted phenomenal growth of over 25%. This year, in Q2, on top of the high growth rates from a year ago, we grew our Molecular Diagnostics business, ex COVID at 10.7%. Our surgical business, 7.4%; and our Breast Health business 1%, excluding the divested SSI business, a solid result given the elevated gantry placements in Q2 a year ago.  \n We also delivered operating margins of 30.4% in Q2, improving 190 basis points sequentially from Q1 and setting us up nicely to approach 31% for the full fiscal year. Now past the halfway point of fiscal '24, we believe we are in an excellent position to achieve our full year goals.  \n Before moving on to our themes for today, our fiscal second quarter marks the fourth anniversary of when the COVID virus changed the world. When COVID initially surged, we had 3 goals: one, ensure that we take care of our employees; two, make a huge difference in the world with our Panther system and COVID testing. And three, emerge as a bigger, stronger, faster growing company in a post-pandemic world.  \n Fast forward to today, as you can see from our results, we have delivered against these 3 goals, and we're aiming for more. Not only did we achieve our primary objectives, we also successfully managed to strengthen all of our franchises, both in the U.S. and internationally, remain innovative and disciplined in executing our growth strategies and build a fortress balance sheet to facilitate future growth. \n On top of these achievements, we continue to elevate our already high employee engagement scores and all through complicated macro challenges. That said, we are never satisfied and firmly believe the best is still ahead. As we look further out beyond the horizon, we see significant potential to continue to innovate and unlock growth opportunities for years to come.  \n Now on to our 3 themes for today. First, our core franchises Diagnostics, Breast Health and Surgical continued to showcase the benefits of our diverse portfolio. As planned, we continue to yield robust growth and durability because we benefit from being both Diagnostics and Medtech. Second, our international business quietly continues to drive strong top line growth. demonstrating our ability to capture potential growth opportunities and turn them into reality. And third, our strong balance sheet and disciplined approach to capital allocation, empower us to fortify our foundation as we've done this week with the announcement of the Endomagnetics acquisition. We have the ability to build on our strength with significant operational flexibility, which allows us multiple levers to deliver top and bottom line performance.  \n Turning to our first theme. Sometimes overlooked and misunderstood -- the strength of our business comes from the sum of our parts. We are a unique collection of Diagnostics and Medtech businesses with many more growth drivers than meets the eye. Each business has multiple growth drivers with tremendous runway ahead. To the outside, it may be unclear how we can keep driving growth with the strong market shares we have. In reality, our product and service diversity creates enduring strength as we advance forward and notch incremental wins.  \n Over time, these wins collectively deliver meaningful and durable growth across multiple franchises and multiple geographies. While we know we don't fit neatly into either diagnostics or medical device, we do fit neatly into the world of improving women's health. Our unique set of businesses equips us to deliver results and positively impact more and more women regardless of external macro challenges. Our strong growth over the past 4 years reflects a combination of multiple durable growth drivers intentionally built into each of our businesses.  \n The beauty here is that over time and in any given quarter, our growth drivers can change and morph. What we've done is create multiphase extended and stacked growth cycles. The net result is our ability to consistently deliver on a consolidated basis over time. A few examples to highlight from across our business. In our second quarter, worldwide diagnostics growth ex COVID of 9.8% was again primarily driven by our Molecular Diagnostics business.  \n In Molecular Diagnostics, over the last few years, we've dramatically expanded both our installed base and menu, nearly doubling our installed base from 1,700 Panthers to over 3,200 during the pandemic and going from 4 FDA-approved assays to over 20. Our next phase of growth is about menu adoption and driving more volume by focusing largely on existing customers while adding more geographies. At the same time, we continue to broaden our menu. As a result, we create years of growth ahead as we extend our commercial reach and continue to add products to our portfolio.  \n In the second quarter, U.S. Molecular Diagnostics delivered double-digit growth, led by ongoing adoption of BV/CV/TV on the Panther, strong contributions from our respiratory suite of assays on the fusion as well as continued growth from Biotheranostics. Each of these are newer products to our portfolio, underscoring the power of our extended reach, layering on top of the strong U.S. molecular performance, international cytology was also accretive to worldwide diagnostics growth. Outside the U.S., diagnostics growth was driven primarily by multi-country adoption of our innovative Genius AI digital psychology in the quarter.  \n As a reminder, digital cytology was only recently approved in the U.S. earlier this year. meaning the U.S. opportunity is still ahead.  \n In Breast Health, we've expanded our product offering from imaging to cover the continuum of breast cancer care, including biopsy and surgery. In the second quarter, on a worldwide basis, the gantry and service businesses performed well against very strong comps from the prior year period. Meanwhile, outside the U.S, our emerging interventional breast business grew double digits in Q2, accretive to the worldwide growth rate.  \n And finally, in Surgical. Once essentially only a U.S. 2 product business with NovaSure and MyoSure, we now have Fluent, Accesa and Bolder. And internationally, we are just getting started with both the core business and new product lines. In Q2, worldwide growth of 7.4% was very strong against the high prior year comp. Our performance was driven in large part by very strong double-digit growth in our International Surgical business, which in Q2 is a reflection of continued market penetration as well as our go-direct strategy in the Nordics.  \n All in, we are a powerful women's health composite. As we extend our reach globally, we expect to grow even in product categories and territories that may on their surface appear to be mature and well penetrated.  \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Essex to discuss our final 2 themes for today. Yes, Patrick, I really call it. It's the dividend and reward for coming to the country and the world's rescue when they needed a stern COVID. And as you well know, we placed a ton of Panthers, almost doubled our worldwide placements. And the big question all through that time and through those next few years was, yes, what's going to happen to those Panthers on the back end. \n And what we said is just keep watching, because I think what we feel great about is in a labor-constrained world, our Panther and the workflow automation, combined with the incredible menu that we have the tight footprint on Panther. And then we've added the Fusion sidecar that these things are just incredible workhorses that really are getting the adoption. And I think you start to -- when you put a double-digit number on top of a 25% number from last year, what we're really just seeing is more customers putting more menu on their Panthers. And I think it's -- the proof is what we've been saying for years and hopefully, it's starting to become evident in the results. Yes, Pat, let's try to put this into context. We were talking as a team about this the other day and said, if we can line up the perfect world, we'd love to do like one Endomag every quarter. right? $300 million deal, bring in some additional revenue products that drop in that we know what to do and just kind of keep phasing those along and then maybe a little bit of a buyback here or there. The real world doesn't work nearly as linear. But that's what we would like to be doing is those size deals on a fairly regular basis. \n Because they don't always pop up from time to time, it is where we'll jump in and do some buybacks, and we're comfortable amassing the cash because there might be a year where we can do a number of these like we did at one point during COVID when we picked up Biotheranostics, Fluent, Accesa, Diagenode, these things that have all been very good for us. So no real change. We think the Endomagnetics deal is right down the fairway, hopefully, exactly what anybody would expect from us and what we've been signaling and if we can find more of those, that'd be great. \n With that, I'll kick it to Karleen. Sorry. I'm sorry, go ahead, Justin. Yes. As you saw, they're really kind of still in the biannual world and we don't think the USPSTF guidelines changed much. Recall that our Breast Health is really a screening business where it's a capital sale and less volume dependent. But we really don't see much of an impact either way, just as when the guidelines shifted \"negatively\" a few years back, I didn't see a downturn there and don't see a big shift now. \n We do think the guidelines are a step forward for women. Unless you're a woman over 74 where they still haven't gone far enough. We are very focused on maintaining co-testing as the gold standard. If anything, what we're seeing is a modest uptick in cervical cancer in women in the United States that really started when the intervals went from to 3 to 5 years back almost 10 years ago and believe absolutely the co-testing is the right way to go. That continues to be -- our base is based on the scientific facts. No need to get too far ahead of ourselves. Great. Yes. It's funny in so many ways, we don't focus always as much probably on share as we do on just building our business for our customers and growing the categories. So I think what we continue to feel great about is we've got, as you know, more respiratory menu than we've ever had. We've got the Fusion sidecars, so we're building a respiratory business. We're not competing in the point of care business. We are very strong in our reference labs in the hospital systems, the public health labs and just really focused on delivering for those customers. \n And we believe we've got both an economic and workflow advantage as well as, frankly, the sensitivity specificity of a lot of our assays. So continue to feel very good about the growth rates there. And at the end of the day, these are big markets, and there will be, I think, several companies going up and others that will be shared donors in the equation. Yes, Casey, you'll love it. We're not going anywhere near '25 guidance at this point in time. So we've given the long range we're delivering for now, investing for the future. But stay tuned for the November call, and we'll get into that. But thank you. Yes. We're earlier stages of really looking at the opportunity there. There are some other things on the markets and frankly, the indication is not necessarily developed. So it's probably a little more of a market development longer-term opportunity for us internationally as frankly, many of our products have been. So very minimal expectations in the near term internationally. I would tell you though we love the momentum we have, certainly in the United States on it. Yes. I think the magic of our international business is -- it's a lot of individual products in individual countries that we've been building kind of market access capabilities and everything over the years. And while there's no one that's driving it. We've just got a series of different products and different geographies that are really building momentum. And a lot of them in kind of the surgical and interventional space. \n Certainly, we're getting very excited about our Surgical business and its opportunity internationally, both what we've been doing with our own sales forces plus we did mention we acquired our distributor in the Nordics. So continuing to go -- feel very well there. And then it's just -- you get different times. The fact we got our digital cytology approved, internationally, that's been going very well in Western Europe. \n So it's just this collection of the different franchises, the different geographies building over time. And I think the magic is, Andrew, from the years in the past, we always said we're going to be building these businesses internationally, not by showing up 1 day and saying, hey, we're going to dramatically expand our sales forces and take a year off on profit growth. We've been making the investments all along. \n And then as certain products launch in certain countries, then we use that funding to fund the next year and keep building. So it's really just this inexorable building of success. Yes. I think the biggest piece is it's just a continuation of what we've been doing over the last 5, 6 years where we've tried to build, especially the gantry business and build out across the breast care continuum. So into biopsies and into interventional techniques. So as we've been building our own markers business, this has been an area we've been looking. We got into localizer a few years back. We've been doing both organic, inorganic. And the timing on this one really is driven by the opportunity to pick up Endomag. They've been a business we've been tracking for quite some time that we liked a lot, and the opportunity finally became available to grab them. Thank you. But yes, just continuing on what we've been doing."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Hologic First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Synthia, and I'm your operator for today's call. Today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce Ryan Simon, Vice President, Investor Relations, to begin the call. Please go ahead.\nRyan Simon: Thank you, Synthia. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Hologic's First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer and Essex Mitchell, our Chief Operating Officer. Our first quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We will also post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them as well as an updated corporate presentation. And a replay of this call will be available on our website for the next 30 days. Before we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements we make today will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the safe harbor statement included in our earnings release and SEC filings. Also, during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Two of these non-GAAP measures are, one, organic revenue, which we define as revenue excluding the divested businesses and revenue from acquired businesses owned by Hologic for less than one year; and two, organic revenue, excluding COVID-19, which excludes COVID-19 assay revenue, revenue related to COVID-19 and sales from discontinued products in Diagnostics; finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO.\nSteve MacMillan: Thank you, Ryan. And good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. For the quarter, total revenue was $1.01 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.98. Both revenue and EPS came in above the high end of our guidance. Before diving into our results, it is important to view our Q1 growth performance in proper perspective. Simply put, our first two quarters of fiscal \u201824 face incredibly difficult comps. Despite Q1 \u201824 having four fewer selling days compared to the prior year, and even against a prior year Molecular Diagnostics ex-COVID revenue growth of 24 .5%, and a Surgical revenue growth rate of nearly 15%, we grew total organic revenue, ex-COVID, a solid 5.2%. Even more impressive, when adjusting four fewer selling days, our Q1 results stand taller. On an adjusted basis, we estimate the total company organic revenue growth ex-COVID was in the high single digits for the period. These are incredibly strong results against challenging comps as we continue to perform exceptionally well against our 5% to 7% percent ex-COVID long-term target. We continue to showcase our durability and broad strength across our divisions, both delivering on our short-term guidance and maintaining our long-term targets. Keep in mind that our long-term revenue targets are more impressive today, given we are growing off a much larger base than we originally contemplated. As we've said before, you can count on us to deliver. During our call today, we will focus on building upon our messaging from the JPMorgan conference three weeks ago. During our presentation, we highlighted that we are a new Hologic bigger, faster, stronger, and poised for continued success. As part of our discussion, Essex will share more insights about our high confidence in our future success. He will also shed light on what we view as underappreciated elements of our growth strategy that are helpful to fully recognize the potential of our business. Before then turning the call over to Karleen to discuss our detailed financial results, we will share reflections from our participation at the World Economic Forum in Davos. While we continue to make progress elevating women's health, it is clear we still have a long way to go. Starting with our meetings at JPMorgan, we realize there are two camps of investors. There is one camp that understands our transformation and recognizes the drivers powering our current results and future growth potential. At the same time, there is another camp that, quite frankly, does not. That said, we certainly appreciate the complexity. Over the past three years, there have been many moving pieces clouding the narrative of the force we've become. From revenue still normalizing following the ups and downs of COVID, to moving past semiconductor chip supply challenges, to selling days dynamics, only naming a few, each has contributed to irregular comps that may be difficult to interpret, and also challenging tomorrow. We appreciate that each represents a layer of complexity that must be pulled back to fully appreciate the underlying strength of our business. Looking beyond the quarterly nuances, our steady performance over time really shines. Above all, we are bigger, faster, stronger, and poised for further growth. We are a durable and diversified growth company with disciplined operations, peer group leading margins, an exceptionally strong balance sheet, and above all, a talented and engaged employee workforce. We are poised to continue to drive top-line growth while growing the bottom line even faster. To shed more light on what gives us high confidence in our future, I'll pass it over to Essex.\nEssex Mitchell: Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As we've commented over the past several quarters, we have dramatically transformed our business since 2019 through the challenges of the pandemic. More recently, as we move further away from the peaks of COVID testing and prevalence, we have posted exceptional ex-COVID results. These results back up our claim that we are much more than a COVID story, and without doubt build for the long term. At the same time, as Steve mentioned, there is a lot to unpack to fully understand our business. Many recognize that we are a new Hologic compared to where we were in fiscal 2018. Since then, we've grown our Molecular Diagnostics business approximately 80%, our Breast business nearly 10% and our Surgical business nearly 40%. Yet there are still some on the fence and uncertain of our future growth potential. As some of our peers have also performed well over this time period, it's not easy to see the throughway. The underlying assumption is that winner must be exclusively taking share. In reality, there was much more to it. In addition to competing and taking share, Hologic growth is centered on innovation, and making sure. We then drive this innovation to commercial execution by leveraging our world class sales teams. As we are positioned today, our future growth is much less about hand to hand combat in the trenches of the markets where we operate. Instead, our growth is derived from growing and expanding market through education, awareness, innovative new products, and tapping into under penetrated markets. As an example, our three largest revenue product lines launched in 2019, excluding COVID are BV, CV/TV, Biotheranostics and Fluent. These three lines alone collectively delivered over 300 million in revenue in 2023. That was essentially nonexistent to start 2019. Moreover, each product line falls into one or more of our market creating strategies, and each is still in their earlier stages of growth. Similarly, outside of the top three, we have a number of other product lines and new since 2019 which could each individually represent $100 million revenue opportunities over time. And these lines are also still in their early innings of growth. To highlight a few are respiratory assays, GYN scopes, and laparoscopic surgical portfolio, each delivered to double digit growth rates for fiscal \u201823. On top of our market expansion activity, we continue to drive further growth by leveraging our large installs in user bases of core products in each division. Through the Panther, our gantry and our hysteroscopic surgical portfolio, we have incredibly deep customer relationships in each of our unique channels. Post COVID, our call points around the world are stronger than ever. Customers associate Hologic with industry leading differentiated technologies, ongoing innovation, best-in-class workflow and automation solutions. Moreover, our strong reputation as leaders and champions for Women's Health continues to open doors. Earning this advantage provide us a unique opportunity to supercharge growth from products introduced into our channel. While there are many out there that claim to be winners, even in categories, we continue to lead year-over-year, we are extremely confident in our ability to carve out a great opportunity for growth. Similarly, we are equally confident in our demonstrated ability to gain and maintain market share across our core product lines. With our core businesses, incredibly healthy, and many of our growth driving products still in early innings. All-in, we believe we are well positioned for the future and well positioned to maintain our strong performance for the years to come. Steve?\nSteve MacMillan: Thank you, Essex. To close out the discussion of our growth prospects. While we continue to make significant progress outside of the US, we still have tremendous opportunity to grow and build a much greater presence internationally. Shifting gears before turning the call over to Karleen, we'd like to share reflections from our time at the World Economic Forum in Davos. For a third year in a row we had the opportunity to participate at the forum, where we presented the results of our third annual Hologic Global Women's Health Index. The Index, which is the largest study of its kind, examining the overall state of women's health and wellbeing continues to generate tremendous support from major organizations dedicated to improving women's health. As we've said before, over time, we believe the Index may be the single greatest contribution to the world that we make at Hologic. This year's results show that we all need to stand behind women more than ever. The harsh reality is that women's health globally has not only stagnated over the past year, but is sadly moving in the wrong direction. The data shows that only 11% of women were screened for cancer and only 10% for STIs. Billions of women are not being screened, this must change. And we have a tremendous opportunity to lead the way with our women's health portfolio. The key takeaway here is that in many ways, our markets are still in the early innings of reaching their potential. As we look ahead, we are even more inspired to live into our purpose, passion, and promise. We continue to believe and we have proven that we can drive results through our unwavering commitment to women's health. Our strong results come from our strong purpose. And finally, in late breaking news, we are incredibly proud to announce that just last night, our new Genius Digital Diagnostic system, with the Genius Cervical AI algorithm received clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration. This accomplishment is only made possible by the creativity, focus and dedication of our outstanding Diagnostics team. Continuing to trailblaze our path. Our system is the first and only FDA cleared digital cytology system that combines deep learning based AI with advanced imaging technology. It can help more accurately detect cervical cancer, improve psychology workflow, and ultimately enhance patient care. We continue to deliver and at a time when women need it most. With that, let me hand the call over to Karleen.\nKarleen Oberton: Thank you, Steve. And good afternoon, everyone. And congratulations again to our Diagnostics team. In my statements, today, I will provide an overview of our divisional revenue results, and walk down our income statement that highlights the broad based strong performance across our business. I will also touch on a few additional key financial metrics and finish with our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal \u201824 in the full year. Jumping right in, we are pleased to share that our first quarter financial performance was strong. We exceeded our expectations on both the top and bottom line. Total revenue came in at $1.013 billion, beating the midpoint of our guidance by about $40 million. As Steve mentioned, despite four fewer selling days in the quarter, we delivered organic revenue growth of 5.2% excluding the impact of COVID in line with our long term revenue growth target of 5% to 7%. In addition, non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.98, exceeding the high end of our guidance. Overall, we continue to deliver robust performance on both the top and bottom lines. Before moving to our divisional results, we again want to emphasize that our balance sheet and willingness to deploy capital remain a core strength of our business in a macroenvironment that remains dynamic. As an example, in our first quarter, we initiated a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program, we purchased an additional $150 million of our stock and also pay down $250 million of floating rate debt with a cash balance of $1.9 billion, a leverage ratio well below our target range, and roughly $350 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. We have significant firepower and flexibility to deploy further capital should the opportunity arise. Turning to our divisional results. In Diagnostics, first quarter revenue of $447.8 million declined 20.6%. Excluding COVID assay and related ancillary revenue, Diagnostics revenue declined 0.9%. Yet adjusted for selling days we estimate we grew mid-single digits compared to the prior year. As a reminder, Q1 \u201823 was a very strong quarter for Diagnostics, boasting 15.8% growth ex- COVID and Molecular Diagnostics 24.5% growth ex-COVID. And without a doubt, our Q1 \u201824 results were impacted by four fewer selling days compared to the prior year. Within Diagnostics, our molecular business continues to drive the divisions results, it will bring growth of 1.9% ex-COVID or mid to high single digits when adjusted for the impact of fewer selling days. We continue to see underlying strength and BV, CV/TV which grew more than 20% in the quarter, and it's still in its early innings of adoption by our customers. More than 95% of our BV, CV/TV revenue is derived in the US, representing incredible longer term opportunity internationally. In addition, non-COVID respiratory revenue delivered ahead of our expectations. As we experienced stronger than anticipated demand for our flu, RSV, and 4-Plex assays. Our responding with published CDC data on respiratory virus positivity. Sales ramped up and in the final weeks of the quarter. Finally Biotheranostics remains a positive driver of growth for our molecular business, and delivered accretive revenue performance in the period. Now moving to Breast Health, total first quarter revenue of $377.7 million increased 12.2% showcasing solid double digit growth. Demand for our gantries remains robust and our interventional business also delivered a strong quarter. In our gantry business, we continue to benefit from a strong cadence of orders. And our elevated backlog continues to give us high confidence in the performance of this business going forward. Finally, as a reminder, Q1 \u201823 results were impacted by constrained supply. In interventional, we continue to see strong performance from our Brevera needles, as well as from our 2-Mark markers used for marking biopsy sites in suspicious lesions and pressed tissue. Leveraging strong performance in the quarter, we believe our Breast health franchise remains well positioned to deliver on its financial targets in fiscal \u201824. Continuing next to Surgical, our first quarter revenue of $162.2 million increased 4.6% or high single digits when adjusted for selling days. The divisions growth continues to be fueled by MyoSure and the Related fluid system, with an increasing contribution from our laparoscopic portfolio. As anticipated, NovaSure declined in Q1 as we lapped the selling price contribution from the products V5 extension introduced just before fiscal \u201823. And finally, in our Skeletal business, first quarter revenue of $25.4 million declined 5.6% from lower capital placement and upgrades. Now let's move on to the rest of the non-GAAP P&L for the first quarter. Gross margin of 60.8% was driven primarily by strong performance in our base business and higher than expected COVID revenues, which carries a favorable impact to our margin. However, as anticipated, our gross margin result remains temporarily depressed due to the ongoing amortization of semiconductor chips purchased at higher costs during the chip supply headwind. As we continue to deploy gantries, we are moving farther away from this high priced inventory. And as a result, we expect margins to continue to benefit from this inventory cycling as we progress through the year. Shifting to operating expenses, total operating expenses of $327.3 million in the first quarter decreased by 3.6%. This decrease in the period was driven by lower marketing spend, lower cost from fewer days and less expense due to the recently divested SSI business. For Q1 \u201923, this translates to a 28.5% operating margin in line with our expectations. While we continue to deliver a peer group leading operating margins, we continue to exercise operational discipline and continuously seek to improve where it makes sense for our business. Below operating income, other income net represented a gain in our fiscal first quarter. As expected, we benefited from elevated cash balance and high interest rates, even though we deployed significant cash in the quarter. Finally, our tax rate in Q1 was 19.75% as expected. Moving on from the P&L, cash flow from operations was $220 million in the first quarter. In addition, as previously mentioned, during Q1 we repurchased 2.2 million shares for $150 million. This activity was above and beyond initiating a $500 million ASR showcasing our high confidence in our business and willingness to bet on ourselves, as well as our ongoing strategy to deploy capital. Now let's move on to our non-GAAP financial guidance for the second quarter and full year fiscal \u201824. For our fiscal Q2 \u201824, we are expecting total revenue in the range of %990 million to $1.01 billion and EPS of $0.95 to $1. For the full year \u201924, our guidance assumes revenue of $3.99 billion to $4.065 billion and EPS of $3.97 to $4.12. With respect to foreign exchange, we are assuming an FX tailwind of $2 million for Q2 and $12 million for fiscal \u201824. Much of this tailwind was realized in Q1 and therefore we estimate that foreign exchange will remain neutral to marginally favorable throughout the remainder of the year. Turning to our divisions, we want to reiterate that we expect each business to grow at least 5% to 7% for the full fiscal \u201824, excluding the impact of COVID. Starting with Diagnostics, we expect the business to grow within our 5% to 7% long term framework for the remainder of fiscal \u201824. While performance was below this level on Q1, primarily due to the impact of fewer selling days compared to the prior year period, we expect the division to return to more normal growth in Q2, and for the remainder of our fiscal year. We expect improving utilization and menu expansion on the Panther coupled with ongoing contributions from Biotheranostics to continue to drive molecular growth, losing out on non-COVID Diagnostics, we expect blood revenue of approximately $7 million in Q2, and $30 million for the year. In terms of COVID revenue, we expect COVID assay sales to be approximately $20 million in the second quarter of \u201824 and $60 million for the full year. COVID related items are expected to be slightly less than $30 million in the second quarter, and approximately $105 million for the full year fiscal \u201824. Moving to Breast health, we continue to expect fiscal \u201824 to showcase strong demand for our portfolio products and services. While moving on it's important to understand the top dynamics that will impact the Breast business through fiscal \u201824. As previously noted, Q1 \u201823 with a softer comp due to shift supply constraints. As a reminder in Q2 \u201823, we delivered a strong quarter gantry placement to meet pent-up customer demand during these earlier days of chip supply recovery. And deliveries in Q3 and Q4 of \u201923 were both lower than Q2. We expect this dynamic to result in a lower Breast health year-over-year growth rate in Q2 that will improve in the back half of fiscal \u201924. For the full year, we continue to expect to deliver more gantries in fiscal \u201824 than in \u201923 as we move further from the chip supply headwinds, while maintaining excellent demand visibility. Finally, in Surgical, we anticipate our full year fiscal \u201824 revenue growth to be at the high end of our 5% to 7% long term target. Although impacted by fewer selling days, Q1 started the year strong and we expect the business to perform well in Q2 in the remainder of the fiscal year. Moving next to margins, our guidance assumes a cadence of improvement throughout fiscal \u201924 for both gross margin and operating margin. For gross margin, we anticipate Q2 levels similar to Q1 exiting the fiscal year in the low 60s. As well, our guidance assumes Q2 operating margins approaching 30% with the Q4 \u201824 exit rate around 31%. Continuing down the P&L, we expect Q2 operating expenses to step down from Q1. As a reminder, Q1 is typically our highest spend quarter seasonally. As we kickoff the fiscal year with our internal global sales meetings, and major trade show events such as RSNA. For the balance of the year, we anticipate quarterly operating expenses to be about $300 million to $310 million. Although operating income, we estimate fiscal \u201824 other income net to be an expense of approximately $10 million in Q2 and an expense between $30 million to $50 million for the full year. Our current guidance assumes an increase in interest income relative to our previous guide, as we expect to have a higher cash balance throughout the remainder of the fiscal year. Our guidance is based on an annual effective tax rate of approximately 19.75%. And diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately 239 million for the full year. To conclude Q1 was a strong quarter across each of our businesses and sets us up nicely for the rest of the year. As we close Q1, we move forward to Q2 in fiscal \u201824 with good momentum and as always remain focused on advancing women's health around the world while delivering on our promises and commitments to our shareholders, employees, customers and patients around the world. With that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley.\nTejas Savant: Hey, guys, good morning. Sorry. Good evening, and congrats on the solid performance here. Steve, I want to start with the Molecular Diagnostics franchise. I want to ask you a little bit about Aptima there. You've talked in the past about the benefits of co-testing the time it will take for physicians to embrace any change. That said, if guidelines move to HPV testing alone, how do you think about the upside on Aptima? And what if any, should be the gating factors to transitioning those volumes? Is there any sort of differences in competitive dynamics for ThinPrep versus the HPV franchise?\nSteve MacMillan: I think regardless of what happens with the guidelines, we see co-testing is being well entrenched. And if anything, it's going to probably get stronger with the approval we just got last night of our digital cytology business, which I think is probably not as fully appreciated. But as we bring that to market, it's going to dramatically improve the workflow for our customers. It's going to improve the efficacy it just -- it's probably the biggest improvement step forward in cytology in 40 years. So, we remain very committed and believing incredibly strongly, by the way as a reminder to single collection device that is used both for our Aptima HPV, as well as cytology. So it's no additional work for the doctor or the patient, and you get the results. So we continue to be very excited. And if anything, probably more excited about our cytology business combined with our HPV business going forward.\nTejas Savant: Got it. That's helpful. And then Karleen, one for you on margin. So you talked about sort of exiting the [inaudible] at about 31%. Can you just help us parse out the dynamics from the gantry chips for the higher cost coming through the backlog here versus your network optimization plans? What are the relative impacts of those two drivers? And as we look to fiscal \u201825, should we be thinking of that 31% as a good jumping off point off of which you expect to see quarter-over- quarter expansion?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes, so let me take it into part two on the gross margin line. The chips in the network optimization efforts are probably about a 50 to 75 point basis headwinds to gross margins. And again, we see have line of sight to that improving over the course of the year, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks on operating expenses. If you looked at just Q1, if you took out the impact of kind of the seasonally high Q1, operating expenses, operating margins would been close to that 30%. So just moving through the year as we see those dynamics of the gross margin. In the normal step down and operating expenses, we see line of sight to extend year 31%. I do think that is a good jumping off point, I think I would caution from significant improvement over the course of \u201925 from there, given those are really, as we said, peer leading operating expenses. And we always want to continue to make sure that we are investing the right amount back into R&D and innovation and see the benefits like we saw last night with the approval of digital cytology.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Patrick Donnelly with Citi.\nPatrick Donnelly: Hey, guys, how are you? Thanks for taking the question. Steve, maybe one for you on the Diagnostics business. It sounds like the rest of the year going to kind of hang around that 5% to 7% framework inside there. I think one of the reasons for the uptick was improve utilization. Obviously, that utilization piece has been a big focus as we come out of COVID. Now that we're in a relatively, hopefully relatively stable environment on the testing side without COVID. Can you just talk about utilization metrics that you're seeing? What gives you guys the confidence on that trajectory? Any metrics will be helpful there.\nSteve MacMillan: Yes, sure. Patrick, I think the biggest metric obviously we track over time is just purely revenue. And I think we continue to feel good but the internals on that are, if you go customer by customer, we continue to grow our portfolio with a lot of our customers and not to be overlooked are our largest customers in the US, as they shift from Tigris to Panther, it is opening up additional menu opportunities for them to be adopting things like BV, CV and some of our other products. So we see really good growth with our largest customers in the US, we're also continuing to see, and what we're still in the early-ish innings is the international expansion and all those Panthers we placed internationally during COVID, as those are coming online. And I think what I love about these businesses, frankly, is they bring on one or two assays at a time, they get more experience, and then they bring more. And so it's not like a one off pop. That frankly might be better in the short term, but the harder to laugh. And so what we really have going on around the world, our customers all over the place, just gradually bringing on either additional assays or as we come out with new menu, being able to build that and that installed base of Panthers that we're able to just drive more throughput through is what really makes us feel very good about the future.\nKarleen Oberton: I'll just add two points to that, Patrick, while we haven't given up our Panther utilization, I would say that we are seeing that our Panther utilization grow year-over-year. And the other metric I would give you that we went back to 2019, around 20% of our customers were running four more assays, that's probably close to doubled here at the end of \u201823. So those are things that should give us confidence of the stickiness of the Panther and the customers are adding menu.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research.\nJack Meehan: Thanks. Good afternoon, Steve. There's always next season, soon enough.\nSteve MacMillan: That\u2019s right. Asterix is also a big Eagles fan. So we got covered.\nJack Meehan: Oh, man. Yes, the payment frame. Well, wanted to get your thoughts on the Diagnostics business at Biotheranostics. Could you just give us an update? Talk about the growth runway for the breast cancer index test? And I think Karleen, you mentioned growth was accretive, but did it slow a little bit? Was that related to selling days or just any color would be great?\nSteve MacMillan: Yes, I think Jack, the more we look at the BCI test and the opportunities ahead of us, I think we're still in the earlier innings on what that business can become. And there's, since we've owned it, and watching the team operate, I think we just feel incredibly good about the long term potential. So it was still well accretive and still growing nicely here. We just don't want to be breaking it out down to the level given the size of it, but feel really, really good about the opportunity.\nJack Meehan: All right, and then, the cash on the balance sheet, continue to get a lot of questions around M&A priorities for Hologic. The recent questions we've gotten had been around, interest in doing things in the med tech world, was wondering if you could just comment on that. And then, kind of on the Biotheranostics team, just like the world of specialty labs, kind of using that as a foray into that world. Just any color on M&A strategy would be great.\nSteve MacMillan: Yes, I think Jack, I think that the magic that because we are both Diagnostics and med tech, to your first part of that question. It does open up the opportunity for additional things, and we're seeing some interesting things that would allow us to build on our Surgical platform or our breast cancer, the breast surgery business areas. So we continue to look in those areas. And frankly, I think some of the valuations in those areas might be a little bit better than say, for example, some of the Diagnostics one. So I think we certainly can shop in that aisle. And coming back to the second part of your question and the other aisle, we can shop in the specialty labs. I think one of the things we're really proud of with Biotheranostics is it actually makes money which you very well know that a lot of the specialty labs there's a lot of great top line revenue, but a lot of expense and not much profit. And so I think we continue to want to be thinking about things that can be generating bottom line. As Karleen is staring at me hard right now. I'm making part of that up, but I've worked with her long enough to know her discipline so we're being very mindful and careful in that space and continuing to feel like, what we know we're good at is taking existing assets that are on the market and operating them pretty well. We don't want to take on, wildly diluted things, just because we have the cash. And we've continued to, I think, be patient and the underlying performance of our businesses continues to give us that ability to be patient. So hopefully, that gave you the landscape here, Jack. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from John Sourbeer with UBS,\nJohn Sourbeer: Good afternoon, and thanks for taking the question. Just a question on the start off on the Breast health business, any updates on what the backlog looks like there? And how many quarters of backlog that you have? And just how would that compare to a normal backlog in that business?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes, I think we certainly have several quarters of backlog probably going into early \u201925 at what I'll call elevated levels. We traditionally have but backlog for this business, given the capital nature of it, but we see it being elevated for probably the next three to five quarters, as we work through that backlog and supply, the gantries to our customers.\nJohn Sourbeer: Got it. And then, as a follow up on the Diagnostics business and in the Panther, I appreciate that you're not providing a full through there and I mean just but just anyway like quantitative or qualitative lead to provide on just what type of improvement on customer spending you're seeing with the addition of the Fusion sidecar.\nKarleen Oberton: So what I would say is that the respiratory menu is on the Fusion sidecar. So that's where we see the most upside coming through in that respiratory menu. But certainly, as we've talked about BV, CVs is really leading the growth in the Molecular Diagnostics business at this point primarily in the US longer term. That's a great opportunity internationally. But also seeing customers take on some of our legacy women's health assays as well. So feel good about that the whole menu is driving the growth but led by BV, CV at this point.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.\nVijay Kumar: Hey, guys, congrats on the [inaudible]. Thanks for taking my question. Hi, Steve. And maybe my first one for you here on, it was helpful for you to talk about those growth drivers. I'm curious what percentage of revenues do you think are growing high single sustainably? What percentage should be growing mid-single-ish? And what percentage of revenues are low singles? Have you looked at that analysis? I'm just curious on when you say 5% or 7%. How investors could get comfortable when they do the sum of the cost between with -- on the business segments?\nSteve MacMillan: Yes, I think we think about it by business segment. And I think what we've really said, Vijay is that each of our businesses this year should be within that 5% to 7%. So I think that has us feel really good. Obviously, within each of the businesses, we're not going to go down that product line by product line, right. But if you played it out, right, Surgical, you got MyoSure and Fluent growing faster than that you have NovaSure lower than that, right. We've got that always across the businesses. But I think the way to think about it is we feel really good about each of our businesses growing in that range. And I will tell you that internationally, each of those businesses is certainly at the higher end of that range, if not slightly beyond. So we've got it across, every business has growth drivers. And like any business, there's always a few that aren't growing as fast. And, that's just the nature of the beast. But overall, I think what we're, again, magically, every one of our businesses is in that frame.\nVijay Kumar: Understood. And Karleen, maybe one view on the guidance like Q1 came in mid singles, despite the day's headwinds 2Q guidance is for about 3.5. Why, when I just think about the 3.5 five versus the five you did in Q1, is it just the comps, what\u2019s driving 2Q and when you think about the back half step up from first half to hit the annual guide, is that just the days normalization and back half or any other drivers we should be looking at the back half?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes, the biggest issue here in Q2 is the comps that is driving. So if you looked at Q2 of \u201823 DX ex- COVID grown 15%, molecular within that grown 24%, breast over 25% and surgical over 25%. So I think what we've been saying all along is that Q2 was just a standing quarter. Proud of that quarter. As we went into Q3 and Q4, we have more normalized comps that were going against that drive that improved growth rate in the back half.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Anthony Petrone with Mizuho Group.\nUnidentified Analyst : Hey, guys, this is Dimitri speaking for Anthony. Congratulations on great quarter. I just saw I wanted to ask about like the Molecular Diagnostics, ex-COVID. Seems like might have slowed down this quarter versus like year-over-year, and just a little bit more color on that this quarter. And kind of like your expectations for Q2, do you see like a stronger respiratory virus season. How should we think about that?\nSteve MacMillan: Yes, I think the big piece that affected molecular in the quarter, the single biggest was the four fewer selling days. It's a disposable run rate business. And if you think about that, that knocked, between 400 and 600 basis points off the quarterly growth rate, frankly, depending on exactly how the days fall. And both that quarter and this quarter that we're in now, the second quarter are going against these ridiculously strong comps of over 20-ish percent molecular growth from a year ago. But I think the overall run rate, and the sheer size of the businesses now we feel very good about.\nUnidentified Analyst : Sounds great. And you guys gave full year guidance for COVID. Should we be thinking about that kind of the new baseline now going forward?\nKarleen Oberton: I think, as we've talked about, we think of COVID as upside. So as the guide would indicate as a continued step down each quarter. I mean, it's hard to really tell if there's another flu season next year that drives a little elevated COVID. But, again, we were looking at his upside. And so, maybe even think about something less than what we're anticipating for \u201824 and \u201825.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners.\nPuneet Souda: Yes, hi, Steve, Karleen, thanks for taking the questions. Yes, hey, Steve. So first one on Genius Digital DX system, can you just remind me in a positive if I miss this, any changes to pricing or margins as a result? And maybe just I know, ThinPrep remains the same. But, can you just talk a little bit about, how do you see the adoption of this in a market that's fairly established already? And then I have a follow up for Karleen.\nSteve MacMillan: Sure. Thanks, Puneet. Yes, don't assume a real change in the margin structure. I think the real win here is for is the workflow, I will tell you, our key customers are incredibly excited, as you will know, right? One of the biggest issues right now, running labs, everything else is workers and cytologists especially trying to read these slides. It's been a very manual and labor intensive process. I can tell you going back to one of my first meetings with Quest, when I got in this role, almost 10 years ago, call that meeting with nine years ago, with discussions around, the workflow of cytology, and it was one of their biggest concerns. So our team has gone out and really addressing that, and I think the magic is going to be unleashing that as we are internationally as well. It's been part of what's starting to drive the growth in our European business has been having that approval already over there. So feeling really good, as well as, frankly, the reduction of the false negatives. So it's just that much more accurate. And going forward. So I think it's going to breed, we think it's going to breed some new life. Particularly, it's been the excitement from our customers that I think has been the galvanizing part for us.\nPuneet Souda: Got it. That's super helpful. And then the Karleen on, I wanted to ask about the tax rate. How are you thinking about the net result of the 15% global tax rate, if that was implemented, and then R&D tax credit that just sort of came through with the tax bill passing in the house, netting those effects, how should we think about the tax rate longer term for Hologic?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes, so let me first frame that to extent the global minimum tax rate is in fact good for us. It doesn't impact us till fiscal \u201826. So we've got some time before we have to deal with that I would say, given this lack of legislation here in the US, it's really hard to say what the impact is. But I would tend to think it'd be more on the middle side, given that our tax rate is already over the 15%. In regard to the change in the amortization for R&D expense, probably minimally favorable for us, but really minimal impact given us just a timing issue, really, in any event.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG.\nRyan Zimmerman: Hey, thanks for taking the questions this evening. I want to start with Breast health, had an opportunity to spend some time with Eric and the team at RSNA. And I just curious because you mentioned the increase in gantries and just help us understand kind of where we're at, in the placement of gantries relative to sockets and just how much of the growth is coming from, new software like Genius AI detection, and things like that. And as we normalize for comps, what the right way to think about the growth of the Breast health businesses, given this mix now that's moving maybe away from equipment to more software.\nSteve MacMillan: You're right, I wouldn't underestimate that there's still going to be continued gantry placement. So a lot of the core is actually still the gantry placements. And then it's the service and the revenue and the additional AI and other things that we sell underneath it. But I think we continue to feel very good about the gantry placements, really from a couple of standpoints. First off, there's still kind of the tail end of going from 2D to 3D. But we're really into the mode now of also the early adopters of 3D. Their machines are now need to be upgraded. And with all the additional enhancements we've made to the system, we continue to place those gantries, so I think it's and we've turned it into certainly a much more diversified business. But at the core the gantries are still a very key foundational component of the strength of our business.\nRyan Zimmerman: Okay, that's helpful, Steve, and then just piggybacking off that, I mean, I'd love to get your assessment on the CapEx environment we've heard from, some of your peers already, we have some 340B money that's kind of making its way back to hospitals, which may or may not be making its way in the capital equipment demand. But I'd love to get your view of kind of the year ahead on the CapEx demand from a logic perspective.\nSteve MacMillan: Yes, I think we continue to feel pretty good from, most of our customers around the CapEx side, I think when people were more fearful year, year and a half ago, we kind of felt like it was still okay, if there's little bits that dribble back in that's fine, too. But I think overall, we think we're in reasonable position and not seeing any dramatic changes one way or the other, least affecting our business. And again, we're not the biggest capital component for the hospitals, as are the ERP systems or the certainly the big iron pieces, we continue to feel like, regardless, we're in a good position.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Casey Woodring with JPMorgan.\nCasey Woodring: Great, thank you for taking my questions. Maybe one for Karleen on the other income line, can you please be specific on what you're assuming for non-GAAP interest income, interest expense and other income for 2Q and the full year, by my math, I'm getting the $6 million of net interest and other income for 1Q and you're getting to $30 million to $50 million of other expense for the year. So just trying to bridge 1Q through the rest of the year?\nKarleen Oberton: Yes, so 1Q was a little unique in that and two pieces, our interest income was actually higher than our interest expense. Given that we still had a favorable interest rate hedging place which actually expired at the end of December. So moving forward, our interest expense, our weighted average cost of debt will increase about 100 basis points through the balance of the year, which really drives that flip and that interest expense will be higher than interest income, to the tune of roughly that $30 million to $50 million. Also in Q1 is we had about $4 million to $5 million of benefit below the line from our mark-to-market investments which really our EPS mutual they offset mark-to-market liability on deferred compensation. So we really don't forecast any benefit or expense related to that because again, this offset and operating expenses so it's really maintaining a high cash balance and I'm assuming some deployment as we exit the year. But it's really that exploration of that interest rate hedge contract that drives higher interest expense.\nCasey Woodring: Got it, that's helpful. And then maybe just if I can sneak one more in on the international piece saw very strong growth there above the fleet average, I think 33%, constant currency in breast. I know, international revenues inherently lower margin. You've talked about that before. But curious if you're doing anything there to drive that contribution margin higher, and investments you're making outside the US and how should we think about international margin expansion versus the fleet average kind of moving forward? Thank you.\nSteve MacMillan: Yes, we're really proud of what the international team has been doing and looking at selective pricing opportunities. They've been very disciplined on the cost side, so that we're still dilutive. Our international growth is still diluted, certainly to the gross margin, and it touch on the operating margin. But our team's being very disciplined and try to help lessen that gap over time.\nKarleen Oberton: Yes, and I think there's opportunities as we go direct in key markets, not only do we see better revenue performance, but that is usually typically accretive to the margin line as well.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.\nDerik Bruin: Hi, good evening. Hey, sorry, I don't do -- I typically don't do sports references. So I'm, I won\u2019t make one. But just out of, so I know you say that the markets not trench warfare, but I mean, you do have, I mean, you do have really strong competitors in viral load testing and STI testing. How should we sort of think about what your market shares are? And what's around? Because I mean, clear, I mean, there's, is it the market? Is the market to the testing or expanding for these? Or are they stagnating? I'm just curious about sort of like market growth? And then can you talk a little bit about what's your pipeline beyond BV, CV/TV and just, what other sort of like diet, what other sort of like molecular assays can be sort of be added? So it's question on like, what's the market expansion opportunities in some of these markets that are more, I would say competitive and hadn't historically grown a lot? And versus what's the new pipeline? Thanks.\nSteve MacMillan: Hey, Derik, starting on, there certainly as we face very formidable competitors. And there's a lot of hand to hand combat. The flip side is, and I think it is the piece that people consistently miss, is how much opportunity there is to expand our markets, right? Let's go to surgical for a moment. Nobody ever would have imagined that MyoSure would have someday gotten to be as big as NovaSure, when we first launched it. And now it dwarfs NovaSure, and is still growing strongly as we've come out with BV, CV, BV, CV may become our largest assay, it's sometimes it's hard to fully understand the impact in the end size of the market creation that we're doing. So we just want people to understand it's hard to fully identify because we're growing and building these markets. And when you look at even some of the data that we got from the Global Women's Health Index, where women's health sits, and testing sits globally, is still a fraction of what it should be, right? If you consider that only 10% of all women in the world got tested that should for STIs, that alone would say the market is probably 10x. Now, we're not going to realize that in the next five years either. So to call the total available market, truly 10x because it's not quite accessible at that level. It's we're in between. So, I think the gist is we continue to pioneer new products, new assays, and grow and create these markets over time.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Mike Matson with Needham and Company.\nMike Matson: Yes, thanks. Thanks for taking my questions. I want to follow up on the earlier question just on the gantries in the mammography business side. I understand that you've made a number of enhancements and so forth, but I believe the platform's fairly been around for a while now. So, I mean, is there any, and I know you're not trying to be a capital focus, boom bust and all that stuff, but it seems like every company's got a kind of launching new platform every once in a while. So I mean, is that something we could see in the near term maybe?\nSteve MacMillan: Yes, completely. So first as a reminder, recall that we did launch our 3D performance and then our 3D. And what we've been doing is gradually improving, and working in better imaging, better detection all through. So it's not like we're selling a 10 year old product, even though we'd be up at it's now 10 years, a little 11 years since we got the 3D approved, but we've been selling newer products along the way. And having said that, we are working on additional hardware and gantry changes as well, that will evolve here, over the next few years.\nMike Matson: Okay, thanks. So just in and then just on M&A, I think there was another question kind of about, the areas that you're looking at. But I guess I wanted to ask about just potential size of the deals, because I feel like you've kind of hinted or maybe directly commented in the past that you are potentially open to larger deals if you found the right thing. And by larger, I mean kind billion plus.\nSteve MacMillan: Yes, I think, we would consider something in that range. If it brings significant revenue, and frankly, EBITDA. So, we're not going to embark on something of that size for a science project or something early stage or something that's losing money, I would say, you would only expect us to do something like that we have the capacity. But it would have to be a pretty special asset. There's not a lot of things, but there are a few things we're looking at in that range. And we continue to be incredibly disciplined, but it will be established businesses that we think, we can improve upon in terms of their ability to contribute to us. So thank you.\nRyan Simon : Hey, Cynthia, this is Ryan, in consideration of time, we'll take one final question.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Navann Ty with BNP.\nNavann Ty: Hi, thank you for taking my question, good evening. Maybe my first question if you can discuss your AI capabilities versus competition, including with breast health versus recent innovation like competitors. And a second question, following up on your comments regarding the [inaudible] international that you're meeting. Can you discuss the size of the long term opportunity outside of the US and any potential structural differences?\nSteve MacMillan: Yes, I think, relative to the AI front, as it relates to Breast health, we've been, on the leading edge for quite some time between our CAD programs and A, the Genius AI Detection program. So we continue to feel very good, particularly as it relates to the workflow advantages, and the linkage to our workstations and our products. And on the second question of international, I think, again, we've been generating, frankly, double digit growth for our international business for the better part, yes, excluding COVID-ish for last five or six years, and continue to see international being accretive to our overall growth rate here for years to come. So thank you very much.\nOperator: This concludes today's question and answer session. And this now concludes Hologic\u2019s First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you and have a good evening.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Essex Mitchell",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As we've commented over the past several quarters, we have dramatically transformed our business since 2019 through the challenges of the pandemic. More recently, as we move further away from the peaks of COVID testing and prevalence, we have posted exceptional ex-COVID results. These results back up our claim that we are much more than a COVID story, and without doubt build for the long term. At the same time, as Steve mentioned, there is a lot to unpack to fully understand our business. Many recognize that we are a new Hologic compared to where we were in fiscal 2018. Since then, we've grown our Molecular Diagnostics business approximately 80%, our Breast business nearly 10% and our Surgical business nearly 40%. Yet there are still some on the fence and uncertain of our future growth potential. As some of our peers have also performed well over this time period, it's not easy to see the throughway. The underlying assumption is that winner must be exclusively taking share. In reality, there was much more to it. In addition to competing and taking share, Hologic growth is centered on innovation, and making sure. We then drive this innovation to commercial execution by leveraging our world class sales teams. As we are positioned today, our future growth is much less about hand to hand combat in the trenches of the markets where we operate. Instead, our growth is derived from growing and expanding market through education, awareness, innovative new products, and tapping into under penetrated markets. As an example, our three largest revenue product lines launched in 2019, excluding COVID are BV, CV/TV, Biotheranostics and Fluent. These three lines alone collectively delivered over 300 million in revenue in 2023. That was essentially nonexistent to start 2019. Moreover, each product line falls into one or more of our market creating strategies, and each is still in their earlier stages of growth. Similarly, outside of the top three, we have a number of other product lines and new since 2019 which could each individually represent $100 million revenue opportunities over time. And these lines are also still in their early innings of growth. To highlight a few are respiratory assays, GYN scopes, and laparoscopic surgical portfolio, each delivered to double digit growth rates for fiscal \u201823. On top of our market expansion activity, we continue to drive further growth by leveraging our large installs in user bases of core products in each division. Through the Panther, our gantry and our hysteroscopic surgical portfolio, we have incredibly deep customer relationships in each of our unique channels. Post COVID, our call points around the world are stronger than ever. Customers associate Hologic with industry leading differentiated technologies, ongoing innovation, best-in-class workflow and automation solutions. Moreover, our strong reputation as leaders and champions for Women's Health continues to open doors. Earning this advantage provide us a unique opportunity to supercharge growth from products introduced into our channel. While there are many out there that claim to be winners, even in categories, we continue to lead year-over-year, we are extremely confident in our ability to carve out a great opportunity for growth. Similarly, we are equally confident in our demonstrated ability to gain and maintain market share across our core product lines. With our core businesses, incredibly healthy, and many of our growth driving products still in early innings. All-in, we believe we are well positioned for the future and well positioned to maintain our strong performance for the years to come. Steve?"

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Karleen Oberton",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve. And good afternoon, everyone. And congratulations again to our Diagnostics team. In my statements, today, I will provide an overview of our divisional revenue results, and walk down our income statement that highlights the broad based strong performance across our business. I will also touch on a few additional key financial metrics and finish with our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal \u201824 in the full year. Jumping right in, we are pleased to share that our first quarter financial performance was strong. We exceeded our expectations on both the top and bottom line. Total revenue came in at $1.013 billion, beating the midpoint of our guidance by about $40 million. As Steve mentioned, despite four fewer selling days in the quarter, we delivered organic revenue growth of 5.2% excluding the impact of COVID in line with our long term revenue growth target of 5% to 7%. In addition, non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.98, exceeding the high end of our guidance. Overall, we continue to deliver robust performance on both the top and bottom lines. Before moving to our divisional results, we again want to emphasize that our balance sheet and willingness to deploy capital remain a core strength of our business in a macroenvironment that remains dynamic. As an example, in our first quarter, we initiated a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program, we purchased an additional $150 million of our stock and also pay down $250 million of floating rate debt with a cash balance of $1.9 billion, a leverage ratio well below our target range, and roughly $350 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. We have significant firepower and flexibility to deploy further capital should the opportunity arise. Turning to our divisional results. In Diagnostics, first quarter revenue of $447.8 million declined 20.6%. Excluding COVID assay and related ancillary revenue, Diagnostics revenue declined 0.9%. Yet adjusted for selling days we estimate we grew mid-single digits compared to the prior year. As a reminder, Q1 \u201823 was a very strong quarter for Diagnostics, boasting 15.8% growth ex- COVID and Molecular Diagnostics 24.5% growth ex-COVID. And without a doubt, our Q1 \u201824 results were impacted by four fewer selling days compared to the prior year. Within Diagnostics, our molecular business continues to drive the divisions results, it will bring growth of 1.9% ex-COVID or mid to high single digits when adjusted for the impact of fewer selling days. We continue to see underlying strength and BV, CV/TV which grew more than 20% in the quarter, and it's still in its early innings of adoption by our customers. More than 95% of our BV, CV/TV revenue is derived in the US, representing incredible longer term opportunity internationally. In addition, non-COVID respiratory revenue delivered ahead of our expectations. As we experienced stronger than anticipated demand for our flu, RSV, and 4-Plex assays. Our responding with published CDC data on respiratory virus positivity. Sales ramped up and in the final weeks of the quarter. Finally Biotheranostics remains a positive driver of growth for our molecular business, and delivered accretive revenue performance in the period. Now moving to Breast Health, total first quarter revenue of $377.7 million increased 12.2% showcasing solid double digit growth. Demand for our gantries remains robust and our interventional business also delivered a strong quarter. In our gantry business, we continue to benefit from a strong cadence of orders. And our elevated backlog continues to give us high confidence in the performance of this business going forward. Finally, as a reminder, Q1 \u201823 results were impacted by constrained supply. In interventional, we continue to see strong performance from our Brevera needles, as well as from our 2-Mark markers used for marking biopsy sites in suspicious lesions and pressed tissue. Leveraging strong performance in the quarter, we believe our Breast health franchise remains well positioned to deliver on its financial targets in fiscal \u201824. Continuing next to Surgical, our first quarter revenue of $162.2 million increased 4.6% or high single digits when adjusted for selling days. The divisions growth continues to be fueled by MyoSure and the Related fluid system, with an increasing contribution from our laparoscopic portfolio. As anticipated, NovaSure declined in Q1 as we lapped the selling price contribution from the products V5 extension introduced just before fiscal \u201823. And finally, in our Skeletal business, first quarter revenue of $25.4 million declined 5.6% from lower capital placement and upgrades. Now let's move on to the rest of the non-GAAP P&L for the first quarter. Gross margin of 60.8% was driven primarily by strong performance in our base business and higher than expected COVID revenues, which carries a favorable impact to our margin. However, as anticipated, our gross margin result remains temporarily depressed due to the ongoing amortization of semiconductor chips purchased at higher costs during the chip supply headwind. As we continue to deploy gantries, we are moving farther away from this high priced inventory. And as a result, we expect margins to continue to benefit from this inventory cycling as we progress through the year. Shifting to operating expenses, total operating expenses of $327.3 million in the first quarter decreased by 3.6%. This decrease in the period was driven by lower marketing spend, lower cost from fewer days and less expense due to the recently divested SSI business. For Q1 '23, this translates to a 28.5% operating margin in line with our expectations. While we continue to deliver a peer group leading operating margins, we continue to exercise operational discipline and continuously seek to improve where it makes sense for our business. Below operating income, other income net represented a gain in our fiscal first quarter. As expected, we benefited from elevated cash balance and high interest rates, even though we deployed significant cash in the quarter. Finally, our tax rate in Q1 was 19.75% as expected. Moving on from the P&L, cash flow from operations was $220 million in the first quarter. In addition, as previously mentioned, during Q1 we repurchased 2.2 million shares for $150 million. This activity was above and beyond initiating a $500 million ASR showcasing our high confidence in our business and willingness to bet on ourselves, as well as our ongoing strategy to deploy capital. Now let's move on to our non-GAAP financial guidance for the second quarter and full year fiscal \u201824. For our fiscal Q2 \u201824, we are expecting total revenue in the range of %990 million to $1.01 billion and EPS of $0.95 to $1. For the full year '24, our guidance assumes revenue of $3.99 billion to $4.065 billion and EPS of $3.97 to $4.12. With respect to foreign exchange, we are assuming an FX tailwind of $2 million for Q2 and $12 million for fiscal \u201824. Much of this tailwind was realized in Q1 and therefore we estimate that foreign exchange will remain neutral to marginally favorable throughout the remainder of the year. Turning to our divisions, we want to reiterate that we expect each business to grow at least 5% to 7% for the full fiscal \u201824, excluding the impact of COVID. Starting with Diagnostics, we expect the business to grow within our 5% to 7% long term framework for the remainder of fiscal \u201824. While performance was below this level on Q1, primarily due to the impact of fewer selling days compared to the prior year period, we expect the division to return to more normal growth in Q2, and for the remainder of our fiscal year. We expect improving utilization and menu expansion on the Panther coupled with ongoing contributions from Biotheranostics to continue to drive molecular growth, losing out on non-COVID Diagnostics, we expect blood revenue of approximately $7 million in Q2, and $30 million for the year. In terms of COVID revenue, we expect COVID assay sales to be approximately $20 million in the second quarter of \u201824 and $60 million for the full year. COVID related items are expected to be slightly less than $30 million in the second quarter, and approximately $105 million for the full year fiscal \u201824. Moving to Breast health, we continue to expect fiscal \u201824 to showcase strong demand for our portfolio products and services. While moving on it's important to understand the top dynamics that will impact the Breast business through fiscal \u201824. As previously noted, Q1 \u201823 with a softer comp due to shift supply constraints. As a reminder in Q2 \u201823, we delivered a strong quarter gantry placement to meet pent-up customer demand during these earlier days of chip supply recovery. And deliveries in Q3 and Q4 of '23 were both lower than Q2. We expect this dynamic to result in a lower Breast health year-over-year growth rate in Q2 that will improve in the back half of fiscal '24. For the full year, we continue to expect to deliver more gantries in fiscal \u201824 than in '23 as we move further from the chip supply headwinds, while maintaining excellent demand visibility. Finally, in Surgical, we anticipate our full year fiscal \u201824 revenue growth to be at the high end of our 5% to 7% long term target. Although impacted by fewer selling days, Q1 started the year strong and we expect the business to perform well in Q2 in the remainder of the fiscal year. Moving next to margins, our guidance assumes a cadence of improvement throughout fiscal '24 for both gross margin and operating margin. For gross margin, we anticipate Q2 levels similar to Q1 exiting the fiscal year in the low 60s. As well, our guidance assumes Q2 operating margins approaching 30% with the Q4 \u201824 exit rate around 31%. Continuing down the P&L, we expect Q2 operating expenses to step down from Q1. As a reminder, Q1 is typically our highest spend quarter seasonally. As we kickoff the fiscal year with our internal global sales meetings, and major trade show events such as RSNA. For the balance of the year, we anticipate quarterly operating expenses to be about $300 million to $310 million. Although operating income, we estimate fiscal \u201824 other income net to be an expense of approximately $10 million in Q2 and an expense between $30 million to $50 million for the full year. Our current guidance assumes an increase in interest income relative to our previous guide, as we expect to have a higher cash balance throughout the remainder of the fiscal year. Our guidance is based on an annual effective tax rate of approximately 19.75%. And diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately 239 million for the full year. To conclude Q1 was a strong quarter across each of our businesses and sets us up nicely for the rest of the year. As we close Q1, we move forward to Q2 in fiscal \u201824 with good momentum and as always remain focused on advancing women's health around the world while delivering on our promises and commitments to our shareholders, employees, customers and patients around the world. With that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions. Yes, so let me take it into part two on the gross margin line. The chips in the network optimization efforts are probably about a 50 to 75 point basis headwinds to gross margins. And again, we see have line of sight to that improving over the course of the year, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks on operating expenses. If you looked at just Q1, if you took out the impact of kind of the seasonally high Q1, operating expenses, operating margins would been close to that 30%. So just moving through the year as we see those dynamics of the gross margin. In the normal step down and operating expenses, we see line of sight to extend year 31%. I do think that is a good jumping off point, I think I would caution from significant improvement over the course of '25 from there, given those are really, as we said, peer leading operating expenses. And we always want to continue to make sure that we are investing the right amount back into R&D and innovation and see the benefits like we saw last night with the approval of digital cytology. I'll just add two points to that, Patrick, while we haven't given up our Panther utilization, I would say that we are seeing that our Panther utilization grow year-over-year. And the other metric I would give you that we went back to 2019, around 20% of our customers were running four more assays, that's probably close to doubled here at the end of \u201823. So those are things that should give us confidence of the stickiness of the Panther and the customers are adding menu. Yes, I think we certainly have several quarters of backlog probably going into early '25 at what I'll call elevated levels. We traditionally have but backlog for this business, given the capital nature of it, but we see it being elevated for probably the next three to five quarters, as we work through that backlog and supply, the gantries to our customers. So what I would say is that the respiratory menu is on the Fusion sidecar. So that's where we see the most upside coming through in that respiratory menu. But certainly, as we've talked about BV, CVs is really leading the growth in the Molecular Diagnostics business at this point primarily in the US longer term. That's a great opportunity internationally. But also seeing customers take on some of our legacy women's health assays as well. So feel good about that the whole menu is driving the growth but led by BV, CV at this point. Yes, the biggest issue here in Q2 is the comps that is driving. So if you looked at Q2 of \u201823 DX ex- COVID grown 15%, molecular within that grown 24%, breast over 25% and surgical over 25%. So I think what we've been saying all along is that Q2 was just a standing quarter. Proud of that quarter. As we went into Q3 and Q4, we have more normalized comps that were going against that drive that improved growth rate in the back half. I think, as we've talked about, we think of COVID as upside. So as the guide would indicate as a continued step down each quarter. I mean, it's hard to really tell if there's another flu season next year that drives a little elevated COVID. But, again, we were looking at his upside. And so, maybe even think about something less than what we're anticipating for \u201824 and \u201825. Yes, so let me first frame that to extent the global minimum tax rate is in fact good for us. It doesn't impact us till fiscal \u201826. So we've got some time before we have to deal with that I would say, given this lack of legislation here in the US, it's really hard to say what the impact is. But I would tend to think it'd be more on the middle side, given that our tax rate is already over the 15%. In regard to the change in the amortization for R&D expense, probably minimally favorable for us, but really minimal impact given us just a timing issue, really, in any event. Yes, so 1Q was a little unique in that and two pieces, our interest income was actually higher than our interest expense. Given that we still had a favorable interest rate hedging place which actually expired at the end of December. So moving forward, our interest expense, our weighted average cost of debt will increase about 100 basis points through the balance of the year, which really drives that flip and that interest expense will be higher than interest income, to the tune of roughly that $30 million to $50 million. Also in Q1 is we had about $4 million to $5 million of benefit below the line from our mark-to-market investments which really our EPS mutual they offset mark-to-market liability on deferred compensation. So we really don't forecast any benefit or expense related to that because again, this offset and operating expenses so it's really maintaining a high cash balance and I'm assuming some deployment as we exit the year. But it's really that exploration of that interest rate hedge contract that drives higher interest expense. Yes, and I think there's opportunities as we go direct in key markets, not only do we see better revenue performance, but that is usually typically accretive to the margin line as well."

            "name": "Steve MacMillan",
            "content": "Thank you, Ryan. And good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. For the quarter, total revenue was $1.01 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.98. Both revenue and EPS came in above the high end of our guidance. Before diving into our results, it is important to view our Q1 growth performance in proper perspective. Simply put, our first two quarters of fiscal \u201824 face incredibly difficult comps. Despite Q1 \u201824 having four fewer selling days compared to the prior year, and even against a prior year Molecular Diagnostics ex-COVID revenue growth of 24 .5%, and a Surgical revenue growth rate of nearly 15%, we grew total organic revenue, ex-COVID, a solid 5.2%. Even more impressive, when adjusting four fewer selling days, our Q1 results stand taller. On an adjusted basis, we estimate the total company organic revenue growth ex-COVID was in the high single digits for the period. These are incredibly strong results against challenging comps as we continue to perform exceptionally well against our 5% to 7% percent ex-COVID long-term target. We continue to showcase our durability and broad strength across our divisions, both delivering on our short-term guidance and maintaining our long-term targets. Keep in mind that our long-term revenue targets are more impressive today, given we are growing off a much larger base than we originally contemplated. As we've said before, you can count on us to deliver. During our call today, we will focus on building upon our messaging from the JPMorgan conference three weeks ago. During our presentation, we highlighted that we are a new Hologic bigger, faster, stronger, and poised for continued success. As part of our discussion, Essex will share more insights about our high confidence in our future success. He will also shed light on what we view as underappreciated elements of our growth strategy that are helpful to fully recognize the potential of our business. Before then turning the call over to Karleen to discuss our detailed financial results, we will share reflections from our participation at the World Economic Forum in Davos. While we continue to make progress elevating women's health, it is clear we still have a long way to go. Starting with our meetings at JPMorgan, we realize there are two camps of investors. There is one camp that understands our transformation and recognizes the drivers powering our current results and future growth potential. At the same time, there is another camp that, quite frankly, does not. That said, we certainly appreciate the complexity. Over the past three years, there have been many moving pieces clouding the narrative of the force we've become. From revenue still normalizing following the ups and downs of COVID, to moving past semiconductor chip supply challenges, to selling days dynamics, only naming a few, each has contributed to irregular comps that may be difficult to interpret, and also challenging tomorrow. We appreciate that each represents a layer of complexity that must be pulled back to fully appreciate the underlying strength of our business. Looking beyond the quarterly nuances, our steady performance over time really shines. Above all, we are bigger, faster, stronger, and poised for further growth. We are a durable and diversified growth company with disciplined operations, peer group leading margins, an exceptionally strong balance sheet, and above all, a talented and engaged employee workforce. We are poised to continue to drive top-line growth while growing the bottom line even faster. To shed more light on what gives us high confidence in our future, I'll pass it over to Essex. Thank you, Essex. To close out the discussion of our growth prospects. While we continue to make significant progress outside of the US, we still have tremendous opportunity to grow and build a much greater presence internationally. Shifting gears before turning the call over to Karleen, we'd like to share reflections from our time at the World Economic Forum in Davos. For a third year in a row we had the opportunity to participate at the forum, where we presented the results of our third annual Hologic Global Women's Health Index. The Index, which is the largest study of its kind, examining the overall state of women's health and wellbeing continues to generate tremendous support from major organizations dedicated to improving women's health. As we've said before, over time, we believe the Index may be the single greatest contribution to the world that we make at Hologic. This year's results show that we all need to stand behind women more than ever. The harsh reality is that women's health globally has not only stagnated over the past year, but is sadly moving in the wrong direction. The data shows that only 11% of women were screened for cancer and only 10% for STIs. Billions of women are not being screened, this must change. And we have a tremendous opportunity to lead the way with our women's health portfolio. The key takeaway here is that in many ways, our markets are still in the early innings of reaching their potential. As we look ahead, we are even more inspired to live into our purpose, passion, and promise. We continue to believe and we have proven that we can drive results through our unwavering commitment to women's health. Our strong results come from our strong purpose. And finally, in late breaking news, we are incredibly proud to announce that just last night, our new Genius Digital Diagnostic system, with the Genius Cervical AI algorithm received clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration. This accomplishment is only made possible by the creativity, focus and dedication of our outstanding Diagnostics team. Continuing to trailblaze our path. Our system is the first and only FDA cleared digital cytology system that combines deep learning based AI with advanced imaging technology. It can help more accurately detect cervical cancer, improve psychology workflow, and ultimately enhance patient care. We continue to deliver and at a time when women need it most. With that, let me hand the call over to Karleen. I think regardless of what happens with the guidelines, we see co-testing is being well entrenched. And if anything, it's going to probably get stronger with the approval we just got last night of our digital cytology business, which I think is probably not as fully appreciated. But as we bring that to market, it's going to dramatically improve the workflow for our customers. It's going to improve the efficacy it just -- it's probably the biggest improvement step forward in cytology in 40 years. So, we remain very committed and believing incredibly strongly, by the way as a reminder to single collection device that is used both for our Aptima HPV, as well as cytology. So it's no additional work for the doctor or the patient, and you get the results. So we continue to be very excited. And if anything, probably more excited about our cytology business combined with our HPV business going forward. Yes, sure. Patrick, I think the biggest metric obviously we track over time is just purely revenue. And I think we continue to feel good but the internals on that are, if you go customer by customer, we continue to grow our portfolio with a lot of our customers and not to be overlooked are our largest customers in the US, as they shift from Tigris to Panther, it is opening up additional menu opportunities for them to be adopting things like BV, CV and some of our other products. So we see really good growth with our largest customers in the US, we're also continuing to see, and what we're still in the early-ish innings is the international expansion and all those Panthers we placed internationally during COVID, as those are coming online. And I think what I love about these businesses, frankly, is they bring on one or two assays at a time, they get more experience, and then they bring more. And so it's not like a one off pop. That frankly might be better in the short term, but the harder to laugh. And so what we really have going on around the world, our customers all over the place, just gradually bringing on either additional assays or as we come out with new menu, being able to build that and that installed base of Panthers that we're able to just drive more throughput through is what really makes us feel very good about the future. That's right. Asterix is also a big Eagles fan. So we got covered. Yes, I think Jack, the more we look at the BCI test and the opportunities ahead of us, I think we're still in the earlier innings on what that business can become. And there's, since we've owned it, and watching the team operate, I think we just feel incredibly good about the long term potential. So it was still well accretive and still growing nicely here. We just don't want to be breaking it out down to the level given the size of it, but feel really, really good about the opportunity. Yes, I think Jack, I think that the magic that because we are both Diagnostics and med tech, to your first part of that question. It does open up the opportunity for additional things, and we're seeing some interesting things that would allow us to build on our Surgical platform or our breast cancer, the breast surgery business areas. So we continue to look in those areas. And frankly, I think some of the valuations in those areas might be a little bit better than say, for example, some of the Diagnostics one. So I think we certainly can shop in that aisle. And coming back to the second part of your question and the other aisle, we can shop in the specialty labs. I think one of the things we're really proud of with Biotheranostics is it actually makes money which you very well know that a lot of the specialty labs there's a lot of great top line revenue, but a lot of expense and not much profit. And so I think we continue to want to be thinking about things that can be generating bottom line. As Karleen is staring at me hard right now. I'm making part of that up, but I've worked with her long enough to know her discipline so we're being very mindful and careful in that space and continuing to feel like, what we know we're good at is taking existing assets that are on the market and operating them pretty well. We don't want to take on, wildly diluted things, just because we have the cash. And we've continued to, I think, be patient and the underlying performance of our businesses continues to give us that ability to be patient. So hopefully, that gave you the landscape here, Jack. Thank you. Yes, I think we think about it by business segment. And I think what we've really said, Vijay is that each of our businesses this year should be within that 5% to 7%. So I think that has us feel really good. Obviously, within each of the businesses, we're not going to go down that product line by product line, right. But if you played it out, right, Surgical, you got MyoSure and Fluent growing faster than that you have NovaSure lower than that, right. We've got that always across the businesses. But I think the way to think about it is we feel really good about each of our businesses growing in that range. And I will tell you that internationally, each of those businesses is certainly at the higher end of that range, if not slightly beyond. So we've got it across, every business has growth drivers. And like any business, there's always a few that aren't growing as fast. And, that's just the nature of the beast. But overall, I think what we're, again, magically, every one of our businesses is in that frame. Yes, I think the big piece that affected molecular in the quarter, the single biggest was the four fewer selling days. It's a disposable run rate business. And if you think about that, that knocked, between 400 and 600 basis points off the quarterly growth rate, frankly, depending on exactly how the days fall. And both that quarter and this quarter that we're in now, the second quarter are going against these ridiculously strong comps of over 20-ish percent molecular growth from a year ago. But I think the overall run rate, and the sheer size of the businesses now we feel very good about. Sure. Thanks, Puneet. Yes, don't assume a real change in the margin structure. I think the real win here is for is the workflow, I will tell you, our key customers are incredibly excited, as you will know, right? One of the biggest issues right now, running labs, everything else is workers and cytologists especially trying to read these slides. It's been a very manual and labor intensive process. I can tell you going back to one of my first meetings with Quest, when I got in this role, almost 10 years ago, call that meeting with nine years ago, with discussions around, the workflow of cytology, and it was one of their biggest concerns. So our team has gone out and really addressing that, and I think the magic is going to be unleashing that as we are internationally as well. It's been part of what's starting to drive the growth in our European business has been having that approval already over there. So feeling really good, as well as, frankly, the reduction of the false negatives. So it's just that much more accurate. And going forward. So I think it's going to breed, we think it's going to breed some new life. Particularly, it's been the excitement from our customers that I think has been the galvanizing part for us. You're right, I wouldn't underestimate that there's still going to be continued gantry placement. So a lot of the core is actually still the gantry placements. And then it's the service and the revenue and the additional AI and other things that we sell underneath it. But I think we continue to feel very good about the gantry placements, really from a couple of standpoints. First off, there's still kind of the tail end of going from 2D to 3D. But we're really into the mode now of also the early adopters of 3D. Their machines are now need to be upgraded. And with all the additional enhancements we've made to the system, we continue to place those gantries, so I think it's and we've turned it into certainly a much more diversified business. But at the core the gantries are still a very key foundational component of the strength of our business. Yes, I think we continue to feel pretty good from, most of our customers around the CapEx side, I think when people were more fearful year, year and a half ago, we kind of felt like it was still okay, if there's little bits that dribble back in that's fine, too. But I think overall, we think we're in reasonable position and not seeing any dramatic changes one way or the other, least affecting our business. And again, we're not the biggest capital component for the hospitals, as are the ERP systems or the certainly the big iron pieces, we continue to feel like, regardless, we're in a good position. Yes, we're really proud of what the international team has been doing and looking at selective pricing opportunities. They've been very disciplined on the cost side, so that we're still dilutive. Our international growth is still diluted, certainly to the gross margin, and it touch on the operating margin. But our team's being very disciplined and try to help lessen that gap over time. Hey, Derik, starting on, there certainly as we face very formidable competitors. And there's a lot of hand to hand combat. The flip side is, and I think it is the piece that people consistently miss, is how much opportunity there is to expand our markets, right? Let's go to surgical for a moment. Nobody ever would have imagined that MyoSure would have someday gotten to be as big as NovaSure, when we first launched it. And now it dwarfs NovaSure, and is still growing strongly as we've come out with BV, CV, BV, CV may become our largest assay, it's sometimes it's hard to fully understand the impact in the end size of the market creation that we're doing. So we just want people to understand it's hard to fully identify because we're growing and building these markets. And when you look at even some of the data that we got from the Global Women's Health Index, where women's health sits, and testing sits globally, is still a fraction of what it should be, right? If you consider that only 10% of all women in the world got tested that should for STIs, that alone would say the market is probably 10x. Now, we're not going to realize that in the next five years either. So to call the total available market, truly 10x because it's not quite accessible at that level. It's we're in between. So, I think the gist is we continue to pioneer new products, new assays, and grow and create these markets over time. Yes, completely. So first as a reminder, recall that we did launch our 3D performance and then our 3D. And what we've been doing is gradually improving, and working in better imaging, better detection all through. So it's not like we're selling a 10 year old product, even though we'd be up at it's now 10 years, a little 11 years since we got the 3D approved, but we've been selling newer products along the way. And having said that, we are working on additional hardware and gantry changes as well, that will evolve here, over the next few years. Yes, I think, we would consider something in that range. If it brings significant revenue, and frankly, EBITDA. So, we're not going to embark on something of that size for a science project or something early stage or something that's losing money, I would say, you would only expect us to do something like that we have the capacity. But it would have to be a pretty special asset. There's not a lot of things, but there are a few things we're looking at in that range. And we continue to be incredibly disciplined, but it will be established businesses that we think, we can improve upon in terms of their ability to contribute to us. So thank you. Yes, I think, relative to the AI front, as it relates to Breast health, we've been, on the leading edge for quite some time between our CAD programs and A, the Genius AI Detection program. So we continue to feel very good, particularly as it relates to the workflow advantages, and the linkage to our workstations and our products. And on the second question of international, I think, again, we've been generating, frankly, double digit growth for our international business for the better part, yes, excluding COVID-ish for last five or six years, and continue to see international being accretive to our overall growth rate here for years to come. So thank you very much."
